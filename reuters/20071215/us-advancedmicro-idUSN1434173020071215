 By  Sinead Carew  and  Duncan Martell NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ) has delayed shipment of major chip products until next year but aims to return to profitability in 2008, Chief Operating Officer Dirk Meyer said on Thursday. The company's shares fell 2 percent after the news as investors were disappointed by the delay and the lack of a more specific timeframe for profitability. AMD, the world's No. 2 supplier of computer processors, has struggled in the last two years with market share losses and chip shipment delays. It posted four straight quarters of losses this year amid renewed competition from its far larger rival, Intel Corp ( INTC.O ). Meyer said AMD would ship its high-end Barcelona chip products and Phenom products in the 2008 first quarter. Speaking at a meeting with analysts, he apologized for delays and promised to do better next year. The Barcelona chip is designed for computer servers and the Phenom chip is aimed at desktop PCs. Both are quad-core chips with four number-crunching "brains" per processor. Charter Equity Research analyst John Dryden said that while investors may have come to expect chip delays, some were hoping for a more specific profit timeframe. "They've delayed profitability in every one of their platforms" said Dryden, noting that AMD had been aiming for a profit in the current quarter. He cited the delay of the Barcelona chips from the current quarter to the 2008 first quarter, and a similar delay for Phenom. "They're all delayed by three months," the analyst said, adding that AMD was delaying product shipments for the biggest computer makers such as Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ), Dell DELL.O, Sun Microsystems JAVA.O and International Business Machines ( IBM.N ). "That's pretty big." AMD executives said they would work hard next year to get back on track with shipments. "We're not happy with our performance in quad-core, not only because it affected our financials but because it let down our partners and customers," said Mario Rivas, executive vice president for AMD's computing products group. Meyer said AMD, which supplies about a fifth of the world's computer chips, expects to increase its market share "tremendously" and turn a profit in 2008. Chief Executive Hector Ruiz had told reporters last month that AMD's No. 1 goal was to return to profitability soon, but he did not give a timeframe. The company said customer demand is strong and it expects increased momentum across all major dimensions of its business as every business unit enters "an exciting new product cycle -- from panel processors in the digital television space to high-performance quad-core processors to next-generation notebook platforms." AMD shares, which have fallen 56 percent this year, were down 28 cents, or 3 percent, to $8.69 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by John Wallace)
