 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's Repsol ( REP.MC ) will seek international arbitration to seek quick compensation over the takeover of its Argentine unit YPF ( YPFD.BA ), the company's chairman Antonio Brufau said in a news conference on Tuesday. 
 The mechanisms used by Argentina's government to expropriate YPF seems to indicate that it want the control of the company without launching a takeover bid, Brufau added, saying Repsol had received lots of international interest in participating in YPF.
