 LONDON/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The likely demise of the biggest takeover so far this year -- Prudential Plc's bid for AIG's Asian unit -- spells a big hit to fees and reputation for the many investment banks involved. 

 The attempt to take over AIA was fraught with missteps, and AIG's quick rejection of a reduced $30.4 billion offer from the British insurer pushed the deal close to collapse on Tuesday. Bankers at Credit Suisse, JP Morgan, HSBC and a host of others will suffer a heavy blow if the deal they helped craft falls apart. "At least 50 percent of the blame would go to the investment banks, I would say," said Ian Nelson, a senior adviser at Wyvern Partners in London. "They're obviously motivated by big transaction fees, and that's understood, that's how they earn their living," he added. Prudential boss Tidjane Thiam's efforts hit an earlier glitch last month, when the Financial Services Authority (FSA) held up the deal on concerns over Prudential's capital base, a hitch that investors decried as "shambolic." Prudential and its banks "should have been more careful with obtaining soundings from the FSA" and had failed to explain adequately the financial logic of the tie-up to risk-averse investors, Nelson said. Nelson served as head of mergers and acquisitions (M&A) for Prudential rival Aviva and its predecessor for 14 years until 2005, where he worked alongside Thiam, who joined in 2002 as director of group strategy. In addition to the FSA flap, there was Thiam's move in the middle of the deal to take a seat on Societe Generale's board. He had to back away from the plan quickly, in a bow to criticism from investors. Another misjudgment came when Pru reopened price negotiations with AIG just two days after Chairman Harvey McGrath said that a "vast majority" of shareholders were comfortable with the deal. "Execution in this deal has been far from smooth so far, to use a euphemism. You would think that with so many advisers involved in this deal ... (they) would have thought of ... the regulator's questions," said one Prudential shareholder who requested anonymity. "It is also the advisers' job to give advice on what would be a good price in a takeover, that's how they earn their fees," the investor added. LEAGUE TABLES If the deal is scrapped, it alone would account for a 4 percent drop in global M&A this year, data show. Some banks stand to benefit if the deal does not go through. It would boost Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and UBS, who are not credited with M&A advice on the deal, and who would all enjoy a boost to their standings in the top-10 M&A advisers. But the banks on the deal will miss out on a big fee pool. Prudential had said it would pay up to 850 million pounds ($1.24 billion) in costs related to the takeover and the rights issue. That includes underwriting, financial advice and legal, accounting and printing costs. The rights issue would have incurred fees of 3.5 percent, split into $315 million for banks, and $420 million for investors sub-underwriting the deal. Freeman & Co, a consultancy, had estimated the original deal would yield M&A fees of $112.7 million for banks on both sides. Credit Suisse, HSBC and JPMorgan Cazenove were leading Prudential's $21 billion rights issue to fund the acquisition as joint sponsors, global co-ordinators and bookrunners, according to Prudential's rights issue prospectus. They were joined as financial advisers by Ondra Partners and Lazard, while Nomura gave a fairness opinion to Prudential's board. A further 30 banks were joint- or co-lead managers or co-managers for the rights issue. AIG took advice from Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Blackstone and Deutsche Bank, according to Thomson Reuters data. All of those firms, except Blackstone, were chosen to handle AIA's IPO in Hong Kong prior to Pru's offer.
