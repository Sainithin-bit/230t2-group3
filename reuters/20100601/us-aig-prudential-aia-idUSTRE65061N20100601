 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc has several options for its Asian life insurance business should a $35.5 billion deal with Prudential Plc fail, Chief Executive Robert Benmosche told employees on Tuesday. 

 "We will have several options to consider regarding AIA -- more than we did in March," Benmosche said in an internal memo obtained by Reuters, referring to American International Assurance. These options include selling parts of AIA by geography, according to sources familiar with the situation. AIG could also revive plans for an initial public offering of the business. Earlier on Tuesday, AIG rejected Prudential's attempt to cut the price of the deal for AIA to $30.4 billion, pushing the transaction close to collapse. AIG's board, which met late on Monday, wanted assurances from the British insurer that it would be able to close the deal even with a reduced price, sources said. But Prudential was not able to persuade AIG's board on that issue, the sources said. They declined to be named because the talks are not public. AIG declined to comment.
