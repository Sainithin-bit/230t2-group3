 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) said Tuesday it reached a tentative agreement with the United Steelworkers (USW) union on a new 4-year labor contract covering 5,400 workers at 10 of the aluminum producer's manufacturing locations in the United States. 

 The new agreement, subject to ratification by USW members, addresses key sticking points in negotiations that began on May 17, Alcoa said in a press release. The previous contract expired on May 31. Local unions will need to speak with employees at all 10 Alcoa plants around the U.S. before they vote on the new labor contract, Alcoa said. Alcoa said it expects workers at all of its plants will ratify the new agreement shortly. The union contract covers all Alcoa workers in the U.S. under an umbrella deal. Alcoa, headquartered in Pittsburgh, is one of the world's largest aluminum producers. (Reporting by  Carole Vaporean ; Editing by John Picinich)
