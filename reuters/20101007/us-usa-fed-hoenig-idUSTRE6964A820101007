 NORFOLK, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank President Thomas Hoenig, who has consistently dissented against the U.S. central bank's extremely easy money policies, said on Thursday he opposes any additional easing. 

 "There is discussion in the media, and broadly speaking, even amongst Federal Reserve policy members that we need to increase our stimulus for monetary policy. Now, I happen to disagree with that," he said. Hoenig, speaking to a business group, said the recovery is proceeding modestly and repeated his belief that the Fed should raise benchmark rates to 1 percent and hold them there to see how the recovery proceeds. A voter on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year, Hoenig has dissented at every one of the Fed's meetings in 2010. He has opposed the Fed's pledge to hold rates exceptionally low for an extended period, and he was against the Fed's recent decision to reinvest maturing securities to prevent its portfolio from shrinking. Hoenig told the group that although unemployment is painfully high, the Fed must also keep an eye on its mandate to maintain long term price stability, which could be jeopardized by leaving financial conditions so accommodative, he said. "With this much liquidity in the system, if it stays there as the economy continues to improve and perhaps strengthens ... then there will be this enormous liquidity and there will be tendencies for inflationary impulses to rise," he said.
