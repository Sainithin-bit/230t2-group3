 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve issued an order on Thursday against HSBC North American Holdings Inc, requiring the bank to improve its practices to prevent customers from laundering money or funding terrorists through its accounts. 

 The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a related order against the U.S. subsidiary of HSBC, for violating a law governing how the company reports and assesses suspicious activity around its accounts, including international wire transfers and large cash withdrawals. HSBC is Europe's largest bank. The regulators have not fined HSBC for the violations, but they could in the future. The OCC said its order "does not preclude" it from assessing a civil money penalty against the bank. The regulators' orders come amid heightened U.S. government attention to how major banks monitor and report suspicious activity, including signs of money laundering, from their accounts. In August, Barclays Bank Plc agreed to pay $298 million to settle criminal charges it violated U.S. sanctions through dealings with banks in Cuba, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Myanmar, according to court documents. The OCC said in its complaint that HSBC Bank USA's "compliance program and its implementation are ineffective, and accompanied by aggravating factors, such as highly suspicious activity creating a significant potential for unreported money laundering or terrorist financing." The regulator cited inadequate staffing, incomplete reviews and reporting of suspected suspicious activity from HSBC accounts, and inadequate monitoring of funds transfers and the financial activities of the bank's "high-risk" customers. HSBC's board of directors must submit a plan to improve its compliance with anti-money laundering regulations to the Fed within 30 days and to the OCC within 60 days. The plan must show how the bank is managing risk across business lines, legal entities and jurisdictions in which the bank operates, the Fed said. HSBC is also required to submit to the Fed a company-wide compliance risk assessment that contains recommendations for improving controls and provides an evaluation of its compliance risk exposure. HSBC said in a statement on Thursday it is cooperating fully with its regulators and it is "committed to prompt resolution." Spokesman Robert Sherman said the bank has been hiring additional staff and outside advisers and it has restructured its organization to ensure its compliance department reports directly to North American Chief Executive Niall Booker. HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY The regulatory order comes after U.S. Senator Carl Levin said in February he was referring HSBC Holdings Plc to its U.S. bank regulator in connection with questionable accounts it provided for senior Angolan officials. Levin, chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, said he was referring the issue to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the U.S. Treasury, because he was concerned that tainted foreign money might be flowing into the United States. Earlier this month, two clients of HSBC Holdings were convicted of failing to report more than $49 million in income to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The two Miami Beach-based developers, Mauricio and Leon Cohen, used shell enterprises and offshore tax havens in the Bahamas and elsewhere to conceal assets and income. Court documents said that among their crimes was failing to pay taxes on the sale of a New York hotel 10 years ago. The proceeds from the hotel sale were transferred to a bank account at HSBC is Switzerland and income from the sale was not reported on U.S. tax returns.
