 MINNEAPOLIS  (Reuters) - Officials at the Federal Reserve have not made any decision whether to pump more cash into the economy, a top Fed official said on Thursday. 

 "The markets have drawn too quick a conclusion that this is a likely event," Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher told reporters following a speech at the Economic Club of Minnesota. "If it is to occur it will only occur after thoughtful discussion." He said he would not use "reluctant" to describe his attitude toward further Fed action, and added he, along with other Fed officials who have made recent public comments in support of further easing, wants to hear all arguments before making a decision.
