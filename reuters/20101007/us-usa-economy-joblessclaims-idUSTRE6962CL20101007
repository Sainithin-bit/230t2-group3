 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, touching their lowest level in nearly three months, according to a government report on Thursday that pointed to some stability in the troubled labor market. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 11,000 to a seasonally adjusted 445,000, the lowest since the July 10 week, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast claims edging up to 455,000 from the previously reported 453,000. The government revised the prior week's figure up to 456,000. * The four-week average of new jobless claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market trends, to fell 3,000 to 455,750, the lowest level since the July 24 week. * The number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 48,000 to 4.46 million in the week ended September 25, the lowest since June 26, from an upwardly revised 4.51 million the prior week. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast so-called continuing claims dipping to 4.45 million from a previously reported 4.46 million. COMMENTS: FRANK LESH, FUTURES ANALYST AND BROKER AT FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC IN CHICAGO: "It is better but not by much. We really haven't had much of reaction -- very little -- and of course with the monthly due tomorrow we probably won't see a lot of trade off this number today. "It is good that it is down, and lower and moving in the right direction, but you'd have to say not enough." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "Talk about a non-event, the whole Street waits for these numbers every week and every week we get the same non-movement. Anybody who can read any excitement into these numbers -- we are stagnant at best. There is nothing positive to be gleaned from these numbers, they are elevated, they are not moving, and they are disappointing. If the Street chooses to look at these numbers, ignore them temporarily and look at other indicators of global growth, fine, that's one thing. But to look at these numbers and to say there is any significant shift in terms of growth in the U.S. economy for the worker, for those looking for employment, they are kidding themselves. These numbers have been on a flat line for months. "The only thing I can say that is mildly positive is these numbers are the same numbers we've had for months -- they are not dramatically worse. So to the extent that we have upward trend in the indexes and we are flirting with a move higher and above 11,000, these numbers aren't going to interrupt that. It's more of a constant than a variable and the market is pricing in and focusing on earnings and global growth more than these weekly data points. Because there is just nothing here that speaks to an improvement in the employment picture." TOM SIMONS, MONEY-MARKET ECONOMIST, JEFFERIES & CO., NEW YORK: "The number is better than expected. The (Treasury) market is up a little bit. I'm a little bit surprised at the reaction myself. I don't think the market really should care about this number. "This number doesn't really have anything to do with tomorrow's jobs number, which is much more important. "The expectations for Fed intervention at this point are not really data dependent. "This is the lowest number that we've seen since July 10...that number was distorted by the factory shutdown cancellations over the summer. I actually think that it's a rather strong number. The emergency employment compensation was up a little bit but it was still down compared to two weeks prior. I don't see anything in the data that is contradicting the headline strength. Definitely something you would not expect the bond market to be reacting positively to." ROBERT DYE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, PNC FINANCIAL SERVICES, PITTSBURGH: "It does show that the summer rise in jobless claims has been corrected. We are getting a lot of mixed signals in the labor market. There is a good deal of uncertainty with tomorrow's payroll number. We are still looking for a modest increase of 25,000. There are downside risks with layoffs of Census workers and other state and local employees due to budget problems. Construction employment is at risk too." ROBERT PAVLIK, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, BANYAN PARTNERS LLC, NEW YORK: "It seems to be helping. Claims were down 11,000, that may give some confidence heading into tomorrow, removing some of the question that the ADP report from yesterday had maybe brought up. So you see futures rising on the Dow and S&P, there may be sort of a quiet day ahead of us, but its relatively good news. "Sales were relatively mixed. Not all has been that terrific, some is good and some is sort of mixed. On average, I'd say its more positive than negative." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures rise after jobless claims. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were mixed after the report. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares losses versus euro.
