 BANGALORE (Reuters) -The International Monetary Fund is considering doubling its capital through an additional quota subscription by member states, with Japan possibly contributing about 2 trillion yen ($24.12 billion), the Nikkei business daily reported. 

 The current IMF quotas stand at $328 billion and a proposal to raise the capital to around $700 billion is gaining momentum, the Nikkei said. The move, the first major capital increase in 11 years and probably the largest ever, comes as a response to the financial crisis, the daily said. The IMF plans to facilitate consultations among member states at a general meeting this weekend in Washington and would finalize the plans by the Group of 20 summit (G-20 summit) in Seoul in November, the paper reported. This year, the IMF has rolled out a number of large-scale packages, including $40 billion to Greece. In addition to that, it may contribute up to 250 billion euros, or $350 billion, to the European Union to bring financial stability in the region, the daily said. Emerging nations are pushing for a review of member quotas and under a new allocation, China -- which has the sixth-largest quota at 3.72 percent of the total -- might rival Japan, which has the second-largest quota, at 6.12 percent, the business daily said.
