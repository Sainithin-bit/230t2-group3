 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday it was too early to say the G20 group of nations had failed to address the issue of global rebalancing and currencies. 

 "Clearly the issue of external rebalancing is becoming more and more important and as a result the issue of exchange rate adjustment is becoming a more and more important one," IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard told reporters. "I am optimistic the G20 can actually work out a solution, we are just at the beginning of the process, so it's much too early to declare it a failure." (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
