 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co is recalling nearly 4,000 Cadillac SRX crossovers from the 2010 model year due to potential power steering line damage that has caused at least one fire, the automaker said on Thursday. 

 GM said it had no reports of crashes or injuries because of the defect, which could cause power steering fluid to leak onto hot engine parts. The recall covers 3,996 SRX crossovers built in December 2009. Most of the vehicles have been sold in the United States and 341 were exported to China, GM said in a statement. Cadillac's U.S. sales were up 44 percent through the first nine months of 2010 compared with last year. SRX sales more than quadrupled in that period to 36,730 vehicles. GM said in a letter to U.S. motor vehicle safety regulators on September 29 that a product investigation engineer was assigned August 4 to inspect an SRX that had a reported fire. The cause was determined to be a power steering fluid leak, GM said. The automaker notified the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the planned recall on September 29.
