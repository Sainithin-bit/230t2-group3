 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Soft drink and snacks maker PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) trimmed its full-year profit forecast and formed a new business unit to drive growth in healthier foods as it tries to overcome tight U.S. consumer spending. 

 Shares of the maker of Pepsi cola and Frito-Lay snacks fell as much as 4.3 percent while archrival Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) slipped 0.3 percent. Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said the economic environment remains tough and called consumers "very value-conscious." "There is no doubt that economic uncertainty and high unemployment levels are keeping a consumer-led recovery at bay in many regions, especially in developed markets like the United States and Western Europe," she told analysts on a conference call. "We expect these conditions to persist." PepsiCo now expects full-year earnings per share, excluding currency fluctuations and one-time items, to rise 11 to 12 percent. It previously forecast 11 to 13 percent. PepsiCo executives said that none of the company's businesses were underperforming, when asked about the grounds for trimming the forecast. But the company is stepping up investments in developing markets including China, and in its North American beverage business and research, they said. "While its long-term focus is laudable, it is increasingly clear that the cost of competition domestically is ramping (up), which will limit upside to both earnings and cash return to shareholders," Deutsche Bank analyst Marc Greenberg said in a research note. He has a "buy" rating on the stock. Chief Financial Officer Hugh Johnston said the increased investments were in addition to the 10 cents a share the company earmarked at the start of the year for strategic spending on existing operations. He declined to say how much the additional spending totaled on a per-share basis. Nooyi said the return on investments made in developing markets is not immediate and more for the long term. PepsiCo's third-quarter profit rose about 12 percent to $1.92 billion, or $1.19 a share, helped by the acquisition of its two biggest bottlers and growth in international markets. Excluding items, earnings were $1.22 a share, matching the average analysts' forecast by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose 40 percent to $15.5 billion, helped by the bottler acquisitions, compared with the $15.35 billion analysts had expected. DRINKABLE OATS PepsiCo also said it was forming a global nutrition group focused on fruits, vegetables, grains and dairy, part of a previously stated strategy to triple the revenue of its nutrition business to $30 billion by 2020. The nutrition group, which includes such brands as Quaker Oats and Tropicana juice, will be based in Chicago and run by chief scientific officer Mehmood Khan. The idea is to take existing brands and make them healthier, for example, by possibly selling a side of carrots with Sabra hummus, a drinkable Quaker oats product or whole-grain Tostitos corn chips. In March, PepsiCo unveiled targets to cut levels of salt, sugar and saturated fats in its top-selling products. Wall Street Strategies analyst David Silver called the new unit a "research and development company within a company." He sees it as PepsiCo looking for ways to improve the health benefits of existing or new snacks without changing the taste. "The formation of this group is a new PR direction ... they've really been working over the past several years to go from this fun-for-you snack to this good-for-your snack," Silver said. He has a "buy" rating on the stock. PepsiCo bought its two top bottlers for $7.8 billion in late February, aiming to cut costs and streamline distribution of its drinks in a sluggish North American market. Rival Coca-Cola closed a similar deal Sunday. PepsiCo reiterated its target of $400 million in cost savings once the bottlers are fully integrated in 2012. It expects savings from the deals of about $150 million in 2010. PepsiCo shares were down 3.4 percent at $65.81 at midday, off an earlier low at $65.19.
