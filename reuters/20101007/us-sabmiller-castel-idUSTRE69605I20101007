 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global brewer SABMiller ( SAB.L ) is in talks to buy the African beer operations of the privately-held French drinks group Castel in a deal worth 6 billion pounds ($9.5 billion), the Times said on Thursday. 

 The newspaper said founder Paul Castel's reduced involvement in the company signals that the next generation may be open to offers, but added that until recently there had been no indication that the family might sell.
