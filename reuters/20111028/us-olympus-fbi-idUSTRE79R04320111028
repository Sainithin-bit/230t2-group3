 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Olympus Corp ( 7733.T ) said it is unaware of any probe by the Federal Bureau of Investigations into payments it made to a financial adviser related to the 2008 purchase of British medical equipment maker Gyrus. 
 "Some media have reported that we have been contacted by the FBI. So far we haven't confirmed that," it said in a statement. Shares of world's leading maker of endoscopes fell as much as 10 percent on Friday to 1,223 yen. (Reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
