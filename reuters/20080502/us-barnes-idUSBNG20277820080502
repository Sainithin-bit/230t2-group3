 (Reuters) - Barnes Group Inc ( B.N ), an aerospace and industrial components maker, posted better-than-expected first-quarter results, driven mainly by strong demand in its aerospace segment, and raised its 2008 earnings outlook.

The latest quarter results saw a transaction loss of 1 cent a share related to sale of Spectrum Plastics Molding Resources, a business of Barnes Industrial, the company said in a statement.
