 LONDON  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ), the world's biggest 
drugmaker, is to invest 190 million euros ($297 million) 
establishing a new biotech plant in Ireland for the production 
of experimental medicines, it said on Friday. 

  The facility, which will create around 100 permanent jobs 
over three years, will develop and produce small-scale 
quantities of products for Phase II and III clinical trials. 
Some 500 people will also be employed during construction.  It is the first time that Pfizer has placed such internal 
biopharmaceutical clinical development outside the United 
States.  The facility at Shanbally in County Cork will be located on 
a site adjacent to Pfizer's existing operation in Ringaskiddy 
and will be completed by the end of 2009.  Nat Ricciardi of Pfizer Global Manufacturing said the 
investment reflected the U.S. group's determination to become a 
leader in biotech medicine, which is a growing focus for many 
drug companies worldwide.  (Reporting by  Ben Hirschler ; Editing by Erica Billingham)
