 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada has not joined other central banks in injecting cash into markets to boost liquidity because the country's funding markets are in better shape than elsewhere, a spokeswoman said on Friday. 

 "The Bank of Canada has not offered the specific types of facilities covered by these central bank announcements because markets and institutions in Canada have not been affected in the same way nor to the same extent as elsewhere," said Jill Vardy, spokeswoman for the central bank. The U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank announced an expansion of their liquidity measures on Friday, citing persistent pressures in some term funding markets. The Fed increased the size of some cash auctions for financial institutions and the amount of U.S. dollars it provides to the ECB and Swiss central bank. Vardy was unable to say whether the Bank of Canada knew about the coordinated effort. Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney has said in recent remarks that funding pressures in Canadian money markets are relatively mild compared with those in the United States and Europe. "The issues in the Canadian interbank market, which are unusual relative to the Canadian experience, are much, much less than they are internationally," he told reporters last week.
