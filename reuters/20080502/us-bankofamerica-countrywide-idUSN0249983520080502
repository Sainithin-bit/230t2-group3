 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America ( BAC.N ), which said it would buy Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N in January, said there was no assurance any of the mortgage lender's outstanding debt would be redeemed, assumed or guaranteed, according to a regulatory filing. 

 Bank of America said Countrywide had outstanding debt of about $97.23 billion as of Dec 31, including Federal Home Loan Bank advances to Countrywide Bank of about $47.68 billion, which it expects will remain outstanding until repaid by Countrywide Bank, in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The bank said it was examining options to dispose remaining Countrywide indebtedness, including redeeming, assuming or guaranteeing some or all of this debt or allowing it to remain outstanding as obligations of Countrywide. "Bank of America has made no determination in this regard, and there is no assurance that any of such debt would be redeemed, assumed or guaranteed," it added in the filing.
