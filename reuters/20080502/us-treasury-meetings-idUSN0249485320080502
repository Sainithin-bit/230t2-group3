 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Treasury Department officials plan private meetings with Wall Street executives and bankers, in an apparent attempt to counter Congressional Democrats seeking stronger steps to handle the housing crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 Six meetings with investors, loan servicers and bankers are planned on Friday, and one of them is to be held at the NewYork City offices of JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the report said. Neel Kashkari, a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, and Phillip Swagel, assistant secretary for economic policy will lead the Treasury's Friday efforts, the Journal said. JPMorgan and Treasury Department officials were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by Gerrard Raven)
