 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) said on 
Friday it sued Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), claiming that J&J's 
Listerine Whitening Quick Dissolving Strips violate P&G 
patents. 

  The lawsuit, filed on Friday in the U.S. District Court for 
the Western District of Wisconsin, alleges that the Listerine 
strips infringe P&G patents related to the tooth whitening 
active ingredient and delivery systems.  P&G has asked the court to stop J&J and its company, 
McNeil-PPC, from making, selling, and importing allegedly 
infringing products. P&G also is seeking recovery of damages.  P&G introduced Crest Whitestrips in 2000.  A spokeswoman for J&J declined to comment on pending 
litigation.  (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein , editing by Richard Chang)
