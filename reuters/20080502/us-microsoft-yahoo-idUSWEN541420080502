 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc is still holding talks with other potential partners about an alternative to Microsoft Corp's takeover bid for the company, even as the two sides intensify efforts to reach a deal, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 Yahoo has held discussions with Time Warner Inc's AOL Internet division and News Corp over a potential deal. It has also been talking to rival Google Inc over a partnership in Web search advertising to bolster its performance. (Reporting by  Michele Gershberg  and  Kenneth Li , editing by Richard Chang)
