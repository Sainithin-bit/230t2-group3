 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp's ( 6758.T ) PlayStation Portable 
(PSP) handheld game gear outsold Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS DS 
portable player more than 2-to-1 in Japan in April, game 
magazine publisher Enterbrain said. 

  But in the console market, Nintendo sold five times as many 
Wii machines as Sony's PlayStation 3 (PS3) in the four weeks 
through April 27, an Enterbrain report dated Thursday showed.  PSP sales came to 380,867 units, beating DS sales of 
169,911 units, as Capcom Co Ltd's ( 9697.T ) hunting action game 
"Monster Hunter Freedom 2G," designed for the PSP, was the top 
seller for the second straight month, the report said.  Nintendo sold 187,121 units of the Wii in the month, 
compared with 37,676 units of the PS3.  The Wii has been leading the PS3 in sales since their 
launches in late 2006 as its innovative and easy-to-play games 
attracted women and the elderly, expanding the overall gaming 
population.  (Reporting by  Kiyoshi Takenaka ; Editing by  Hugh Lawson )
