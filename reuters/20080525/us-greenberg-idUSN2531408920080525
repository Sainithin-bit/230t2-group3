 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission's investigation of Maurice "Hank" Greenberg goes beyond the one deal that was the subject of a criminal trial earlier this year and includes a second deal made by his former company, American International Group ( AIG.N ), according to an article in The Wall Street Journal. 

 The investigation of Greenberg, former chief executive of AIG, includes review of a deal AIG made with now-defunct Capco Reinsurance Co, once an AIG-controlled company, according to people familiar with the situation, the report on the Journal's Web site said. Last week, Reuters reported that Greenberg received a "Wells notice" from the SEC, indicating possible charges over his role in reinsurance transactions between AIG and Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) General Re Corp unit. A Wells notice indicates that the SEC is considering civil charges, and gives the recipient a chance to mount a defense. The General Re deal was the subject of a criminal trial earlier this year in which five people were convicted, the WSJ report said. The SEC has also informed former AIG Chief Financial Officer Howard Smith that it may bring civil charges against him in connection with AIG's restatements, the report said, quoting people familiar with the situation. Spokesmen for Greenberg, Smith and the SEC were not available for comment. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
