 LONDON  (Reuters) - British caterer Compass Group Plc ( CPG.L ) has sold its Selecta vending machine unit to the private equity arm of German financial group Allianz ( ALVG.DE ) for 772.5 million pounds ($1.53 billion), and will spend 500 million pounds of the proceeds buying back shares, a spokesman said on Sunday. 

 Compass said the sale would allow it increase its planned share buybacks over the next 12-18 months to 1 billion pounds and that the balance of the Selecta sale proceeds would be used to reduce debt. Selecta operates around 150,000 food and drinks vending machines in offices and public places across Europe. Compass Chief Executive Richard Cousins said in a statement the sale would help the world's biggest caterer focus on its core contract catering and support services business. The disposal is conditional upon clearance from competition authorities with completion expected in July 2007, Compass said. Citigroup advised Compass, while Merrill Lynch advised Allianz Capital Partners GmbH.
