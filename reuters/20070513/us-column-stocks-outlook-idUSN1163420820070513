 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors will likely look for evidence the U.S. housing slump may be over and for signs of moderating inflation this week before deciding whether the rally in U.S. stocks since mid-March is over. 

 The steepest one-day drop in U.S. stocks in two months last Thursday gave investors pause, but signs of slowing retail sales and slowing inflation on Friday encouraged a return of confidence. "On a short-term basis, the market is very vulnerable to a normal 3 percent, 5 percent correction," said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. "I would think we would probably have a normal pause to refresh coming up." But when or what might spark a pullback is impossible to predict, he added. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  both rose for a sixth straight week, with the Dow setting new all-time closing and intraday highs. But the other major gauge of U.S. equity performance, the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC , fell for the first time in six weeks. For the week, the Dow rose 0.46 percent to 13,326.22, the S&P gained 0.02 percent to 1,505.85 and the Nasdaq fell 0.38 percent to 2,562.22. A record-setting climb over the past two months, during which the Dow gained more than 10 percent and the S&P more than 9.6 percent, was a little too fast but indicative of the stock market's strength, A.G. Edwards' Goldman said. Up to May 7, the Dow rose 24 of 27 trading sessions, matching an 80-year-old record. "We had a record-setting successive days in a row that hasn't been seen since 1927. That's the good news, because bad markets don't rally like that. The bad news is we are very extended short term," Goldman said. The Labor Department releases data on Tuesday when economists expect the consumer price index for April, excluding food and energy, to show a 0.2 percent gain, up from 0.1 percent a month earlier. Rising consumer prices could trigger higher interest rates and curb the buying power of private equity firms, whose deal-making has helped lift stock prices this year. "Wall Street doesn't like the possibility of an increase in interest rates with all the leverage out there," former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker told foreign correspondents on Thursday. "Once in a while we had drops in GNP, is that all gone?" Volcker said, wondering how much steam the U.S. economy could still muster. A report on Wednesday from the Commerce Department is expected to show U.S. housing starts in April set an annual pace of 1.49 million units, down from 1.518 million units An index reflecting U.S. consumer sentiment on Friday by the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers is likely to show a preliminary reading for May of 86.5, down from 87.1 in the prior month. Among companies to report earnings are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) and Applied Materials Inc. ( AMAT.O ) on Tuesday, and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) the following day. Results and company outlooks may provide investors insight on consumer and business spending. Through Friday, 443 companies in the S&P500 have reported earnings results for the first quarter, with 67 percent beating Wall Street expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. The difference between consensus estimates and actual results was 6 percent, up from 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.9 percent a year ago. Among other possible investor concerns is China, where the country's main stock index last week climbed above 4,000 for the first time the. The Shanghai Composite Index  .SSEC , which has gained 50.3 percent so far this year, was blamed in part for a stock market decline in February. "China is not a major problem here short term," Goldman said. "The reason why the market sold off in late February and reached a crescendo on February 27 is that we hadn't had a pullback in six and a half months."
