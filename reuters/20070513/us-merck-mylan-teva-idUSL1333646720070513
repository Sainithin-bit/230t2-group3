 JERUSALEM  (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.O said on Sunday it stopped pursuing the purchase of the generics unit of German drugs and chemicals group Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ) because the terms didn't fit its criteria. 

 "Teva's long-held practice is to only pursue transactions that fit our long-term strategy of delivering profitable growth and enhancing our global leadership position while meeting our stringent financial criteria, Teva said in a statement. "While Merck's generics business would have been a strategic fit for Teva, the terms of this opportunity did not fully meet our investment criteria," it added. Merck said on Sunday that it had signed a deal with Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N under which the U.S. firm will buy the generics business for 4.9 billion euros ($6.6 billion). Israeli-based Teva ( TEVA.TA ) is the world's largest generics drugmaker.
