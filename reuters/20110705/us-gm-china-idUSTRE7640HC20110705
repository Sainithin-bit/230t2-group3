 BEIJING  (Reuters) - General Motors' ( GM.N ) car venture in Shanghai said it sold 612,072 vehicles in the first half of the year, up 27.5 percent from a year earlier. 

 The tally includes 12,067 exported vehicles, Shanghai GM, the Detroit automaker's tie-up with SAIC Motor Corp ( 600104.SS ), said in a statement on its website late on Monday. In June, the venture sold 104,472 Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac vehicles, it said, without providing the year-earlier tally. (Reporting by Fang Yan and  Ken Wills ; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
