 (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline operator Southern Union SUG.N is the target of competing bids from Energy Transfer Equity LP (ETE) ( ETE.N ) and Williams Companies Inc ( WMB.N ). 

 Southern has said it favors the ETE bid, but has been in discussions with Williams, too, over its proposal. Following is a timeline on the bidding: June 16 - Energy Transfer says to buy Southern Union in an all-stock deal at $33 a share, worth $4.1 billion. June 23 - Williams counters with unsolicited $4.9 billion cash bid for Southern Union. - ETE says its tax-deferred offer is better than Williams', which, it says does not have committed financing. June 27 - ETE says Southern Union is not permitted to talk to Williams. - Williams says its bid for Southern is not subject to any financing contingency, as charged by ETE. June 28 - Southern Union says it will talk to Williams, but it still backs the deal with ETE. June 29 - ETE sends a legal letter saying any attempt by Southern to talk to Williams will be a "willful and intentional" breach of their merger agreement. July 5 - ETE raises its bid for Southern Union by 21 percent to about $5 billion -- with Southern shareholders able to choose to swap their shares for $40 cash, or 0.903 ETE common units.
