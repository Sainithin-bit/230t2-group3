 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal's government said on Tuesday a four-notch ratings cut by Moody's to junk showed the vulnerability of the economy amid a debt crisis, but added that the ratings agency did not take into account strong political backing for austerity and a recent additional tax. 

 It said that sticking to a program of macroeconomic adjustment presented by the government last week "is the only way to reverse the course and restore confidence" in Portugal. It also reaffirmed commitment to deepening and speeding up austerity measures that the country vowed to implement under its 78-billion-euro bailout program.
