 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos will have a working dinner with his German counterpart Wolfgang Schaeuble in Berlin on Wednesday to discuss the debt crisis, the Greek finance ministry said on Tuesday. 

 Euro zone policy makers are working on a new rescue package to cover Greece's funding needs up to 2014 which will involve private creditor participation. French banks, the most exposed to the Greek debt crisis, have reached an outline agreement to roll over holdings of maturing Greek bonds but Germany's finance ministry has yet to agree with German financial institutions over a clear and concrete model for private sector contributions to the Greek aid package.
