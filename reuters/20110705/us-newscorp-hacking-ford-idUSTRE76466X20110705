 LONDON  (Reuters) - Car maker Ford has suspended advertising in Britain's News of the World due to allegations of hacking by the newspaper, while lender Halifax joined a growing band of companies reviewing their policies. 

 "Our Marketing Director is considering our options regarding advertising in the News of the World," Halifax, which is owned by Lloyds Banking Group, said on Tuesday via its official Twitter feed. The moves by companies to distance themselves from the newspaper, which is part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., came after allegations that the tabloid hacked the voicemail of a missing schoolgirl who was later found murdered. "We are awaiting an outcome from the News of the World investigation and expect a speedy and decisive response," Ford said in a statement. "Pending this response we will be using alternative media within and outside News International Group instead of placing Ford advertising in the News of the World." News International publishes Murdoch's stable of British titles including The Times and The Sun. Elsewhere on Twitter, where many companies faced a barrage of messages from consumers demanding that they boycott News of the World, mobile telephone operator T-Mobile UK said it was reviewing its advertising position with News of the World. French carmaker Renault said it acknowledged "concerns regarding the allegation of phone hacking by News of the World" and said it had no advertising planned with the newspaper. Budget airline EasyJet described the allegations against News of the World as "serious and shocking" and said it was monitoring the situation.
