 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will accept Greek government bonds as collateral until all rating agencies rate them as having defaulted, the Financial Times said on Tuesday, citing a financial sector source. 

 The move could keep the door open for a compromise deal on Greece's debt crisis as it is not yet certain that all rating agencies would put Greek debt in a default category after a voluntary rollover of bonds to involve private sector investors in a second bailout of the debt-ridden euro zone member. Were the ECB to refuse to accept Greek debt, it could trigger a new wave of banking turmoil that could spread through the euro zone as Greek commercial banks would have diminished access to central bank funds on which they rely. The ECB has suspended ratings requirements for Greek and Irish government bonds, but has said that it would stop accepting Greek bonds as collateral were the country to default on its obligations. The ECB uses four rating agencies -- Standard & Poor's, Fitch, Moody's and their smaller rival DBRS -- to determine collateral eligibility in its liquidity operations. "The ECB would rely on the principle of using the best rating available from the agencies," the FT said, quoting an unnamed senior financial sector official. An ECB spokeswoman offered no comment on the report. Standard & Poor's cast new uncertainty on Monday over euro zone efforts to rescue Greece by warning it would treat a French bank plan for a rollover of privately-held debt as a default. [nL6E7I408N] French banks, major holders of Greek sovereign debt, proposed voluntarily renewing some of the bonds when they mature but on different terms. However, Fitch Ratings has hinted it may not be so severe and may avoid downgrading Greek debt to default after the transaction period, leaving the ECB a chance to go on accepting the bonds. Fitch has said that under a voluntary scheme, it may temporarily downgrade Greece's 'Issuer Default Rating' to 'restricted default' but keep the government bonds at 'CCC', although that was before the details of the French plan became public.
