 (Reuters) - Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn inched closer on Tuesday to seeing U.S. sex assault charges against him dropped, although a new complaint in France could pose a hurdle to any political comeback. 

 Here is a timeline of events: May 13, 2011 - Strauss-Kahn checks into a $3,000 a night suite at the luxury Sofitel hotel in Manhattan. May 14 - A hotel maid tells New York police that she was attacked by Strauss-Kahn after opening the door to the suite and finding Strauss-Kahn naked. She complains to her supervisor who calls the police on her behalf. -- An ambulance is called to the hotel and the woman is taken to a hospital where she is treated and released. -- Strauss-Kahn leaves the hotel to a previously scheduled lunch a few blocks away with his daughter. -- He is driven to John F. Kennedy International Airport to catch an Air France flight to Paris. Police board the flight minutes before it is due to depart and detain Strauss-Kahn. May 15 - Strauss-Kahn is arrested and charged with a criminal sexual act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment. May 16 - Strauss-Kahn enters Manhattan Criminal Court for his hearing, and is denied bail. -- Strauss-Kahn is transferred to Rikers Island jail and held in protective custody. May 17 - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says "I can't comment on the case, but he is obviously not in a position to run the IMF." May 18 - Strauss-Kahn resigns as head of the IMF, saying he needs to devote all his energy to fight charges that he sexually assaulted a hotel maid. May 20 - He is released on bail and held at a Manhattan safe house under around-the-clock armed guard. The temporary housing was arranged by a private security company at an estimated cost of $200,000 a month, which he is responsible for paying. May 23 - In a letter to IMF staff, Strauss-Kahn strongly denies charges against him and calls the events around his arrest on attempted rape "a personal nightmare." June 6 - The former IMF chief pleads not guilty to charges he sexually assaulted a New York hotel maid. June 28 - Christine Lagarde, former French finance minister is chosen to head the IMF. June 30 - Sources familiar with the case say that prosecutors now have doubts about the maid's credibility as a witness. The purported victim is 32-year-old Guinean immigrant. July 1 - Strauss-Kahn is released from house arrest without bail after prosecutors say the hotel maid has lied to a grand jury and made other false statements. -- Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance says the sexual assault case against Strauss-Kahn will continue to be investigated, including concerns that have been raised about his accuser's credibility. July 2 - Scrutiny of the accuser intensifies after more revelations about her conduct. A new report says the hotel maid spoke of the possibility of financial gain from the incident. July 4 - Writer Tristane Banon, who says Strauss-Kahn attempted to sexually assault her in Paris in 2003, plans to file a complaint against him, her lawyer says. -- Lawyers for Strauss-Kahn in France say they will counter-sue Banon for defamation.
