 LONDON, Jul  (Reuters) - Car maker Ford has suspended advertising in Britain's News of the World newspaper after allegations that the tabloid hacked the voicemail of a missing schoolgirl who was later found murdered. 

 "We are awaiting an outcome from the News of the World investigation and expect a speedy and decisive response," Ford said in a statement. "Pending this response we will be using alternative media within and outside News International Group instead of placing Ford advertising in the News of the World," it added. News International publishes the newspaper and is part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. (Reporting by  Keith Weir )
