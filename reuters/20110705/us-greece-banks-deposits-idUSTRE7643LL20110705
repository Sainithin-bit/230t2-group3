 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek business and household bank deposits fell for a fifth consecutive month in May, dropping 2.5 percent from the previous month to the lowest level since December 2007, the country's central bank said on Tuesday. 

 Bank of Greece data showed deposits fell to 191.9 billion euros ($277.8 billion) from 196.8 billion in April. A shrinking deposit base, partly caused by capital flight, has added to the strains of Greek banks, which have become reliant on ECB funding for their liquidity needs as access to wholesale funding remains mostly shut on sovereign debt concerns. Deposits have shrunk by 17.7 billion euros or 8.5 percent since the beginning of the year. In 2010, they had contracted by 29.1 billion euros or 12.2 percent. (Reporting by Harry Papachristou)
