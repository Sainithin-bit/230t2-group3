 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Shares in Australia-based uranium miner Paladin Resources Ltd. ( PDN.AX ) ( PDN.TO ) and its takeover target Summit Resources N.L. ( SMM.AX ) were placed on a trading halt on Monday pending an announcement, the Australian Stock Exchange said. 

 Paladin last week sweetened its bid for uranium prospector Summit by around 20 percent, valuing it at A$1.18 billion ($983 million), after Summit sold a stake to France's Areva CEPFi.PA, the world's top builder of nuclear reactors. Summit had rejected Paladin's initial February offer, which valued Summit at around A$1 billion, as inadequate and the bid struggled to find support. It has advised its shareholders not to take action while it reviews Paladin's new offer. Interest in Summit comes amid a sharp rise in uranium demand worldwide as new larger nuclear power plants are built, with limited supply leaving miners scouring the globe for new lodes. Paladin upped its hostile takeover offer to one Paladin share for every 1.67 Summit shares, valuing Summit at A$5.99 a share for its listed shares, based on Paladin's close on Thursday at A$10. The two companies are joint owners in the Valhalla/Skal project, which contains one of the world's top five uranium deposits and is located near an existing mining hub at Mount Isa in Queensland state in northern Australia. Areva agreed to pay A$292.6 million for up to 18 percent of Summit, which would make it Summit's largest shareholder. Summit has denied Areva was preparing a full takeover. ($1=A$1.20)
