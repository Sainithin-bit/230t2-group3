 RIYADH  (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Sunday it had 
shortlisted groups led by Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), Hong 
Kong's PCCW ( 0008.HK ) and Bahrain Telecommunications Co. 
BTEL.BH for the country's second fixed-line telephone 
license. 

  Ten groups had submitted applications in March for the 
license, which will end the fixed-line monopoly of 
state-controlled Saudi Telecom Co. 7010.SE.  Saudi Arabia will open bids from the three consortiums on 
April 21, the Communications and Information Technology 
Commission said in a statement.  The Verizon consortium also includes emerging markets 
telecommunications operator Millicom International Cellular SA 
MICC.O, CITC said, without naming other participants.  Bids by Etihad Etisalat 7020.SE (Mobily), which operates 
the kingdom's second mobile phone operator, South Korea's KT 
Corp. ( 030200.KS ) and China Telecom ( 0728.HK ) were among those 
disqualified.  Saudi Arabia, the largest Arab economy, is the Gulf Arab 
region's biggest telecom market.  Saudi Telecom has around 4 million fixed-line phone 
subscribers, giving it a penetration rate of around 16 percent 
of the kingdom's 25-million population, while internet 
penetration barely exceeds 3 percent.  A consortium led by Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Co. 
TELE.KW made the highest bid for Saudi Arabia's third mobile 
telephone license in March, offering $6.11 billion.  Mobily, an affiliate of Emirates Telecommunications Corp. 
ETEL.AD, has attracted around 6 million mobile customers 
since it started operating a second mobile phone service in May 
2005.
