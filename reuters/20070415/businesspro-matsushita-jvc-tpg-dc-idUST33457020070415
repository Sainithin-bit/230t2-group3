 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. 
( 6752.T ) is in the final stages of talks with TPG to reinvest 
in JVC 6792.T after selling its 52.4 percent stake in the 
struggling electronics maker to the U.S. private equity firm, 
the Asahi newspaper said. 

  The report came after sources familiar with the matter said 
in March that Panasonic maker Matsushita was set to choose TPG 
as preferred bidder for loss-making Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. 
(JVC).  TPG has decided Matsushita's support is indispensable for 
JVC's turnaround, and asked the world's largest consumer 
electronics maker for its cooperation, the newspaper said.  One likely scenario is that Matsushita sells its JVC stake 
to TPG, and, after the transaction, the Osaka-based company 
buys JVC-issued preferred shares to own less than 20 percent of 
the company, the paper said.  The final agreement will likely be reached by the end of 
the month, and JVC President Masahiko Terada is expected to 
step down as part of the deal, it said.  Although JVC enjoys brisk demand for hard disk 
drive-equipped camcorders, its rear-projection television sales 
have been hit by sharp falls in plasma TV prices.  It is also struggling to compete with industry titans such 
as Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. 
( 005930.KS ) in the liquid crystal display TV market.  ($1=119.25 Yen)
