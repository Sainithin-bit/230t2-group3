 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ), Japan's No.3 
automaker, will delay a target to sell 4.2 million vehicles 
globally in the business year to end-March 2009, as demand for 
its cars falls short of expectations, a source familiar with 
the matter said on Sunday. 

  Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan and French partner 
Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), is due to confirm an updated plan along 
with Nissan's 2006/07 results on April 26, the source said.  Nissan, 44 percent-owned by Renault, has seen its sales 
drop below target in its two biggest markets, the United States 
and Japan, prompting a downward revision to its profit 
estimates for the year to March 31.  In February, Nissan said it was certain to miss its 2006-07 
global sales target of 3.73 million vehicles.  But Ghosn said then that Nissan would draw up additional 
action plans to make sure it met three commitments under its 
medium-term business plan.  The "Nissan Value-Up" plan calls for an operating profit 
margin at the "top end" of the industry, and a 20 percent 
return on invested capital in 2007/08. A vehicle sales target 
of 4.2 million units was slated for completion a year later.  While a revision to the much-publicized target could deal 
another blow to Ghosn's reputation for delivering promised 
results, analysts have said the sales volume commitment should 
be dropped as it risked hurting margins through the possible 
use of heavy sales incentives.  Most automakers do not publicize volume targets beyond the 
year ahead.  Nissan shares have dropped by more than a fifth since 
hitting a 2007 high at the end of January. The autos sector 
sub-index .ITEQP.T has fallen 11.4 percent over the same 
period.
