 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The World Bank's development committee will discuss bank President Paul Wolfowitz's leadership on Sunday in a meeting of development ministers, a source told Reuters. 

 The source said the committee would issue a statement after the meeting. World Bank staff and anti-poverty activists have called for Wolfowitz to resign, saying the bank's moral authority is in tatters because of his handling of a high-paying promotion for his girlfriend, who was assigned outside the bank when he became president in 2005.
