 (Corrects month in paragraph 3 to April, not May)    
  RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Sunday it had shortlisted groups led by Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), Hong Kong's PCCW ( 0008.HK ) and Bahrain Telecommunications Co. BTEL.BH for the country's second fixed-line licence. 

 Ten consortiums had submitted applications in March for the licence, which will end a fixed-line monopoly of state-controlled Saudi Telecom Co. 7010.SE. Saudi Arabia will open bids from the three consortiums on April 21, the Communications and Information Technology Commission said in a statement. Bids by Etihad Etisalat 7020.SE (Mobily), which operates the kingdom's second mobile phone operator, and South Korea's KT Corp. ( 030200.KS ) were among those disqualified.
