 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The World Bank's board must decide the fate of Paul Wolfowitz, Chancellor Gordon Brown said on Saturday, in cautious remarks that offered little support to the bank's embattled president. 

 "Having published the facts themselves, the board obviously has to complete its work. And I think we have got to respect the board process," he told a joint press conference with International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato. Wolfowitz has been under growing pressure to resign after it became known that he approved a big pay rise and new job for his girlfriend -- a World Bank staffer. "It is the World Bank's process, not the IMF's process," said Brown, who added that Wolfowitz remained fully engaged with the meetings taking place here this weekend. "Paul Wolfowitz played a full part in the meeting as he always does, of the IMF committee today as he did in the G7 (Group of Seven) yesterday," said Brown. His remarks were somewhat milder than the blunt criticism earlier on Saturday by development minister Hilary Benn, who said the scandal had damaged the institution. The White House has offered its backing for the former Bush administration stalwart. But many other countries have so far remained cautious about prejudging any decision by the World Bank's board. Rato steered clear of the controversy, but pointedly confined his remarks to an expression of satisfaction that the bank could resolve the situation over Wolfowitz internally. "The board of the bank is looking at the issue and I have total confidence in the institution of the Bank to handle the issue," Rato said.
