 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - African finance ministers said on Saturday that embattled World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz was a "visionary," who had furthered the cause of African economic development. 

 Wolfowitz has come under increasing pressure to resign this week over his role in securing a high-paying promotion for his girlfriend and bank employee, Shaha Riza. The bank's board said on Friday it would decide quickly on how to proceed. Speaking in Washington, African finance ministers said Wolfowitz had played a key role in promoting development in Africa, particularly in post conflict-ridden countries such as Liberia. "We have seen visionary leadership and steadfast progress under Mr. Wolfowitz," said Antoinette Sayeh, finance minister of Liberia and a former World Bank official. "He has certainly championed Africa's cause in the two years of his leadership." The World Bank has pleaded with the donor community to help repay or cancel about $3.7 billion in foreign debt accumulated by previous corrupt governments in Liberia. Some observers argue Wolfowitz's role in promoting his girlfriend has left his credibility in tatters, particularly since he has spearheaded a drive against corruption in Africa. But the African ministers, attending annual spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, said the renewed emphasis on corruption under Wolfowitz had delivered some well needed tough medicine. "We has made us believe in ourselves," said N'Gandu Magande, finance minister of Zambia. "Corruption is a cancer that cost us a lot in development." Magande said he would stand by any decision the World Bank board made, and even if Wolfowitz was forced out of the bank, he expected no major policy shift on Africa. Rama Sithanen, the deputy prime minister and finance minister of Mauritius, also gave Wolfowitz a vote of confidence. "We think he has done a good job," he said."
