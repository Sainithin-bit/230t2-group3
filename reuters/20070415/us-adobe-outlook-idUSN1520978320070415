 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. software company Adobe Systems Inc. ( ADBE.O ) could be spurred by a series of new product launches over the next three months, according to the April 16 edition of Barron's. 

 "There is tremendous market-growth opportunity here, and both Adobe earnings and Adobe stock have very good chances of surprising everyone on the upside over the next six months," said Tom Ernst of Deutsche Bank, according to the report. The company's free cash flow amounts to more than 30 percent of sales, making the company one of the market's most notable cash kings, according to the weekly publication. Moreover, the consensus earnings estimates of roughly 20 percent growth may seriously underestimate the real 12-month potential, Barron's wrote.
