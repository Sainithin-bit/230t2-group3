 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Here are quotes about World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz, embroiled in controversy over his role in securing a promotion for Shaha Riza, a World Bank staffer with whom he has a romantic relationship. 

 Finance leaders from leading industrialized nations are in Washington for a Group of Seven meeting and for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson: "He's apologized, the bank has a process in place to review this, and Paul has said this process is appropriate, and I agree with him. Given that we have a representative on the board involved in that process I don't think it's appropriate for me to comment any further. But let me add, though, that this should not call into question or be read as any lessening of U.S. support for Paul Wolfowitz." British Development Minister Hilary Benn: "While this whole business has damaged the bank and should not have happened, we should respect the board's process. I am sure these views will be shared by other governors who will also be considering their responses." German Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul: "For me the most important thing is that the moral authority and the financial stability of the World Bank must not be harmed. He himself has to decide whether he still has the credibility to represent the position of the World Bank." Liberian Finance Minister Antoinette Sayeh: "We have seen visionary leadership and steadfast progress under Mr. Wolfowitz. He has certainly championed Africa's cause in the two years of his leadership." Bank of Canada Governor David Dodge: "Certainly in the meetings, both the G7 (on Friday) and the IMFC (on Saturday), Mr. Wolfowitz participated in absolutely the appropriate manner that one would expect the president of the World Bank to participate in." Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz: "We have known President Wolfowitz for a long time. He is a man who is professional and shows high ethical standards. And we hope that the current issue resolves itself amicably, and that President Wolfowitz can take the World Bank and steer the World Bank, to serve the developing world, to build the institution, to reform the institution, so that it can play an even more effective role in the global financial system."
