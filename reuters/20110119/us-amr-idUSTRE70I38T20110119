 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - American Airlines parent AMR Corp AMR.N posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, but shares tumbled nearly 6 percent as analysts perceived a challenging outlook for the airline. 

 AMR is the second major U.S. airline to post fourth-quarter results. Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) posted a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday. The Delta disappointment raised new concerns on Wall Street about the strength of the airline industry's recovery in the face of rising jet fuel prices. AMR shares rose as much as 2.5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange early on Wednesday but were down 5.9 percent at $7.80 by afternoon. The Arca airline index  .XAL  was down 1.72 percent. J.P. Morgan analyst Jamie Baker said that a strict interpretation of AMR's full-year forecast caused the firm to lower its AMR earnings outlook. "Reasonable revenue adjustments are likely to restore profitability, though potentially to a level less robust than currently forecast," Baker said in a note to clients. AMR said its full-year capacity will increase by 3.6 percent in 2011 compared with 2010, with domestic capacity up 1.0 percent and an increase of international capacity of 7.7 percent compared with 2010 levels. The U.S. airline industry has been hammered in the last decade by volatile fuel costs and the 2008/2009 economic downturn that drained travel demand. Additional pressure on airline shares came from a month-long rally in fuel prices. NYMEX crude, which is directly related to the price of jet fuel, was at $90.75 per barrel on Wednesday. "The whole airline space is down, and I think it's just we're seeing jet fuel prices up. So I think that's mostly it," said Helane Becker, an airline analyst with Dahlman Rose & Co, referring to historically high energy prices. AMR said its fourth-quarter net loss was $97 million, or 29 cents per share, compared with a loss of $344 million, or $1.03 per share, a year before. The fourth-quarter 2010 results include the impact of a $28 million noncash charge related to the lower value of Colombian routes because of a new law that makes them more accessible to other airlines. Excluding that charge, the company said it lost $69 million, or 21 cents per share. Wall Street analysts had expected AMR to lose 32 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. AMR said revenue was $5.6 billion, a gain of 10.3 percent. "Excluding the one-time charges, AMR did a commendable job reducing controllable expenses," said Morningstar equity analyst Basili Alukos. "However, AMR still reported a loss, and I think the company has an arduous task returning to the black on a consistent basis." The carrier said labor costs eased 1.2 percent to $1.7 billion. But experts generally agree that AMR's labor costs are too high relative to its peers, who slashed their labor costs in bankruptcy in recent years. AMR said fuel costs increased 12.9 percent to $1.7 billion. The carrier predicted fuel costs would be a "significant headwind in 2011." The company said its cost per available seat mile for 2011, excluding fuel and the potential impact of any new labor agreements, is expected to be flat with the previous year. AMR ended the fourth quarter with $4.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. The company said it is currently in talks with online travel agencies Expedia Inc ( EXPE.O ) and Orbitz Worldwide Inc ( OWW.N ) on a distribution deal. AMR is trying to push third-party sellers of its tickets to use its direct connect technology, which it says will save money and allow customers to shop for flights based on factors other than just fares. AMR has removed its fares from Orbitz sites after Orbitz shunned AMR's technology. Expedia later pulled AMR fares, saying AMR's strategy is "anti-consumer" and "anti-choice." Last year, industry analysts wondered whether AMR was at a competitive disadvantage to rivals that have found merger partners. United Airlines and Continental Airlines merged to form United Continental Holdings Inc. ( UAL.N ) But AMR has long insisted it does not need a merger partner to thrive and has said its network, which focuses on key cities, will pay off. "In 2011, American will continue to enhance its own network and expand its relationship with quality carriers in the markets that are important to our customers," said AMR Chief Executive Gerard Arpey in a statement. "American is well positioned to capitalize on the opportunities unfolding in the marketplace," Arpey said. AMR also said it will support its network strategy by purchasing two Boeing ( BA.N ) 777-300ERs. The two aircraft are expected to be delivered in late 2012.
