 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - T-Mobile USA's new chief executive looks set to dash the hopes of Clearwire Corp CLWR.O investors when he meets Wall Street analysts on Thursday as he is unlikely to announce a strategic deal with the smaller wireless operator, sources close to the situation said. 

 Philipp Humm, CEO of T-Mobile USA, a unit of Deutsche Telekom ( DTEGn.DE ), is expected to give analysts a strategy overview for the No. 4 U.S. mobile service provider in New York on Thursday. Clearwire, which is 54 percent owned by Sprint Nextel ( S.N ), has long been in talks with companies such as T-Mobile USA as it needs billions of dollars in new funding to finish a high-speed wireless network it is building. Clearwire and T-Mobile USA are still in active talks about options including a spectrum sale or a T-Mobile USA equity investment in Clearwire, according to two of the sources who asked not to be named as talks are ongoing. Some analysts are hoping T-Mobile USA, which will needs access new spectrum in coming years, would be ready to announce a deal with Clearwire at its analyst meeting. A representative for T-Mobile USA declined to discuss the contents of Humm's planned presentation. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew  and  Nadia Damouni ; editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
