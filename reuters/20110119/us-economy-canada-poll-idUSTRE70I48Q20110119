 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada's economic expansion will slow this year, according to a Reuters poll, but a stronger corporate environment and a pick-up in the U.S. recovery is expected to help keep growth running at a healthy clip. 

 The median forecast of 21 economists polled over the past week predicts the Canadian economy will expand 2.4 percent this year, in line with predictions in a similar survey in October, when economists had predicted last year's GDP growth at 3.0 percent. The forecast for 2012 GDP growth was 2.8 percent. "One of the big things for Canada is the U.S. recovery picking up strength a bit," said Nathan Janzen, an economist at RBC Economics, the most bullish of all the banks surveyed. "Some of that strength in American growth spilling over into Canadian export growth -- that spurs a bit of a pick-up in jobs growth." The survey showed economists expect the unemployment rate to be 7.6 percent this year, down from 7.8 projected in October, and fall to 7.4 percent next year. "We hope that the rebound in GDP in the U.S. will help the auto sector in Ontario and ...the manufacturing sector overall," said Marie-Claude Guillotte, an economist with Laurentian Bank Securities. A big capital spending boom that started last year is expected to continue in 2011 and 2012, helping to power the economy forward. "With that capital spending comes employment," said economist Ryan Bohren of BofAML. A pick-up in jobs growth and rising incomes will also drive consumer spending, although not quite at the same pace as in 2010 as rising levels of household debt weigh, Janzen said. The government took steps this week to curb credit growth, tightening mortgage rules and reducing support for lines of credit secured by homes. "The impact of this tightening will probably be modest, but we expect that will reduce the pace of consumption growth," said Laurentian's Guillotte. Economists surveyed in the poll saw housing starts averaging 174,500 units this year, down slightly from the 175,000 units predicted in October's poll. Housing starts are expected to climb again in 2012, to 178,100. The median core consumer price index (CPI) forecast was 1.7 percent for 2011, down from 1.8 percent in October, and 1.9 percent for 2012. The Bank of Canada this week held its key interest rate steady and signaled it may keep rates on hold for longer than markets had expected. The central bank, the first of the Group of Seven major industrialized countries to begin raising interest rates last year following the global financial crisis, is expected to hike rates to 1.25 percent in the first half of this year, according to a separate Reuters poll last week.
