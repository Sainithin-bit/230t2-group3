 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mosaic Co ( MOS.N ) could sell itself over the next two years even though its majority shareholder Cargill CARG.UL decided to sell its stake in the fertilizer company, Mosaic's chief executive said in a conference call on Tuesday. 

 The company and Cargill have built mechanisms into their deal that would let the company accept a competing bid if one arises, according to a source familiar with the matter. For a bid to be taken seriously, the source said, it would need to be high enough to offset the tax benefits of the Cargill-Mosaic deal. (Reporting by  Michael Erman  and Ernest Scheyder.
