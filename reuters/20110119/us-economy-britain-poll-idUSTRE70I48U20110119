 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England is still set to raise interest rates from the fourth quarter but a growing minority of analysts say it could move earlier to curb inflation that is well above target, a Reuters poll shows. 

 The survey of more than 60 analysts showed the bank rate rising from its record low of 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent in the fourth quarter. The poll was taken after official figures on Tuesday showed inflation hit an eight-month high of 3.7 percent in December, nearly double the Bank of England's 2 percent target rate. While the median forecast was unchanged from a poll conducted earlier this month, 22 of 63 economists -- more than a third -- now forecast a rise in the third quarter or before compared to 16 of 59 in the previous poll. "This raise is becoming much more difficult for the Bank of England -- certainly there's going to be a market expectation that they move much sooner rather than later," said Ross Walker, economist at RBS. "So I think you'll start to see a May hike getting priced in quite soon." Consumer price inflation, which has been well above the central bank's 2 percent target for well over a year, had been forecast to remain steady at 3.3 percent last month. It is likely to rise even further early this year due to an increase in government sales tax. The poll predicts it will peak at 3.8 percent this quarter and average 3.4 percent this year before dropping below target to 1.9 percent in 2012. Actual CPI figures have topped the median Reuters poll consensus in 20 of the last 33 months, having equaled or undershot the forecasts in the other cases. "Pressure on the doves to change their views is building. Markets will increasingly price in tightening this year," said Rob Carnell at ING. "An expansion of the UK's asset purchase scheme looks all but impossible now, and though we continue to believe that rates will be left on hold until early next year, this is becoming a closer call to make." A poll taken ahead of the January 6 Monetary Policy Committee meeting also predicted rates would not rise until the fourth quarter, pegging them at 0.75 percent at the end of this year before creeping up gradually to 2.0 percent by the end of 2012, with similar results in the most recent poll. GRADUAL GROWTH The BoE slashed interest rates back in early 2009 and embarked on a 200 billion pound ($319 billion) asset purchase program to inject cash into the money supply, aiming to drag the economy out of its deepest post-war recession and back to growth. The economy pulled out of recession in the second quarter of last year and the poll forecasts slow but steady growth through to the end of next year. And despite inflation being so far above target, and for so long, the majority of poll respondents who answered the question said the BoE's inflation-targeting credibility remained strong. Growth was seen slowing from a forecast 0.5 percent in the final three months of 2010 to 0.2 percent in the current quarter before gradually picking up speed, similar to predictions made in last month's poll. The economy is expected to grow 1.9 percent this year and 2.1 percent in 2012, unchanged from the last poll. Unemployment data due on Wednesday is expected to show the unemployment rate held steady at 7.9 percent in November, but the poll sees it peaking at 8.1 percent in the second half of this year and averaging that in 2012. For 2011, it is seen averaging 8.0 percent, just down from the 8.1 percent predicted in a poll taken three months ago.
