 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy is likely to grow modestly this year after a mild contraction in the final quarter of 2010, a Reuters poll showed, as exports pick up on robust demand from fast-growing emerging nations. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters do not expect recent rises in commodity and food prices to greatly impact Japan, which is mired in consumer price deflation due to weak domestic demand. "Exports are unexpectedly firm. Although domestic demand remains sluggish, companies are enjoying strong profits," said Takehiro Sato, chief economist at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities. "Economic growth is likely to pick up moderately in the latter half of this year," he said. Economists surveyed by Reuters in January expect Japan's economy to grow 0.2 percent in January-March, a touch up from the 0.1 percent expansion forecast in December, after an expected 0.4 percent contraction in the final quarter of last year. Growth is expected to pick up to 0.4 percent in the second quarter followed by a 0.5 percent expansion in July-September, the poll of over 20 economists showed, unchanged from the December forecasts. Despite recent rises in commodity costs, economists stuck to their view that Japan will remain in deflation at least until the second quarter of 2012, keeping the central bank under pressure to maintain its ultra-loose monetary policy. "The economy likely won't be strong enough to improve the supply and demand balance," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. "Downward pressure on prices may ease somewhat, but prices won't rise at a pace that the BOJ would consider as stable," he said. Factory output is expected to rise 0.5 percent in the first quarter and pick up pace later in the year, the poll showed. FED EFFECT Some analysts said developments in the U.S. Federal Reserve's bond buying program are among the risks to Japan's outlook as an end to the big stimulus could trigger an outflow of funds from emerging economies, hurting growth in key Japanese export destinations. "If the possibility of the Fed ending its quantitative easing program heightens, financial markets in emerging economies may face an adjustment phase," Morgan Stanley MUFG's Sato said. The BOJ is expected to make minor tweaks to its growth forecasts but will stick to its view that the economy will resume a moderate recovery later this year on bright signs in output and exports, sources told Reuters last week. The central bank will review its economic and price forecasts for the three fiscal years up to March 2013, which was issued in October, at its next rate review on January 24-25. The BOJ last year cut interest rates effectively to zero and set up a 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) asset buying scheme under which it injects funds into the economy by buying assets ranging from government bonds to corporate debt.
