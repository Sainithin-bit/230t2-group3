 LONDON  (Reuters) - The euro zone's motley collection of economic leaders and losers are unlikely to muster anything more than grinding, unspectacular growth over the coming two years, a Reuters poll of economists showed on Wednesday. 

 Despite some promising economic indicators in January pointing to booming growth for the bloc's No.1 economy Germany, few of the survey's 50-plus analysts said this would translate into any kind of spurt across the 17-nation euro bloc. They predicted euro zone quarter-on-quarter growth would range around 0.3 and 0.4 percent in each quarter through to the middle of next year, before picking up slightly to 0.5 percent in each of the last two quarters of 2012 -- roughly in line with last month's poll. A flurry of fiscal austerity measures plus a sovereign debt crisis centered on Ireland and Greece, will ensure the divergence in growth rates between the strong Franco-German core and a weak periphery will persist. "We believe the ability of the region to generate sustained consumption to drive the growth prospects in the coming years will remain subdued," said Silvio Peruzzo, economist at RBS. While domestic demand inside the euro zone will remain weak, Peruzzo said its 17 members would still benefit from economic strength further afield. "There is a divergence between the big countries and the small countries, but the way we see (it) this recovery is cast globally where generally the conditions for economic activity remain very positive, for this year and maybe for next year." Still, the poll showed the euro zone as a whole lagging behind both fast-growing emerging economies and its developed world peers. While the euro area economy is expected to grow around 1.5 percent this year and 1.7 percent in 2012, economists predict almost twice those rates of growth in the United States. Outside the euro zone, the only major economies expected to post similarly modest growth rates in coming quarters are Britain and Japan, which is still battling deflation. BAILOUT A strong majority of economists in the latest poll expect Portugal to capitulate to market pressure by accessing the euro zone's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), reaffirming findings from a survey taken two weeks ago. Seventeen out of 22 analysts who answered an extra question on the subject said they expected a Portuguese bailout, with most earmarking the first half this year. The January 6 poll, which had a larger sample, showed 44 out of 51 saying this. Only two out of 22 thought Spain would be forced down the same route, while no-one thought Belgium -- touted by some as a source of sovereign debt risk -- will ever have to access the EFSF. "We expect demand for Portuguese bonds to ebb over the coming weeks, which will eventually force the government to follow Greece and Ireland in seeking help," said Azad Zangana of Schroders. Last week's sale of 10-year Portuguese bonds went smoothly, although at 6.72 percent the yield was far higher than normal and some analysts suspect it would have breached 7 percent had it not been for the European Central Bank's presence in the market. Warnings last week from ECB policymakers that inflation risks could move to the upside had a pronounced effect on the poll's inflation forecasts. Economists now expect first quarter inflation of 2.1 percent -- the first time the consensus has crossed the 2 percent mark since polling for this quarter started in October 2009. They also upgraded forecasts for second and third quarter inflation, as well as the full-year figure for 2011. Still, respondents largely retained their forecasts for the first interest rate hike to come in the fourth quarter, with only four out of 66 bringing their prediction forward by at least a quarter.
