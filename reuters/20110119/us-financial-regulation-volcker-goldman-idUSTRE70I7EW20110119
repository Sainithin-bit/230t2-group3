 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker on Wednesday praised Goldman Sachs' recent internal report that promised more disclosure about trading for its own account. 

 "I appreciate the philosophy that's stated," Volcker, who recently left his post as an adviser to President Barack Obama, said in an interview with Reuters. "At least they certainly recognize the difference between the customer-relationship orientation and pure trading orientation." Volcker also said he believes a single hedge fund or insurer could be deemed "systemic" by the new U.S. risk council, a designation that would impose strict oversight.
