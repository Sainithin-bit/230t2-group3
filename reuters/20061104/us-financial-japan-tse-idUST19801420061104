 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) has proposed an operational tie-up with its Japanese counterpart, the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE.UL), the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Saturday. 

 The TSE has agreed to discuss a deal that might include cross-listing of exchange-traded funds and cooperation in a wide range of other areas, such as development of trading systems and strategies for revitalising exchanges for start-up companies, the paper said. The TSE has also been in capital tie-up talks with the New York Stock Exchange NYX.N that could bring together the world's two largest equities markets as early as 2009, the TSE's president said this week. The TSE said it was looking to form alliances with other Asian exchanges, underscoring a growing trend among stock exchanges around the world to link up amid intensifying competition. Earlier this month, Nasdaq, NYSE's biggest rival, signed cooperative agreements with the Korea Exchange and Tokyo-based Jasdaq. NYSE itself struck a $10 billion deal in June to take over Paris-based exchange operator Euronext ENXT.PA.
