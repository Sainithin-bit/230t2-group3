 LONDON  (Reuters) - Online gaming firm PartyGaming PRTY.L is in talks to buy part of Austrian Internet betting company bwin.com BWIN.VI, a source close to the situation said on Saturday. 

 "It is a logical extension from PartyGaming buying Gamebookers in August," said the source, adding that PartyGaming was losing interest in buying smaller rival 888 Holdings Plc  ( 888.L ). PartyGaming said last month that its sports betting operation Gamebookers had exceeded expectations since it was bought. PartyGaming is also looking at other deals, including smaller online bingo and casino operators, the source said. Meanwhile, the Financial Times reported that Ladbrokes ( LAD.L ) and 888 were in merger talks. Ladbrokes declined to comment, while 888 reiterated its statement on Monday that it had held "various preliminary discussions with third parties." A source close to 888 said: "The founding shareholders are not desperate to sell, because they believe in the long term business." Many online gaming companies have been in tie-up talks as they search for potential synergies to improve margins after the United States effectively banned online gaming last month. PartyGaming spokesman John Shepherd declined to comment on the potential acquisitions but added that the company had continued to reduce its cost base by cutting jobs. "Out of the 1,750 staff in India, we had to let go of 800," he said. "It was necessary to reduce the cost base as a result of illogical, ill-conceived and inconsistent prohibition legislation in the United States," he added. PartyGaming offered other companies in Hyderabad, India the employees it was losing, said Shepherd. As a result, 13 companies conducted job interviews, including HSBC Technology Services, technology firm Cisco, mobile phone maker Motorola, investment bank UBS and consultancy Deloitte. "We're very pleased to have found alternative employment for a couple of hundred former employees," said Shepherd.
