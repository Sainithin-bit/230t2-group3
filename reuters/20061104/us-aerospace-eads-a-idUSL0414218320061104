 PARIS  (Reuters) - Franco-German aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ) will hold a board meeting on Tuesday to decide on the possible launch of the A350 XWB mid-sized aircraft, French newspaper Le Figaro said on Saturday without citing sources. 

 At EADS, parent company of planemaker Airbus and Europe's largest aerospace group, no one was immediately available to comment. Production problems with Airbus's A380 superjumbo have plunged the group into crisis and forced it to re-examine its projects and restructure its business. The A350 XWB, or Extra Wide Body, is a redesigned version of Airbus's slow-selling mid-sized plane and the German co-head of EADS, Thomas Enders, last month was reported as saying he did not rule out abandoning the XWB due to delays of the A380. Le Figaro said the XWB would cost almost 10 billion euros to make and could be launched in 2012. On Saturday, German magazine Der Spiegel said it had obtained a letter from German aerospace industry group BDLI which revealed the German government was considering giving aid to parts' suppliers hit badly by the delays to the A380. The letter said the delays would lead to 24 A380s fewer than originally planned being built in each of the next two years. In the two years after this, the production shortfall is expected to number a further 25 aircraft in total, the magazine said. The German government has pledged to keep German-French parity in EADS and Chancellor Angela Merkel met Enders and his French counterpart Louis Gallois on Friday, although this failed to produce a plan to secure new German investors in EADS. Germany is concerned that founding EADS shareholder DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE could reduce its stake in the Airbus parent, diminishing German influence in the company just as it is about to push through substantial cost cuts.
