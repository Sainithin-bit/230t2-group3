 MADRID  (Reuters) - The Spanish government is about to remove key conditions it slapped on E.ON's EONG.DE proposed 37 billion euro ($47 billion) bid for Spanish power firm Endesa ( ELE.MC ), newspaper El Mundo reported on Saturday. 

 Spain's Industry Ministry is due to reply in the next few days to the European Commission, which has said the conditions, requiring E.ON to sell Endesa strategic assets, violate EU legislation. El Mundo said the government was ready to back down on at least three of the 19 conditions its regulator had imposed. "As this newspaper has found out, the Industry Ministry will allow the German company to continue to manage the nuclear plants that Endesa now controls," El Mundo said. "It will be able to keep the coal plants and continue to operate in the Balearic and Canary Island electricity markets." The government was giving way on the most controversial conditions and modifying some of the others, the report said. The European Commission has threatened to take Spain to the European Court of Justice over its opposition to E.ON's takeover bid. Under the conditions the energy regulator slapped on E.ON's bid in July, E.ON would have to divest itself of about 32 percent of Endesa's core Spanish business, equivalent to 7,396 megawatts of capacity, including all of its interests in the Asco I nuclear power station, the only one Endesa owns completely. E.ON would also have to give up any management interest in the other nuclear power stations in which Endesa has a stake, the regulator said then, claiming that the nuclear assets involved "greater risk to public security". E.ON would also have to sell coal-fired generating capacity that uses Spanish coal and the electricity supply business in Spain's Canary and Balearic islands and the north African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. The Industry Ministry's spokesman was not immediately available to comment on the newspaper report.
