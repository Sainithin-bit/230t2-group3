 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on 
Friday said that China has stepped up the pace at which it is 
letting the value of its currency appreciate, but should allow 
the change to take place even more rapidly. 

  "China has recognized the need to appreciate their currency 
and for greater currency flexibility. ... I don't want to use 
the word rapidly, but the pace of change has accelerated, 
they've moved it about 6 percent over the last year, they need 
to move it more quickly," he said in an interview on Bloomberg 
TV.  There is a growing awareness around the world regarding how 
important it is for China to have a currency that more 
accurately reflects economic fundamentals, said Paulson, who 
travels to China next week.  (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal )
