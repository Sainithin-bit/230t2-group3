 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Friday it would recall 575,417 vehicles as long-term wear on the gear shift assembly could cause them to shift out of park without the key in the ignition. 

 The recall involves 2001 to 2002 model-year Dodge Dakota pickup trucks, Durango sports utility vehicles and Ram van models and 2002 model-year Ram pickup trucks. "In a limited number of cases, long-term wear on the shift assembly can erode the height of the shift blocker, creating the potential that the vehicle could shift out of park without the key in the ignition," Chrysler said in a statement The company said nine incidents involving injuries have been identified in connection with this issue but no fatalities have been reported. Owners will be notified, beginning in January, according to the company. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
