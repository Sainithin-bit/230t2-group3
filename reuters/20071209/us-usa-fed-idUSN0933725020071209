 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Steady U.S. hiring points to economic resilience that will let the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a restrained quarter-percentage point on Tuesday rather than a more aggressive half point. 

 Employers added a net 94,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday, and even though revisions subtracted a net 48,000 positions from the count for the previous two months, the report blunted fears of a plunging economy. As a result, Fed policy-makers are likely to conclude they are safe in taking out only a little extra insurance to prevent the housing slump and credit market turmoil from dragging the broader economy into recession. A resurgence in credit market turbulence in recent weeks had led financial markets to boost bets of a more aggressive half-point move. "In the absence of evidence that the real economy is falling apart, that would argue for the Fed to proceed cautiously with another quarter point," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist for Global Insight in Lexington, Mass. Markets fully expect a quarter-point rate reduction at the Fed's December 11 meeting, as implied by short-term futures contracts. But after Friday's employment report, markets scaled back bets for a half-point rate reduction to about 41 percent from 47 percent on Thursday and 65 percent a week ago. A Reuters poll of 17 primary dealers, firms that trade directly with the U.S. central bank, found that all of them are counting on the central bank to cut rates a quarter point. Dealers said the jobs data did not justify a bigger move. FED FLEXIBILITY Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chairman Donald Kohn made clear last week that deteriorating credit market conditions since the Fed's last meeting at the end of October spelled rising risks to the economy. "These uncertainties require flexible and pragmatic policy-making -- nimble is the adjective I used a few weeks ago," Kohn said. Credit conditions remain tight, as evidenced by the gap between the Fed's 4.5 percent target for the overnight federal funds rate -- its main policy lever -- and the three-month dollar-denominated London Interbank Offered Rate, which stands at 5.15 percent. That spread is wider now than in August, when a worldwide bout of credit market turmoil set in. Since then, the Fed has cut benchmark overnight rates by a cumulative three-quarters of a point in two moves. They have also lowered the discount rate, which governs direct Fed loans to banks, and taken other steps to make it easier and more attractive for banks to borrow directly from the central bank. While the economy grew at a vigorous annual rate of 4.9 percent in the July-September period, the Fed expects slower growth through the end of the year and into 2008, and many economists have said recession risks are on the rise. On November 20, the U.S. central bank ratcheted back its growth forecast for next year to between 1.8 percent and 2.5 percent from a June projection of a 2.5 percent to 2.75 percent range. PUTTING OFF RECESSION TALK Even so, not all Fed officials were convinced at their last meeting in October that a second rate cut was needed to follow up the initial bold half-point reduction of mid-September. And the latest jobs figures provide a sign that, outside of housing and the financial services sectors, the economy is still trudging along. "It was certainly healthy enough to put off talk that the economy is careening off the cliff into a recession," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. But some analysts said the report showed a clear slowing trend since mid-year that keeps a large rate cut on the table. "The Fed's main focus remains the credit squeeze and liquidity conditions and a slackening labor market will reinforce concerns that the economy is slowing," said Benjamin Reitzes, an economist with BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. Some economists say the Fed may trim the federal funds rate by only a quarter-point, but cut the discount rate by a half-percentage point to address concerns about a lack of financial market liquidity. That would put the discount rate just a quarter point above the federal funds rate and could encourage banks to approach the Fed if they had trouble finding funds. (Editing by  Jan Paschal )
