 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Halliburton Co ( HAL.N ), the world's second-largest oilfield services company, plans to increase capital spending next year by about a fifth at least, as it targets new opportunities outside its core U.S. market. 

 Chief Financial Officer Mark McCollum credits Halliburton's steady investment through the 2009 downturn as one reason for its recent outperformance over rivals, and said he expects 2011 capital expenditure of between $2.5 billion and $3 billion. That compares with its expected 2010 capital expenditure of $2.1 billion, and $1.8 billion in 2009. Addressing analysts at a meeting in Houston on Wednesday, McCollum said about half the investments are in international markets, where it is second only to Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ). Halliburton shares rose 4.9 percent to $34.85, about a dollar below the two-year high they touched last month. UBS analyst Angie Sedita said North American prospects were not as weak as many fear and that Halliburton's international and deepwater positions were "stronger than most recognize." The company is ramping up in Iraq, where it has won three contracts in the past three months, and expects increased oil and gas extraction from shale rock around the world to follow the growth of U.S. shale drilling. The number of rigs in the Eagle Ford shale in Texas, for example, would likely more than double to 200 by the end of next year, according to Jim Brown, senior vice president for the Western Hemisphere at Halliburton Energy Services Group. Concerns about the environmental impact of such drilling have prompted an investigation by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which on Tuesday subpoenaed Halliburton demanding information about chemicals it uses in the extraction technique known as hydraulic fracturing. Halliburton has its eyes on extending its U.S. leadership in "fracking" to its international markets. Brown told the analyst meeting that U.S. shale investments by the likes of France's Total ( TOTF.PA ) and Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) pointed to the potential in other countries. "They're not here just to harvest, they're here to learn," he said. Brown also said officials in India had identified six shale basins, and bidding for contracts there would start next year. Tim Probert, president of global business lines, said there was plenty of potential in India, Libya and Russia, three markets that have collectively grown 60 percent over the past four years. Halliburton also will focus on deepwater drilling, in which it aims to grow 25 percent faster than rivals, and on the well intervention business that increases output at old wells, now that it owns Boots & Coots -- a deal that closed in September. Executives pointed out that, apart from the more exciting exploration business, there are about a million and a half producing wells worldwide, with 90,000 being added every year and most needing to be worked over every three to five years. So Halliburton aims to triple Boots & Coots revenue in the next three years, including some growth through acquisitions. Sedita at UBS, calling Halliburton's three-year targets "impressive," citing a plan to boost capital efficiency on North American fracking by 20 percent, while reducing well site personnel by 35 percent and completion time by 25 percent.
