 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Two Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) directors, including the chairman, purchased 65,000 shares of the company on Tuesday, according to a Wednesday filing with U.S. securities regulators. 

 BofA Chairman Chad Holliday purchased 30,000 shares in a transaction valued at $378,150, the filing stated. Holliday's stock deal roughly doubles the amount of shares he owns in the largest U.S. bank by assets, and is the former DuPont executive's first purchase of BofA stock since becoming chairman at this year's annual meeting. Holliday now owns 54,650 BofA shares. Separately, Robert Scully bought 35,000 shares, for a total price of $491,716 through a trust. Scully, a former Morgan Stanley director, is a member of BofA's audit and compensation and benefits committees. (Reporting by Joe Rauch, editing by Dave Zimmerman)
