 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama is withholding comment on a bipartisan panel's recommendations for cutting the U.S. deficit to give the group and its leaders space to work on them, the White House said on Wednesday. 

 "These ideas ... are only a step in the process toward coming up with a set of recommendations and the president looks forward to reviewing their final product early next month," White House spokesman Bill Burton said in a statement. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason ; Editing by  Ross Colvin )
