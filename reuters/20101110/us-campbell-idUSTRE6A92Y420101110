 NEW YORK/CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ) cut its earnings forecast for the current year after a weaker-than-expected start, as deep discounts on soup failed to boost sales, and its shares dropped 3.7 percent. 

 Campbell said on Wednesday that it expects to report a decline of 1 percent in sales for the just-ended first quarter and a 6 percent drop in earnings per share, or weaker than it had originally planned. The preliminary results on Wednesday bode poorly for the autumn and winter soup season a year after Campbell saw consumers buy discounted frozen meals instead of soup, disappointing investors that expected strong soup sales in a weak economy. The results also show that after several years of weakness, the U.S. soup business does not appear to be turning around, a situation that could call the future of Campbell -- the world's top soup maker -- into question. "The prolonged weakness in the U.S. soup category could reignite speculation that the board could explore strategic options for the company, or seek to diversify away from soup," said Janney Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Feeney. A Campbell spokesman declined to say whether the board was considering such moves but noted that Campbell has said in the past that it wanted to increase its focus on its drinks and snacks businesses, which include V8 juices and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers. Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo said it was not entirely clear why the soup category has been soft. "We had a recession. People were looking for value and convenience. Meals consumed at home were on the rise. This category should have done better," Russo said. Campbell said deep price cuts by rivals hurt soup sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, which began on August 2. The company, which competes against General Mills Inc's ( GIS.N ) Progresso brand and others, said it now expects to report that overall sales fell 1 percent in the quarter. Analysts on average were expecting first-quarter revenue of $2.24 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, which would have been up 1.7 percent from a year earlier. Whereas Campbell expects earnings to fall 6 percent, analysts were looking for an increase to 91 cents a share, excluding one-time items, from 87 cents a share a year earlier. Standard & Poor's equity analyst Tom Graves said he expects the aggressive discounting to ease later in fiscal 2011, as costs for commodities such as wheat have risen considerably. But he said he is "wary about the strength of the soup category." Graves reiterated his "sell" rating on Campbell shares. Campbell's long-time chief executive, Douglas Conant, plans to step down in July and be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Denise Morrison, former president of Campbell's North American soup, sauces and beverages business. Some analysts have questioned the choice of successor, given the ongoing weakness in soup, despite moves like reducing sodium and overhauling the Chunky soup line. In fiscal 2010, the U.S. soup, sauces and beverages unit generated $3.7 billion in sales, or about 48 percent of the company's total. The unit also includes Prego pasta sauces and V8 juice drinks. U.S. soup sales fell 4 percent. For fiscal 2011, Campbell said it now expects earnings to rise 2 percent to 4 percent, down from its prior forecast of a 5 percent to 7 percent increase. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of $2.64 per share, up 6.9 percent from a year earlier, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Campbell will report first-quarter earnings on November 23. Campbell's shares fell $1.34, or 3.7 percent, to $34.71 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Maureen Bavdek and Steve Orlofsky)
