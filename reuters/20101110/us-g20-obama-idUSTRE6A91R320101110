 SEOUL  (Reuters) - A strong economy is the most important contribution the United States can make to the global recovery, President Barack Obama told the G20 in a letter obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. 

 Obama, who arrived in Seoul for the Group of 20 leaders summit Wednesday evening, called on his G20 counterparts to "do their part" to reduce imbalances between export powerhouses and heavily indebted importers. "No one country can achieve our joint objective of a strong, sustainable, and balanced recovery on its own," Obama said in the letter, which was sent on Tuesday.
