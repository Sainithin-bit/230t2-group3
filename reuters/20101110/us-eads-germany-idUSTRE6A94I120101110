 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Aircraft manufacturer Airbus ( EAD.PA ) has not had any orders canceled since engine problems arose with the A380 jumbo jet last week, the company's Chief Executive Tom Enders said on Wednesday. 

 Speaking in Berlin, Enders said he was confident that the builder of the jet's engines, Rolls Royce ( RR.L ), would ensure there would be no repeat of the problems. There is no reason to doubt the safety of the aeroplane, he added. "We haven't had any orders called off, there isn't any kind of discussion about cancellations going on," Enders said after meeting German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle. "There is no reason to doubt the safety of the aircraft." Nevertheless, Enders described the problems as a "serious incident," adding that Airbus wanted to help airlines "as far as possible with engines that we have at our disposal." Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) said on Wednesday it would replace engines on three of its A380 planes after finding oil stains on them, nearly a week after Australia's Qantas ( QAN.AX ) grounded its A380 fleet over an engine failure. Qantas's six A380s have been grounded since Thursday, when a Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) engine partly disintegrated mid-flight, forcing the fully laden A380 to make an emergency landing in the biggest incident to date for the world's largest passenger jet. Probes into that incident have focused on oil leaks inside the Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines, the same model used to power Singapore Airlines' and German Lufthansa's ( LHAG.DE ) A380 fleet. Lufthansa said on Wednesday its A380 flights were on schedule. Enders said Rolls-Royce was working hard to investigate what exactly had happened. "I have every confidence in Rolls-Royce that they will quickly be able to analyze what happened and take measures relating to the production of these engines which will prevent such incidents occurring any more," Enders said.
