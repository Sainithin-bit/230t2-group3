 SEOUL  (Reuters) - A final statement to be released at the end of the Group of 20 summit will not comment on any individual currency, an Indian official close to the negotiations said on Wednesday. 

 Germany and several other nations have hit out at a U.S. plan to consider limiting current account imbalances, while some countries, notably China, have come in for criticism for intervening in currency markets to get a trade advantage. The Indian official who has knowledge of the talks also said many of the deputies negotiating the communique agreed that the yuan could not be singled out for criticism. "Many of us think you can not reduce all the problems just to a particular currency," the official, who declined to be named, said. The official said that after a heated debate, discussion on current account imbalances had gained pace. "The big thing is mutual assessment process -- how do you coordinate policies to rebalance global demand," the official said. (Reporting by  Krittivas Mukherjee ; Editing by  Tomasz Janowski )
