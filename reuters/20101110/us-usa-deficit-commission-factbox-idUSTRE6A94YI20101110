 (Reuters) - The heads of a commission appointed by President Barack Obama to propose ways to fix the growing U.S. financial debt problem on Wednesday presented some of their ideas for tax policy. 

 The proposals come from the two co-chairs only, and have been criticized by several panel members already. Fourteen of 18 members need to agree for the proposals to make it to a congressional vote -- which many believe is unlikely. While American corporations will back cutting the corporate tax rate, there would be heavy lobbying by them and other special interests against proposals such as taxing dividends and capital gains as income, and trimming deductions for home mortgages. Here are three big options proposed and other tax elements. * OPTION 1-"The Zero Plan" Eliminate most or all tax preferences to cut the corporate tax rate as low as 26 percent. Tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income rates. They are currently taxed at 15 percent. Include potential change to a "territorial" corporate tax system where companies would be taxed only within the United States. The United States now has a "worldwide" tax system, which taxes companies when income is earned abroad, providing tax credits to avoid double taxation. * OPTION 2 -"Wyden-Gregg style reform" This is based on a bill offered earlier this year by Republican Senator Judd Gregg and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden that narrows the income tax categories to 15 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent from the current six income groups. It would: Cut the corporate tax rate to 26 percent from the current 35 percent; Cut corporate tax benefits, including a deduction for domestic production and energy tax preferences; Change to a "territorial" system; Limit the mortgage interest deduction to exclude second residences, home equity loans and mortgages over $500,000; Limit charitable deductions with a 2 percent of adjusted gross income floor; and Use savings for deficit reduction. * OPTION 3 - "Tax Reform Trigger" Calls on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committees to enact tax reform by the end of 2012. Gives itemized deductions a "haircut" - including cuts to the employer health exclusion and general business credits. Cuts deductions and exclusions increase over time until tax reform enacted. GAS TAX The report suggests raising the gas tax by 15 cents beginning in 2013 to fund transportation spending. The tax has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since the early 1990s. The Obama administration has refused to consider any hike with the economy struggling, and the incoming chairman of the House of Representatives Transportation Committee has said an increase is off the table.
