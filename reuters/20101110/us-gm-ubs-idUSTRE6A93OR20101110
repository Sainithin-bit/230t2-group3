 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) confirmed on Wednesday that it has dropped one of the proposed underwriters of its initial public offering due to an "unauthorized" e-mail sent by an employee of the bank. 

 While GM did not name the bank in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission, UBS ( UBSN.VX ) was not listed as a proposed underwriter on the GM IPO when the automaker filed terms for its stock offering on November 3. The Swiss bank had been listed as a proposed underwriter as recently as October 29. A senior high-yield research analyst at UBS sent an e-mail discussing GM's valuation the night before GM filed terms for its $13 billion IPO, breaking an SEC rule about not disclosing information about IPOs aside from regulatory filings, sources told Reuters previously. In Wednesday's filing, GM confirmed that an employee of a proposed underwriting bank distributed an unauthorized e-mail message to various potential institutional accounts and that the bank would no longer participate in its stock offering. Representatives for UBS have declined to comment on the matter. GM also said that the company, its selling shareholders including the U.S. Treasury and underwriters, "disclaim all responsibility for the content of the e-mail." "We were not involved in any way in the preparation or distribution of the e-mail by the employee of the previously named proposed underwriter, we had no knowledge of the e-mail until after it was sent, and the e-mail does not reflect our views," GM said in the filing. GM said the e-mail message may constitute a violation of the Securities Act and any potential investor who received the e-mail should not rely upon it in any manner in making a decision whether to purchase its stock. If the e-mail did amount to a violation, some investors in the GM IPO may have the right to seek refunds or damages. "If any liability is asserted, we intend to contest the matter vigorously. We do not believe that we will be subject to any material liability as a result of the distribution of the e-mail," GM said. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ) and Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) are the lead underwriters on the offering, which is expected to be priced on November 17 and trade on November 18. There are 35 underwriters overall. (Reporting by Soyoung Kim and Clare Baldwin; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
