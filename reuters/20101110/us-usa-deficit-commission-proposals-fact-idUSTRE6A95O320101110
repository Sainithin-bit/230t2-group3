 (Reuters) - Leaders of a presidential commission released a draft plan on Wednesday that would close the federal budget deficit, but they got a mixed reception from lawmakers who will need to sign off on any final product. 

 The plan would reduce spending and benefits and overhaul the tax code to reduce the deficit to 2.2 percent of GDP by 2015, a level many economists consider sustainable. The deficit stood at 8.9 percent of the economy in the last fiscal year. Others on the 18-member panel said the proposal was a good starting point and would look at its specific elements as they seek to produce a final plan by December 1. In order to guarantee a vote in Congress, at least 14 members of the bipartisan commission must agree on a final product. Following is a summary of the proposal put forward by the commission's co-chairmen, former Republican Senator Alan Simpson and former Democratic White House official Erskine Bowles: SPENDING CUTS - Would reduce discretionary spending (programs like defense and law enforcement that are set by Congress each year) in fiscal 2012 to 2010 levels; impose 1 percent cuts in each of the next three fiscal years - In 2015, defense spending would be $100 billion lower and nondefense spending also $100 billion lower than envisioned in the White House's current budget scenario - Eventually bring government spending down to 21 percent of gross domestic product, from its current level of 24 percent of the economy - Automatic cuts would take effect at the end of each year if Congress exceeds spending caps - Set up bipartisan committee to eliminate outdated and inefficient programs - Stretch out budget cycle over two years - Sample cuts include: freeze pay for federal workers; reduce overseas military bases by one-third; cut federal workforce by 10 percent; slow growth of foreign aid OVERHAUL TAX CODE - Would eliminate all of the $1.1 trillion exemptions currently in the tax code, such as the mortgage-interest deduction and the earned-income tax credit - Lower and simplify individual income-tax rates: 8 percent for those with annual incomes below $70,000; 14 percent for those with incomes up to $210,000; and 23 percent for incomes above that level - Lower corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 26 percent - Treat dividends and capital gains as ordinary income - Set aside $80 billion for deficit reduction - Gradually raise gas tax by 15 cents starting in 2013 to pay for transportation spending - Abolish the alternative minimum tax REDUCE HEALTH CARE COSTS - Would pay doctors and other providers less for seeing patients under government programs like Medicare and Medicaid - Cap damages in malpractice suits - Require Medicare participants to pay more costs themselves - Require lower costs for brand-name drugs covered by government programs - Expand successful cost-containment programs - Strengthen independent oversight board - If costs grow more than 1 percent faster than the economy after 2020, require president to propose further cost cuts or a robust public health insurance option OTHER SAVINGS - Would reduce farm subsidies by $3 billion per year - Revamp consumer price index, used to calculate benefit increases, to better reflect actual rate of inflation - Increase employee contributions to government retirement programs - Postpone military retirement programs and make them take effect after age 60 SOCIAL SECURITY - Would revamp the retirement program to ensure its long-term stability, but separately from the deficit reduction effort - Add minimum benefits for poorest retirees - Increase benefits for older retirees - Require more affluent earners to pay more - Raise the retirement age to 68 in 2050 and 69 in 2075 - Exempt those who work physically demanding jobs; allow them to retire at 62 (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Xavier Briand )
