 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Global regulators have yet to draw up lists of banks judged "too big to fail," people close to the G20's taskforce on financial regulation said on Wednesday. 

 The Financial Times said most big Asian banks were to be exempt from G20 proposals on "systemically important financial institutions" due to a two-tier system of classifying such banks. The FT said big Asian banks would likely be placed on a list of domestically focused institutions rather than one of global banks whose failure would pose a risk to the world financial system and should be subject to the most exacting rules. The report sent Japanese bank stocks higher after the FT cited someone briefed on the G20 agenda as saying that Japan's top three banks could be put on the domestic-focused list. But people close to the Financial Stability Board, which is tasked by the G20 with implementing its regulatory pledges, said that they had not decided which institutions would be classified as "systemically important financial institutions" (SIFIs). "There are no two lists," said one official close to the FSB. They added that additional loss absorbency measures would be applied to all systemically important financial institutions -- whether they were globally interconnected or not -- but that they would apply "initially" to global SIFIs in particular. "It's premature to say anything about the institutions identified and their number," the official said. The FT cited a list of banks it said was on the FSB's original list of "too big to fail" banks but officials said this referred to an old list drawn up the Financial Stability Forum, the FSB's predecessor, to determine which banks should be subject to supervision by international colleges. "It's nothing to do with the SIFI project," one official said. (Reporting by Rachel Armstrong; Editing by  Alex Richardson )
