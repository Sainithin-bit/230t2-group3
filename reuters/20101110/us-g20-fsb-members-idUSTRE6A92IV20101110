Will also implement the G20's regulatory pledges, and present recommendations on "systemically important financial institutions" or SIFIs -- a reference to the world's 30 or so biggest banks whose failure could destabilize the global financial system. -- Local regulators required to make sure big lenders have a 'living will', or plan showing how they would be wound up without causing broader disruption to markets. -- The body's profile has risen under Mario Draghi's leadership.
