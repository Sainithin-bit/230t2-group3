 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bernie Madoff's tiny bull is up for sale. 

 A miniature bronze statue and symbol of Wall Street optimism that once belonged the former financial adviser is among the 400 items U.S. Marshals are auctioning on Saturday to help compensate the convicted swindler's victims. Made in Italy in 1927, the piece is 5.5 inches long and 2.75 inches tall -- seemingly modest for a man who promised investors consistently high returns at extraordinary levels above the market but instead pocketed from them billions of dollars. He pleaded guilty last year and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. A previous auction of his personal property raised $1 million. U.S. Marshals displayed an array of jewelry, furniture, antiques, clothing and other personal effects on Wednesday ahead of Saturday's auction in Brooklyn and simultaneous online bidding. A 10.54-karat diamond engagement ring that once belonged to wife Ruth Madoff and a pair of black velveteen slippers embroidered with Bernie's initials will also go on sale, along with a 1917 Steinway grand piano and 15 luxury watches. The bronze bull was one of several sculptures including miniature busts of Plato and Aristotle and twin marble lions. Among the collectibles are a set of 120 rare postage stamps and 247 rare coins and banknotes from around the globe. Proceeds from the auction will go to the Department of Justice's Asset Forfeiture Fund, which is used to compensate the victims of Madoff's multibillion-dollar Ponzi scheme.
