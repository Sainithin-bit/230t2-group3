 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The leaders of a U.S. deficit-reduction commission on Wednesday urged limits to the popular Medicare health insurance program, smaller payments to drugmakers and more power for a health cost-control board. 

 The draft proposals called for increasing rebates that drugmakers provide to the government and lowering payments to doctors. Seniors also could pay a higher proportion of Medicare costs. The proposals were likely to be unpopular with companies across the healthcare sector and with seniors who widely favor Medicare coverage. The draft proposals were portrayed as achieving $4 trillion in deficit reduction through 2020, but they got a mixed reception from other commission members. A final report from the panel is due December 1. One idea suggested strengthening the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB), a panel set up by the healthcare reform law to rein in Medicare costs if Congress fails to act on its own. The panel is set to begin work in 2015 but drugmakers are fighting to eliminate it before then. Other cost-reduction pilot programs should be expanded by 2015, according to the proposals from Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, co-chairmen of the presidential commission. They also called for accelerating the phase-in of payment cuts to private insurers who provide Medicare health plans. In addition, the deficit-reduction plan calls for medical malpractice reforms that "pay lawyers less and reduce defensive medicine." Republicans have pushed for malpractice changes for years.
