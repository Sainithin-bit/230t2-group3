 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A panel of 51 economists left their forecast for U.S. growth for this year and next unchanged for a third consecutive month, according to a survey on Wednesday. 

 The Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey also said that "not until the second half of next year is the economy expected to be expanding fast enough to generate job growth of sufficient size to initiate the beginning of a sustained decline in the rate of unemployment." The stable growth outlook suggests that a significant majority of the panelists had factored into their forecasts what they assume will be the economic consequences of additional quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve and the Republicans' majority in the House. The survey, which was conducted November 4-5, said for all of 2010, real gross domestic product is forecast to expand 2.7 percent on a year-to-year basis, unchanged from the previous month. The forecast for real GDP growth in 2011 also stayed the same at 2.5 percent. Panelists were equally split on whether the elections or the outcome of the Fed's actions would have the greater impact on GDP. Both the elections and the Fed announcement took place before the survey was conducted. About 61 percent of the economists surveyed said home prices will be lower in June of next year than they are now. (Reporting by  Nancy Waitz ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
