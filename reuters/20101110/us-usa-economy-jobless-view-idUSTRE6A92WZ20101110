 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. claims for unemployment benefits fell more than expected and a moving average fell to a two-year low, pointing to some relief in the weak jobs market. 

 TRADE DEFICIT The U.S. trade deficit narrowed more than expected in September, despite near record imports from China, as a weak U.S. dollar helped American exports grow for the third consecutive month. EXPORT/IMPORT PRICES: A jump in petroleum import prices pushed October U.S. import prices to the biggest gain since April, but the rise was less than forecast, a government report showed on Wednesday. KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 435,000 in the week to November 6 from a revised 459,000, the Labor Department said. Analysts were expecting claims to slip to 450,000 from an initially reported 457,000. * The four-week moving average of claims, considered a better measure of underlying market trends, eased to 446,500, the lowest since September 2008. * The monthly trade gap totaled $44.0 billion, down from a revised estimate of $46.5 billion in August. Wall Street analysts had expected the deficit to narrow to about $45.5 billion. * U.S. exports rose a bare 0.3 percent to $154.1 billion. But that still was the highest since the depths of the financial crisis in August 2008, and included record services exports of $46.5 billion. COMMENTS: DAVID ADER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGY, CRT CAPITAL GROUP, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "There is a mix of data here with the inflation components rather friendly and the real components rather unfriendly. First, claims fell more than expected with no special factors mentioned so an improving trend is in place. "Second, the narrower deficit is a good number for Q3 GDP but we have that so it is something of a moot point. We do note the drop in imports, too, so perhaps less domestic demand or, better, replacement with domestic sources. "Third, import price ex-fuels/petroleum continue to come in friendly with the year-over-year gain at 2.5 percent the best since early this year. Thus no immediate signs of import inflation despite weaker dollar and firmer commodities. "The market is a bit better post this data which either means they wash out as neutral or we have our sights on bigger issues, like the auction and Fed QE details. The curve is steady as well so long sector specific performance to note." HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF HUGH JOHNSON ADVISORS LLC, ALBANY, NEW YORK: "Claims numbers were good, they tend to be fairly volatile from week to week and are very tough to forecast but these numbers are better than expected. In addition to that, the 4-week moving average which is more useful in telling what claims are doing declined and that suggests the gains that we saw in employment for the month of October will continue. Claims are very consistent with the view that the economy is expanding as measured by employment and should continue to do so. So good news. "The claims number to be honest is interesting but it's actually not as important, in my view, as the trade numbers and the import price numbers. The reason I say those numbers are of greater importance is the real question for the markets is - will the decline in the dollar work? Will it lead to an increase in exports and lead to higher import price driven inflation? And the answer to both those of those questions based on the numbers today is yes. So we saw an increase in exports, an increase in import prices excluding fuels. Both suggest the declines in the dollar might be beginning to weave its magic, or have a positive impact, on imports and inflation. Those are both important numbers and as important as the claims numbers. "The only thing that surprises me is that the futures have not had a more positive response because this is good news." PAUL BALLEW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIONWIDE, COLUMBUS, OHIO: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "That's consistent with what we saw in last week's monthly employment report. It shows a slow improvement in the labor market but there is still a long way to go. "We expect the weekly jobless claims to consistently run below 300,000 in the first half of 2011 if we see payroll gains of 150,000 a monthly basis." TRADE BALANCE: "You are getting this J-curve effect with the depreciation of the dollar. The big question is whether we are going to see exports beyond agricultural sector." JAY SUSKIND, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT DUNCAN-WILLIAMS, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY "Jobless looks a little better than expected. The trend seems to be getting better, though certainly there's way too many as far as unemployed out there. But the trend seems to be coming down, which is the right direction, even as the absolute numbers are still bad. But its certainly more positive, and it adds into the effect of all the other economic numbers to continue the debate about QE2 and the necessity of it. Better economic numbers could decrease the amount of needed QE2, but my bet is that the Fed will continue as planned just to make sure. But numbers like this will make some people want the Fed to take its foot off the gas pedal. "The dollar is another big force today, and one thing we need to pay attention to is the impact its having on commodities, and how that's impacting people's ability to spend. Inflation at the core may not be higher, but when food and energy prices are through the roof, that won't be good for the economy."
