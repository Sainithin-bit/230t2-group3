 (Reuters) - Here is a look back at Greece's financial crisis, after euro zone finance ministers sealed a 130-billion-euro ($172 billion) bailout for Greece on Tuesday to avert a chaotic default. 
 May 2, 2010 - Prime Minister George Papandreou says he has sealed a bailout deal with the EU and IMF in return for extra budget cuts of 30 billion euros ($39 billion) over three years.

May 10 - Global policymakers install an emergency safety net worth about $1 trillion to bolster international financial markets and prevent the crisis from damaging the euro.
