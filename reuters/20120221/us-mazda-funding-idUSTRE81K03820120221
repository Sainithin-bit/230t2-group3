 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp ( 7261.T ) plans to raise 170 billion yen ($2.1 billion) in funds, 100 billion yen of which will be through a new share issue, public broadcaster NHK said on Tuesday. 
 Battered by the strength in the yen and wanting to invest in a new plant in Mexico, the automaker will receive 70 billion yen through subordinated loans from banks, including Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ( 8316.T ) and the Development Bank of Japan, NHK said. NHK did not say whether the capital raising would be via an issue of common or preferred stock. A Mazda spokesman said the company was checking on the report.
