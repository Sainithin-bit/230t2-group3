 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) Chief Executive Glenn Murphy said on Thursday that he saw "no signs of improvement in the psyche of the American consumer." 

 Murphy, speaking to analysts after first-quarter results were announced, said customers were responding positively to new merchandise that focused on color and classic styles at Gap stores. But "adjustments" might need to be made at Banana Republic stores, he said, due to intense promotions by rivals. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
