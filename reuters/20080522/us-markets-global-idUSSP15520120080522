 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil stormed to a new record above $135 a barrel, knocking world stocks to a one-month low on Thursday as concerns grew that rising raw material costs will hit corporates and consumers at a time of an economic slowdown. 

 U.S. crude rose as high as $135.09 a barrel -- bringing its gains since early April to more than 30 percent -- following a sharp drop in U.S. oil stocks. The surge in oil prices has set off concerns over a toxic mix of rising prices and a deeper slowdown, which would tie the hands of central banks keen to tackle the effect of the credit crisis with easier monetary policy. The Federal Reserve cut its 2008 growth forecast on Wednesday but lifted its inflation forecast, suggesting it had finished cutting interest rates after slashing them to 2 percent last month. "The current oil prices and the fact the Fed basically admitted they are going to pause are not good news for stocks," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. The FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.2 percent while MSCI world equity index dropped 0.15 percent. It hit a 4-month high on Monday, rising close to the end-2007 level, which represents a break-even point for investors. U.S. stock futures were pointing to a higher open on Wall Street which would feature first-quarter results from Gap ( GPS.N ). COMMODITY SUPERCYCLE Gold, seen as a traditional inflation hedge, had risen as high as $935.30 before yielding to pressures from investors wishing to cash in on the rally. "Day by day, commodities move higher and higher," Lehman Brothers said in a note to clients. "This macro Supercycle exhibits strong evidence of persistent stamina... The asset allocation move, more like growing stampede, into commodities by institutional and individual investors has hardly concluded." The dollar had fallen beyond $1.58 per euro for the first time in a month before recovering, while it also hit a one-month low against a basket of six major currencies. Analysts are in two minds about the effect of high oil prices on the dollar. "It can lead to more diversification from central banks and lead them to adjust their reserves out of dollars," said Chris Turner, head of FX strategy at ING. "But stagflation... can also turn the focus of the Fed to deprioritize growth and focus on inflation, increasing the prospects of higher rates and a dollar supportive yield curve." UK and euro zone government bonds fell after data showing UK retail sales fell less than expected in April pointed to a resilience of British consumers. The June Bund future was down 0.2 percent. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 4 basis points while emerging stocks fell 0.7 percent, after setting a 2008 high earlier this week.
