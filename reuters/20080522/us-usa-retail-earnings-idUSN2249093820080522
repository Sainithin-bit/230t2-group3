 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel and jewelry retailers surprised Wall Street with better-than-expected earnings on Thursday as cost-cutting measures and inventory controls offset the impact of the weak economy. 

 The Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX was up nearly 1 percent in afternoon trade, reversing course after four straight days of losses sparked by a record surge in oil prices that cost the retail index 6 percent. Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ), New York & Co Inc ( NWY.N ) and Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ), whose shares have all lost more than 30 percent over the last year, saw sizable market gains on Thursday, after reporting better-than-expected quarterly profit in a weak environment. "Sales growth has been very weak and I suspect will continue to be weak because of all the problems associated with the consumer," said Carl Steidtmann, chief economist at Deloitte Research. "But retailers have actually done a pretty good job managing the things they can manage." Children's Place, whose shares jumped as much as 18 percent to a nine-month high, said its operating margin improved 20 basis points in the first quarter and that its plan to turn around its business by updating merchandise, cutting costs, and exiting the Disney Store business was paying off. New York & Co and Limited also cited better margins due to efforts to reduce inventory and manage costs. Keeping inventory levels slim, in line with lower consumer demand, means chains can avoid heavy discounting necessary to move unsold merchandise. AnnTaylor Stores Corp ( ANN.N ) has been working to improve its store environments and marketing messages. Its profit topped the average Wall Street estimate by a penny, but its stock fell after Chief Executive Kay Krill said on a conference call that consumers seemed to be needing broader promotions to make them spend. That, coupled with a need to spend more on marketing to these cash-strapped consumers, led the apparel retailer to give a profit forecast for the current quarter that largely trailed Wall Street estimates. AnnTaylor reaffirmed its full-year outlook. Inventory and margin control will be the hallmarks of good management this year, according to Eric Beder, a retail analyst at Brean Murray, Carret & Co. "This year you'll see who the good retailers are, in terms of how they manage their business," Beder said, praising chains that took steps to manage their margins quickly. Despite a 460-basis-point reduction in gross margin that led Zale Corp ( ZLC.N ) to report a deeper quarterly loss, the jeweler's shares jumped 15 percent after it said a program to liquidate a large portion of inventory exceeded expectations. Zale shares have lost about 32.5 percent over the last year. NOT OVER YET Howard Davidowitz, chairman of New York-based retail consulting firm Davidowitz & Associates, said he thought the overall retail results looked "pretty bad," and attributed some of Thursday's rally to low valuations and the fact that many stock buyers have been burned by investments in financial stocks and are looking for refuge in retail shares. "Investors have been so burned by these highly leveraged investment banks, they're looking to retailers for understandable balance sheets and big cash flow. The money is on the sidelines and they can't wait to get in." But he cautioned that issues like soaring gasoline prices and the housing market slump persist. "If the consumer starts saving, and I believe they will out of fear, that will decimate retail," he said. Yet the second half of the year should bring retailers easier comparisons with last year, since the back half of 2007 was when many of their businesses began to suffer, according to Standard & Poor's analyst Marie Driscoll. "Unless the economy worsens, there could be surprises on the upside" in earnings, Driscoll said. Children's Place shares were up $3.63 at $31.98 on the Nasdaq in afternoon trade, while Zale was up $2.62 at $21.26, Limited shares were up 56 cents at $18.87 and AnnTaylor shares were down 17 cents at $26.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.
