 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) on Thursday nominated nine of its 10 existing directors for re-election to the company's board, setting the stage for a showdown with dissident shareholders at its annual shareholder meeting. 

 Yahoo postponed its annual meeting from July 3 and said it expected to hold it at the end of July. The Internet media company also disclosed in a regulatory filing that shareholders other than billionaire investor Carl Icahn plan to nominate candidates to its board. Two individual shareholders other than Icahn have informed the company they plan to nominate themselves to the board, and another shareholder has notified Yahoo of plans to nominate an alternate slate of nine directors, not including himself, according to a filing. Yahoo said it does not believe these shareholders had complied with its company bylaws. It also said it does not believe electing Icahn's board nominees was in the best of stockholders. Icahn, who recently amassed 10 million Yahoo shares and options to buy another 49 million, launched a proxy campaign last week to replace Yahoo's board with directors with those who would reopen talks with Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ). Microsoft walked away from its sweetened $47.5 billion offer for Yahoo earlier this month. Yahoo also said Edward Kozel, one of its 10 directors, had resigned from the board. Following Kozel's resignation, Yahoo reduced the size of board's size to nine members, the company said in a separate filing. Kozel, in a letter to Yahoo, said he had intended to leave the board in February to spend more time with his family, but stayed on after Microsoft made an unsolicited proposal to buy the Internet company, according to the filing. The new record date for filing of stockholder proposals is close of business on June 3, Yahoo said. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
