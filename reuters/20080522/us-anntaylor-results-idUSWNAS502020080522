 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Women's clothing retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corp ( ANN.N ) reported lower quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by restructuring costs. 

 Net income fell to $25.9 million, or 43 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on May 3 from $31.5 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding costs from the company's restructuring, the operator of the Ann Taylor and Ann Taylor LOFT chains earned 47 cents per share. Earlier this month, AnnTaylor said operating earnings for the quarter would range from 45 cents to 47 cents per share. That surprised Wall Street analysts, who on average had expected 36 cents, with estimates ranging from 35 cents to 40 cents. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
