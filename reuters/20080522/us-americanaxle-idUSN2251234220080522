 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Union workers at an American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ) plant in Three Rivers, Michigan, voted overwhelmingly to ratify a contract to end a nearly three-month strike by the United Auto Workers, a union official said on Thursday. 

 About 80 percent of the workers represented by UAW Local 2093, who voted supported ratification of the contract and nearly all of the roughly 800 workers at the plant cast ballots, local bargaining chairman David Morris said. American Axle and the UAW reached the tentative agreement last week. UAW Local 2093 held its vote on Monday and had said it endorsed the agreement, but withheld the total vote until the last of the local units completed voting on Thursday.
