 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice has requested information from Sony BMG and Universal Music Group about their talks to launch an online music subscription service, said a record company executive on Thursday. 

 The person, who wished to remain unnamed, said both record companies had received letters from the Justice Department asking questions about their plans for a site to be called Total Music, which would help the labels reduce the leverage that Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) wields in the digital music market with its popular iTunes service. A spokesman for Sony BMG, a joint venture between Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) and Bertelsmann AG ( BTGGg.F ), was unavailable to comment. While Universal, owned by French media giant Vivendi( VIV.PA ), declined comment. (Reporting by  Sue Zeidler ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
