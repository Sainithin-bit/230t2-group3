 CAPE TOWN  (Reuters) - President Thabo Mbeki said on Friday South Africa could overcome in a "relatively short period" a power supply crisis that has hurt the mining industry and raised concern among foreign investors. 

 In a state of the nation address to parliament, Mbeki said his government would maintain its fiscal policies to support continued economic growth. Below is reaction from politicians, analysts and others: JACOB ZUMA, PRESIDENT RULING ANC "I think the speech was generally very good. I think the president was able to indicate the progress of government very clearly as to what it is that we need to emphasize. I think there is adequate energy and commitment from the ANC, from government generally. There is no doubt about that. What the president put across here is what we are all supporting." I think the president ... addressed a number of issues of concern ... I think he was very frank ... I don't think he could have done more than that ... On the issue for example of energy he talked about what Eskom and government is doing." SANDRA BOTHA, LEADER OF OPPOSITION DEMOCRATIC ALLIANCE IN  PARLIAMENT "I'm very disappointed. The president had an opportunity to give us hope, to give us leadership and to inspire us because the nation in fact is in a crisis and there is a state of anxiety wherever you go and none of these issues were addressed. What we got is a kind of business as usual approach from the president, something we've seen for the past eight years. As far as the energy crisis is concerned, what we needed to have seen is somebody to have taken direct responsibility and to be held accountable." JUDITH FEBRUARY, ANALYST, IDASA POLICY THINK-TANK "He seemed to say on the electricity front 'There is a problem. We acknowledge we've not always planned properly'. That's a huge concession from President Mbeki." CARMEN NEL, ECONOMIST, MERRILL LYNCH "It is interesting that the government has decided to give Eskom assistance as early as this, but we don't think that it will take the pressure off future tariff increases. So there will still be some inflationary impact."
