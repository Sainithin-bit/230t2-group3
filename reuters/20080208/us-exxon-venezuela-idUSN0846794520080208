 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuela said on Friday its oil supplies, cash flow and operations are unaffected by a court order favoring Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) that freezes up to $12 billion of the major U.S. oil supplier's energy assets abroad. 

 Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez said Venezuela would introduce in the next week a legal response to the rulings, which were won by the world's largest oil company in its fight for compensation for a project nationalized last year. Ramirez criticized Exxon for its actions. He accused it of breaking the terms of arbitration proceedings on the dispute over an oil project in the massive Orinoco belt and of seeking to destabilize the OPEC nation's state oil company by creating doubt over its financial health. The Exxon move is the boldest challenge yet by an international oil major against any of the governments around the world that have moved to increase their control on natural resources as energy and commodity prices have soared.
