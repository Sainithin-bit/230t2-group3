 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The broader U.S. stock market fell on Friday as renewed worries about the credit market sparked a wave of selling in financial shares, but a rally in beaten-down technology shares led the Nasdaq higher. 

 The credit market fears drove safe-haven buying of U.S. government bonds, while the Dow Jones industrial average ended its worst week in nearly five years. Concerns about the precarious state of the U.S. economy, highlighted by remarks late on Thursday by a Federal Reserve official who said she was "not confident" a recession could be avoided this year, added to the rally in U.S. Treasury debt prices, which recovered from their worst rout in four years. U.S. oil prices rose more than 4 percent, lifted by supply concerns raised by Exxon Mobil Corp's ( XOM.N ) dispute with Venezuela, as well as a forecast for colder weather in the U.S. Northeast and output uncertainty in Nigeria. "There is that fear angle still out there," said David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and trading at the Williams Capital Group in New York. "Add to that the fear of recession and that is what is helping to give Treasuries a better bid here." In another sign of nervousness in the market, European credit spread indexes widened to record intraday levels amid rumors that a French bank or a fund was liquidating collateralized debt obligations. Financial shares in Europe also fell on the credit worries, but gains in technology and mining shares drove European markets to close higher. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended down 66.25 points, or 0.54 percent, at 12,180.75, according to preliminary results. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 5.65 points, or 0.42 percent, at 1,331.26, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 11.82 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,304.85. FINANCIALS DOWN, TECH UP Last week's strong rally further unraveled and risk aversion grew on suspicions that banks have more to do to clean up their balance sheets. American Express Co ( AXP.N ) shares led declines on the Dow, while Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) was one of the top drags on the S&P 500. The S&P Financials .GSPF were the worst performer of the 10 major industry groups, losing 2.5 percent. S&P financial index closed down 2.3 percent, with all but nine of its 92 components posting declines. Transportation stocks felt the pinch of rising energy costs, with the Dow Jones transportation average down 0.95 percent. Technology stocks, however, posted gains. Shares of Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), a Dow component, gained 1.56 percent, and shares of iPod maker Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) rose 3.5 percent. "Tech was very oversold and at its lowest extreme, so we expected it to bounce," said Cleveland Rueckert, market analyst at Birinyi Associates Inc in Stamford, Connecticut. "The Nasdaq is (more than) 10 percent below its 50-day moving average, so it's not surprising to see a bounce." In Europe, gains in technology and mining shares propelled the FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  to close 0.5 percent higher at 1,302.36 points, although it lost 3.7 percent on the week. The MSCI main world equity index .MIWD00000PUS was down 0.12 percent. Shares of top cell phone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) rose 3.1 percent and Ericcson ( ERICb.ST ) gained 3.3 percent, but French bank Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) lost 4.1 percent and BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) shed 2 percent. Investor sentiment remained fragile, putting the focus firmly on a weekend meeting of Group of Seven finance chiefs in Tokyo, which will discuss policy responses to the deteriorating economic climate. ECB TO JOIN EASING CAMPAIGN? In currency markets, the dollar slipped on light profit-taking but remained on track for the biggest weekly rise since June 2006 as investors increasingly expect the U.S. growth slowdown to drag on other economies. "It became clear this week that the economic slowdown has been moving East and that Europe is not insulated," said Mark Meadows at Tempus Consulting in Washington D.C. "The euro suddenly came under pressure and it may continue so for a while." The euro edged up 0.2 percent at $1.4504 but was still down almost 2 percent since Monday. Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.1 percent at 107.40 yen. Among G7 nations, central banks in the United States, Britain and Canada have cut interest rates to boost their economies, while the Bank of Japan and the ECB have held steady. The March Bund future was down 11 ticks. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, March U.S. light crude oil settled up 4.15 percent at $91.77 a barrel. The jump in oil prices helped fuel a rise in gold, which gained more than 1 percent.
