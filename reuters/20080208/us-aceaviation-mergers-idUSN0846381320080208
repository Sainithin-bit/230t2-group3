 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - ACE Aviation Holdings ACEa.TO is looking at several ways to wring the most value from its Air Canada ( ACa.TO ) stake, including sales to private equity players and even a linkup with a U.S. airline, ACE's chief executive said on Friday. 

 ACE CEO Robert Milton said he still prefers the original plan of distributing the 75 percent interest in Canada's dominant carrier to shareholders before winding up the holding company structure, rather than buying back the minority. But weakness in Air Canada's stock price has prompted ACE to keep all its options on the table, he said after the shrinking holding company reported a fourth-quarter net income of C$1.13 billion ($1.13 billion). Milton told analysts on a conference call that he has been approached by private equity players and pension funds on ways that Air Canada could join the U.S. airline consolidation. "In my view, as I watch the U.S. airlines scurrying around to merge, anybody that actually ties up with Air Canada gets a unique piece of geography relative to the way the U.S. guys would split it up," Milton said. "So there has been dialogue with the U.S. space looking to change, and I don't think it's inconceivable that Air Canada could be part of it, and I think it would make a lot of sense for a U.S. airline to look at Air Canada." Shares in ACE rose C$1.29, or nearly 6 percent, to C$23.55 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In a second day of big gains, Air Canada jumped C$1.07, or 11 percent, to C$10.73. In recent days, it has been reported that Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) and Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N could announce a merger as early as next week and that United Airlines UAUA.O and Continental Airlines Corp CAL.N are in talks. ACE executives have been planning to wind up the holding company by mid-year, but Milton said international pressure on airline stocks may affect the schedule. He said he had not talked to Ottawa about proposing changes to federal legislation that limits foreign ownership in a Canadian airline to 25 percent. However, it may not be necessary for foreign private equity to get involved, he said. "I think that there's plenty of money in Canada," Milton said. In Ottawa, a spokeswoman for Transport Minister Lawrence Cannon said foreign ownership limits will apply to any redistribution of Air Canada shares. But the most likely outcome for ACE -- which has also been reducing its stake in regional carrier Jazz Air JAZ_u.TO, the Aeroplan AER_u.TO frequent flier program and maintenance unit ACTS -- is a private equity buyout of the holding company's interest as well as the public float, said analyst Jacques Kavafian of Research Capital. ACE's net income in the fourth quarter included C$1.3 billion in pre-tax gains from the sale of ACTS and secondary offerings of Jazz and Aeroplan. Operating income was C$46 million. Last month, it completed a C$1.5 billion share buyback. ($1=$1.00 Canadian) (Reporting by Jeffrey Jones; Editing by Rob Wilson)
