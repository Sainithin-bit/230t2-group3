 (Reuters) - Oil major ExxonMobil Corp obtained court orders in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Netherlands Antilles in late January, freezing $12 billion of the foreign assets of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA. 

 The freeze was sought by Exxon as a means of guaranteeing payment from PDVSA in the event it wins an arbitration case brought over the nationalization of Exxon's stake in Cerro Negro, a Venezuelan heavy oil project. PDVSA claims to have $107 billion in assets worldwide.
