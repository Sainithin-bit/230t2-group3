 LONDON  (Reuters) - French utility giant Suez LYOE.PA is among companies mulling an offer for British waste handling company Biffa Plc BIFF.L, which has already agreed to a 1.2 billion pound ($2.34 billion) takeover from a separate group of buyout firms, said sources familiar with the matter. 

 Biffa said on Friday that third parties had approached it, were looking at its books and might improve on the 350 pence per share it had accepted from Montagu Funds, Global Infrastructure Partners ( GE.N ) and UCIL. Suez, which already has UK waste collection operations, is among those parties said the sources, adding the company is unlikely to overpay and could decide to walk away now a deal has been reached with the buyout consortium. Biffa and Suez both declined to comment. (Reporting by  Mathieu Robbins ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
