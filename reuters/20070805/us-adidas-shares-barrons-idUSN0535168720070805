 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Adidas ADSG.DE should see strong growth continue, especially next year when several major sporting events including the Olympics should fuel sales, Barron's said on Sunday. 

 The German sporting goods giant will likely capitalize on next summer's Olympics in Beijing and the European soccer championship in Switzerland and Austria. Adidas should also benefit from British soccer star David Beckham's move to the United States. If Beckham does well for his new team, the Los Angeles Galaxy, Adidas sales in the United States could climb, Barron's said. (Reporting by  Lisa Lee )
