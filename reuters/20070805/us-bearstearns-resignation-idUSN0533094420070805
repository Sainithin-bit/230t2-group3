 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N said on Sunday that Warren Spector has resigned his positions of president and co-chief operating officer, member of the executive committee and member of the board. 

 Bear Stearns said on Friday it is weathering the worst storm in financial markets in more than 20 years after a major rating company warned mortgage credit problems could hurt the investment bank's profits. In a statement, Bear Stearns said that, effective immediately, Alan Schwartz has been named the company's sole president, and Samuel Molinaro will become chief operating officer in addition to chief financial officer. Bear also said that Jeffrey Mayer, co-head of the fixed income division, has been named to the Bear Stearns executive committee.
