 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Liberty Global Inc ( LBTYA.O ) could see its profit and stock rise in coming years as it signs up more customers in Europe, Japan and Latin America, Barron's said on Sunday. 

 Liberty Global, the holding company for media mogul John Malone's non-U.S. cable assets, could particularly benefit from a "triple play" of video, broadband and telephone services that is helping U.S. cable operators gain new subscribers in the United States, Barron's said.
