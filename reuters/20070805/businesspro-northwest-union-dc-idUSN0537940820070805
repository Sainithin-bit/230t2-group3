 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The union representing pilots at 
Northwest Airlines Corp. NWA.N approved a deal that seeks to 
prevent late-month spikes in the airline's flight cancellations 
such as those seen in June and July. 

  Saturday's vote by Northwest Airline Pilots Association 
confirms the tentative accord reached on August 1, said 
Northwest and its pilot union.  The agreement makes contractual changes on several work 
rules pertaining to international flying and settles an 
outstanding grievance. In exchange, Northwest will reinstate 
premium pay of 50 percent for all pilots flying more than 80 
hours a month.  The airline said the pact was "economically neutral" with 
the premium-pay costs offset by the work rule changes and the 
grievance settlement.  The No. 5 U.S. airline suffered the extraordinarily high 
cancellation rates at the end of the last two months, blaming 
the problem on "pilot absenteeism."  The Air Line Pilots Association, however, said absenteeism 
is not the problem. Rather, it said, the cancellations resulted 
from the airline having too few pilots to work the hectic 
summer flying schedule.  Work rules the pilots agreed to during the carrier's 
20-month bankruptcy, which ended in May, often required pilots 
to spend more time in the air.
