 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force on Friday had loads to say about its $35 billion program to build a new fleet of refueling aircraft -- except when it came to the prominent role being played by a European contractor. 

 The Air Force awarded the hotly contested aerial refueling contract to Los Angeles-based Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and its European partner, Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ), in a decision that surprised many who had expected Chicago-based Boeing Co ( BA.N ) to win. But Air Force officials and an Air Force press release referred solely to Northrop Grumman as the contract winner. The Northrop-EADS plane will be based on the Airbus A330 airliner. Only twice during a 25-minute Pentagon press conference was the name EADS mentioned and that was by a reporter. "This is an American tanker. It's flown by American airmen. It has a big American flag on the tail. And every day, it'll be out there saving American lives," Gen. Arthur Lichte, head of the Air Force's Air Mobility Command, said when asked if he expected repercussions over EADS' role in the contract. Boeing, which could challenge the multibillion-dollar contract award, said in a statement that it was disappointed with the decision and would review its options after learning from the Air Force why it lost.
