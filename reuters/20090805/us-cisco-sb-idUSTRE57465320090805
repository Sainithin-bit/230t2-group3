 LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) reported an 18 percent fall in fourth-quarter revenue as customers held back spending on network equipment, but its profit was better than expected. 

 COMMENTARY BRENT BRACELIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES "It looks like they did a little better than we expected on revenue and earnings, but in line with what people were thinking. The key now is guidance. "It certainly suggests we saw a rebound, and that's consistent with what we've been hearing from other component suppliers. So, again, clearly we saw a rebound in the July quarter but now we need to see what their guidance implies. "Will we see a continued, sustainable rebound or was this a seasonal uptick? That's why their guidance is so critical here. "We believe we're in the early stages of a rebound right now. That is our belief based on talking to our contacts."
