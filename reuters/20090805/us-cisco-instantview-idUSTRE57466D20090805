 LOS ANGELES/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc reported an 18 percent fall in fourth-quarter revenue as customers held back spending on network equipment, but its profit was better than expected. 

 COMMENTARY SIMON LEOPOLD, ANALYST, MORGAN KEEGAN "Certainly sales being in line. We'd be worried they'd be a little bit light of Street consensus. "They upsided the pro-forma earnings per share versus expectations, versus our own estimates, so it's presumably coming from better cost controls. "I don't think Cisco is under-investing. We think they are investing in new products. Their R&D budget is still substantial. "It sounds to us like the North American enterprise market has shown some improvement on a sequential basis, not compared to the previous year. Since that sub-segment was one of the first to show the downturn, it's logical to imagine it would be one of the first to show the recovery. With some of that evidence, we're encouraged that we're at the beginning of a recovery. "The turning point is probably this quarter, and you only know that for sure when you're well into it." BRENT BRACELIN, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES "It looks like they did a little better than we expected on revenue and earnings, but in line with what people were thinking. The key now is guidance. "It certainly suggests we saw a rebound, and that's consistent with what we've been hearing from other component suppliers. So, again, clearly we saw a rebound in the July quarter but now we need to see what their guidance implies. "Will we see a continued, sustainable rebound or was this a seasonal uptick? That's why their guidance is so critical here. "We believe we're in the early stages of a rebound right now. That is our belief based on talking to our contacts."
