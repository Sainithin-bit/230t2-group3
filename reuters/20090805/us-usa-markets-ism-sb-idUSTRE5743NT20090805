 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector contracted in July at a faster pace than in June, according to a report released on Wednesday. 

 New orders received by U.S. factories unexpectedly rose in June, government data showed on Wednesday, advancing for a third straight month and bolstering hopes the recession-hit economy was starting to turn the corner. KEY POINTS: ISM SERVICE SECTOR: * The Institute for Supply Management's services index fell to 46.4 last month from 47.0 in June, below economists' median forecast for a rise to 48.0. * The dividing line between growth and contraction is 50. * The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants. FACTORY ORDERS: * The Commerce Department said factory orders climbed 0.4 percent in June after increasing by a revised 1.1 percent in May, previously reported as a 1.2 percent rise. * Economists polled by Reuters had expected factory orders to fall 1.0 percent in June from the prior month. * Excluding transportation items, factory orders surged 2.3 percent in June from May's 0.9 percent advance. S * Shipments of manufactured goods rebounded 1.4 percent in June, breaking 10 straight months of declines, the department said. Shipments fell 0.8 percent in May. COMMENTS: GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The index was a little disappointing. It's better than it was earlier this year, but still shows the service sector is weak. The breakdown of the numbers shows employers are reluctant to hire; the employment component was weaker. We're treading water right now and need more positive signs on spending and revenues to get the service sector moving forward." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures extend losses after weaker-than-expected ISM service sector data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends gains versus euro, falls versus yen.
