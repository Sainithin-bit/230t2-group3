 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone governments are not discussing debt-stricken Greece's departure from the currency bloc, Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the euro zone finance ministers, said on Wednesday. 
 "We've got a 17-member euro zone. Greece's exit is not a working hypothesis for us," Juncker told the European Parliament's economic committee. (Reporting by  Jan Strupczewski ; editing by  Robin Emmott )
