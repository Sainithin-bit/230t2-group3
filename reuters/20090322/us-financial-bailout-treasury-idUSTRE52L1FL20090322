 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department announced on Sunday that Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will hold a briefing on Monday morning on efforts to stabilize the financial system. 

 "Tomorrow, Treasury will announce details of the next component: the Public Private Investment Program, which will invest alongside private investors in funds that will provide a market for the legacy loans and securities that currently burden the financial system" Treasury said in an announcement.
