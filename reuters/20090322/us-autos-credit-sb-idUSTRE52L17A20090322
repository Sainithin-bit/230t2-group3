 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The U.S. auto industry is facing its worst downturn in decades. Industrywide sales for the first two months of 2009 fell nearly 40 percent to their lowest level in 27 years. 

 Auto dealers across the country say this slump, accompanied by the credit crunch that has frozen the market for floorplan financing -- loans to fund their inventory -- threatens to put thousands of dealerships out of business and they have called on U.S. President Barack Obama for help. Below is a selection of facts about U.S. auto dealers in the current recession: * According to estimates from the National Automobile Dealers Association, some 1,200 dealers could go out of business in 2009. That compares with 900 closures in 2008. * According to Sageworks Inc, which compiles information on private companies, private new-car dealerships saw the following in 2008: - a 12.5 percent decline in sales compared with an increase of 2.41 percent in 2007. - Enough inventory for 78.71 days, up 6 percent from 74.05 days in 2007. - Sales per employee of $465,556.38, down 25 percent from $620,571.82 in 2007. - Profit per employee of $349.20, down 92 percent from $4,173.40 in 2007. * According to the NADA the average dealership made a net pretax profit of 1 percent of sales, down from 1.5 percent in 2007. * According to a March 2 letter sent to President Obama by the NADA and two other dealer associations -- the American International Automobile Dealers Association and the National Association of Minority Dealers-- on behalf of more than 19,000 dealerships: - The closure of approximately 1,000 dealerships over the past 12 to 14 months has left more than 50,000 Americans out of work. - The average floorplan loan is approximately $4.9 million. - Nationwide, dealers are collectively at risk for approximately $100 billion in inventory financing.
