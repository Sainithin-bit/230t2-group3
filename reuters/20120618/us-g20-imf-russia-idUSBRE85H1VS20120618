 LOS CABOS, Mexico  (Reuters) - Russia will contribute $10 billion to the International Monetary Fund as part of efforts to boost the fund's firepower, a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. 
 The spokesman also said Russia was concerned by the amount of liquidity being pumped into the global economy, saying it was not a "systemic solution". (Reporting by  Gleb Bryanski , writing by Krista Hughes)
