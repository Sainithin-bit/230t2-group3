 LOS CABOS, Mexico  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Monday a new Greek government had to meet commitments made to international lenders. 
 Speaking to reporters at a Group of 20 leaders' meeting, Merkel said any loosening of agreed reform pledges after Sunday's narrow election victory for Greece's pro-bailout parties would be unacceptable. [ID:nL5E8HI7K9] (Reporting by  Gernot Heller ; Editing by  Kieran Murray )
