 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - AU Optronics ( 2409.TW ), the world's No.4 flat panel maker, said a U.S. trade body had affirmed an earlier ruling that the Taiwanese company did not violate patents owned by Thomson Licensing. 
 The International Trade Commission upheld a preliminary decision that AU did not infringe on any valid claim of patents asserted by Thomson, AU said in a brief statement on Sunday. It did not elaborate. The case, brought by Thomson in 2010, concerned LCD panel display technologies. The company had sought a ban on imports into the U.S. of some AU products. Thomson is a unit of French digital video firm Technicolor ( TCH.PA ), which is restructuring after financial difficulties. (Reporting by  Jonathan Standing )
