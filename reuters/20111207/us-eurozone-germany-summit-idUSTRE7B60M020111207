 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Berlin is increasingly pessimistic about the chances of a deal to solve the euro zone debt crisis at this week's European Union summit, because some governments don't seem to grasp the gravity of the situation, a German government official said on Wednesday. 
 "We get the impression from many conversations in recent days that a lot of the protagonists still have not understood how serious the situation is," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity. (Reporting by  Noah Barkin  and  Annika Breidthardt , writing by Stephen Brown)
