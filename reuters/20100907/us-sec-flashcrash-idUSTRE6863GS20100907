 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator said on Tuesday that the follow-up report on what might have caused the May "flash crash" is expected by the end of September. 

 "Toward the end of the month. That's our goal," Mary Schapiro, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Economic Club of New York luncheon. (Reporting by  Herbert Lash ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
