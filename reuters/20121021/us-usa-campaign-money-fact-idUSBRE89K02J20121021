 (Reuters) - The presidential campaigns and "Super PACs" filed their financial reports for this week showing how much they raised and spent this campaign season, as of September 30. 
 The Federal Election Commission filings also offer a snapshot of who has been donating how much to the "super" political action committees, which operate independently from campaigns and can raise unlimited amounts from individuals, corporations and unions. Below are some highlights of the FEC filings, with raised amounts reflecting total contributions and spent amounts reflecting operating and independent expenditures. The amounts spent and on hand may not add up to the total raised because of rounding, or money transferred from previous campaigns.
