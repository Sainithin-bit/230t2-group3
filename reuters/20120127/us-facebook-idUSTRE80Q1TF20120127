 (Reuters) - Facebook plans to file documents as early as Wednesday for a highly anticipated IPO that will value the world's largest social network at between $75 billion and $100 billion, the Wall Street Journal cited unidentified sources as saying on Friday. 
 Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) is a strong front-runner to be the lead underwriter on what would be one of the largest initial public offerings in U.S. history, the Journal cited its sources as saying. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) is expected to play a significant role in the deal too, the newspaper added. A Facebook spokesman declined to comment. The impending IPO - expected to raise $10 billion - is a prized trophy for investment banks, setting up a fierce competition on Wall Street, particularly between the presumed front-runners Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. Shares of Internet and social-networking companies rose after the news, with LinkedIn Corp ( LNKD.N ) closing 5.9 percent higher at $76.64 and Zynga Inc ( ZNGA.O ) gaining 5.6 percent to $10.05. GSV Capital ( GSVC.O ), an investment firm that owns Facebook shares, jumped 17.8 percent to $17.79. (Reporting by  Alexei Oreskovic  and  Edwin Chan ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz,  Gary Hill )
