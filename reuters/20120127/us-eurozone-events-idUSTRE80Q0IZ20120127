GREECE: POLITICS: -- Talks between Greece and its creditors on a bond swap scheme, dubbed private sector involvement (PSI), have entered their final stretch. Greece hopes to complete talks on the PSI as early as this week. International Institute of Finance bank lobby head Charles Dallara was due to return to Athens on Thursday. -- A deal must be clinched to ensure there is enough time for the debt exchange to be wrapped up and funding by international lenders to be in place before a 14.5 billion euro government bond matures on March 20. -- IMF and EU inspectors in Athens continue high stake talks to flesh out a new bailout program that Greece needs to avert default. They will assess progress on reforms and reducing deficits versus targets set in a bailout program and whether a deal with private bondholders to cut the nation's debt burden will render it sustainable in the long term before freeing up further lending. GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY: -- Athens is expected to continue monthly auctions of 3- and 6-month T-bills in February as it needs to refinance a total of 2.6 billion euros of maturing bills. Monthly T-bill sales are Greece's sole source of market funding. -- February 7 - Auction of 6-month T-bills. -- February 14 - Auction of 3-month T-bills.

The measures, now before parliament, have sparked strikes from taxi drivers. Many other categories affected also plan strikes and protests. -- The government is now in talks with trade unions over reform of the labor market. Monti says he wants to reform a system that offers too much protection to salaried employees in medium-sized and large companies, while offering virtually no rights or protection to growing legions of mostly young people on temporary contracts. Monti aims to present legislation by the middle of February. -- The deregulation plans follow an austerity program already approved by parliament which includes the reintroduction of a housing tax, pension reform and spending cuts. Truck drivers are striking against rising fuel costs caused by a hike in excise duties included in the plan. Their protests have blocked motorways around Italy, halted production at major companies unable to receive supplies, and left shelves half empty in supermarkets. -- A number of relatively successful bond auctions have brought Italy's 10-year bond yields down to around 6 percent from peaks around 7.5 percent near the end of last year. The spread with safer German Bunds has fallen to around 4.2 percent, down sharply from highs around 5.5 percent. POLITICS: -- Monti is heading to an EU leaders' summit on January 30, where he will push for an increase in the size of the European Union's bailout fund.
