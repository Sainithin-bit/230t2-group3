 MOBILE, Alabama  (Reuters) - The Chicago Federal Reserve Bank said on Wednesday its Midwest manufacturing index slipped in August as auto production set back a bit after a strong increase in July. 

 The index fell 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted 80.1 from an upwardly revised 80.4 in July. The July reading was originally reported at 79.7. Compared with a year earlier, Midwest output was down 20.8 percent, worse than the 12-percent national decline. Midwest auto sector production fell by 4.2 percent in August after surging by 16.4 percent in July to meet demand for new vehicles created by the federal government's "cash for clunkers" program. Compared with a year earlier, the region's automotive output was down 29.3 percent. Regional steel output rose by 0.6 percent after rising by 1.9 percent in July. Machinery sector output rose by 0.3 percent in August after falling by 0.6 percent in July, while resource sector output was up 1.3 percent on the month. Two of the five segments of the resource sector -- food and chemicals -- rose while paper, nonmetallic mineral, and wood production decreased. Compared with a year earlier, the region's resource output was down 6.6 percent, against the 5.1-pct national decrease in resource production. The Chicago Fed Midwest Manufacturing Index is a monthly estimate of manufacturing output in the region by major industries. The survey covers the five states that make up the seventh Federal Reserve district: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan and Wisconsin. (Reporting by  Ros Krasny , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
