 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar weakened against most major currencies, pushing up crude oil, gold and other commodity prices on Wednesday, after patchy U.S. manufacturing data pointed to a slow road to recovery for the U.S. economy. 

 An unexpected contraction in Midwest business activity sounded a dour note for the end of a strong quarter for stocks, but oil rose above $69 per barrel, buoyed by a drop in U.S. gasoline inventories and a weaker dollar. The weak U.S. data pushed longer-dated euro zone bond yields to five-month lows but U.S. government debt traded near break-even after U.S. equity markets rebounded to turn higher after midday. A report showing a steeper-than-expected loss in private-sector U.S. jobs in September reinforced the notion that U.S. consumer spending will remain sluggish even as the economy emerges from the worst downtown since the 1930s. "I'm not a believer yet that this is a robust economy," said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Corp in Boston. "What it comes down to is how much of this recovery is going to be sustainable." MacIntosh said one question mark is whether businesses will ramp up production and spur jobs. Without those elements, consumption will remain weak and hamper economic growth. Before 1:30 p.m. (1730 GMT), the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 16.40 points, or 0.17 percent, at 9,758.60. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 0.70 points, or 0.07 percent, at 1,061.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 8.88 points, or 0.42 percent, at 2,132.92. European shares closed lower after the drop in the U.S. business barometer of the Institute for Supply Management-Chicago, which fell to 46.1 from 50.0 in August. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed nearly 0.5 percent lower, dragged down by banks and commodity stocks. "The inclination is not to read too much into the latest (Chicago) report," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Global Banking and Markets in Stamford, Connecticut, citing the report's erratic nature. "Nonetheless, this is a further warning shot that even a modest recovery will not be smooth sailing and is going to reinforce the equity slippage today." The Swiss franc fell against the euro and the dollar, with traders citing talk the Swiss National Bank may have intervened to weaken its country's currency. The SNB declined to comment on the franc's price action. "Net-net, people are selling dollars although we don't know how long it would remain weak," said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets in New York. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.60 percent at 76.663. The euro was up 0.42 percent at $1.4644, and against the yen, the dollar was down 0.46 percent at 89.68 yen. The weak manufacturing data reinforced expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will refrain from raising interest rates any time soon. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 8/32 in price to yield 3.32 percent. U.S. government weekly oil data showed a 1.6 million barrel drop in gasoline inventories, in line with separate figures from the American Petroleum Institute industry group but contrary to analysts' forecast for an increase. Gasoline demand over the past four weeks rose more than 5 percent. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $2.89, or 4.33 percent, to $69.60 per barrel. Copper rose to a one-week high and gold rallied above the $1,000-an-ounce mark, as dollar weakness helped the metal stay on track for its best quarterly performance since early 2008. Spot gold rose $16.40 to $1,007.60 in New York. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  edged up 0.3 percent in cautious trade, while the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was up about 0.7 percent and was set to post a second straight quarterly gain.
