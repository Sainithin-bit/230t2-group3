 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Business activity in the U.S. Midwest failed to return to growth in September as expected, but instead contracted on a decline in production and new orders, a report showed on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer fell to 46.1 in September from 50.0 in August. Economists had forecast the index at 52.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the regional economy. * The employment component of the index inched up to 38.8 in September from 38.7 in August. Prices paid rose to 51.3 from 50.0 and new orders dropped to 46.3 from 52.5. Production dropped to 47.2 from 52.9. COMMENTS: MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "It was a disappointing number. We thought it would be above 50 percent. The index lost ground in September. The new orders component was especially disappointing. Everything else will eventually follow orders and that was the weakest area of the report, dropping 6.2 percentage points. "After seeing this, I'd be much less optimistic about the ISM index (due on Thursday). It opens the possibility that ISM could take a step back as well. We're just starting to get numbers on September now. We're seeing the economy turn, but it's most likely not going to be a vigorous turn. You will have setbacks and the numbers will ebb and flow. That's what the report today is telling us." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "Not very good and the market really just took a dive on it. Don't know why it looks so weak when at least anecdotally we've been hearing that September was a good month economically and a pick up from August. "In any economic recovery you're not going to sell all good economic data, there is going to be a mix. And we have certainly seen other weak, or below expectations, data recently and this is another example of one. But the market certainly doesn't like it and we'll see if this initiates the market correction that everybody seems to be overly anxious for." STEPHEN STANLEY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RBS GREENWICH CAPITAL MARKETS, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It was a little bit disappointing. I'm a little bit surprised -- we find that this generally tends to track the auto sector so that the big improvement that we have seen over the last few months corresponded with the big rebound we saw in auto production over the summer and we weren't seeing the big improvements in auto production in September. "I don't think we are going to change our view on the ISM, we are looking for a continued increase in the ISM. But if the ISM were to stall out or fall back the same way that Chicago did, obviously we would have to think about that long and hard. It would obviously play a role in how we see things playing out over the next few months." MARY ANN HURLEY, VICE-PRESIDENT OF FIXED-INCOME TRADING, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO., SEATTLE: "It definitely looked weak and seems to be indicating that manufacturing, while maybe having found a bottom, seems to be struggling. Bonds are up a little bit on the news but not a lot." CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO/MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "The report magnified the Dow losses and that put a bid to the bond market. "The report is pretty disappointing. The Chicago purchasing managers are saying that the recovery hasn't gained any momentum here. In fact, it seems to be sliding backwards. It has to be seen as a negative report on the economic outlook. Things looked good in August, but not quite as good in September. "Importantly, whenever the Chicago purchasing managers index has a big change like this it tends to provide a better forecast for the national ISM manufacturing number which comes out tomorrow. Some economists might revise their ISM numbers down. The report ties in with what the consumer confidence survey showed yesterday: that jobs were notably harder to get in September. The 'cash for clunkers' program may have boosted the economy temporarily, but now we're back to where we were." CRAIG PECKHAM, EQUITY TRADING STRATEGIST, JEFFERIES & COMPANY, NEW YORK: "I think the main takeaway is that this is a data point that breaks the fairly consistent trend of improving business conditions. "Notable to me were a couple of components which retreated relatively meaningfully: order backlog and new orders. Those elements have an out-sized impact on psychology because they tend to be a little more forward-looking and representative of how U.S. businesses are looking ahead over the next couple of quarters. That goes a way to explain why the market has had a notable about-face after a strong morning rally." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes slumped. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices rallied. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was largely unchanged.
