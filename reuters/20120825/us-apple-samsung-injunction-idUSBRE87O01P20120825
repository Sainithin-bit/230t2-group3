 SAN JOSE, California  (Reuters) - Apple Inc plans to file for a sales injunction against Samsung Electronics within the next seven days, its lawyers said on Friday after a jury handed the U.S. company a major victory in their landmark trial. 
 The judge in the case set a September 20 hearing on the proposed injunction. (Reporting by  Gerry Shih ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
