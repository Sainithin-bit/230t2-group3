 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Real-estate magnate Sam Zell is negotiating a revised offer for publisher and TV broadcaster Tribune Co. TRB.N, according to people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal reported. 

 Details of Zell's revised offer weren't clear, the Journal said, although it is already known that his bid involved use of an employee stock-ownership plan taking on debt to buy some of the newspaper and TV company. Tribune executives have become increasingly concerned about any deal involving a large amount of debt given the weakening business outlook for newspapers. It is possible Zell is trying to find ways of raising the equity portion of his bid and reducing the amount of debt involved, the Journal said. Chicago-based Tribune, which owns 11 daily papers in such cities as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles, is reviewing bids that include buying out the company and spinning off divisions as it tries to satisfy restive investors. It also owns a TV-station group and the Chicago Cubs baseball team.
