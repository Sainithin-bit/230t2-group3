 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - An insider trading case against Citigroup ( C.N ) opens on Monday, with Australian regulators charging the U.S. bank's "Chinese Walls" were breached when it traded shares in a company it knew was a takeover target. 

 The case, closely watched internationally as it deals with how investment banks separate their trading and merger advisory businesses, centers on a chat between two traders over a cigarette break. Authorities allege a brief conversation on a Sydney street led a Citigroup trader to believe his firm was involved in the A$6.3 billion ($5.1 billion) takeover of stevedoring firm Patrick by rival Toll Holdings Ltd. ( TOL.AX ) in 2005. The trader, then in possession of "inside information", sold a parcel of Patrick shares later that day, they say. "This goes to the heart of the investment banking business, where one arm of the bank may be offering advice and another arm of the bank may be trading in securities," Australian Financial Markets Association executive director Duncan Fairweather said. Citigroup, which rejects the charges, says it believes the Australian regulator wants to prevent investment banks from proprietary trading -- trading on the bank's behalf -- from the date they accept an advisory mandate with a client. "We maintain that these issues are most appropriately dealt with by industry consultation," Stephen Roberts, CEO of Citigroup Australia, said late last year. Citigroup Chief Executive Chuck Prince has worked in recent years to reform business practices and ethics after a series of scandals cost the bank billions of dollars and alarmed regulators. Citigroup agreed to pay $4.6 billion to settle lawsuits over its roles in the collapses of Enron Corp. and WorldCom Inc, and was fined over a multi-billion-euro bond trade in 2004. Citigroup Australia advised corporate takeovers worth about $41 billion last year, making it Australia's fourth busiest deal broker, according to data compiler Dealogic. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) has charged Citigroup Australia with two insider trading offences and a series of conflict of interest charges relating to trades in port-cargo handler, Patrick. The charges are civil, not criminal, and no individuals have been charged. Citigroup Australia has said its "Chinese Walls", internal barriers to secure information, were not breached. INSIDER TRADING CHARGES In its statement to the Federal Court in Sydney, ASIC says Citigroup conducted "insider trading" on August 19, 2005 when a trader bought 1.14 million Patrick shares, but later sold Patrick shares after being told by his boss to stop trading in Patrick. On that day, Citigroup corporate investment advisers knew the firm was acting for Toll in relation to the takeover, ASIC says. Malcolm Sinclair, head of equities at Citigroup Australia, knew this "inside information" and, around lunchtime, met Paul Darwell, head of equity derivatives, who was not privy to the information, says ASIC. "Do you know who is buying Patrick's shares?," Sinclair asked Darwell, adding "We may have a problem with that", says  ASIC. Because of intense media and market speculation of a possible takeover of Patrick by Toll, and the fact that Sinclair was "from the private side of the Chinese Wall", ASIC says the comments made Darwell believe Citigroup was acting for Toll on Patrick. Darwell was therefore "in possession of information he knew or ought reasonably have known as inside information", says  ASIC. Later that day, Darwell asked Citigroup trader Andrew Manchee to go for a cigarette break outside their office in Sydney where he told Manchee to stop buying Patrick shares, says ASIC. Manchee had already bought 1.14 million Patrick shares. While Darwell gave no reason, Manchee made the supposition that Citigroup was acting for Toll in the takeover bid for Patrick, says ASIC. ASIC says this was "inside information" and Manchee later sold 192,352 shares in Patrick -- about 17 percent of his stake -- therefore Citigroup had broken insider trading laws. Patrick shares opened at $5.75 that day and closed at $6.45, ASIC said, adding that Citigroup's trading forced the price up. The shares bought by Manchee on August 19 made up 5.7 percent of the volume of Patrick shares traded that day, ASIC said. Toll Holdings declined to comment. CONFLICT OF INTEREST The second insider trading charge says several Citigroup officers had inside information that Citigroup was acting for Toll in relation to the proposed Patrick takeover, yet Citigroup was trading Patrick shares between August 8-22. ASIC has charged Citigroup with breaching its fiduciary duty to Toll "not to place itself in a position where its duty to Toll conflicted with its own self-interest". Citigroup says it informed Toll, well ahead of the takeover bid announcement, that it may conduct proprietary trading and that its advice to Toll was not influenced by any trading. ASIC says it was in Toll's interest that Patrick's share price did not rise on the last day of trading before the bid, but Citigroup's purchase of Patrick shares "directly caused" a hike in the price "contrary to the interests of Toll". Citigroup says ASIC's case was built on supposition. "ASIC appears to have made supposition upon supposition to create these claims," Citigroup's Roberts said. ($1=A$1.24)
