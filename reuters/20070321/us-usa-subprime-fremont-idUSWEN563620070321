 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fremont General Corp. FMT.N, which is trying to sell its unit that makes home loans to people with poor credit histories, said on Wednesday it is selling $4 billion of subprime residential loans. 

 Shares of Fremont rose 16.7 percent in pre-market electronic trading. Santa Monica, California-based Fremont said it has received $950 million in cash from the first sale installment, and its Fremont Investment & Loan unit expects to complete the remaining sales over the next several weeks. It did not identify the buyers. The company said it is selling the loans at a discount, reflecting current difficulties in the subprime market, and expects to realize a $140 million pre-tax loss from the sale. It said it is still operating its commercial real estate lending and residential loan servicing operations, as well as its retail bank. Fremont hired Credit Suisse to help sell Fremont Investment & Loan. Subprime lenders are struggling because of rising delinquencies and defaults, and in many cases because they lowered their underwriting standards too much. Many, including Fremont, have announced plans to cut jobs. Last Friday, Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, a San Diego subprime lender, said it would sell $2.7 billion of loans, sending its shares up 15.6 percent that day. Fremont shares closed Tuesday at $8.78. They rose to $10.25 in pre-market trading. (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
