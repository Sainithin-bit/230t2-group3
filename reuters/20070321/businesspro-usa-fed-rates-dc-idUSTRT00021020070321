 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve held benchmark 
interest rates steady at 5.25 percent on Wednesday for a sixth 
straight meeting, while maintaining a warning on the risk of 
inflation. 

  The widely expected decision by the central bank's Federal 
Open Market Committee keeps the overnight federal funds rate 
target at the level it hit in June after 17 straight 
quarter-percentage point increases.  In a statement outlining its decision, the Fed indicated it 
continues to focus on inflation risks and stands ready to raise 
borrowing costs further if needed.
