 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) posted a 60 percent jump in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, exceeding expectations on blowout results from debt and equity trading. 

 The quarter provided further evidence that Wall Street earnings continue to defy gravity, despite worries among investors that stock market turbulence in late February and problems in subprime mortgages would hurt results. "This was an astounding trading quarter. They must have been beautifully positioned for the subprime meltdown and long volatility when equity markets tumbled," said Sanford Bernstein brokerage analyst Brad Hintz. The investment banking giant said income from continuing operations rose to a record $2.56 billion, or $2.40 a share, in the first quarter ended February 28, from $1.60 billion, or $1.51, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 29 percent to a record $11 billion. The results exceeded the average analyst forecast of $1.88 a share by about 28 percent. Morgan Stanley shares rose 3 percent to $78.40 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Net income was a record $2.67 billion, or $2.51 a share, including a $109 million gain from the sale of UK brokerage Quilter Holdings Ltd. Morgan, which last year acquired subprime lender Saxon Capital and expanded mortgage lending activities, recently extended secured financing to New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), a lender on the brink of bankruptcy. Yet Chief Financial Officer David Sidwell said Morgan Stanley instead "made money" in mortgages during the quarter, while debt and equity trading desks both set records. "We saw good trading opportunities for most of the quarter, and we managed to do well in getting extremely good returns," Sidwell said in an interview. Toward the end of the fiscal first quarter, though, "We felt the markets were getting too frothy, so we brought our risk levels down." Rivals Goldman and Lehman Brothers LEH.N last week reported record first-quarter profits. Goldman said revenues were up in almost every business, though Lehman said woes in U.S. mortgage markets slowed debt trading revenue growth. ON THE MEND Morgan Stanley shares have climbed 26 percent during the past year as Chief Executive John Mack, who took over the bank in June 2005, encouraged traders to take more risks, overhauled the brokerage division and expanded the asset management's arms offerings in hedge funds and private equity. The firm's traders continued to place bigger bets in the quarter, with the average daily value-at-risk rising by half to $90 million from the end of 2006. Yet trading revenue rose at an even faster pace, generating a 40 percent return on equity. Pretax income from Morgan Stanley's investment banking and trading division soared 71 percent to $3.0 billion, boosted by a 30 percent increase in debt trading revenue from last year. Investment banking activity was also strong, with underwriting income up 20 percent to $659 million and advisory fees up 10 percent to $390 million. Morgan Stanley ranks second in global announced mergers and acquisitions this year and its pipelines of pending underwriting and M&A work all increased. At the same time, Mack's efforts to turn around laggard businesses showed progress. The company's brokerage arm boosted revenue by 18 percent to $1.5 billion, or about $748,000 per broker, while client assets rose 11 percent to $690 billion. Asset management, which made a series of hedge fund acquisitions and is launching a private equity business, generated $905 million in revenue, up 28 percent. Discover credit card and payments pretax income fell 22 percent to $372 million, while revenue fell 6 percent to $1.03 billion from last year. But Sidwell said revenue increased excluding a one-time item last year, with transaction volumes and loan receivables up. Discover is scheduled to be spun off as an independent company in the third quarter.
