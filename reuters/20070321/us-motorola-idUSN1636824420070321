 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc MOT.N warned on Wednesday that it would post a first-quarter loss, citing weaker-than-expected sales for its mobile devices business. 

 It also said it would increase its share repurchase program to $7.5 billion and that Chief Financial Officer David Devonshire would retire on April 1. The following are comments from market sources on the news: COMMENTARY: JOHN SLACK, EQUITY ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR INC., CHICAGO "It's certainly disappointing news, though investors didn't expect a great quarter to begin with. It's encouraging that Motorola is not chasing market share as much, and instead appears to be focusing on getting back to profitability. "Many investors have been arguing for a large buyback, so that should provide some support to the stock. "Greg Brown's promotion is a natural move. Motorola may have also wanted fresher blood in the CFO seat." EDWARD SNYDER, ANALYST, CHARTER EQUITY RESEARCH "This is worse than I expected. They're losing a ton of money in phones. "Overall, they're $1.3 billion light in revenue, almost all of that coming from phones. It's a loss of 8 cents compared to an estimate of 20 cents. "They need to release a set of new phones designed for lower prices, they need to design lower priced phones that are designed to be profitable at a much lower price. And that's going to take about a year and half. "We're rating it 'market underperform'. I'd say it could go to $16 or $17." INDER SINGH, PRUDENTIAL ANALYST "Obviously, this is another setback for the company. People were hoping they would start to get their product roadmap together and we would see some progress. "Unless you have a really new compelling product you're going to come out on the short end of it ... If you've wowed people with one product, the bar's been raised, so you have to outperform yourself. "Obviously, you don't do that by painting phones different colors. "The preannouncement today simply reflects the fact they knew they were going to miss their own guidance by a long shot." DAVID KATZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT MATRIX ASSET  ADVISORS IN NEW YORK "Motorola has been well understood as a company-specific problem for some time, and I didn't think we would see a turnaround that fast. "We wouldn't expect this to (hurt the broader stock market)." (Contributions from Jonathan Stempel, Robert MacMillan, Ritsuko Ando and Jennifer Coogan)
