 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch chemical distributor Univar NV UNIV.AS said on Wednesday it had increased the purchase price for U.S.-based rival Chemcentral to $650 million from $600 after a competing offer by Brenntag Holding GmbH. 

 "The revised merger agreement increases the purchase price to $650 million, prohibits Chemcentral from soliciting or considering other proposals to acquire the company, and requires Chemcentral to discontinue further acquisition discussions with Brenntag Holding GmbH," Univar said in a statement. On Monday, Univar said Chemcentral had received a $700 million competing bid from Brenntag. Last week, Univar said it was buying Chemcentral for $600 million in cash, including assumed debt, to expand its U.S. operations. Univar said Chemcentral's board of directors and some of its senior officers have agreed to vote their shares in favor of a merger with Univar and against other proposals. Chemcentral may end the merger agreement with Univar in favor of a competing offer if it pays Univar a termination fee of $22 million, the Dutch company said on Monday. Privately held Chemcentral, based near Chicago, had $1.4 billion in 2006 revenues and distributes specialty and commodity chemicals.
