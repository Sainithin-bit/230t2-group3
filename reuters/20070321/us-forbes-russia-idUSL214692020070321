 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - A Moscow court ruled on Wednesday that Forbes magazine had defamed Russia's richest woman and ordered it to pay her about 110,000 rubles ($4,224) in compensation, Interfax news agency said. 

 The court backed a claim, filed by Yelena Baturina's Inteko company, that a cover story in the Russian edition of the magazine detailing her business interests had damaged the firm's reputation. Construction magnate Baturina has an estimated fortune of $1.1 billion and is married to Moscow's powerful mayor, Yuri Luzhkov. The Forbes story said Baturina was reorganizing her businesses in preparation for her husband's retirement. Baturina, her company and her husband have always strenuously rejected suggestions that her businesses have benefited from Luzhkov's influence.
