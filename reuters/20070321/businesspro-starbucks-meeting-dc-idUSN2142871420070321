 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) Chairman 
Howard Schultz on Wednesday said a memo in which he warned of 
the "commoditization" of the company's brand was not meant to 
be leaked to the media and was not a criticism of the coffee 
shop chain's management. 

  The memo, which Schultz sent to members of senior 
management on February 14, was "not intended in any way to be 
critical of or demonstrate a lack of faith in the management of 
this company," Schultz said during a speech at Starbucks' 
annual meeting in Seattle.  Schultz also reaffirmed the company's growth targets, 
saying it plans to open at least 10,000 stores in the next four 
years and increase net earnings faster than revenue.
