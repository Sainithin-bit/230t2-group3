 (Reuters) - Hancock Fabrics Inc. HKF.N on Wednesday said it voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of U.S. bankruptcy code. 

 Its subsidiaries are also filing for the same relief, the company, which sells fabrics, crafts and sewing machines, said in a statement. Hancock also said it has negotiated a consensual $105 million debtor-in-possession financing arrangement with Wachovia Bank N.A., in which the company will gain additional borrowing capacity necessary to operate successfully under Chapter 11. The company said it is also in the final stages of negotiating an additional loan of up to $17.5 million with another lender. Hancock said it has filed a number of 'First Day Motions' in the bankruptcy court to support its employees, customers, vendors and other stakeholders. On Tuesday, the company had said it was closing over a fourth of its stores and was exploring strategic alternatives. (Reporting by Purwa Khandelwal in Bangalore)
