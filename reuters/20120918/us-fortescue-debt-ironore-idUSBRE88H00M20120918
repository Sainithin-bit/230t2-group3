 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Fortescue Metals Group ( FMG.AX ), the world's No.4 iron ore miner, said it expects iron ore prices to continue to edge up in the near term to around $120 a metric ton (1.1023 tons). 
 "We do expect the iron ore price to recover to more sustainable levels," Chief Executive Nev Power told reporters after the company lined $4.5 billion in debt to refinance all existing debt facilities. (Reporting by  Sonali Paul ; editing by  Miral Fahmy )
