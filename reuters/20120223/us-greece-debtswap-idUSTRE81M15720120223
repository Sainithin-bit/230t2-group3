 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek parliament passed on Thursday legislation to launch a debt swap for private bondholders which is at the core of the 130- billion-euro bailout agreed with euro zone partners this week. 
 Under a common procedure of Greek parliament, acting parliament speaker Anastasios Kourakis said the law passed automatically without a vote because the incumbent government has a majority and no request for a named vote had been made. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; editing by  Mark John )
