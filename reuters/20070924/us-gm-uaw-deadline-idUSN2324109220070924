 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union has set a Monday deadline for reaching a contract deal with General Motors Corp. and told its local leaders to be prepared to strike if no agreement is reached. 

 Chris "Tiny" Sherwood, president of UAW Local 652 in Lansing, Michigan said the union's leadership had told him to be prepared to send workers out on picket lines at 11 a.m. on Monday unless told otherwise. "They told me to walk them at 11 a.m. unless I hear otherwise," Sherwood said. The imposition of a strike deadline by the UAW came after a weekend of marathon bargaining that had appeared to bring both sides close to a cost-cutting contract for 73,000 factory workers at the top U.S. automaker.
