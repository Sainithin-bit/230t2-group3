 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Negotiators from General Motors Corp and the United Auto Workers union resumed talks, hours after 73,000 workers walked off their jobs at the automaker's plants. 

 Bargaining for a labor contract resumed Monday afternoon, a GM spokeswoman said. GM said it was disappointed in the UAW's decision to call a national strike against the automaker.
