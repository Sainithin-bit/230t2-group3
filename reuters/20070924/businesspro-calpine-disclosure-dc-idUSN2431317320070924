 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt power producer Calpine 
Corp CPNLQ.PK on Monday lowered an estimated return for 
existing shareholders under a revised disclosure statement 
filed at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of 
New York. 

  Judge Burton Lifland will hold a hearing on the disclosure 
statement on Tuesday. The statement spells out the details of 
Calpine's reorganization plan to emerge from Chapter 11 
bankruptcy.  Calpine's third amended disclosure filing lowered the 
projected high end value of each existing share to $3.01 from 
$3.28 after adjustments were made for secured and unsecured 
claims against the company.  The company puts its estimated enterprise value on leaving 
bankruptcy at between $19.2 billion and $21.3 billion with a 
midpoint of $20.3 billion.  Calpine's filing was posted on a Web site of court 
documents maintained by Kurtzman Carson Consultants, a legal 
and financial services company.  San Jose, California-based Calpine has said it expects to 
get its reorganization plan confirmed by the end of this year.  Calpine shares rose 9.8 percent to $1.68 on over-the- 
counter pink sheets.  (Reporting by Leonard Anderson)
