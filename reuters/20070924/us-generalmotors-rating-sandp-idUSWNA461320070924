 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Monday said its ratings on General Motors Corp. are unchanged after the automaker failed to reach an agreement with its main union, the United Auto Workers, and union members went on strike. 

 "We still expect GM and the UAW to reach an agreement in the near future that will start to address the automaker's legacy cost issues," S&P said in a statement. S&P rates GM's debt "B," five levels below investment grade, and has a negative outlook, indicating a rating cut is likely over the next two years.
