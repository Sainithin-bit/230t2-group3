 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Monday it was disappointed in the United Auto Workers union's decision to call a national strike against the automaker. 

 "The bargaining involves complex, difficult issues that affect the job security of our U.S. work force and the long-term viability of the company," GM said in a statement. "We are fully committed to working with the UAW to develop solutions together to address the competitive challenges facing General Motors." "We will continue focusing our efforts on reaching an agreement as soon as possible," the statement said. GM workers at plants in Michigan, Ohio and Kansas City began walking off the job on Monday as a UAW strike against the company began. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
