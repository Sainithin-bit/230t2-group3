 DETROIT  (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger said on Monday the union was pushed into a strike by General Motors Corp. after the automaker failed to meet it halfway in marathon contract talks. 

 "You can be pushed off a cliff and that's what happened here," Gettelfinger said, speaking to reporters at a news conference at the union's Detroit headquarters. Gettelfinger said that union negotiators would head back to the bargaining table on Monday and remained ready to discuss one of GM's key demands of establishing a trust fund to pay for retiree health care. He said that GM's push to establish a cost-saving voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA, was not the reason the UAW had decided to set a strike deadline. "We were pushed into a strike and that's where we're at," Gettelfinger told reporters. Gettelfinger said that one of the union's key priorities was to protect the job security of 73,000 union-represented GM workers in negotiations.
