 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Wall Street watchdog has been too quick to let brokers wipe their records clean of customer complaints, and in many cases made allegations disappear without a hearing, according to a study made public on Monday. 

 Arbitration panels convened by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) approved brokers' requests to wipe out 98 percent of customer complaints, according to the study by the Public Investors Arbitration Bar Association (PIABA). The association's members represent individual investors. Moreover, 71 percent of complaints addressed through so-called stipulated awards were expunged without a hearing into the matter, the study found. "Complaints are being wiped off without arbitrators holding any hearings on the merits. That is a huge problem if you're a customer and go to FINRA looking for any record of problems. You won't find any," PIABA president Steven Caruso said. FINRA, created by the merger of the regulatory arms of the National Association of Securities Dealers and New York Stock Exchange, maintains a database of customer allegations such as unauthorized trading or steering customers into inappropriate investments. The data helps customers and brokerages steer clear of bad brokers. A rule passed in 2003 required that complaints be expunged only after an arbitration panel held hearings. But PIABA said its data showed many panels still approved the requests to expunge without review. The study looked at some 200 stipulated or settled customer awards issued in 2006 and filed since April 2004, when new rules took effect. In one example cited by the study, a Baltimore-area broker received 18 approvals to expunge customer complaints by 18 panels last year. In all but 17 cases, there was no hearing before approval. FINRA did not dispute the study's findings. It contends, that recommendations to expunge complaints are down and that PIABA focused on just 2 percent of all closed arbitration cases to support its claims. "FINRA has worked diligently to reduce the number of recommendations to expunge from its arbitration forum," the group said in a statement. The number of recommendations to expunge dropped to 562 last year, or more than a third from 2005," according to FINRA. PIABA's Caruso, a longtime critic of Wall Street's arbitration process, acknowledged that the recent bull market has led to a drop in complaints. Last year, 7,212 customer complaint cases were wrapped up by panels, down 20 percent from 2005. Still he said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has oversight of how FINRA handles arbitration, should put a stop to these rubber stamp approvals. "If they have any real interest in investor protection, this can't be allowed to continue," Caruso said.
