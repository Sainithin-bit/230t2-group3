 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to insure the debt of General Motors Corp. rose on Monday, after initially tightening, as members of the United Auto Workers union went on a nationwide strike. 

 GM's credit default swap spreads widened to around 552 basis points, or $552,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, after opening at about 507 basis points, said a trader.
