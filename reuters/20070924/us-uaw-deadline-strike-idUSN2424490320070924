 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers said on Monday its decision to set a strike deadline was prompted by General Motors Corp's failure to address job security and other mandatory issues. 

 In a statement issued on the UAW web site, the union said the 11 a.m. (1500 GMT) Monday strike deadline was "firm." "We're shocked and disappointed that General Motors has failed to recognize and appreciate what our membership has contributed during the past four years," said UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said in the statement.
