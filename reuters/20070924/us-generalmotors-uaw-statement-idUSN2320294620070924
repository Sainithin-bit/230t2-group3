 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. aims to reach a deal on a new contract with the United Auto Workers quickly, a spokesman said on Sunday. 

 "We are fully committed to working with the UAW to develop solutions together ... We will continue focusing our efforts to reach an agreement as soon as possible," spokesman Dan Flores told Reuters in reaction to news that the UAW has set a strike deadline for 11a.m.ET on Monday unless a deal is reached.
