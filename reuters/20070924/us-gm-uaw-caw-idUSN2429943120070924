 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - Up to 100,000 Canadian autoworkers could be laid off by the end of this week if the strike at General Motors Corp's U.S. operations drags on, the head of the Canadian Auto Workers said on Monday. 

 CAW President Buzz Hargrove told a televised news conference he believed 80,000 to 100,000 Canadian auto-sector employees could be forced out of work, a figure that included about 40,000 who work at parts manufacturers that sell to GM.
