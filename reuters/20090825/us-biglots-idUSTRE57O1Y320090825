 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Big Lots Inc ( BIG.N ) posted a higher-than-expected 9.2 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by tight expense controls, and the close-out retailer raised its full-year profit outlook, sending its shares higher. 

 Building on the momentum in its business, Big Lots, which specializes selling of excess merchandise, said it was opening five more stores than initially planned this year, and will roll out a loyalty-card program to offer discounts to frequent shoppers. While manufacturers have cut production to match suppressed consumer demand, Big Lots said it was not worried about its ability to stock new merchandise for the year-end holiday shopping season. "We're absolutely not concerned about the fourth quarter," CEO Steve Fishman said on a call with analysts. Net income for the second quarter that ended August 1, rose to $28.4 million, or 34 cents per share, from $26 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 35 cents a share, compared with the analysts' average forecast of 30 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell 1.7 percent to $1.09 billion, while sales at stores open at least two years, or same-store sales, fell 2.4 percent. Cowen & Co analyst Laura Champine said in a note the results left her bullish on the stock. "While the top-line remains pressured, we believe capital investments into store operations is leading to a better shopping experience, and ongoing improvements in inventory management continue to benefit margins," she wrote. RAISING ITS PROFILE, OPENING MORE STORES Big Lots stocks its stores with merchandise that has been overproduced, discontinued or rejected by other retailers that have had to cancel orders. It has been somewhat insulated from the recession as shoppers seek its low prices on food, paper towels or pet food, although sales of its discretionary merchandise such as home decor and furniture have suffered. Big Lots is using the recession as a chance to enhance its image, signing deals to open stores in better locations as other retailers go out of business. It is also testing its ability to appeal to higher-income shoppers by opening a store in Columbus, Ohio in a relatively upscale area. Big Lots said it now expects to open 50 new stores this year, compared with its previous estimate for 45 new ones. It still plans to shut 40 stores. In the recently completed quarter, its results were helped by lower transportation and fuel costs, and smaller payroll and advertising costs. In the second half of the year, Big Lots said it will be more aggressive with its advertising to win market share. To boost sales, it is introducing higher-quality towels and sheets, while also setting up a section in its stores featuring merchandise for the U.S. football season. For the third quarter, it forecast same-store sales to be flat to down 2 percent, and earnings of 14 cents to 19 cents per share. For the fourth quarter, it expects same-store sales to be flat to slightly up, with earnings of 99 cents to $1.04 per share. For the full year, it now expects income from continuing operations of $1.92 a share to $2.02 a share. Its prior forecast called for $1.85 to $1.95 per share on that basis, while analysts have been expecting $1.93 a share. Its shares rose $2.32, or 9.7 percent, to $26.35 in late morning trading.
