 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence climbed more than expected in August on an improved outlook on the job market and the overall economy, according to a private report released on Tuesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 54.1 in August from an upwardly revised 47.4 percent in July. The July figure was originally reported at 46.6. * Analysts had predicted the index likely moved up to 47.5 in August. The August reading on consumer sentiment was the loftiest since May when it was 54.8. * The survey's present situation index edged up to 24.9 in August from 23.3 in July, while its expectations component jumped to 73.5 -- the highest since December 2007 when it was at 75.8 -- from 63.4 in July. * Fewer Americans said jobs were "hard to get," the survey found, with that measure slipping to 45.1 percent from 48.5 percent. Those saying jobs were plentiful rose to 4.2 percent, from March's 3.7 percent. COMMENTS: RUDY NARVAS, SENIOR ANALYST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "Confidence was much firmer than expected. There seems to be a lot of good news coming from that, and also from the housing sector. Everything seems to be looking very bearish for bonds." KIM RUPERT, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS LLC, SAN FRANCISCO: "Obviously much better than expected but not a total surprise given the improvement in a lot of the economic data and the moderately more upbeat assessment from policy maker. "Most of the strength was in the expectations component, so it looks like even though the near-term conditions are still a bit rocky there is hope for the future. "Obviously it has added to gains in equities and I think it will provide the opportunity to cheapen up the Treasury market ahead of the two-year auction." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH,  CONNECTICUT: "Consumer confidence was one of the lagging indicators that had been disappointing lately, with equities going higher and unemployment declines ebbing. With that, confidence wasn't up to expectations but it is today. "Overall, stocks have had a nice rally, they're sporting new recovery highs and are trading 53 percent above their lows. In another time, this data maybe would've helped, but now its not helping so much since we've had such gains over the past four or five weeks." MELVIN HARRIS, MARKET STRATEGIST, ADVANCED CURRENCY MARKETS,  NEW YORK: "These numbers are definitely reassuring, though I'm more focused on the housing data. Still, the consumer confidence is like gravy today. We're not in full-blown recovery mode yet but we are seeing more normalized markets. Consumer numbers are important numbers -- they are an indicator of what people are willing to spend and that matters for GDP growth. "The dollar tends to weaken in this type of market. But there's no volume out there, so in that atmosphere, 30-40 pip moves doesn't get me very excited. The yen crosses are a better barometer of sentiment." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes rallied to new highs. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices added to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the euro and yen.
