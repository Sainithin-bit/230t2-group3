 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence climbed more than expected in August on an improved outlook on the job market and the overall economy, according to a private report released on Tuesday. 

 The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose to 54.1 in August from an upwardly revised 47.4 percent in July. The July figure was originally reported at 46.6. Analysts had predicted the index likely moved up to 47.5 in August. The August reading on consumer sentiment was the loftiest since May when it was 54.8. The survey's present situation index edged up to 24.9 in August from 23.3 in July, while its expectations component jumped to 73.5 -- the highest since December 2007 when it was at 75.8 -- from 63.4 in July. Fewer Americans said jobs were "hard to get," the survey found, with that measure slipping to 45.1 percent from 48.5 percent. Those saying jobs were plentiful rose to 4.2 percent, from March's 3.7 percent. (Reporting by  Richard Leong , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
