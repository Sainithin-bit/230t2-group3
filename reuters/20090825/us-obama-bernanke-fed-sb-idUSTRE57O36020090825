 OAK BLUFFS, Massachusetts  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday that he would work to build a solid foundation for growth and prosperity in an environment of price stability, if he was confirmed for a second term. 

 Bernanke, speaking after President Barack Obama renominated him, said the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- had been challenged by the unprecedented events of the past few years. "We have been bold or deliberate as circumstances demanded, but our objective remains constant: to restore a more stable economic and financial environment in which opportunity can again flourish, and in which Americans' hard work and creativity can receive their proper rewards," Bernanke said.
