 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office lowered its estimate of the U.S. government's 10-year budget deficit Tuesday to $7.14 trillion as the economy recovers and inflation remains low in coming years. 

 Congress' budget watchdog calculated that the federal government will spend a record $1.59 trillion more than it collects in the current fiscal year, which ends September 30, and post a deficit of $1.38 trillion in fiscal 2010, figures which closely track separate estimates put out by the White House.
