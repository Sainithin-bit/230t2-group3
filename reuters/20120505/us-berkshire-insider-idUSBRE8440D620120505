 OMAHA, Nebraska  (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway would settle for an acquisition in the $10 billion range after a larger deal of more than $20 billion fell apart recently, Chief Executive Warren Buffett told Reuters Insider on Saturday. 
 Buffett, speaking after the conclusion of his conglomerate's annual meeting, said he also expected some version of the so-called Buffett rule, a plan to raise taxes on the wealthy, would be passed in a second Obama administration. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz  in Omaha; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
