 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S producer prices rose by a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in April after gasoline prices sank, government data showed on Tuesday, but core inflation at the producer level posted a larger advance. 

  KEY POINTS: * Economists polled by Reuters had expected that producer prices - a gauge of costs at the farm and factory gate - would rise 0.4 percent after mounting 1.1 percent in March. * Core producer prices, which strip out volatile energy and food costs, increased by 0.4 percent. That was twice the rate that had been forecast. Core producer prices over the last 12 months rose 3.0 percent, the largest gain since December 1991. * Gasoline prices at the producer level fell 4.6 percent, but they were up 23 percent over the past year. Overall producer prices were up 6.5 percent on a year-on-year basis. Food prices were unchanged in April, although within that category the price of rice jumped by 17.4 percent, notching the largest rise since 1993.  COMMENTS: CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE  NEW YORK: "The point here is that we know CPI was really tame last month. On a core basis it was 0.1 percent while we got a 0.4 percent increase in core PPI. "That points to an inability of producers to pass on higher costs to the consumer, which just reinforces the idea that the U.S. consumer is very weak." JEOFF HALL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, IFR MARKETS, BOSTON: "There was some acceleration in the non-energy sector with a curious rise in furniture and household durables. It may be costing more to ship them and bring them out of warehouses rather than more demand for them. "Food prices were held in bay in April but they should rise in May. "The three-month annualized rate on the core is 4.9 percent. That's just too much inflation to deal with. In terms of tinkering with monetary policy, the next move for the Fed will likely be a hike. "This (report) will take a swipe at stocks. From an asset allocation perspective, stocks will suffer more than bonds today." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW  YORK: "The headline number is a bit surprisingly low, and the core rate was surprisingly high. I tend to put more stock in trying to decipher underlying trends in the core rate, and the increase this month was surprising and somewhat disappointing. "The PPI is significantly more difficult to gauge than the CPI is. The PPI and the CPI both use different weighting schemes for the various components. That can account for some of the differences between the core and headline numbers... "The markets will not like the high core rate, and the year-over-year rate in both the core and the headline rate are unacceptably high. I caution, however, that what happens in the CPI does not always translate into finished goods prices. And there are anomalies in these data that the PPI and CPI over the long run will tend to move towards the same inflation rate. In the short run, the PPI is significantly nosier. It's almost three times as volatile as the CPI in the headline figures." KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST FOR GLOBAL WEALTH  MANAGEMENT WITH MORGAN STANLEY IN PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "I am surprised that Treasuries have come back and are actually higher (in price)." "There is some trepidation when you look at this report. It doesn't suggest that inflation pressures are receding." RICHARD YAMARONE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ARGUS RESEARCH, NEW  YORK: "The 5.8 percent year-over-year increase in intermediate goods, less food and energy, is the red warning flag in this report. Now you see that higher prices have moved from the crude stage to the intermediate, so there's only one stage left before moving to the retail sector. The Fed watches this intermediate stage." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW  YORK: "The PPI core index was high, both in absolute terms and relative to expectations. There was a broad-based increase in prices of investment goods, of which light trucks is one component, and that reflects the strong demand that U.S. manufacturers of capital equipment are seeing despite everything. So it's good news in the sense that it confirms that capital goods producers are seeing strong demand from abroad and it's not quite as bad news in terms of domestic consumer prices. "Capital goods is a relatively narrow part of the economy so that probably means less potential damage to the inflation picture here and keeps the economy more active than it might otherwise be. "The Fed's not going to be comfortable with this. They don't like to see significant price increases under any circumstances at the moment because anything can contribute to inflation expectations. "There's also extremely strong upward price movement at the earlier stages of processing: intermediate goods and crude goods. And that's a reflection of a global increase in commodity prices and will also trouble the Fed. Whether or not it means the Fed will think about tightening, it certainly points to stress and strain on the economy because producers will see their margins narrow and the people who ultimately pay these prices will feel as if they're being taxed. That becomes damaging to the economy. "The Fed will be uncomfortable with this, but there's not much they can do about it other than stick to their posture about being concerned. The cost side pressures may or may not affect consumer prices at the moment, but for the long run they make the Fed very nervous." JOEL NAROFF, PRESIDENT, NAROFF ECONOMIC ADVISORS, HOLLAND,  PENNSYLVANIA: "The April numbers do reflect the kind of the energy increases we've been seeing like the CPI report. The worrisome aspect of the number is the core number, which costs are bleeding into. But it's not surprise." "Nothing here bodes well for consumers. We are not going to see easing anytime soon." "It's putting more pressure on businesses to raise their costs. This is problematic in an economic slowdown we are in right now. This will have a more negative news for earnings and inflation." "I don't think the Fed is going to change their thinking because of this. There will be members of the Fed who are concerned about this. But it's hard to argue it's an excess demand with the economy slowing so quickly."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices initially fall but turn up as stock futures drop * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar weakens on the tame headline PPI number * STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures fall on the stronger-than-expected core PPI * RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures essentially unchanged, pricing in a 10 percent probability of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's June meeting versus an 10 percent probability late Monday.
