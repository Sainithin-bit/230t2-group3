 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The comments made by Germany's labor minister about future euro zone bailout payments needing to be covered by collateral do not reflect the government's position, a government source said on Tuesday. 

 Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen -- who is also a deputy president of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) -- said that future euro zone bailout payments should be covered by collateral such as gold reserves or stakes in state industry.
