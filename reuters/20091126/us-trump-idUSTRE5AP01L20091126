 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Beal Bank has made a restructuring proposal for bankrupt Trump Entertainment Resorts' TRMPQ.PK Atlantic City casinos that would give it a 65 percent stake in the casinos company, the bank's attorney said on Wednesday. 

 Dallas-based Beal Bank introduced its plan about a week after Donald Trump abandoned his campaign to get back the properties bearing his name. Beal Bank, which is owed around $486 million, offered a New Jersey bankruptcy judge and Trump Entertainment to convert $386 million of loans it made to the casinos into equity of the company, and receive a $100 million cash payment, attorney Thomas Lauria said. Under Beal Bank's proposal, other creditors of Trump Entertainment would receive a 35 percent stake in the company, Lauria said. Trump Entertainment was not available for comment.
