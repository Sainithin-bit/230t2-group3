 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke withstood a grilling in Congress, while the U.S. dollar rose after unexpectedly bad jobless claims data dampened risk appetite. 

 Euro zone government bond prices rose after data showed industrial orders in Europe plunged in April as the surprise jump in American workers filing new claims for unemployment benefits lifted short-dated U.S. government debt prices. Oil rose above $70 a barrel after Nigeria's main militant group attacked a Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) pipeline, heightening concern about supplies from the region. Hopes for recovery from global recession could be seen in a rise in the price of copper, a widely used industrial metal, even though the poor U.S. jobs data reminded investors that economic weakness would hamper demand. European shares closed lower, led by drugmakers and banks, after Asia-focused Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) said it remained cautious on the economic outlook despite record levels of income and profit in the first five months of the year. U.S. stocks rose sharply after committee members questioned Bernanke on the Fed's role in Bank of America's ( BAC.N ) takeover of Merrill Lynch, and whether he pressured Chief Executive Ken Lewis to conclude the deal after Lewis raised objections. As the testimony in the U.S. House of Representatives Oversight and Government Reform Committee wore on, however, analysts' concerns receded and stocks added to gains. "There has been nothing in his testimony that has confirmed conspiratory theorists that he overstepped his authority," said Peter Kenny, a managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. Consumer discretionary shares led stocks higher early in the session on positive news from the retail and home-building sectors, leading shares of home builder Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) and retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond ( BBBY.O ) to rally. Lennar shares shot up 15.7 percent after it posted a wider quarterly loss, but also reported an increase in new home sales and orders. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc ( BBBY.O ) reported a surprising increase in quarterly profit as it cut costs to offset slumping demand, and its stock soared 10 percent. After 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 141.70 points, or 1.71 percent, at 8,441.56. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 15.66 points, or 1.74 percent, at 916.60. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 28.55 points, or 1.59 percent, at 1,820.89. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares ended 0.9 percent lower at 845.71. The European Central Bank moved to lend banks 442.24 billion euros, its latest effort to boost liquidity, which led the bank-to-bank cost of borrowing euros to fall by the most in six months. Overnight euro Libor rates slumped by almost a percentage point to a record low. The Swiss franc fell against both the euro and dollar as traders cited talk of the Swiss National Bank selling francs for euros and dollars, possibly via the Bank for International Settlements. Both the SNB and BIS declined to comment. The dollar slipped against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.27 percent at 80.34. The euro was up 0.14 percent at $1.3944, and against the yen, the dollar was up 0.31 percent at 96.02. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 28/32 in price to yield 3.58 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose 6/32 in price to yield 1.12 percent. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 2.77 percent to $70.57 a barrel. Spot gold prices rose $5.55 to $936.65 an ounce. Asian stocks rallied for a second day after the Fed repeated that interest rates will be kept at a record low for a while. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 1.1 percent, while the Nikkei average  .N225  climbed 2.2 percent.
