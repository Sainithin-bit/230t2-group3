 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that President Barack Obama had confidence in the job Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has done so far, despite congressional criticism over his role in the Bank of America merger with Merrill Lynch last year. 

 White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama had "confidence in the job Mr. Bernanke has done and confidence in the role the Fed will play going forward to ensure what's happened never happens again," a reference to the financial meltdown on Wall Street that fueled the United States' worst economic crisis in decades.
