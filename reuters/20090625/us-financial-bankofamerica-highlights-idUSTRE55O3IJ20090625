 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on Thursday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testifying on the Bank of America acquisition of Merrill Lynch. 

 COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN EDOLPHUS TOWNS ON INCONSISTENCIES: "There are significant inconsistencies between what we have been told today, what we were told two weeks ago by Ken Lewis, and what the Fed's internal emails seem to say. It is still unclear whether Bank of America was forced by the federal government to go through with the Merrill deal or whether Ken Lewis pulled off what may have been the greatest financial shakedown in a long, long time." TOWNS ON SEC AND FDIC: "As a result of this hearing, we have learned that the SEC and the FDIC played a role in this transaction as well. We're going wherever the road leads us, so therefore we're going to talk to the SEC and we're going to talk to the FDIC. We're going to talk to former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. He has agreed to appear before the committee in July. "But we also need to hear from the FDIC and the SEC so that we can better understand what happened during the dark days of last December so we will be hearing from them as well." COMMITTEE RANKING REPUBLICAN DARRELL ISSA QUESTIONS ON LACKER EMAIL Rep. Darrell Issa: "Do you at this time believe that intentionally, Ken Lewis, Hank Paulson or any of the people we've cited today in emails intended to lie in their statements?" Bernanke: "I have no judgment on that." Issa: "But you believe in good faith that they think what they're saying is true, at least as far you know." Bernanke: "As far as I know." Issa: "Do you think Federal regulators should pick winners and losers as they go through trying to figure out in a crisis like this who gets to own who, or who gets bailout money and who doesn't." Bernanke: "I think all these interventions are unfortunate, and they're only made necessary by the extreme circumstances." Issa: "Earlier one of the people we mentioned was Mr. Lacker. In light of his email, paraphrasing a longer discussion, do you intend to speak to him and try to clarify how his how this difference in interpretation could have happened." Bernanke: "I have done so already and he didn't have any further recollection." BERNANKE ON MONEY SUPPLY AND INFLATION: "The money's not in the system in any real way. The money is electronic deposits from banks sitting in the federal Reserve accounts. They're not being used, nothing loaned, they're not circulating. The key issue here is can we unwind this money creation and low interest rates in time to head off inflation when the economy begins to recover. We have all the tools we need to do that. We believe we can do that. We will certainly remove that stimulus in time and we are committed to price stability and we will make sure that happens." COMMITTEE MEMBER DANNY DAVIS ON BofA's KEN LEWIS: DAVIS: When the government invested heavily in AIG, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac management was actually replaced. Why was the fate of Mr. Lewis different in this instance? BERNANKE: In this case the merger was undertaken in good faith. It was at the time looked like a reasonable combination. A lot of firms suffered severe losses in the fourth quarter -- it was one of the worst quarters in history in terms of financial losses -- our judgment at the time was that he could continue to lead the company and we have not addressed that. Obviously we will continue to evaluate management and the board as we go forward and make sure we're comfortable with the leadership of Bank of America." BERNANKE ON FED ACTIONS REGARDING BANK OF AMERICA, MERRILL: "I believe that we solved this problem without in any way taking steps that were beyond the law or unethical." BERNANKE ON "TOO BIG TO FAIL": "I believe that the centerpiece of financial regulatory reform should be steps to get rid of 'too big to fail,' to find measures that allow a large firm to fail when its appropriate and to do so in a way it doesn't bring everything else down with it." BERNANKE ON FED'S CURRENT CONSUMER PROTECTION ROLE: "The Federal Reserve was late to invoke those consumer protection powers. We have been very aggressive ... for the past couple of years. I think it is very important if the Fed retains those powers, that we strengthen the priority that those have in our decision-making and that we have strengthened accountability, that we report frequently to Congress about what we're doing on these areas."
