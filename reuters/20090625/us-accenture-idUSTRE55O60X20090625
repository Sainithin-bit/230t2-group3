 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Technology outsourcing and consulting firm Accenture Ltd ( ACN.N ) raised its full-year outlook, saying some customers were beginning to make investment decisions after a long freeze in such plans. 

 And while Accenture's fiscal third-quarter profit fell due to a slower economy and a stronger U.S. dollar, the results were better than Wall Street expected and helped the shares rise 4.3 percent. Accenture said on Thursday its profit for the quarter ended May 31 fell to $444 million, or 68 cents a share, from $469 million, or 74 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average had expected profit per share of 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Chief Executive William Green said customers were beginning to better deal with the challenging environment. "They are back in the saddle, starting to plan investment decisions," he said, adding that while he needed another few months to declare things were stabilizing, he was optimistic. "It's going to be an interesting summer to get a sense of, are we seeing some stability, are we seeing confidence of customers. And my instinct is that we will," he said. The company raised its earnings per share outlook for the full year to $2.67 to $2.70 from a previous range of $2.60 to $2.67. It had lowered its outlook last quarter as the global economic slowdown forced companies to stall business decisions, and a stronger dollar weighed down the value of overseas sales. Chief Financial Officer Pamela Craig told investors on a conference call that there was "some positive activity" toward the end of the third quarter. CONSULTING THE WEAK SPOT Analysts have said the company has been spared the worst impact of the global economic slowdown due to solid demand for its outsourcing services. Outsourcing revenues in the quarter fell 9 percent to $2.2 billion, but they rose slightly in local currency terms. Consulting revenues, however, fell 20 percent to $3 billion and were down 9 percent in local currency terms. The company said the decline in the consulting business was due to clients' caution about large commitments. Some customers were slowing the pace of ongoing projects and deferring decisions, Craig said, also citing pricing pressure. Overall revenue fell to $5.15 billion from $6.10 billion, due in part to a stronger dollar, the company said. Accenture shares rose after-hours to $33 after closing up 0.7 percent at $31.64 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Ritsuko Ando; editing by  Richard Chang ,  Andre Grenon ,  Tim Dobbyn )
