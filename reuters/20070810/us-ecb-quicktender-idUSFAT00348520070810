 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said it would add liquidity to calm markets on Friday, following Thursday's 94.8 billion euro cash injection, the bank said. 

 "The liquidity-providing fine-tuning operation follows up on the operation conducted yesterday and aims to assure orderly conditions in the euro money market," the ECB said on a regularly updated quote page. The central bank said it was setting a tender for 3-day variable-rate securities with a minimum bid rate of 4.00 percent, with bids due by 4:50 a.m. EDT. The ECB did not state an intended volume for the transaction. The start date for the securities is August 10, and they expire on August 13. The 94.8 billion euros of securities issued by the ECB on Thursday mature on Friday.
