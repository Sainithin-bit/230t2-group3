 (Reuters) - American Home Mortgage Investment Corp.'s ( AHMIQ.PK ) shareholder NWQ Investment Management Co. LLC liquidated its beneficially owned passive stake in the company, which recently filed for bankruptcy, as of July 31. 

 The liquidation was disclosed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On December 31 2006 NWQ had disclosed a 5.8 percent stake in the mortgage lender. American Home Mortgage received bankruptcy court approval earlier this week for debtor-in-possession financing to pay salaries and other costs as it shuts most businesses.
