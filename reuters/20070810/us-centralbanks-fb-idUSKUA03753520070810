 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Central banks from Frankfurt to Sydney have injected extra cash into banking systems to calm panicky credit markets in the last 24 hours. Below is a breakdown of their actions. 

 EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK The ECB pumped 94.8 billion euros ($130.6 billion) in a one-day tender on Thursday, the largest amount ever. It followed with 61.05 billion euros ($83.61 billion) in a 3-day tender on Friday and said it continued to monitor conditions in the euro money market closely. The totals were well above the amounts that the ECB flooded into markets immediately after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. At that time, 69.3 bln euro in overnight money was allocated on September 12, 2001, followed by 40.5 billion euro the next day. U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE The Fed added $24 billion into the U.S. banking system on Friday, its biggest single-day cash injection in nearly four months. But analysts said this did not amount to an emergency injection of liquidity and was not significantly above the range of funds added in normal market conditions. BANK OF CANADA The Bank of Canada injected C$1.64 billion ($1.55 billion). It said it was in contact with other central banks on the global situation and stood ready to add money as needed. BANK OF JAPAN The BoJ supplied 1.0 trillion yen ($8.45 billion) at its regular money market operation on Friday after a slight rise in the benchmark overnight call rate. Traders said the amount was at the higher end of market expectations, but was not a major surprise. THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA The RBA on Friday added more than twice the usual amount of money into the banking system, injecting A$4.95 billion ($4.19 billion) in its regular morning money market operation. SWISS NATIONAL BANK The SNB offered banks money at a below-market rate of 2.6 percent for the second day in a row on Friday. Traders estimated that 2-3 billion Swiss francs ($1.68-2.51 billion)  CHF=  was probably injected on Thursday, when the market rate was at 3 percent. CENTRAL BANKS OF MALAYSIA, INDONESIA, PHILIPPINES Traders said the Asian central banks intervened in foreign exchange markets on Friday to support their currencies by selling U.S. dollars. BANK OF KOREA South Korea's central bank said on Friday it was ready to add funds to markets if needed. CENTRAL BANK OF NORWAY The central bank said Thursday's loan of 45 billion crowns ($7.80 billion) gave ample liquidity to banks and it would continue to ensure orderly operations in the money market.
