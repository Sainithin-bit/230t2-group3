 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian stocks tumbled across the board on Friday following a rout in global markets as credit jitters flared up, after a major French bank froze three funds that invested in U.S. subprime mortgages. 

 Financial stocks were among the hardest hit amid the credit fears, with Australia's Macquarie Bank down 6.4 percent and South Korea's Shinhan Financial Group sliding 4.6 percent. France's biggest listed bank, BNP Paribas, froze $2.2 billion worth of funds on Thursday, citing the U.S. subprime mortgage sector woes. The move spooked global financial markets and prompted action from major central banks to calm markets, with the European Central Bank injecting record amounts of cash to prevent a financial system seizure. The flight to safety also knocked down prices of industrial metals and oil, which in turn hit resource issues such as mining giant BHP Billiton. At 0015 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had fallen 2.2 percent further hit by weakness in exporters including Canon Inc., which were thumped by a jump in the yen as investors shunned risky low interest rate-funded trades. Canon fell 4.3 percent, Sony shed 2.3 percent, top bank Mitsubishi UFJ dropped 4.1 percent. Hiroichi Nishi, a general manager of equity marketing at Nikko Cordial Securities, had expected the flurry of selling, but said markets may pare some losses later. "Japanese economic fundamentals are not bad. Stock prices are also at an attractive level," he said. In South Korea, falls of 4.4 percent for Kookmin Bank and 3.4 percent for Samsung Electronics helped sent the benchmark KOSPI down 3.4 percent. "The subprime troubles are not something that can be cleared up overnight," said Kim Joong-hyun, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. Also hit, Australia's key S&P/ASX 200 index skidded 2.4 percent, dragged lower by weakness in the banks and mining stocks. BHP Billiton dropped 3.3 percent and Commonwealth Bank fell 2.2 percent. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan slid 1.5 percent, snapping three straight sessions of gains. It was about 2 percent off the trough plumbed on August 6. On Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow slid 2.8 percent and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index fell 2.2 percent.
