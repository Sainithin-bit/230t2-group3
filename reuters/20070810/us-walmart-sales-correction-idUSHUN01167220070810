 Corrects net sales figures in paragraph 12 to 8.8 percent and $27.58 billion 

 By  Nicole Maestri NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) on Thursday posted a 1.9 percent rise in July sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, toward the top end of its forecast, after cutting prices to attract shoppers. But the world's largest retailer, which will report quarterly earnings on Tuesday, warned that its aggressive price reductions were hurting gross margins. Sarah Henry, an investment analyst at the Sovereign Asset Management group at MFC Global, said it was worrisome to hear Wal-Mart talk about margin pressure. "It means that the sales they did get were due to discounting," she said, which can wind up hurting profits. Wal-Mart shares were down nearly 2 percent in midday trading. The company is working to revive sales in its namesake U.S. stores after attempts last year to play down its discount roots and sell higher-margin goods, like trendy clothes and home decor, backfired with its low-income consumers. Wal-Mart has returned to emphasizing low prices. To spur sales around the July 4 U.S. Independence Day holiday, it implemented "deep cuts" in prices on top brand-name items and food. And last month it announced price cuts of as much as 50 percent on 16,000 items, like school supplies and backpacks, to jump-start back-to-school sales. Wal-Mart had forecast July same-store sales would rise 1 percent to 2 percent. Analysts on average were expecting a gain of 1.5 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales rose 1.3 percent at Wal-Mart stores and 5.1 percent at the Sam's Club warehouse unit. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart's smaller rival, Target Corp. ( TGT.N ), posted a 6.1 percent rise in its July same-store sales and forecast a gain of 4 percent to 6 percent for August. Net sales in the four weeks ended August 3 rose 8.8 percent to $27.58 billion, while total sales for the second quarter that ended July 31 were about $92 billion. The Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said it was encouraged by positive early signs in back-to-school categories and was seeing strong demand for dorm-room items like microwaves, small refrigerators, and coffee makers. But it said its clothing and home businesses were still soft and are expected to remain so through the third quarter. Grocery sales were still stronger than general merchandise, and demand for electronics, including televisions, computers and digital cameras, was robust. Wal-Mart shares were down 86 cents, or 1.8 percent, at $47.56 on the New York Stock Exchange.
