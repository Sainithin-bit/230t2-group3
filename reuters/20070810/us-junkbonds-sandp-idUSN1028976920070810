 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The global junk bond default rate is likely to remain low this year but could pick up significantly in coming years if liquidity in credit markets evaporates further, Standard & Poor's said on Friday. 

 In a new report, S&P said there was only one default in July among global corporates rated by S&P, bringing the total for the year to 12 defaults, affecting $2.4 billion of debt. S&P has already lowered its speculative-grade default forecast to 1.4 percent by year-end 2007 from 2.2 percent. The 1.4 percent forecast is the low end of a range S&P had established earlier this year between 1.4 percent and 3.5 percent. "This does not indicate that we expect corporate credit risks to diminish," said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed income research at S&P. "Rather, it is an indication that corporate defaults will be slow to materialize in the remainder of this year. At the same time, there is a material risk that defaults may be more severe beyond the one-year forecast horizon," she said. U.S. credit markets have taken a beating in recent weeks as worries about the subprime-mortgage market and a heavy calendar of high-yield debt deals have pushed investors away from riskier assets. "The leaks in the credit markets will continue to sap strength, even though, in the next six months, defaults may be staved off, in part, due to structural concessions that avert payment default," she said.
