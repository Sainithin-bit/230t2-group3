 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to protect the debt of Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N jumped on Friday after the U.S. home loan provider said turbulence in the mortgage market is likely to hurt operations in the near term. 

 Countrywide, the largest mortgage lender, said it faces "unprecedented disruptions" in the debt market and secondary market for mortgages. It said these "could have an adverse impact on the company's earnings and financial condition, particularly in the short-term." Countrywide's debt protection costs rose about 130 basis points to 330 basis points, or $330,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million of debt, after leaping as high as 500 basis points in earlier trading on Friday.
