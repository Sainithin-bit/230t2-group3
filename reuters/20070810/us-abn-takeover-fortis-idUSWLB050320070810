 EDINBURGH  (Reuters) - Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis' FOR.BR chief executive dismissed fresh concerns on Friday over the bank's capacity to fund its part of a 71 billion euro takeover of Dutch rival ABN AMRO AAH.AS. 

 "We are used to rumors about Fortis in all kinds of categories, so I would add this into the category of new rumor," Fortis' Jean-Paul Votron told reporters in Edinburgh. "We are very comfortable about our financing. We have always been comfortable about the financing, and there's no reason why we should not be today." Worries Fortis could be hit by credit market turbulence hit shares in ABN, which fell as much as 11 percent on Friday. Fortis, which is bidding for ABN alongside Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), needs 24 billion euros to finance its part of the ABN deal. At 1421 GMT (10:33 a.m. EDT), ABN shares were down 4.1 percent against a 3.3 percent drop in the European sector.
