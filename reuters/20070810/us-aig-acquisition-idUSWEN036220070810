 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc. (AIG), the world's largest insurer, said on Friday it entered an agreement to acquire a German property and casualty insurer from J.C. Flowers & Co. LLC. 

 AIG is buying Wurttembergische und Badische Versicherungs-AG, its major subsidiary DARAG Deutsche Versicherungs- und Ruckversicherungs-AG and other minor subsidiaries for an undisclosed price in order to grow in the German marketplace, said AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan in a statement. J.C. Flowers is a New York City-based private equity firm with worldwide interests. The sale is subject to regulatory approval from insurance and other authorities and is expected to close later this year.
