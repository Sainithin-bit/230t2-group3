 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Shares in Dutch Bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS fell as much as 11 pct on Friday as analysts cited worries that Fortis may find it hard to finance its part of an offer for ABN amid growing concerns over credit availability. 

 Fortis FOR.BR, together with Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), and Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ), has made a 71 billion euros ($97.24 billion) mostly cash bid for ABN, the Netherlands' biggest bank, while Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ) is offering about 63 billion euros. Belgian-Dutch Fortis needs 24 billion euros in funds to finance its part of the deal, but a Fortis spokeswoman said financing was not an issue because of a bridge loan facility that allows it to sell assets at appropriate moments. ABN shares recovered slightly from a five-month low at 31.20 euros but remained down over 9 percent by 1250 GMT at 31.84 euros. That marks the stock's steepest one-day fall in four years. The DJ Stoxx European bank index .SX7P was down nearly 5 percent, as trouble with risky U.S. mortgages spills into world financial markets. The European Central Bank pumped cash into the system for a second day to try to reassure markets. The consortium's offer is currently worth about 37.99 euros per ABN share, compared with 33.28 euros for the Barclays offer. "Shares are down as (Dutch daily) Het Financieele Dagblad says Fortis has problems getting financing," Theodoor Gilissen analyst Gert-Jaap Kraan said. But he said Fortis has sufficient possibilities to finance the deal. Analysts said it was unlikely Barclays would drop its bid for ABN, mostly in shares, a possibility talked about among traders. BRIDGE LOAN Fortis's chief financial officer, Gilbert Mittler, said on Thursday it had a 10 billion euros bridge loan for its part of the ABN deal. Fortis wants to securitize about 2 billion euros in assets, Mittler said, and he was quoted as saying in Het Financieele Dagblad that "August 9 was not the most appropriate moment" for this securitization. Analysts said the decline in the Fortis share price also gave rise to worries over financing the ABN deal. Fortis shares have fallen about 23 percent since it announced its ABN takeover plan together with the consortium on Apr. 13, compared to a 10 percent decline of the DJ Stoxx European bank index .SX7P. FBS Bankiers analyst Daan Muusers said Fortis would have to issue more shares due to the stock's decline, putting pressure on the per share profitability of the deal, while higher interest rates for credit facilities also weighed on expected returns. "The market fears that Fortis, and therefore the consortium, will get problems with financing. That is why the chances increase that Barclays wins the battle for ABN and ABN's shares are declining towards the Barclays' bid," Muusers said. An ABN spokesman said there were no new developments in the bidding process. Barclays declined to comment. France's biggest listed bank, BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), froze 1.6 billion euros worth of funds on Thursday, citing the U.S. subprime mortgage sector and "the evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments of the U.S. securitization market." Subprime mortgages are the riskiest property loans, often extended to people with payment difficulties or a bad credit history. (Additional reporting by Steven van Aartrijk)
