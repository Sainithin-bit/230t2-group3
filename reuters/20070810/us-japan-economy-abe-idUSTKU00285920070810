 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, speaking amid growing worries about spreading U.S. subprime mortgage woes, said on Friday he would carefully watch share prices and economic indicators. 

 "I think the Japanese economy is strong. I will closely watch economic indicators, including share prices. I think we must watch them carefully," Abe told reporters. Tokyo's Nikkei average  .N225  fell more than 2 percent to its lowest close in almost five months on Friday as worries about spreading U.S. subprime problems sparked selling of shares in financial companies.
