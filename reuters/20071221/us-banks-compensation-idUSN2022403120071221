 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N employees will be the worst paid on Wall Street among the four investment banks whose fiscal year ends in November. 

 Bear Stearns, which posted its first quarterly loss in its history on Thursday after making bad bets on subprime mortgages, will pay employees an average of $241,998, down about 24 percent from last year and about a third of the average pay for a Goldman Sachs Group Inc employee. Bear Stearns' top executives, including Chairman and Chief Executive Jimmy Cayne, will not take home bonuses at all, which should leave more money in the bonus pool for other employees. Last year, Bear Stearns' top four executives received cash and restricted stock then valued at over $100 million. But Bank of America analyst Michael Hecht said Bear's smaller bonus pool could lead to attrition and hinder a strong rebound for the investment bank. Goldman Sachs employees were the best paid among the four investment banks, taking home an average of $661,490. A table showing relative pay at the firms is below.
