 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Friday it has contacted a number of companies regarding their alleged participation in an air freight cartel. 

 "The European Commission can confirm that a statement of objections has been sent to a number of companies, concerning their alleged participation in a cartel in the provision of airfreight services, in violation of EU rules on restrictive business practices," the European Union executive said in a statement. It named no companies in the statement but Scandinavian airline SAS ( SAS.ST ) said earlier on Friday it had received a statement of objections accusing the airline's cargo unit of breaking competition rules. SAS said it was cooperating with the investigation. "Sending a statement of objections does not prejudge the final outcome of the procedure," the Commission said.
