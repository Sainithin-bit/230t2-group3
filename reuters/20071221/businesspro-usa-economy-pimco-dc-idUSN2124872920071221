 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy this month has fallen 
into a recession, which should last for the next four to five 
months, Bill Gross, chief investment officer of the world's 
largest bond fund manager, told the Financial Times. 

  "If I had to be bold I'd say we began a recession in 
December," he said in an interview posted on the paper's Web 
site on Thursday.  The median forecast for growth in the U.S. gross domestic 
product in the fourth quarter of 2007 is a 0.9 percent 
annualized rate, according to a Reuters poll, sharply slowing 
down from a 4.9 percent rate in the third quarter.  Growth is seen sputtering largely because of the ailing 
housing sector, crippled by rising defaults on mortgages and 
the difficult lending environment.  Gross, who founded Pacific Investment Management Co or 
PIMCO, said the government's efforts so far to blunt the impact 
of the credit crisis have not been enough.  Two weeks ago the Bush administration unveiled a plan to 
slow the rate of home loan foreclosures by offering some 
homeowners a five-year freeze on mortgage rates.  "What needs to be done is something fairly radical compared 
to Republican orthodoxy, which means spend money and absorb the 
deficit as opposed to pretending that you're fiscally 
conservative."  (Reporting by  Kevin Plumberg , editing by Walker Simon)
