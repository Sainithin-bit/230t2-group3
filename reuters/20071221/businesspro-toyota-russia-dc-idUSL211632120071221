 ST PETERSBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Japan's top automaker, 
Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) ( TM.N ), will open its first plant in 
Russia on Friday, aiming to produce 50,000 Camry sedans 
annually, the company said in a statement. 

  The $121 million plant, which is also Russia's first to 
produce premium-class cars, is expected to increase output to 
200,000 per year at a later stage.  Russian president Vladimir Putin and Economy Minister 
Elvira Nabiullina are expected to attend the opening ceremony 
in Russia's second largest city of St. Petersburg.  Sales of foreign car brands in Russia surged 63 percent in 
the first 11 months of this year.  General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and South 
Korea's Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ) all build cars in Russia, 
and Japan's Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ), Suzuki Motor Corp 
( 7269.T ), Mitsubishi Motors ( 7211.T ) and France's PSA Peugeot 
Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) are scheduled to follow.  Toyota's flagship Camry sedan is the best-selling car in 
the United States in eight of the past nine years.  (Reporting by Denis Pinchuk, writing by Tanya Mosolova;
