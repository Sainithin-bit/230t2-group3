 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) was awarded a $1 billion contract to build an LPD 17 amphibious transport ship, the Pentagon announced on Friday. 

 The contract is for construction of the ninth ship of that type, the government said in its daily list of defense contract awards. "The LPD 17 will perform more than amphibious missions and serve as more than a transport for the landing forces," it said. The contract, awarded by Naval Sea Systems Command, provides full funding for construction, design, testing and technical issues, the Pentagon said. The ship is be completed by November 2011. Most of the work will be performed in New Orleans, La. and some in Pascagoula, Miss. (Reporting by  Julie Vorman ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
