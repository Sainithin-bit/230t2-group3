 LISBON  (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Vitor Constancio was quoted as saying on Friday that risks to world economic growth had risen due to the continued crisis in the credit and monetary markets. 

 Constancio said, in an interview with Portuguese business weekly Semanario Economico, that he was a slightly more pessimistic on growth than a few months ago as he had expected the liquidity crisis to have been resolved more quickly. "I have shown some preoccupation regarding risks to growth next year in the world economy ... in other words, I am a little more pessimistic than a few months ago," said Constancio. "It's not a dramatic scenario. The risks have in fact increased as a result of the crisis in the credit and monetary markets which was contrary to what was expected."
