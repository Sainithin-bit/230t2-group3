 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers' mood brightened a bit in late December, but still soured for the month as a whole, the third straight month that it did so, leaving sentiment near its lowest since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, a report showed on Friday. 

 The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers index of confidence edged up to 75.5 in late December from a mid-December reading of 74.5, slightly above economists' median forecast for a reading of 74.9, but down from November's reading of 76.1. The U.S. economy has been plagued by a housing crisis that spread to mortgage-linked financial assets and crippled the credit system, threatening growth. The survey's index of current economic conditions slipped to 91.0 at the end of December -- the lowest since March 2003 -- from 92.1 in early December and from 91.5 in November. The reading of consumer expectations rose to 65.6 at the end of December from a mid-December reading of 63.2 and a November reading of 66.2. CONSUMERS' VIEW OF LONGER-TERM PROSPECTS IMPROVED The late-December strength was centered on an improvement in longer-term economic prospects, but the near-term outlook was still quite pessimistic, the report said. Consumers held very negative assessments of their personal financial situation, especially lower income households. Buying plans remained subdued, even among upper income households. Overall, the data are consistent with a growth rate in personal consumption expenditures of just 2.0 percent in 2008, with significantly weaker growth of about 1.0 percent in the first quarter. More than nine out of 10 consumers said that they had heard some negative news about the economy. Two-thirds of consumers reported that the economy had already worsened, and nearly as many expected bad economic times to persist in the year ahead. More consumers expected job losses to increase, with the unemployment rate moving to 5 percent by mid-2008. The long-term economic growth outlook improved, although half still anticipated some interruptions of economic growth, the survey said. GULF BETWEEN RICH AND POOR Record differences remained between consumers in the bottom third and the top third of income distribution: half of all consumers in the bottom tier reported worsening finances, while half of those in the top tier reported improving finances. Higher food and fuel prices were cited much more frequently by lower income households as the reason for worsening conditions. An inflation rate of 3.4 percent was expected for the year ahead in December, unchanged from November. Declines in home prices were reported by 31 percent of homeowners in December and 23 percent anticipated declines in the year ahead -- both record levels. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
