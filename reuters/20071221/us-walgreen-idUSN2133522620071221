 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) reported a better-than-expected rise in quarterly profit on Friday as cost controls offset weak sales of flu medications and a recall of cold medicines, sending the drugstore chain's shares up 7 percent. 

 Walgreen said payroll reductions were largely responsible for a drop in expenses as a percentage of sales. But sales were slower than anticipated as a warm autumn across much of the country delayed the flu season, holding down sales of medicines, vaporizers and related products. Net earnings rose to $455.5 million, or 46 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter ended November 30, from $431.7 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts' average forecast was 44 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 10.4 percent to $14.03 billion but were also hurt by the recall of certain nonprescription cough and cold medicines for infants and children due to the danger of overdose. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 5.4 percent, with a 4.6 percent increase for general merchandise, or "front end" goods, and a 5.9 percent increase for prescription drugs. The number of prescriptions filled in stores open at least a year rose 3.7 percent. Walgreen said it faced a tough comparison with the year-earlier period, when profit was boosted by the introduction of generic versions of blockbuster drugs such as cholesterol medicine Zocor and anti-depressant Zoloft, and by an influx of pharmacy patients after the introduction in 2006 of the Medicare Part D drug benefit. While generic drugs sell at lower prices than their branded counterparts, they are typically more profitable for drugstores. "Overall we did see a decrease in customer count (in older stores), starting in about mid-October when the sub-prime crisis became big news. We saw people trading down a little bit," said Chief Executive Jeffrey Rein on a conference call with analysts and investors. "With regard to the rest of the year, it is a tough economic environment right now. But we're not commenting on sales for this month or also how it's going to be for the rest of the year," Rein added. "We expect the first half of fiscal 2008 to remain challenging from a bottom-line perspective, as we cycle a very robust period of generic introductions ... however our long-term outlook for margins and sales remains strong and should improve in the second half of fiscal 2008 and beyond," Rein said. The company, one of the nation's biggest pharmacy chains, also offered a glimpse at a rare silver lining to the cloudy economic environment that has hurt sales at retailers. "We are in the neighborhood, we are close to home. With gas prices increasing, people are coming to our stores," Rein said on the call. The company also said it was seeing strong sales of its more profitable private-label goods "as the economy softens and consumers search for more value." "In my opinion we are recession-resistant, but we are not recession-proof," Rein said. The company said it opened 169 new stores in the first quarter and plans to open 550 new stores during fiscal 2008. As of November 30 it had 6,139 stores in 49 states and Puerto Rico. The company's shares were up $2.66 at $38.91 on the New York Stock Exchange. Including the gain, Walgreen shares are down about 15 percent this year, performing slightly better than its peers on the Standard & Poor's Retail Index .RLX, which is down nearly 18 percent.
