 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ), one of the 
largest U.S. drugstore operators, posted higher quarterly 
profit on Friday, helped by higher sales and cost controls. 

  The company reported net earnings of $455.5 million, or 46 
cents a share, for the fiscal first quarter ended November 30, 
compared with $431.7 million, or 43 cents a share, a year 
earlier.  Sales rose 10.4 percent to $14.03 billion, with sales at 
stores open at least a year up 5.4 percent.  (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; editing by John Wallace)
