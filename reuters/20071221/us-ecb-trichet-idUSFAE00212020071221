 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank must ensure that current levels of inflation are short-lived and do not lead to higher wage increases, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said in an interview published on Friday. 

 "It's our responsibility to make sure that this inflation is just temporary and doesn't spill over into the cost of living, and particularly that it doesn't affect wage negotiations," Trichet said in an interview published on the Web site of broadcaster EuroNews. Trichet also said that the euro zone faced a "more protracted" period of inflation than previously expected. (Reporting by  David Milliken ; editing by  David Stamp )
