 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors probing 
corruption accusations against the giant Samsung Group said on 
Friday they had narrowed their focus down to around 400 
accounts that might be linked to an alleged slush fund. 

  A former top legal executive with the country's biggest 
conglomerate last month accused Samsung of running a 200 
billion won ($212.7 million) fund to bribe public officials to 
avoid investigation into its operations.  "The list of accounts has become a lot shorter," a 
prosecution official said by telephone. "It's roughly about 300 
or 400."  Media reports have said the number of accounts searched by 
prosecutors was well in excess of 1,000.  The former Samsung employee, Kim Yong-cheol, said the firm 
hid the illicit funds in scores of deposit accounts in the 
names of current and former executives.  The company, whose group sales are equivalent to about a 
sixth of the entire economic output of the world's 13th largest 
economy, has denied any wrongdoing.  Prosecutors will hand over records of the accounts to a new 
team of investigators led by an independent counsel, which is 
expected to begin work in January, the official said.  The country's family-owned conglomerates, known as 
"chaebol," have been the backbone of its dramatic economic rise 
but in recent years a number of their top executives have been 
convicted of corruption, the result of what critics say have 
been too cozy ties between politicians and business leaders.  (Reporting by  Jack Kim , editing by Jonathan Thatcher)
