 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Shares in Circuit City Stores Inc CC.N plummeted 25 percent on Friday after the U.S. electronics retailer forecast a loss for the holiday shopping season. 

 The company also reported a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss. It had previously forecast a profit for the current quarter, which is typically the most profitable for many retailers since it includes the Christmas holiday. "It's a dire situation," said Alan Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz & Associates Inc., a Toledo, Ohio, investment advisory firm, which has a short position in Circuit City. "It goes back to the company releasing its best and highest-paid sales people" earlier this year, he added. Shares on the New York Stock Exchange were down 25.08 percent or $1.67 to $4.99 in the half-hour before the market's early close. Circuit City's loss contrasted sharply with main rival Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ), which reported a 52 percent jump in profit earlier this week and boosted its full-year forecast. Analysts expect electronics retailers to be winners this Christmas as gift-giving consumers buy fancy TVs and games. As Circuit City posted losses this year, some analysts have speculated that the retailer could be ripe for a takeover. "I do not see this company going to zero," Lancz said. "There is a national footprint, assets there that are going to be worth something to an acquirer strategically." The loss came to $207.3 million, or $1.26 a share, for the quarter ended November 30, compared with a loss of $20.4 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a noncash expense of $102.8 million, the loss was 64 cents in the latest period, wider than the loss of 31 cents a share expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell 3 percent to $2.96 billion, below the $3 billion analysts expected. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, fell 5.6 percent. Same-store sales fell 5.8 percent in the United States and 1.1 percent internationally.  BEST BUY WINNING "Circuit City's much weaker results should remind investors that Best Buy is a company in a much better competitive position, taking share, and has shown very solid execution even in a tough macro environment," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note. Circuit City said sales of flat-panel televisions, notebook computers, video games and navigation systems rose, but cited lower sales of projection and tube TVs and desktop computers. The Richmond, Virginia, retailer has cut costs in a bid to turn around its business amid an onslaught of competition from Best Buy and other chains such as Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ). This year, Circuit City restructured its headquarters and reorganized store leadership. It replaced more than 3,000 workers with lower-paid staff, a move criticized by analysts who said it cost the company sales. "The changes we made ... contributed to poor execution," Circuit City Chief Executive Philip Schoonover said during a conference call. He cited lower rates of sale closures and fewer sales of add-ons such as extended warranties that carry higher profit margins. Gross profit shrank to 19.1 percent of sales from 22.1 percent a year earlier. "You don't make high-end purchases without some guidance," Lancz said. "When you go to the store, you need your questions answered and that's where Circuit City missed the ball." Schoonover added that the company would "slow the rate of change in its business" and concentrate on improving close rates for sales. Last month, Circuit City said it had asked some former workers, including higher-paid staffers who were laid off earlier this year, to return. The company this week also said its board approved cash awards that will vest over a three-year period for senior-level executives in hopes of ensuring that they remain with the company. Circuit City said it now expects a "modest" loss from continuing operations for the fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting a fourth-quarter profit of 56 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Circuit City's shares were down $1.68, or 25.2 percent, to $4.98 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading after earlier hitting $4.93, a level last reached in March 2003. Best Buy was up 89 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $52.56. Circuit City's stock has fallen 72 percent this year, while Best Buy is up about 6 percent. (Editing by  Brian Moss ,  Leslie Gevirtz )
