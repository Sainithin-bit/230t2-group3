 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. personal spending jumped a much bigger-than-expected 1.1 percent in November, the sharpest rise in more than two years, while prices rose, a Commerce Department report showed on Friday. 

 Economists polled by Reuters were expecting a 0.6 rise in spending. The personal consumption expenditure price index, a key measure of inflation, rose 0.6 percent, the biggest gain since September 2005. Core PCE prices, which strip out food and energy costs, rose at a 0.2 percent rate, matching expectations. The year-on-year core PCE, a favorite inflation gauge of the Federal Reserve, climbed to 2.2 percent, the highest since March. The overall PCE index rose 3.6 percent from a year earlier, the steepest 12-month climb since October 2005. Real spending, which adjusts for inflation, rose 0.5 percent in November, the highest since December 2006. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell as the report showed inflation flaring above the 2 percent rate that is at the top of the Fed's ideal range. "Once again it appears the demise of the US consumer has been exaggerated," said Marc Chandler, head of global foreign exchange strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.
