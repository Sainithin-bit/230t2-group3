 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ) said on 
Thursday it agreed to sell its Godiva Chocolatier business for 
$850 million to Yildiz Holding A.S. 

  Yildiz is the owner of the Ulker ( ULKER.IS ) Group, a 
diversified food company based in Istanbul, Turkey. Campbell 
said the sale price represents a multiple of nearly 15 times 
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and appreciation 
(EBITDA)--a measure of cash flow.  Campbell had said in August that it would explore a 
possible sale of the luxury chocolate brand, since it did not 
fit into its core portfolio of soups, baked snacks and 
vegetable-based beverages, with brands such as Pepperidge Farms 
cookies and V8 vegetable juice.  At that time, analysts said Godiva could fetch more than $1 
billion for Campbell. About a month later, a news report said 
the company was seeking between $1 billion and $1.5 billion for 
the upscale chocolate business.  Godiva has annual sales of about $500 million, out of 
Campbell's total of more than $7.8 billion.  Ulker, the largest consumer goods company in Turkey's food 
industry, sells biscuits, chocolate, and beverages, had sales 
of $7.4 billion in 2006, according to a statement issued by 
Campbell. The company also has operations in the packaging, 
real estate and telecommunication sectors, Campbell said.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman  and  Michael Flaherty ,
