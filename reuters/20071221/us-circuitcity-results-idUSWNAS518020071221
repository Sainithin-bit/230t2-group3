 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Consumer electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc CC.N reported a wider third-quarter loss on Friday as sales fell and store changes disrupted business. 

 The loss came to $207.3 million, or $1.26 a share, for the quarter ended November 30, compared with a loss of $20.4 million, or 12 cents a share, a year earlier. Earlier this week, rival Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) reported a 52 percent jump in quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; editing by)
