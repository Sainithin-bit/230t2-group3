 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Fedex Corp ( FDX.N ) said on Friday that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service found that its FedEx Ground independent contractors should be reclassified as employees for tax purposes and that the company faced related taxes and penalties of more than $319 million for 2002. 

 The IRS is auditing similar issues for 2004 through 2006, the package delivery company said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. "Given the preliminary status of this matter, we cannot yet determine the amount or a reasonable range of potential loss. However, we do not believe that any loss is probable," Fedex said in the filing. The company also said that it has "strong defenses to the IRS's tentative assessment and will vigorously defend" its position that FedEx Ground's owner-operators are independent contractors. The filing came a day after Memphis, Tenn.-based FedEx warned that it faces "increase regulatory and legal uncertainty" over the independent contractor model it uses at FedEx Ground, which could result in higher costs. The company is fighting against a number of lawsuits claiming these contractors should be classified as employees. FedEx shares rose 66 cents, or 0.7 percent, to close at $94.29 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Julie Vorman  in Washington and  Nichola Groom  in Los Angeles, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
