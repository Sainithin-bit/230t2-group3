 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Shareholders suing officers and directors of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) refiled their claims on Wednesday to address a judge's ruling that some fraud complaints were too old and that the lawsuit contained scant details about wrongdoing by the company's top officials. 

 The second amended shareholder derivative complaint, filed late on Wednesday in San Jose federal court, adds four additional instances of alleged backdating by the Apple executive team and directors. The original lawsuit was filed in June of 2006. The new complaint tallies up proceeds of the exercise by Apple executives of the backdated options at more than $1 billion. It places the value of shares held by Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs that were received in exchange for backdated options at nearly $1 billion. The amended lawsuit, which grew to 153 pages from an original 86, also ties the Apple board closer to the backdating of shares to executives by alleging that the full board acted as the company's compensation committee when it signed off on options with false grant dates. It removes federal securities fraud claims arising before June of 2001 after U.S. District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled last month that the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. The suit still alleges breach of fiduciary duty under state law that occurred before 2001 on the grounds that the fraud was concealed by Apple management until recently, lead attorney Mark Molumphy, of Cotchett Pitre & McCarthy, said. In response to the judge's request, the new suit adds details about two 2001 backdating options that are also the focus of an U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit. An Apple spokesman could not be reached for comment. The case, brought on behalf of Apple shareholders against 13 current and former company directors and senior executives, seeks the return of any ill-gotten profits from the exercise of those options. Backdating itself is not illegal unless companies fail to record an expense for the options granted below the current market price at the time of the grant. Apple had to restate results last year to recognize an additional stock-based compensation expense of $105 million as a result of an internal audit. The suit also takes issue with an Apple special committee finding that only two former company executives engaged in backdating options. The special committee exonerated Jobs, saying he was not aware of stock options accounting rules and had not personally profited from the backdated shares. The lawsuit, however, alleges that Jobs was allowed to exchange 55 million backdated options for an equal value of Apple stock, which totaled 10 million shares. The 5.42 million shares that he has not yet sold are now worth about $993 million, the suit said. (Reporting by Gina Keating, editing by Richard Chang)
