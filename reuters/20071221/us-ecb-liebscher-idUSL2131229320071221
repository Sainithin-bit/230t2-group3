 VIENNA  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will do everything that is necessary to bring inflation in the euro zone back below 2 percent, Governing Council member Klaus Liebscher said in an interview published on Friday. 

 "The ECB will do everything that's necessary so that the inflation rate (in the euro zone) falls below 2 percent again in the medium term," he said in an advertisement for the Austrian central bank published in Austrian newspaper Kurier. He said that the ECB could live with short-term fluctuations blips inflation, such as the current one on the back of the oil and commodity price shock. "But what's important is that such price shocks don't intensify in second-round effects in wages and prices," he said. (Reporting by  Boris Groendahl )
