 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley, waylaid by subprime mortgage losses, paid co-presidents Walid Chammah and James Gorman a combined $17.9 million in restricted stock, but left Chief Executive John Mack out of the bonus pool. 

 The investment bank, which stunned Wall Street with $9.4 billion of losses on subprime mortgages and other assets, paid Chammah $9.44 million and Gorman $8.45 million in restricted stock, the company disclosed in regulatory filings on Friday. Mack said he would forego his bonus this year after receiving a $37 million compensation package last year. Chammah received about 174,000 shares of restricted stock and Gorman got 155,380 shares. Morgan Stanley shares closed up 5.84 percent on Friday at $54.37. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin )
