 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Olympic organizers staged a full dress rehearsal on Saturday for next week's opening ceremony at the Beijing Games, expected to be an epic production involving more than 10,000 performers and hi-tech wizardry. 

 Fireworks lit up the Beijing skyline as the show's creative team gave the outside world a glimpse of some of the pyrotechnics that will feature in the 3-1/2 hour extravaganza. Chinese workers involved in the Olympic project and some of their families and friends were given tickets for the lavish show, filling the 90,000-seat national stadium, dubbed the "Bird's Nest", to near capacity. A handful of journalists were also let in on condition they did not reveal anything about the ceremony before next Friday. Chinese director Zhang Yimou has worked on the project for three years and had hoped to keep its contents a secret, with everyone on his team signing a confidentiality contract. But his best efforts were partially thwarted last week when a South Korean television crew got into the first dress rehearsal and broadcast brief footage of the show. The footage showed aerial artists floating over the track, mass kung-fu formations and replica humpbacked whales cavorting round the rim of the Bird's Nest. Many in the audience on Saturday seemed impressed by what they had seen. "It was very beautiful and big. It showed a lot of Chinese history," said Wu Yu Pu, 23, as he left the stadium. A final dress rehearsal is scheduled for next week before the big night, which is expected to draw a global television audience of more than 4 billion viewers.
