 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bob Toll, co-founder and CEO of the U.S. luxury homebuilder bearing his name and best known for its "McMansions," announced his resignation on Monday, and will be replaced by a non-family member who has worked for the company for 20 years. 

 Toll Brothers said executive Vice President Douglas Yearley Jr, 50, will replace Toll, 69, effective June 16. Toll has been CEO since founding the company in 1967 with his brother Bruce. Toll Brothers, the 15th-largest U.S. builder by sales, is the largest builder of luxury homes. It popularized the large suburban homes on large lots known as "McMansions." Yearley joined the company in 1990 and made his name in the early 1990s acquiring land from banks and the government-owned Resolution Trust Corporation, which disposed of real estate that had been assets of failed savings and loan associations. He considers one of his major success stories the purchase of a tract of land in West Windsor, New Jersey, near Princeton University. Its development turned a huge profit because of its cut-rate purchase price and access to transit and jobs. Yearley has also overseen Toll Brothers' marketing and brand development group. FBN Securities analyst Joel Locker said the choice of Yearley made sense in light of the company's active land acquisition and development operations and his expertise in distressed land acquisition. The company's shares closed down 0.1 percent at $20.88 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff ; editing by  Leslie Gevirtz ,  Gary Hill )
