 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prominent Wall Street economist Henry Kaufman has resigned from the board of directors of bankrupt Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK, a regulatory filing showed on Monday. 

 Kaufman's resignation from the board was not due to any disagreement with Lehman, the filing said. Kaufman was once known as "Dr. Doom" for making the right call on higher inflation and interest rates when he was chief economist with Salomon Brothers in the 1970s and 1980s. He is now president of financial consulting firm Henry Kaufman & Co Inc in New York. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
