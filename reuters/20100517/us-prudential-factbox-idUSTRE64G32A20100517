 (Reuters) - Following are the main points on pricing and timing for British insurer Prudential Plc's $21 billion rights issue, a key component in financing its $35.5 billion offer for AIG's Asian subsidiary: 

 RIGHTS ISSUE PRICING Prudential shareholders can buy 11 rights issue shares for every two shares they currently own at 104 pence or HK$11.78 a share. Prudential will issue just under 14 billion new shares. The rights issue price is a 39.3 percent discount to the theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) based on Prudential's closing price of 542-1/2 pence on May 14. The rights issue is fully underwritten. TIMING The prospectus for the rights issue is due later Monday. Prudential's Hong Kong listing takes effect on May 25. Prudential needs approval from 75 per cent of its voting capital at a meeting on June 7. The new shares will start to trade in London on June 8, in Singapore on June 9 and in Hong Kong on June 10. WHAT ABOUT THE $35.5 BILLION PRICE TAG? Prudential will pay $25 billion in cash on completion of the deal, raised from the rights issue and the eventual proceeds of one or more bond offerings. AIG will receive $5.5 billion worth of shares in the new company, approximately 10.9 percent of the combined group's share capital on completion. The new company will issue AIG with $3 billion in mandatory convertible notes and $2 billion in Tier 1 capital. CASH COMPONENT MAY BE LOWERED AIG has agreed to buy a maximum of $1.88 billion of Prudential's newly issued debt securities through its subsidiary AIA Aurora LLC, the seller of AIA. Should AIG buy these securities, the cash component it receives will be reduced in an amount equal to the sum of subordinated notes for which AIG subscribes. Prudential's joint lead arrangers have underwritten a $5.4 billion hybrid capital facility ahead of the bond issuance. (Compiled by Victoria Howley and Douwe Miedema; Editing by  David Holmes )
