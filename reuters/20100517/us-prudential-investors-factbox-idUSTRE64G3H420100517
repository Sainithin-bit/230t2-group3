 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Prudential unveiled a $21 billion rights issue on Monday, offering new shares as it seeks to finance a planned acquisition of AIG's Asian insurance business. 

 Following are reactions relating to levels of shareholder support for the offer: AN UNNAMED TOP 30 INVESTOR: "The key takeaways are: they have got a more hybrid capital in there, they have got a standby facility as well which is good and the results are strong. "They have also confirmed something we didn't know before - the amount of capital that is semi-trapped. They have 5.2 billion pounds of surplus capital and on top of that they have 1.2 billion pounds which they have not included in that surplus. That is primarily from entities in Singapore and Thailand. So from a total capital perspective, the surplus is even stronger. "They have also provided a nice little sensitivity analysis of what happens if there is an instantaneous 20 percent fall in the markets. So if the markets almost halve, they would still be in a reasonable capital position. "These figures are a bit more reassuring and I am quite pleased with this at an initial glance, but we have got to delve into the detail and we have 1,000 pages to have a go at." DAVID CUMMING, HEAD OF UK EQUITIES, STANDARD LIFE "I think they will have quite a lot of trouble raising that cash, to be honest. I think they do supposedly have backers in Asia, particularly the government of Singapore, but I think it's still going to be a very difficult deal to execute. "I mean we and other shareholders believe the price is too high and the financial case for the deal hasn't been particularly well articulated, so I think they are going to have a difficult task getting this deal through. "When you're raising 14billion pounds, one needs a lot of strategic and financial precision and we didn't get that first time round and we are skeptical." "We're skeptical on price. They got into a mess in terms of capital, and we're not clear in terms of the strategy in terms of the UK business and indeed some of the Asian businesses they're buying, so we need a lot more new information and we are skeptical." (Cumming was speaking on BBC radio. Standard Life is the 17th largest investor in Prudential with a 0.78 pct stake) AN UNNAMED TOP 20 INVESTOR "They have priced pretty much as people expected but at least it's in play now. Roll on June 7th for the vote really. "The vote is a really, really difficult one to call. They had to offer a bit more in terms of underwriting fees. It's a big issue and we are at a very volatile point in markets as well. "It's always been a bit of risk that because they've bid an absolute amount against a fluctuating share price. You've got a problem of taking on market risk and you've got market risk at this point because of the volatility in the markets. "I think if Capital (Capital Management) were actively against it, I don't think Pru would have risked it because you can't have such a big holder against the deal when you need 75 percent approval." PAUL MUMFORD, ASSET MANAGER, CAVENDISH ASSET MANAGEMENT "The size of the right issue is largely as expected but it is a huge amount of money to actually get hold off. "From the first quarter figures, it looks as though the company is trading pretty well in its own right without the acquisition. Personally, I'm feeling a bit dubious as to whether it is the best thing for shareholders. "They have got some punchy targets looking forward in terms of profitability of the group, but it does rely on the Far Eastern markets. They have got more eggs in one basket than before the issue. "The initial reaction of the market was to mark the price down. It's recovered a bit, but that's still down which is understandable." (Cavendish has a 2.5 million pound holding in Prudential) A SECOND UNNAMED TOP 20 INVESTOR "Today's announcement is not a game changer. I expect Prudential management are relieved that they have finally come out with it, but it doesn't really change anything materially. If you were against the deal before, you will still be against it. "On the cost side, they look to be slightly better but again it's not material to really change our view. It will depend to a large degree on how management present when they have their final meetings with investors in the next few days but I don't see them really departing from the script. It will be a pretty close run thing." TIDJANE THIAM, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, PRUDENTIAL "We were talking about financial returns and profits, but in the absence of detailed financial information it was impossible for them to make a (decision), quite simply. "We have been very keen to get to this point today where we can finally tell the full story. If you want an analogy, we were a little bit like a fighter fighting with one arm behind his back. We were handicapped, we weren't able to answer a lot of questions, which was frustrating for our shareholders. "They have been quite supportive in this period... and have given us the benefit of the doubt and the chance to come out today and tell our story. We are confident, the quality of this story is phenomenal." DAVID BUIK, BGC PARTNERS "All I can say is that Mr Thiam must have tapped his major institutional shareholders about the need for this money and must he have satisfied them. "This would be an amazing achievement in the light of the current market, as sentiment is fairly negative."
