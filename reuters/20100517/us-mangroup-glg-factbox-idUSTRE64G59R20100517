 (Reuters) - London-listed hedge fund manager Man Group ( EMG.L ) announced a deal to buy New York-listed GLG Partners GLG.N for $1.6 billion. 

 Below are details on the two companies: MAN GROUP * Man moved into alternative investments in 1983 and is the world's largest listed hedge fund firm with $39.1 billion under management. In March 2008 it ran $74.6 billion. * Its flagship fund is AHL, a $21.1 billion 'black box' computer-driven strategy that tries to make money by following trends in global futures markets. * In the 12 months to December 28, 2009 AHL fell 16.4 percent, underperforming its peers, with losses wiping out $1.2 billion from Man's assets in the fourth quarter. * Man's fund of funds arm runs $14.6 billion. Its RMF fund of funds business, which was later merged into other Man units, was found to have around a $360 million exposure to U.S. fraudster Bernard Madoff. GLG * GLG came to the U.S. stock market via a reverse acquisition in 2007. * It manages $23.7 billion as at end-March. * It runs $12.3 billion in long-only funds following the acquisition of Societe Generale's UK long-only asset management business last year. * It was in the news in 2008 with the resignation of Australian star manager Greg Coffey, who ran $7 billion in assets at GLG and who earned an estimated $300 million in 2007, according to Alpha Magazine. Coffey later joined Louis Bacon's firm Moore Capital. * In 2006 former GLG fund manager Philippe Jabre was fined a record 750,000 pounds by Britain's Financial Services Authority for market abuse.
