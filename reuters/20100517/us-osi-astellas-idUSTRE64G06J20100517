 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Astellas Pharma ( 4503.T ), Japan's No. 2 drugmaker, agreed to buy U.S. biotech OSI Pharmaceuticals OSIP.O for $4 billion in cash in a sweetened bid that will add OSI's blockbuster cancer drug Tarceva to its line-up. 

 Astellas has been chasing OSI as it seeks to bolster a nascent cancer drug business as a future earnings pillar amid falling earnings in its core, transplant and urinary therapeutic areas. It marks the biggest deal ever for Astellas and the latest move by a Japanese pharmaceutical company to snap up a U.S. biotech, such as Takeda Pharmaceutical's ( 4502.T ) acquisition of Millennium Pharmaceuticals to gain the cancer drug Velcade. Astellas will pay $57.50 per OSI share, 11 percent more than a previously proposed $52. The new price represents a 55 percent premium to OSI's last closing price before Astellas launched a hostile bid on March 1. "It's positive that it was cheaper than some market expectations of over $60 a share. But it will take a while for Astellas to generate synergies from the acquisition," said Atsushi Seki, a drugs analyst at Barclays Capital. OSI shares were off 4 percent at $57.38 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq as the price eased to become more in line with the announced sale price. They had closed up 4.4 percent at $59.80 on Friday with investors betting on a higher final price from Astellas or another bidder joining the process. Astellas, which sells the urinary drug Flomax and transplant drug Prograf, wants OSI to boost its U.S. profile and oncology presence as it faces generic competition for its flagship drugs, which recently lost patent protection in the United States. The Japanese drugmaker said it has extended its tender offer that was to have expired on Monday until June 2 "unless further extended." It said 229,214 shares of OSI had been tendered in and not withdrawn as of May 14. "As for how many shares we may obtain, we will carry out the tender offer, targeting at least 90 percent," Astellas President and CEO Masafumi Nogimori told a news conference. The boards of directors of both companies have unanimously approved the deal, Astellas said in a statement. "Buying OSI carries a major strategic significance for us. Most importantly, the deal will enable the early establishment of our cancer business base," Nogimori said. The takeover could raise the profile of 62-year-old Nogimori, who has led the company's biggest M&A drive. While rivals Takeda, Eisai ( 4523.T ) and Daiichi Sankyo ( 4568.T ) have cut billion-dollar overseas deals, Nogimori has been viewed as a humble, ordinary man, with plenty to prove. "Investors were worried that Astellas might fail to buy a foreign firm again. That they have managed to clinch the deal will probably wipe out investor anxiety about Astellas' management," said Seki at Barclays. RIGHT MOVE Astellas expects the deal to add 34 billion yen in revenue in the year to March 2011, and predicts OSI earnings will grow in the years ahead to contribute an operating profit, after amortization, by March 2015. Astellas shares were off slightly at 3,135 yen compared with a broader market  .N225  that closed down 2.2 percent. Tarceva, which generated $1.2 billion in sales last year, is currently approved as a second-line treatment for patients whose lung cancer has worsened after at least one round of chemotherapy. OSI hopes to expand Tarceva's approved use for first-line maintenance therapy for lung cancer, meaning the drug would be given to patients earlier in the disease and potentially for several months longer. OSI's management has touted the company as a rare profitable mid-cap biotech company fully integrated with discovery and commercial capabilities. The OSI bid is Astellas' second attempt to push into the U.S. market after it failed last year with a hostile bid for CV Therapeutics. Then, Astellas refused to raise its offer and lost out to rival Gilead Sciences ( GILD.O ).
