 BRISBANE  (Reuters) - Australia's federal government is aiming to wrap up consultation talks with miners over its plans for a new tax as soon as possible to help investment decisions, Resources and Energy Minister Martin Ferguson said on Monday. 

 Ferguson acknowledged the proposed tax could put on ice the final investment decisions of three major coal-seam gas export projects, owned by energy firms Britain's BG Group, Australia Santos Ltd and Origin Energy Ltd. The government has unveiled a new tax regime, also known as the Resource Super Profits Tax, which would impose a 40 percent tax on Australia's miners "super profits" -- currently defined as returns above the 10-year government bond yield of less than 6 percent. The plan has sparked strong opposition from the energy and mining sector, with heavyweights such as Xstrata Plc, BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc, saying they would review new investments in the country.
