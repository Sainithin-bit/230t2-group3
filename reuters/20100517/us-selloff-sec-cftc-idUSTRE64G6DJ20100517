 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A panel advising U.S. market regulators will meet on May 24 to discuss the mysterious market plunge, the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday. 

 Nobel laureate economist Joseph Stiglitz will be a member of the committee to advise the SEC and fellow market regulator the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC said. For more than a week, regulators have been trying to determine what caused the Dow Jones industrial average to drop nearly 1,000 points in minutes on May 6 before paring its losses. The joint SEC-CFTC advisory panel is expected to examine regulators' preliminary findings, which are due to be released on Monday. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
