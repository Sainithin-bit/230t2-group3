 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Prudential unveiled a $21 billion rights issue on Monday, offering new shares as it seeks to finance a planned acquisition of AIG's Asian insurance business. 

 Following are reactions from shareholders, analysts and traders to the offer: BARRIE CORNES, ANALYST, PANMURE GORDON "Whilst it's still probably on a bit of a knife edge, people will perhaps warm to it. I think the key will be the fact that the economics of AIA from November 30 and toward completion of the deal will look more attractive, and as such it's not such an ask in terms of the price. "Not surprisingly they've come out with comments about the UK being core and no decision made, which is what you'd expect. It'll be interesting to see whether the UK is part of the group medium term. I think nothing will happen until this deal completes if it does, but thereafter I certainly feel it's something that could be sold." MARCUS BARNARD, ANALYST, ORIEL SECURITIES "There are some quite ambitious targets for new business growth in there. Increasing the value of AIA's new business from $600 million to $1.7 billion sounds pretty go-ey. "Clearly we've got more detail now, and some targets we can hang our hat on." BARRIE CORNES, ANALYST, PANMURE GORDON "We are comfortable with our 'buy' recommendation. We believe that there is and has always been a strong strategic logic to the deal with only the price and execution being our concern. "It is very early to form a cast iron view but we believe that either the proposed deal will fail to achieve the required 75 percent hurdle rate and the shares will bounce or investors will take comfort from improving economics (despite the recent banana skins) and the shares will rally. "With the caveat over the price being paid (which we believe will look less unattractive as time goes on) and the integration/execution risk, we believe that there is very little downside risk in the share price with the shares currently trading at a 14 percent discount to our 2010F Embedded Value." DAVID BUIK, BGC PARTNERS "All I can say is that Mr. Thiam must have tapped his major institutional shareholders about the need for this money and must he have satisfied them. "This would be an amazing achievement in the light of the current market, as sentiment is fairly negative. Sales are good with 807 million achieved in the last trading period." SAM WRIGHT, EQUITY TRADER, SPREADEX "It has a lot of work to do in terms of marketing and asset sales, but press reports at the weekend highlight that there is plenty of Asian interest in providing capital if the deal is not well-supported here." PAUL MUMFORD, ASSET MANAGER, CAVENDISH ASSET MANAGEMENT "The size of the right issue is largely as expected but it is a huge amount of money to actually get hold off. "From the first quarter figures, it looks as though the company is trading pretty well in its own right without the acquisition. Personally, I'm feeling a bit dubious as to whether it is the best thing for shareholders. "They have got some punchy targets looking forward in terms of profitability of the group, but it does rely on the Far Eastern markets. They have got more eggs in one basket than before the issue. "The initial reaction of the market was to mark the price down. It's recovered a bit, but that's still down which is understandable." (Cavendish has a 2.5 million pound holding in Prudential) WENLI YUAN, ANALYSST, CELENT "Prudential's operation in India is much larger than AIG. Hence the sale of Indian operations will not have a significant impact on Prudential's overall operations." "In China, Prudential will have to consolidate its business post the acquisition to meet the regulatory requirement." EAMONN FLANAGAN, ANALYST, SHORE CAPITAL "Much of the above had already been flagged by the media in the past few weeks, especially regarding the tussle with the FSA. As ever, the devil is likely to be in the detail of the prospectus, to be published later today. For now, we reiterate our 'buy' recommendation on the stock." "Q1 2010 new business figures from Pru were excellent." UNNAMED TOP-20 INVESTOR "There are no real surprises in the pricing of the deal. The discount of 39 percent is standard for this sort of deal. But I don't think it's going to be easy for them to get the backing of enough shareholders. They will struggle to get the vote through."
