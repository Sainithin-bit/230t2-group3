 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The costs to insure the debt of Goldman Sachs Group Inc fell on Tuesday after the bank reported a stronger-than-forecast rise in quarterly earnings. 

 Goldman's credit default swaps tightened to about 142 basis points, from 150 basis points late on Monday, according to Phoenix Partners Group data. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by W Simon)
