 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global shares eked out gains on Tuesday after blowout results at Goldman Sachs boosted hope corporate earnings for the second quarter will prove strong, but oil prices fell on troubling signs of weak demand. 

 The yen fell and the U.S. dollar struggled against most major currencies as Goldman's earnings and U.S. retail sales in June surpassed expectations, stoking hopes for economic recovery and reducing flows into the dollar driven by risk aversion. But traders were cautious before the release of earnings from other U.S. banks this week, while lackluster sentiment data from Germany weighed on the euro. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond traded more than two points lower in price as a sell-off in government debt markets deepened on profit-taking from a month long rally. Profits at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) surged 33 percent as trading results nearly doubled, trouncing expectations and putting the bank on pace for windfall bonuses that could draw more unwanted public scrutiny. But analysts said much of the day's news, including Goldman's profits, was already accounted for after optimism that banks' earnings will be stronger than anticipated lifted the major U.S. stock indexes more than 2.0 percent on Monday. Investors were also cautious with other major companies set to post results later this week, including Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and General Electric ( GE.N ), and as doubts persisted about the economy. Much of a 0.6 percent gain in U.S. retail sales was driven by higher gas prices, suggesting consumers remained wary of stepping up discretionary spending. Retail sales registered a fourth consecutive monthly decline. A rebound in sales is considered vital for the U.S. economy to bounce back from recession, as consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the country's economic activity. "The consumer remains extremely weak and that's the biggest headwind we face, in terms of the economy picking up steam," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. "As a result, investors face a large amount of uncertainty over the near term as to the next direction for the market." Intel ( INTC.O ) is expected after the closing bell on Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 27.81 points, or 0.33 percent, at 8,359.49. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 4.79 points, or 0.53 percent, at 905.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 6.52 points, or 0.36 percent, at 1,799.73. Banking shares led European stocks higher, with the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closing up 1.2 percent at 840.15 points. A slight rise in risk appetite supported higher-yielding currencies and those tied to commodities, such as Canada's dollar, which hit a three-week high against the greenback. The U.S. dollar and yen tend to fall when risk appetite rises as investors target higher-yielding currencies and assets such as stocks and commodities. The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.03 percent at 80.147. The euro was down 0.24 percent at $1.3943, while against the yen, the dollar was up 0.38 percent at 93.32. A recent rally in U.S. Treasuries may have run its course after benchmark yields, which move inversely to prices, have fallen to a seven-week low of 3.26 on Monday from 4.00 percent in early June, analysts said. "We had a nice run in June, we moved a long way in fairly short order, and that is usually a prescription for profit taking in overbought conditions," said David Coard, head of fixed-income sales and trading at The Williams Capital Group in New York. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 25/32 in price to yield 3.45 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was down 3/32 in price to yield 0.94 percent. U.S. crude fell 17 cents to settle at $59.52 a barrel, extending a decline that shaved 11 percent from the price last week. London Brent crude rose 17 cents to $60.86 a barrel. The loss came after data showed disappointing U.S. consumer spending alongside a larger-than-expected increase in producer prices -- a reflection of inflation. In a sign of soft demand in the United States, the world's leading energy user, Mastercard SpendingPulse said gasoline consumption over the peak travel July 4 holiday was 4.3 percent lower than a year ago. New York gold futures ended a tad higher as greater-than-expected increase in U.S. producer prices and retail sales in June boosted bullion's appeal as an inflation hedge. Gold futures for August delivery settled up 30 cents at $922.80 an ounce in New York. Asian stocks gained, as a rally in U.S. financial shares helped Japan snap a losing streak. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  rose 2.3 percent, while MSCI's index of stocks elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 3.4 percent.
