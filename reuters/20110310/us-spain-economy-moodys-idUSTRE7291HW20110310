 MADRID  (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's slashed Spain's sovereign credit rating by a notch to Aa2 on Thursday and warned of further cuts, saying the country's plans to clean up the battered banking sector will cost more than the government expects and add to its debt burden. 

 The Bank of Spain is due to publish the capital needs of all Spanish banks on Thursday after the market close, which will indicate which banks need to raise funds to meet government targets, part of measures to inject credibility into the financial system brought low by a property bust. COMMENTARY JUAN RODRIGUEZ REY, BANCO SABADELL "This is clearly negative. I'm not sure up to what point, but it will certainly impact the banks. Obviously the direct consequence is that it will be harder and more expensive to access financing." SILVIO PERUZZO, RBS "The downgrade is not really a surprise. Most of what Moody's is saying has already been priced in and Moody's is just catching up with the state of play in the Eurozone periphery." "Moody's hiking of its estimates of Spanish banks' capital shortfalls is not great news considering the Bank of Spain's announcement of capital ratios coming out this afternoon."
