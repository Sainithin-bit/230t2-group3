 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany played down the chances of sealing a debt crisis breakthrough at a euro zone summit on Friday and made clear it opposed allowing the bloc's rescue fund to buy the bonds of troubled states on the secondary market. 

 Leaders from the 17-nation euro area meet in Brussels on Friday to discuss new measures to fight a crisis that has deepened in recent days, with both Greece and Spain suffering ratings downgrades that have weighed on the single currency. This week's summit comes two weeks before a March 24-25 meeting at which EU leaders have promised to unveil a comprehensive new package of anti-crisis steps. The euro zone remains divided on how to proceed, with Germany and a handful of allies including Finland and Netherlands reluctant to bow to calls to alleviate the burden on crisis-hit countries like Greece and Ireland. A day before the summit, a senior German official told reporters that focus of Friday's meeting would be the "competitiveness pact" that Berlin and Paris proposed last month, saying no decisions would be taken on boosting the bloc's rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF). "The German government does not believe it is the right time to discuss this," the official said, requesting anonymity. He also said Berlin opposed using the EFSF or its planned successor fund, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), to buy the bonds of troubled member states on the secondary market or lend to them so they can repurchase their own debt. "We are not in favor of the buying of bonds on the secondary market," the official said, making clear he was referring to both direct and indirect purchases. The official left open the door, however, to primary market bond buys, which would presumably involve using the fund to buy debt in auctions. Asked about market turbulence following the downgrades of Greece and Spain, the official played down the need for urgent action, reiterating that member states would unveil their wider package later this month.
