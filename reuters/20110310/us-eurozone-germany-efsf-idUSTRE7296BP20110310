 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers in a closed-door meeting on Thursday that Germany could agree to increase the lending capacity of Europe's EFSF rescue fund if lower-rated euro members contributed capital, sources said on Thursday. 

 "Merkel stressed this should be achieved through a mix of additional guarantees and capital," one of the sources who attended the meeting said. Additional guarantees would come from AAA-rated countries, while lower-rated countries would contribute capital, Merkel told members of the Bundestag's European affairs committee, the sources said. Some lower-rated euro zone members have already signaled that they are unwilling to contribute capital in order to boost the fund's lending capacity to 440 billion euros. A decision on whether to increase the fund is due as part of a complete package to be agreed at a 27-nation European Union summit on March 24/25. Leaders of the 17-nation euro currency area are meeting in Brussels on Friday and are expected to back a watered-down version of a German-French plan to boost economic competitiveness. But they are unlikely to overcome sharp differences over the size and scope of the rescue fund then. The sources said Merkel had also expressed a willingness to ease the debt burdens of Greece and Ireland in return for pledges from those countries. As examples, she cited movement from Greece on privatizations and from Ireland on the corporate tax base issue. (Reporting by Andreas Rinke; editing by  Noah Barkin )
