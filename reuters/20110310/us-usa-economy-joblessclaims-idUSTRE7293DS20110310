 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, a government report showed on Thursday, but held below a key level associated with labor market recovery. 

 The U.S. trade deficit widened much more than expected in January to $46.3 billion, as surging imports of oil, capital goods and cars overpowered record exports. KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 397,000, the Labor Department said, after falling to a 2-1/2 year low the prior week. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 378,000. The prior week's figure was revised slightly up to 371,000 from the previously reported 368,000. * Analysts had expected the trade gap to grow moderately to $41.5 billion, from a revised estimate of $40.3 billion in December. * The closely watched trade gap with China also widened in January. * Led by higher oil prices, U.S. imports of goods and services leapt 5.2 percent in January to $214.1 billion for the largest month-to-month gain since March 1993. COMMENTS: ERIC GREEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND HEAD OF RATES STRATEGY, TD SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "It's not as bad as it looks, we were looking for a pretty sizable expansion in the net export deficit and we're getting it so we are not changing out assumptions for growth at 3.2 percent next quarter based on this number. What you are going to see is a lot of the drag coming from the net export side showing up in inventories, so a lot of that is going to be balanced out by a stronger contribution on the inventory side." "The key point in the January data is that it has nothing to do with oil, it is not an oil affected report. The ex-petroleum deficit actually rose by around $5 billion so most of the gain is not petroleum. This is actually a pretty bullish number. I would look at this as more of a reflection of strength than weakness and when you look at this in terms of how the numbers play out in Q1 GDP there is less of an effect than one might think." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES IN TORONTO: "I think the jobless number, though people are suggesting the direction is right, shows that any improvements are gradual. On the trade number, I believe we would need to see a much lower number to bring confidence on the dollar given the issues of higher oil prices and consumer activity. We could see markets go lower from here, both in stocks and bonds. "Overseas issues continue to play a role in U.S. markets. The situation in Europe isn't complete, the market continues to have concerns about sovereign credit. Markets have been hoping that China would lead the recovery, but when you put this data with slower growth out of China, the idea that everything looks normal is going away. The focus has been on the positive, but some of these negatives are coming back." HOWARD SIMONS, STRATEGIST, BIANCO RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "This is where our tough nut's going to be to crack. The whole year I've been saying to people that we were going to have an uneven recovery with two very important sectors lagging. One is housing, and the other is employment. It's going to be a long time before we start putting people back to work because what we've been doing here is trying to get our economy going again by creating another financial bubble. "Whereas a factory can hire people, a stock certificate cannot. This is where QE-2 is always going to fail." VIMOMBI NSHOM, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS: On jobless claims: "As initial claims had recently undergone two noteworthy declines in the two weeks prior (down a combined 42k to 371k claims), today's rebound of 397,000 individuals initiating the qualification process to receive unemployment benefits for the week ending March 5, is not that much of a surprise. Although there is nothing unusual in this week's data, the seasonally-adjusted rise of 26k is slightly more than what history would have predicted to occur." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS: On trade deficit: "January's trade deficit of $46.3 bln is the widest since June 2010 and well above both the expected $41.5 bln and the December outcome of $40.3 bln (revised from $40.6 bln). The explanation for the surprise lies with a rebound in imports of 5.2 percent (the largest since March 1993, and the highest on record in USD terms). Exports saw respectable growth of 2.7 percent. These numbers suggest underlying demand continues to recover. The wider than expected January trade deficit will see Q1 GDP forecasts trimmed, but it is likely that the surge in imports will be reflected in rising inventories."
