 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clearwire Corp CLWR.O CEO Bill Morrow has resigned, two other top executives are leaving and the finance chief is moving to an operational role in a massive management shakeup at the wireless service provider. 

 Morrow will be replaced on an interim basis by Chairman John Stanton, according to the company, which is seeking billions in funding to expand its high-speed wireless network. Chief Commercial Officer Mike Sievert and its Chief Information Officer Kevin Hart are also leaving, Clearwire said. Chief Financial Officer Erik Prusch was promoted to the role of Chief Operating Officer and the company's treasure Hope Cochran will become CFO. The company said it does not expect the change in leadership to hurt its progress in resolving a dispute with 54 percent owner Sprint Nextel ( S.N ).
