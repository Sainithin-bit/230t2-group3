 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan is lining up its options on what more it can do to support the disaster-struck economy and its further actions will largely depend on how markets, the yen in particular, will perform. 

 Shortly after a deadly 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami struck Japan's northeast, leaving nearly 22,000 dead or missing and some 350,000 homeless, the central bank stepped in, doubling its asset buying plan and flooding the banking system with cash to calm jittery markets. It later followed up by joining forces with other G7 central banks in a currency intervention to keep a rallying yen from inflicting further damage to an economy hit by the world's costliest natural disaster. BOJ Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said last week the central bank would act "appropriately" after scrutinizing data that will offer more clues on the quake's damage on the economy, signaling more easing down the road. Now BOJ policymakers are trying to decide on the next steps while there is little clarity of the overall impact of the disaster, which the government estimates caused up to nearly $310 billion in material damage. The most likely policy easing would be a further increase in the bank's asset buying scheme, ramped up to 10 trillion yen ($123 billion)just days after the disaster, sources familiar with the BOJ thinking said. Another option is to boost the size of a 30-trillion-yen fund for fixed-rate market operations, the sources said. But it would take a severe market shock, such as the yen's spike to new highs or a plunge in the BOJ's quarterly tankan sentiment survey, for the central bank to loosen policy at its next rate review on April 6-7. More probable for now is that the next meeting will focus on helping companies directly affected to get funding repairs, the sources said. One way to do this is to offer refinancing to commercial banks and government institutions that provide emergency loans, government sources said. The BOJ could also consider buying more corporate bonds and commercial paper directly from the market at the first sign of those markets seizing up, some analysts say, although it looks a remote possibility for now. NON-OPTION One option that the BOJ is certainly not entertaining is a suggestion that the central bank could help the government by taking up a big issue of emergency bonds. Both Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda and Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano quickly denied such a plan existed, echoing the BOJ's argument that underwriting government debt would erode confidence in the yen. So far there were no signs that the government would try to pressure the BOJ to do so and the central bank is determined to resist any possible attempts. "Whatever happens, it's something the BOJ should not and will not do," said one of the sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking. Instead, at some point in the future it may consider buying more long-term government bonds from the market than the current 21.6 trillion yen per year, some BOJ officials say. The BOJ would justify the move as meeting an increase in long-term fund demand for disaster relief, although it could also address government concerns that increased bond sales could push up borrowing rates. The BOJ has two scheduled policy-setting meetings next month, one on April 6-7 and another on April 28, when it issues its long-term economic and price forecasts and when it would be more likely to top up its asset-buying pool again. "If the BOJ sees the impact from the quake heightening downside risks to its forecasts for a moderate economic recovery, it could boost its asset-buying scheme as early as on April 28," said Naomi Hasegawa, senior fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities in Tokyo. Analysts, however, say that after the BOJ pegged rates virtually at zero and pledged funds for purchases of a range of assets there is not much else it can do to help the economy beyond continuing to pump liquidity into the money market. "The ball is in the government's court," said Yasunari Ueno, chief market economist at Mizuho Securities in Tokyo. "Currency intervention was one thing. The next thing it needs to do is to come up with a credible fiscal spending plan."
