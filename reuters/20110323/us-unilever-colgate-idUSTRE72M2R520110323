 (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) said it will buy Sanex personal care brand in Europe from Unilever PLC ( ULVR.L ) for about $940 million to expand in the higher-margin personal care and pet nutrition businesses. 

 Colgate said it also agreed to sell its laundry detergent business in Colombia to Unilever for $215 million. Colgate said the deals are expected to add, on a combined basis, of about 4 percent on total company earnings in 2011. (Reporting by NR Sethuraman; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)
