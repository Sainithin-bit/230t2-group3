 WASHINGTON/DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( TM.N )( 7203.T ) will slow some U.S. production due to supply disruptions caused by the fallout from the earthquake in Japan. 

 The company said it told employees on Wednesday that it would "incur some non-production time" at American plants but the size and pace of the slowdown has not been determined yet. (Reporting by  John Crawley  and  Deepa Seetharaman )
