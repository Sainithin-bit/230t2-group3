 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's government said on Wednesday it will expand the type of small and medium-sized companies that can access its emergency loan guarantee scheme, as part of an effort to ease the effects of the March 11 earthquake. 

 The government will tap a 36 trillion yen ($444 billion) fund put in place since the Lehman crisis to offer loan guarantees to small firms in 82 business sectors from April, up from the originally planned 48 sectors. Under the scheme, the government will offer guarantees for eligible small firms when they borrow from commercial banks. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which is in charge of the scheme, said it did not have an estimate of the total amount of guarantees that will be extended in the six months from April.
