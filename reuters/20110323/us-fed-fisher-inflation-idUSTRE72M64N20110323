 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank must be "extremely wary" not to let price pressures take hold in the U.S. as they seem to be doing in parts of Europe, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday. 

 In an interview with Reuters in Berlin, Fisher - one of the U.S. central bank's most-hawkish policymakers - said signs have emerged that U.S. businesses are passing on higher costs to consumers. He also said the Fed must be prepared to take steps to offset high oil prices if it became clear they were becoming a permanent feature of the U.S. economy. "We are going to have to be extremely wary and vigilant on this front to make sure that this doesn't take grip in the United States as it has apparently in the case of England and possibly within the EC," Fisher said, referring to general price pressures. Fisher's comments highlight divisions at the U.S. central bank as the Fed nears the end of its $600 billion bond-buying plan, meant to counter both persistently high unemployment and uncomfortably low inflation. The purchases began in November and are slated to run through June. Fisher and a handful of other hawkish U.S. central bankers have warned the program may set the stage for future inflation. Ongoing upheaval in the Middle East has lifted oil prices above $100 a barrel, boosting inflation expectations to their highest since 2008. But the Fed's policy-making core, led by Chairman Ben Bernanke, have so far sounded few alarms. The U.S. central bank's continued commitment to monetary easing contrasts with signals across the Atlantic that higher interest rates will not be long in coming. Top European Central Bank officials have suggested they will look to raise interest rates as early as next month to rein in excessive risk-taking and inflationary pressures. Traders have also begun betting that the Bank of England may tighten in coming months, as inflation runs at more than double the 2 percent target rate. The number of policymakers favoring interest-rate hikes held steady at three, minutes from this month's Bank of England policy meeting showed, with six still backing rates at a record low of 0.5 percent. Criticizing the Fed's policy of quantitative easing earlier on Wednesday, Fisher equated the decision to buy $600 billion in Treasury securities with monetizing U.S. Treasury debt, and called it a "dangerous course to follow." He has said he will oppose any extension of the program beyond June. U.S. monetary policy probably won't be affected in the long term by Japan's earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, he said, although it is still too early to calculate the toll on the U.S. economy. Fisher also warned that investors could begin demanding higher interest rates on U.S. debt if U.S. lawmakers did not "get their act together" and map out a credible fiscal plan. "At some point the markets will vote against it. Thus far they've been tolerant and also we've benefited from a rush to quality," said Fisher, who is a voter on monetary policy this year. "But I wouldn't trust that for too long. We have to get our act together and to me that is the responsibility of the fiscal authorities. The Fed has done its job." Earlier, at a lunch with a small group of reporters, Fisher said that Spain was doing "a very good job" in pushing through economic reforms to restore confidence in its finances. "I think Spain will surprise people," he said, stressing that it was important to distinguish Spain from other troubled euro zone countries like Greece and Portugal. "I think markets are not taking this into consideration enough," he said. (Reporting by Noah Barkin; Editing by Andrew Hay)
