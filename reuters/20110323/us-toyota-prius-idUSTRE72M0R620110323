 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Wednesday it would delay the launch in Japan of two new additions to the Prius line-up, a wagon and a minivan, from the originally planned end-April due to production disruptions from this month's devastating earthquake. 

 The world's biggest automaker has suspended production at all of its 12 domestic assembly plants at least through March 26 and has estimated a production loss of 140,000 vehicles until then. (Reporting by Kentaro Sugiyama and  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
