 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - LandAmerica Financial Group Inc LFG.N a title insurance company, said on Tuesday it was eliminating 1,100 jobs as mortgage loan volume in the United States declines. 

 The company said severance payments linked to the layoffs will cut into pre-tax earnings in the third and fourth quarters. LandAmerica is the latest company to get hit by the slowdown of the U.S. housing sector. CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) said earlier on Tuesday it was eliminating 550 jobs as it closes its mortgage lending operations. Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co LEND.O last week said it was cutting 1,600 jobs. Layoffs are seen by many analysts as a sign the mortgage sector is not likely to return to prior levels anytime soon. LandAmerica said it was cutting the equivalent of 1,100 full-time jobs in the second half of 2007 and had laid off 300 employees since July 1 as part of that target. The insurer laid off about 700 employees in the first half of the year, a company spokesman said. LandAmerica also said its board had approved buying back up to 1.5 million shares, or about 9 percent of its outstanding common stock, between now and the end of March 2009. That buyback approval was in addition to a share repurchase authorization under which the company can still buy about 710,400 shares through October 2008. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
