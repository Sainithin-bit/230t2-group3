 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Pharmacy-benefits manager Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N said on Tuesday it agreed to buy PolyMedica Corp PLMD.O for $1.2 billion, in a move to expand its diabetes care services. 

 Medco currently manages more than $6.5 billion in drug spending for its 2.8 million patients with diabetes. The PolyMedica acquisition is expected to add 1 million members. The deal would allow Medco, which now primarily distributes drugs to diabetics, to boost its sales of diabetes-care products such as blood-glucose meters and strips and package them together with prescription medicines like insulin. "This is a good acquisition for Medco that fits its strategy of moving away from a mere drug middleman into the evolution of managing overall disease states," said Constantine Davides, an analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group. Under terms of the deal, Medco will pay $53 per share of PolyMedica, a 17 percent premium to PolyMedica's closing price of $45.29 on Monday on the Nasdaq. Diabetes represents one of the fastest growing segments of health care, largely because of increasing incidence of obesity, which is highly linked to the disease. Diabetics make up 5 percent of the U.S. population, but account for more than 15 percent of total drug spending, Medco said. The acquisition is part of Medco's efforts to expand its business that handles specialty medicines. Medicines prescribed by specialists have been one of the main growth areas in the pharmaceutical market. Such drugs are often more modern biotech products that are expensive or require special handling. Medco broadened its specialty business dramatically in 2005, when it bought Accredo Health for $2.3 billion. Accredo provides pharmacy services focusing on medicines that are complicated to manage and often address chronic, life-threatening diseases. Medco and PolyMedica began collaborating in 2006 and Medco currently handles more than 50,000 prescriptions per week for PolyMedica's patients. Earlier this year, PolyMedica began providing Medicare Part B administration services and supplies to certain Medco clients. Based on PolyMedica's 22.9 million shares outstanding as of August 3, the deal is valued at $1.2 billion. Including debt, the deal is valued at $1.5 billion. Shares of PolyMedica were up $6.36, or 14 percent, to $51.65, in morning trading on the Nasdaq. Before news of the acquisition, the stock had gained about 13 percent this year. PolyMedica trades at about 21 times earnings forecasts for fiscal 2008, which is below the average 29 times earnings seen for the health care sector. The deal, which is expected to close later this year, is expected to add slightly to Medco's earnings in 2008. Shares of Medco were little changed on the New York Stock Exchange. Lazard served as Medco's financial adviser, while Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. represented PolyMedica. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha  and Ransdell Pierson in New York,  Jessica Hall  in Philadelphia)
