 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve acknowledged at its last regular meeting that a policy response might be necessary if financial market conditions worsened, minutes of its August 7 meeting, released on Tuesday, show. 

 "Members expected a return to more normal market conditions, but recognized that the process likely would take some time, particularly in markets related to subprime mortgages," the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said.   KEY POINTS: * The Fed at its August 7 meeting left the federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent, saying the risk that inflation would fail to moderate was its predominant concern, although it noted that risks to growth had increased somewhat. * The minutes released on Tuesday did not include discussions connected to the Fed's August 17 actions.  COMMENTS: SEAN MURPHY, TREASURY TRADER WITH RBC CAPITAL MARKETS IN  NEW YORK: "So far the bond market's response seems pretty muted. Prices haven't changed much. It was pretty close to their verbiage when they came and cut the discount rate, and obviously shows concern prior to that. They noted that the credit markets could change rapidly. We thought that was important." ASHRAF LAIDI, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, CMC MARKETS, NEW  YORK: "These minutes seem to show that the Fed, even though it's restated its inflation vigilance, is hedging itself by saying a policy response may be the solution to the stabilize markets. The Fed is saying on one hand that we have to worry about inflation, but on the other hand is saying we'd be ready to respond with a rate cut. It's hedging itself for a possible contraction in growth, too. I do not think the market will embrace carry trades with the level of conviction it previously did, especially with the possibility of further economic turmoil and new evidence of weakness in jobs, housing and consumer job in the U.S. economy. It's going to be very difficult for USD/JPY to go back to 118." DOUG ROBERTS, FOUNDER AND CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST FOR  CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH BASED SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "What it clearly indicates to me is that they are separating the economy from market and they have really a two-track way of dealing with it. They'll use the fed funds rate for economic deterioration and the discount rate, capital infusion and discussions with other central banks to deal with the market situation. If the (economic) numbers hold up, they will be inclined not to lower the fed funds rate." BERNARD BAUMOHL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK  GROUP LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "My interpretation is that the FOMC has acknowledged clearly there is a modest credit crunch underway and it could get significantly worse. They also noticed that consumer spending has slowed down as well. At the same time, they reiterate that inflation risks are still there, as a result of slowing productivity growth and the dollar which has fallen so much in the last two years. There have been also signs of resource scarcity, especially in the labor sector, which could lead to wage inflation. That's why the Fed has been so reluctant to lower the fed funds rate. Bernanke has studied credit crunches before. So far the problem in lending problem has not affected the real economy. The unemployment is still at 4.6 percent, which is still very good by historical standards. Wages are still growing by 4 percent. Obviously, we saw the deterioration in consumer confidence from earlier today. All in all, what we are seeing from the FOMC is that there are some reasons to be concerned about the mortgage and capital markets in general. What remains to be seen as monitored by economic indicators is whether action by the Fed is warranted. Based on the minutes, I conclude that there is a higher probability that the Fed will lower the fed funds rate by 25 basis points on September 18th largely because they are seeing signs of the economy slowing. They will not lower rates by 50 basis points. They want to proceed cautiously." GEORGES YARED, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, YARED  INVESTMENT RESEARCH IN WAYZATA, MINNESOTA: "It certainly is more of the same. The one thing that the Fed did acknowledge was that the housing crunch could go longer than expected, which is not a surprise, but when the Fed says that, it lends credibility to it. They are certainly seeing that the housing sector's difficulties are going to extend probably through 2008. This was a meeting before the Fed actually took action. If things deteriorated, I think they will act again without hesitation." NICHOLAS BENNENBROEK, HEAD CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT WELLS  FARGO IN NEW YORK: "The headline worth highlighting is the one in which they say the Fed may act if financial markets conditions worsen. But remember, this was before the rout and they did exactly that. They acted. They cut the discount rate and they increased the amount of repos in the markets. The question now is if that response was enough and the answer we are only going to get at their next meeting." ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,  BOSTON: "The problem with these minutes is they are out of date in that they don't take into account the past couple of weeks including the decision that the Fed made to cut the discount rate. It is almost like it doesn't matter what they said because things have changed. I don't think they will cut rates on September 18 but I'm in the minority on that. The economy is going well enough that they don't need to. The most important thing they can do is maintain credibility to fight inflation." FRANK HSU, DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL FIXED INCOME, FIMAT, NEW  YORK: "The Fed is still straddling between worries about inflation and the financial markets. It looks like they realize both sides are serious. They're walking a very tight line. At this moment, I think they're probably more concerned about inflation, that's why they will not readily lower the fed funds rate."  MARKET REACTION: - BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extended session gains <ID:nNYG000716> - CURRENCIES: Dollar edges lower against yen <ID:nN28268899> - EQUITIES: U.S. stocks hit session lows <ID:nN28269038> - RATE FUTURES: A 25 basis point cut in the Fed's overnight lending rate is fully priced for September FFV7 and the implied chances of a 50-bps cut are holding at 36 percent. Futures point to further rate cuts over the coming months. <ID:nCHB000351>
