 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Tuesday it has charged the former general counsel of KLA-Tencor Corp ( KLAC.O ) and Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O with fraudulently backdating stock options. 

 The SEC alleged Lisa Berry routinely backdated option grants from 1997 to 2003, causing the two companies to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars in stock option compensation expenses. The investor protection agency also said it settled fraud charges with Juniper. The agreement enjoins the Sunnyvale, California-based information technology company from violating antifraud provisions and other portions of federal securities laws but contains no monetary penalty. KLA-Tencor previously settled with the SEC over an options backdating scheme at the Silicon Valley semiconductor company. KLA-Tencor also avoided any monetary penalties. More than 180 companies have been investigated by U.S. authorities or have conducted their own internal inquiries into possible manipulation of option-grant dates. Backdating is not in itself illegal as long as the practice is properly disclosed and fully accounted for in financial statements. "This case is unfounded and the SEC's allegations don't make it otherwise," said Melinda Haag, attorney for Berry. "Lisa had no responsibility for accounting at either company, had no idea that either company violated options accounting, and did not personally benefit from misdated option grants at either company." Juniper, which settled without admitting or denying the charges, released a statement from Chief Executive Scott Kriens saying the company was pleased to conclude the matter. SEC enforcement director Linda Thomsen said in a statement that the case against Berry "confirms that attorneys are no less bound by the securities laws than other public company executives. "At both KLA and Juniper, Ms. Berry was in a unique position to insure that the companies accurately disclosed their stock option expenses; instead, she facilitated their fraud on investors," Thomsen said. The SEC said Berry routinely used hindsight to identify dates with historically low company stock prices, allowing KLA's stock option committee to backdate option grants. Berry moved to Juniper shortly before it went public in 1999, advertising her experience in stock administration, the SEC said. The agency said it is seeking disgorgement of ill-gotten gains, a civil penalty, and an order barring Berry from acting as an officer of director of a public company.
