 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lone Star Funds, a private equity firm seeking to abandon its $400 million purchase of Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co LEND.O, said on Tuesday it extended its tender offer to buy the struggling subprime mortgage lender to September 12. 

 The private equity firm said it granted the extension as required under the merger agreement, which calls for an extension if Accredited asks for it and conditions to closing the tender offer remain unsatisfied. Dallas-based Lone Star said stockholders had tendered 74.2 percent of Accredited shares as of Monday. It said Accredited still has not satisfied all closing conditions in light of the "drastic deterioration" in its finances and operations. San Diego-based Accredited on August 22 said it would close much of its operations and cut 1,600 of its 2,600 jobs to help it survive market turmoil. Earlier in the month, the company said it could not guarantee it would remain a "going concern," and that bankruptcy was possible unless markets improved. Accredited agreed on June 4 to be acquired by Lone Star for $15.10 per share. After Lone Star indicated it wanted to back out, Accredited sued in Delaware Chancery Court to enforce the merger. Lone Star has said Accredited may be entitled only to a $12 million breakup fee. Subprime lenders make loans to people with weaker credit histories. Several dozen have quit the industry this year, including many that went bankrupt as delinquencies and defaults rose, and tight capital markets deprived them of needed cash. Accredited has said it made $15.8 billion of home loans last year. Accredited shares closed Tuesday up 4 cents at $5.84 on the Nasdaq. They rose to $6.25 in after-hours electronic trading.
