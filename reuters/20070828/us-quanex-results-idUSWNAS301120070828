 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Quanex Corp ( NX.N ), which produces steel for the auto industry and aluminum sheets for construction, posted a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday as demand fell for aluminum sheet building products and high raw material costs hurt profit in its vehicular products. 

 Net income fell to $40.2 million, or $1.02 a share, in its fiscal third quarter, from $45.1 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were also $1.02 per share, compared with the $1 per share analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected. Last month, Quanex raised the low end of its third-quarter forecast by 4 cents. It said it expected a profit from continuing operations in the range of 94 to 98 cents a share, including an estimated 3 cents for a noncash inventory charge. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski)
