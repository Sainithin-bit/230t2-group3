 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Reports of more damage from the teetering U.S. subprime mortgage sector hit global stock markets on Tuesday as central banks around the world said their outlooks for monetary policy had been thrown into doubt. 

 Speculation that more financial institutions face problems, evidence that German confidence has been weakened and data showing U.S. house prices slid by the most in at least two decades in the second quarter all quashed any hopes that the home loan crisis was easing. Reflecting concern that the fallout from the subprime debacle is spreading, shares of State Street Corp. ( STT.N ), the world's biggest institutional money manager, fell 4.3 percent on worries about the company's $20 billion plus in commitments to asset-backed commercial paper programs. Meanwhile, British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) denied a report on Tuesday that it has several hundred million dollars of exposure to failed debt vehicles structured by its investment banking arm. "The credit story is back, with headlines about banks' exposure meaning that risk aversion is back to the fore," said Ian Stannard, senior FX strategist at BNP Paribas in London. Minutes from the Federal Reserve policy meeting on August 7, released on Tuesday, showed the central bank recognized worsening financial market conditions might require a policy response. The European Central Bank, Bank of Japan and Bank of Canada have all said market turmoil could affect their decisions on monetary policy. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke will take the spotlight on Friday when he gives a speech on housing and monetary policy. Investors are becoming increasingly confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its next meeting in September, and that other central banks, including the ECB and BOJ, will be dissuaded from raising rates in the near term. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet cast fresh doubt on the chances of a euro zone rate rise next week. His last comments on monetary policy made on August 2, when he used the "strong vigilance" phrase signaling tightening was likely, were made before the current market volatility, he noted on Monday. The Bank of Canada said risks to the Canadian economy had risen as a result of credit market turmoil, adding this would be taken into account at an interest rate review on September 5. Some Bank of Japan policy board members also expressed concern about the risks of U.S. subprime mortgage problems spilling over to global financial markets, minutes of their July 11-12 meeting showed on Tuesday. SPREADING FALLOUT Germany has so far borne the brunt of the European fallout from problems stemming from subprime U.S. home loans, as two of its banks have almost collapsed, requiring major bailouts. Britain's Times newspaper said institutional money manager State Street ( STT.N ) faced $22 billion of exposure to asset-backed commercial paper conduits -- packages of retail and commercial loans financed by short-term debt raised in the commercial paper market -- that have caused problems for rivals in recent weeks. The Boston-based bank has credit lines to at least six conduits, which account for 17 percent of its total assets, the report said, citing regulatory filings. Boston-based State Street said in a statement that its commercial paper continues to be sold daily. British bank Barclays ( BARC.L ) denied the report that failed debt vehicles structured by its investment banking arm had left it with an exposure worth hundreds of millions of dollars. "To say we have hundreds of millions of dollars of exposure to SIV-lites generally is inaccurate," a spokesman for the bank said, responding to a report in the Financial Times. China said it had only a limited exposure and its banks had set aside adequate provisions for dealing with the problems. "Our commercial banks are making very cautious management decisions and have made adequate provisions for any possible risks," said Yi Gang, an assistant central bank governor. Banks such as Bank of China ( 3988.HK ) and Construction Bank ( 0939.HK ) have revealed hefty exposure to the subprime crisis. As further evidence that the subprime crisis may be spilling over into the broader economy, the S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index showed the sharpest decline since 1987 in the second quarter. In addition, German business sentiment fell in August as firms took a dimmer view about the next six months following recent market turmoil, the Munich-based Ifo economic research institute's closely watched survey showed.
