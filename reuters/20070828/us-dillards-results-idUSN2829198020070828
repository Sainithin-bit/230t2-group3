 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Department-store operator Dillard's Inc ( DDS.N ) reported a second-quarter loss on Tuesday as sales fell and it boosted markdowns, and its shares fell 3.5 percent in extended trading. 

 The loss for the second quarter ended August 4 came to $25.2 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with a profit of $15.7 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 2 percent to $1.65 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year fell 3 percent. Dillard's noted weakness in juniors and children's apparel and the home category during the quarter. The company said gross margin declined as it marked down goods to maintain appropriate inventory levels. Dillard's, based in Little Rock, Arkansas, has posted declining same-store sales for the past few months amid competition from expanding rivals such as Macy's Inc ( M.N ). It has recently come under pressure as Barington Capital Group LP, which has said it owns at least a 3.7 percent stake in the company, sought a meeting with its chief executive. Barington said in late June it hoped to discuss merchandising, cost controls and other ways to enhance value. Then in early August, the activist hedge fund renewed its request, saying Dillard's responded to its initial approach with an offer to meet its investor relations director. Dillard's shares were down 3.5 percent to $23.47 in extended trading after the results were reported, from a $24.34 close on the New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has fallen about 30 percent this year. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs )
