 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Motorola Inc MOT.N said on Tuesday that two of its subsidiaries had sued Aruba Networks Inc ( ARUN.O ) for infringement of patents involving short-range wireless network technologies. 

 Shares of Aruba, a supplier of equipment for wireless networks used in offices, fell 4.5 percent after the news. Motorola said subsidiaries Symbol Technologies and Wireless Valley Communications sought monetary damages and a permanent injunction against Aruba in the suit filed in U.S. District Court in Delaware. Motorola, which bought Symbol earlier this year, said two patents in the case involved technologies for three-dimensional representations for short-range wireless network design and management. Another two patents relate to technologies for planning and managing wireless networks. Officials of Aruba were not immediately available for comment. Aruba shares were down 92 cents at $19.63 in morning Nasdaq trade, while Motorola fell 22 cents, or more than 1 percent, to $16.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew )
