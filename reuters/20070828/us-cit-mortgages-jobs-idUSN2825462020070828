 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ), the consumer and commercial finance company, is eliminating 550 jobs across 25 offices as it closes its mortgage lending operations, spokeswoman Mary Flynn said on Tuesday. 

 Earlier in the day, the company said it will take a $35 million pretax charge in the third quarter for severance and exit costs related to the closure. It said its loan collection and customer service activities are unaffected. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
