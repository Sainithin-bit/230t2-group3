 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Seagate Technology STX.N told employees the company is not for sale despite "growing interest" in disk-drive technology from companies in China, Korea and Japan. 

 Seagate, the world's largest maker of computer hard-disk drives, has "not received such an offer" from a company in those countries, according to a memo the company distributed to employees on Monday. A copy of the memo was obtained by Reuters on Tuesday. The New York Times reported on Saturday that Chief Executive Bill Watkins had said in an interview that a Chinese technology company had expressed interest in buying a U.S. disk-drive maker, potentially raising concerns about U.S. national security.
