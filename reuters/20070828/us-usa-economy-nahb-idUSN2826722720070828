 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. home builders said on Tuesday that tightening lending standards have made it even harder for them to unload huge inventories of unsold houses as the housing market meltdown unfolds. 

 The number of builders complaining about tough new mortgage underwriting rules hurting their business has nearly doubled to 62 percent from a March survey, National Association of Home Builders Chief Executive Jerry Howard said in a "Credit Crunch" conference call. Problems in the housing market have become so severe that the NAHB is now urging the government and the Federal Reserve to help boost the sector. "If they take these numbers with the same degree of alarm that we do, things can get done quickly," Howard said. The biggest home builders have been hit hardest, with 88 percent reporting a business slowdown as lenders pull back on credit to borrowers. The NAHB plans to take "a very aggressive posture to assert ourselves both in calming the markets and with policy makers," Howard said. Among actions the U.S. central bank might take, the Fed could be more aggressive in lowering benchmark interest rates. Also, the Bush administration could "take some action" with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, he said. To make matters worse, another down leg in the U.S. housing market will occur in the second half of this year as tighter access to credit impacts the hard-hit sector, the NAHB said. David Seiders, chief economist at the NAHB, expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to start cutting its target federal funds rate by 25 basis points in September and October. The Fed has kept the fed funds rate at 5.25 percent since late June 2006. "While we are looking for at least two cuts from the Fed by the end of the year, it is not out of the question that the Fed would even do a third cut at the December meeting," he said. Seiders said the housing sector should subtract a full percentage point off of GDP growth in the third and the fourth quarter. "The contraction that we have under our belts to this point in percentage terms certainly rivals the 1990-91 contraction when we did have an economic recession and I am looking for things to go somewhat deeper, certainly in the second half of this year into the early part of 2008," he said. Seiders reduced his housing market forecast for a fourth time this year. New U.S. home sales should bottom at the end of 2007, down a whopping 38 percent from the peak in the third quarter of 2005. Housing starts will take longer and reach a bottom by the middle of 2008, a peak-to-trough decline of an astonishing 43 percent, he said. "I am worried that it might even go further than that, given the condition of the mortgage markets," he said on the conference call. "These are major contractions" The overwhelming majority of credit quality and mortgage market problems stem from adjustable-rate mortgages, he said. A sharp rise in defaults in the subprime mortgage market, which caters to borrowers with poor credit histories, has caused lenders to tighten requirements, making it difficult for all but those with stellar credit to get a home loan.
