 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence deteriorated in August to its lowest level in a year on concerns about a softening labor market and market turmoil stemming from the subprime mortgage crisis. 

 The Conference Board said its index on consumer sentiment fell to 105.0 in August from a downwardly revised 111.9 in July. In August 2006, the index was 100.2. The median forecast among economists polled by Reuters was 104 compared with an originally reported 112.6 in July, which was the highest figure since August 2001. Consumers' assessment of current and future conditions also worsened this month. The business research group's present situation index fell to 130.3 from a downwardly adjusted 138.3 in July. The expectations index declined to 88.2 in August compared with a downwardly revised 94.4 in July. Inflation expectations held steady despite lower gasoline prices, the report showed. Consumers' expectations for the inflation rate 12 months stood at 5.1 percent in August, unchanged from July. On the labor front, consumers who said jobs were "plentiful" declined to 27.5 percent in August from a downwardly revised 30.0 percent in July, the Conference Board said. Those who said jobs were "hard to get" rose to 19.7 percent in August from an upwardly adjusted 18.7 percent in July.
