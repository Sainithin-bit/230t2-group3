 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) said on Tuesday that it would sell its wholesale supply business to buyout firms for $8.5 billion -- nearly 18 percent less than previously agreed upon -- as the U.S. housing slump and recent credit crunch forced renegotiation of the deal. 

 The world's largest home improvement retailer will pay $325 million to keep a 12.5 percent stake in the supply business, which will be owned by Bain Capital Partners, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. Total cash proceeds will come to $7.9 billion after the stake and other expenses. Home Depot shares were up 1 percent as analysts said the revised deal cleared the way for the chain to focus on its retail stores and proceed with a current tender offer for 250 million shares. "We are also pleased to see them keep a piece of HD Supply as we view that as being a superb growth vehicle that can take advantage of the current market weakness to gain share," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note. Home Depot also agreed to guarantee a $1 billion senior secured loan for the contractor business. The deal will close on Thursday. The revised accord, which marks the first price reduction of a major private-equity deal, comes as drying credit markets have forced banks to reel in loose lending practices that came to define the leveraged-buyout boom that began roughly two years ago. "The amended agreement ... reflects the diligent efforts to complete the HD Supply transaction on mutually acceptable terms," the private equity buyers said in a statement. "As the buyer, we are particularly gratified to have reached this favorable outcome in the face of challenging conditions." The steep fall-off in housing also contributed to the cut from the original $10.325 billion sale price announced in June, as the supply division's worsening prospects forced the two sides back to the bargaining table. The unit provides construction, sewer and utility products to contractors. The sale will allow Atlanta-based Home Depot to focus fully on its core retail business, where it has lost market share in wake of the weaker U.S. housing market and increased competition from smaller rival Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ). The retailer has said that proceeds from the supply sale would help fund a planned $22.5 billion share repurchase. As part of that plan, Home Depot is buying back 250 million shares under a tender offer that is due to expire on Friday. Home Depot reiterated its 2007 earnings outlook that calls for per-share profit from continuing operations to fall 12 percent to 15 percent, excluding the benefit of share repurchases. The ugly drawn-out renegotiation by the banks and the buyers is likely to have wide repercussions, and according to analysts, could go down as a watershed transaction marking the end of the private equity megadeal frenzy. Merrill Lynch MER.N, JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) and Lehman Brothers LEH.N provided the private equity firms with third-party financing, while Goldman Sachs advised Home Depot financially. Home Depot shares, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI , were up 34 cents at $35.37 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 12 percent this year.
