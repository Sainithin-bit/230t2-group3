 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tighter lending standards in recent months have hurt business at two-thirds of the nation's home builders that were already suffering from burgeoning inventories, an industry association executive said on Tuesday. 

 A survey by the National Association of Home Builders found that 62 percent of builders saw more stringent requirements on mortgages affecting their business, up from 33 percent in March, NAHB Chief Executive Jerry Howard said on a "credit crunch" conference call. The subset of the largest homebuilders was hit even more, with 88 percent reporting that business is affected as lenders pull back on credit to borrowers, he said.
