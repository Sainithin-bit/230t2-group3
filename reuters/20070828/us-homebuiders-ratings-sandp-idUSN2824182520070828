 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - More than half of the 26 home builders rated by Standard & Poor's are vulnerable to downgrades, and the outlook could worsen if current credit market turmoil is long-lasting, the rating agency said. 

 "Our rating bias for the U.S. home building sector remains decidedly negative," S&P said in a report late on Monday. Fifteen of the 26 companies it rates are either on review for a downgrade or have negative outlooks, meaning the rating could be downgraded over the next six months to two years. The companies have about $30 billion in publicly rated debt, S&P said. "Our present outlook anticipates that the current volatility in the credit markets is temporary," S&P said. "However, if a longer-term dislocation in the mortgage market develops, we would expect potentially sharp downgrade activity for the sector in the next few quarters." Earnings and cash flow have been weaker than expected, and key credit quality measures will likely worsen as declining home prices and financial market turmoil weigh on home buyers' sentiment, S&P said. "Additionally, there is no question that more stringent mortgage credit standards will now make it difficult for some willing buyers to finance home purchases, which will delay the absorption of excess inventory," the rating agency said. Most home builders have already had to seek covenant relief from lenders to avoid technical defaults because of failure to meet requirements such as interest coverage, S&P said. "To date, bank lenders have been largely supportive of the group, but if this downturn gets much deeper, we would fully expect another round of modifications to be required," S&P said. S&P has downgraded eight ratings since its last report on the sector on May 25. Seventeen of the home builders now are junk-rated, with the other nine in the "BBB" category, the lowest investment grade. The lone bright spot is that only about 3 percent of home builders' $30 billion in rated debt matures through the end of 2008, S&P said. Home builders are expected to be able to meet these debt payments with free cash flow and by liquidating assets, the rating agency said.
