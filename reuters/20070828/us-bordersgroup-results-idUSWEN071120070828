 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Borders Group Inc BGP.N, the second-largest U.S. book retailer, said on Tuesday its quarterly loss widened due to charges although sales rose on record demand for "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." 

 Second-quarter net loss widened to $25.1 million, or 43 cents a share, from a loss of $18.4 million, or 29 cents, a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose 10.4 percent to $945.1 million while comparable store sales at Borders superstores in the United States rose 4.6 percent during the quarter ended August 4. Excluding non-operating charges, Borders said the loss narrowed to 26 cents a share. The results included a 17 cent per share after-tax charge and a 4 cent per share charge to settle litigation in California stemming from a dispute over overtime pay. On this basis, analysts, on average, were expecting Borders to post a loss of 34 cents a share on $913.5 million in sales, according to Reuters Estimates. "Progress is clearly being made at Borders Group as we continue to execute our strategic plan and are beginning to see improved performance," Chief Executive George Jones said in a statement. "Harry Potter certainly gave us a big boost in sales across all businesses, yet even without it we achieved positive same-store sales results." Excluding sales of the final Harry Potter book, same-store sales inched up 0.4 percent for the quarter. Last week, industry leader Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ) credited record sales of the final Harry Potter book for a 9 percent rise quarterly profit. Borders also said sales at Waldenbooks fell 7.7 percent during the quarter, with a 6.2 percent jump in same-store sales due to Harry Potter. Minus Potter, same-store sales for the chain were flat. During the quarter, Borders said it closed 21 of its underperforming mall-based Waldenbooks stores. The company said earlier this year that it would close nearly half of its Waldenbooks stores, which have been struggling with declining same-store sales. International sales, meanwhile, climbed 31 percent during the quarter, with same-store sales getting a Potter-related boost of 8.2 percent. Without Potter, same-store sales rose 5.6 percent. Borders has cut back on its remodeling efforts after seeing its expenses triple since 2005 and said previously it expects the first store under its new design to open in early 2008. Expenses decreased to $38.3 million during the quarter from $46.8 million a year ago. Borders shares closed down 5.8 percent at $14.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Justin Grant )
