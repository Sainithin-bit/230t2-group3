 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IndyMac Bancorp Inc IMB.N, the ninth-largest U.S. mortgage lender, said on Tuesday it expects to hire as many as 850 former employees of bankrupt rival American Home Mortgage Investment Corp ( AHMIQ.PK ) as it prepares for a rebound in demand for home loans. 

 The hiring marks an about-face for the parent of IndyMac Bank, one of the largest U.S. savings and loans, which last month laid off 400 workers after lower lending volumes contributed to a 57 percent decline in second-quarter profit. It is also a bet by Chief Executive Michael Perry that IndyMac will survive the current mortgage downturn, which has felled dozens of rivals as delinquencies soared and investors stopped buying home loans they considered too risky. Pasadena, California-based IndyMac said it has already hired more than 600 former employees of American Home, a Melville, New York-based lender that is liquidating after filing for Chapter 11 protection on August 6. About 75 percent of new staff are retail loan officers, and 83 percent are in the western United States, IndyMac said. The hires include Ron Bergum and John Johnston, former American Home co-chief executives for retail lending in the West. IndyMac is also taking over leases on more than 90 American Home offices. IndyMac is a specialist in "Alt-A" home loans that fall between prime and subprime in quality. It has tightened lending standards, and now mainly makes loans eligible for purchase and guarantee by Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. Perry expects IndyMac to end September with more than $4 billion of operating liquidity. Mortgage lending volume should fall "substantially" in the fourth quarter, but revenue margins should rise, he said. "While we have significantly staffed up our retail lending platform, which we expect will quickly contribute to profitability, we will need to carefully monitor our overall production volumes to see where they settle in light of mortgage market conditions," he said. The company did not immediately return a request for further comment from Perry. IndyMac said it expects to add more than 1,300 retail lending staff this year through acquisitions or from bankrupt rivals. IndyMac made $48.1 billion of home loans from January to June, according to the Inside Mortgage Finance newsletter. American Home ranked 10th, with $34.6 billion of loans. Moody's Investors Service said on Monday it may downgrade IndyMac's credit rating to "junk" status, saying lower lending may hurt profitability for a few quarters. IndyMac shares closed 76 cents lower at $22.89 on the New York Stock Exchange. The 3.2 percent decline mirrored the drop in the KBW Mortgage Finance Index .MFX. IndyMac shares are down 49 percent this year, while the index is down 23 percent.
