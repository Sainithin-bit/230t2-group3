 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ) said on Tuesday its commercial paper continues to be sold daily as the company sought to alleviate any concerns about its exposure to a corner of the credit market that has roiled other companies. 

 "The commercial paper continues to be sold daily," State Street said in a statement. "We continue to actively monitor market developments." State Street shares fell as much as 4 percent on Tuesday over concerns about its asset-backed commercial paper program. State Street recently said in U.S. regulatory filings that it administers four, third-party-owned asset-backed commercial paper programs, or conduits. Banks rely heavily on these conduits for cheap, short-term funding, but if they cannot continue to access this debt they could face a credit squeeze. At the end of June, State Street disclosed nearly $29 billion in off-balance-sheet conduit assets. The Boston-based bank does not hold any equity interest in the conduits.
