 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Shares in Lenovo ( 0992.HK ), the world's third largest PC maker, slid more than 2 percent after news that U.S. rival Gateway GTW.N will try to block the Chinese firm's effort to buy European-focused Packard Bell. 

 Analysts say the deal, announced at the same time that Taiwan's Acer ( 2353.TW ) said it would buy Gateway for $710 million, dealt a blow to Lenovo's exclusive negotiations to buy Packard Bell and expand into the European consumer arena.
   Shares in Lenovo were down 2.2 percent at HK$5.38 in pre-opening trade, in a market that is set to open strongly after Beijing relaxed investment restrictions.
