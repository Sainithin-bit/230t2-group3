 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence deteriorated in August to its lowest level in a year on concerns about a softening labor market and market turmoil stemming from the subprime mortgage crisis. 

 The Conference Board said its index on consumer sentiment fell to 105.0 in August from a downwardly revised 111.9 in July. In August 2006, the index was 100.2.   COMMENTS: LINDSEY PIEGZA, MARKET ANALYST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "It's continuing to decline, but it doesn't look too bad. One thing that jumps out is the weaker employment sector. We are going to see that reflected in payrolls. Companies are cutting out slack after a weak second quarter. They need the financing so they can't keep as many people on the payrolls. They need every bit of cash on hand to operate. Consumers are not spending and credits are not as plentiful. Plans to buy home within six months, however, are stable despite evidence of a weak housing market." IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY  ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: "At current levels the numbers are not catastrophic, but they signal consumers' spending growth of only about 2.5 percent; major appliance buying intentions dropped to a 8-month low. Ouch. TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT CLEARBROOK  FINANCIAL LLC IN PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "The figure was better-than-expected with a real surprise coming from the west coast as confidence rose from 111.3 to 115.7 and expectations also rose to 91.3 from 84.2. The fact that the subprime issue is not affecting the west coast, which is where Countrywide Financial is based, is impressive. Whether it's hedge funds or Wall Street firms, you can see some take off their bets that the Federal Reserve is going to ease. They are now putting on flatteners because you had a strong rally in the front of the curve." ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, RBS GREENWICH  CAPTIAL, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "Consumer confidence data for July was fairly close to expectations, albeit sharply off its July levels that itself looks like an outlier. The August decline was fairly evenly distributed between the present situation and the expectations component. The data probably says more about a backlash to the strength in July than it does to any impact from credit woes. Interestingly, the component on plans to buy a home within the next 6 months went to the strongest levels for the year, hardly suggestive of a consumer that feels credit constrained. However, this house purchases data has generally been a less than reliable indicator so not too much should be read from this component ... Nothing here to upset the slow erosion in risk appetite we have seen today." MICHAEL METZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT OPPENHEIMER &  CO. IN NEW YORK: "I think it is going to have a negative impact on the retail sector; the whole retail industry will have difficulty for the balance of this year and all of next year." "The reality of foreclosures and stresses on the household will result in a reluctance of the consumer to leverage up on rising asset values. Asset values aren't rising. I think this is something every household has to be aware of. This has to have an impact on confidence. My guess is we're heading for a consumer-led recession beginning a few quarters. The consumption boom is over." STEVEN BUTLER, SCOTIA CAPITAL, DIRECTOR OF FX TRADING,  TORONTO: "The data is really secondary at the moment, and this was in line with the estimates. We're watching the credit headlines and have had a few negative ones today that has put the FX market on the back foot. Things are going to get a lot worse before they get better, as evidenced by the big sell-off in euro-yen. Of course, nothing is a one-way bet. You can't just walk in, hit a bid and feel safe in these markets. One good headline can provoke a sharp bounce back in dollar-yen or euro-yen. But it seems we're getting 10 bad headlines for every good headline right now." BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, DAILYFX.COM,  NEW YORK: "The drop in confidence is not unexpected given the turmoil we've had in the market and the decline in real estate values. I don't think there is anything unusual about it, but what we are seeing in the forex market today is a little bit of risk aversion coming back, with the yen starting to strengthen as equities falter ... With consumer confidence so weak the Fed may be forced to lower the federal funds rate, but they may have to be dragged rather than voluntarily going that way." MICHAEL CHEAH, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND SENIOR PORTFOLIO  MANAGER, AIG SUNAMERICA ASSET MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY: "The number this morning is not bad enough that (it) would trigger an imminent Fed rate cut and so this is disappointing to some people in the stock market. That encourages the bond market yield curve to steepen. The underlying curve steepening trade is still in play as the result of continuing fear about asset backed commercial paper. The other shoe that has fallen is the increase in write offs among banks of credit card debt, but that hasn't gathered much attention in the popular media yet." BILL HORNBARGER, CHIEF FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, A.G.  EDWARDS & SONS, ST. LOUIS: "The bond market is not doing a lot. I thought the number, considering what we've come through in the last month or so, is actually relatively encouraging from an economic perspective. I thought it would've been down a little bit more than it actually was. It's no surprise that it was soft."
