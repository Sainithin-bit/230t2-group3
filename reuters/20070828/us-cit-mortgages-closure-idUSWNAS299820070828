 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ), the consumer and commercial finance company, said on Tuesday it has closed its mortgage lending operations, resulting in the loss of 550 jobs across 25 offices. 

 The company is the latest to abandon mortgage lending amid difficult market conditions. CIT said it will take a $35 million pretax charge in the third quarter for severance and exit costs. It said its loan collection and customer service activities are unaffected. Spokeswoman Mary Flynn confirmed the job cuts, which equal about 7.5 percent of the 7,345 employees CIT said it had at the end of 2006. About 5,620 were employed in the United States. New York-based CIT announced plans to stop mortgage lending on July 18, when it reported a surprising second-quarter loss because of a $495.3 million after-tax charge to reduce the value of home loan receivables. Chief Executive Jeffrey Peek on a conference call that day said the mortgage business had a "problematic outlook" and CIT was not willing to spend more to add scale and boost returns. He said mortgages accounted for about 10 percent of CIT's income. CIT joins dozens of mortgage lenders to leave the industry after delinquencies and defaults soared, housing prices stagnated or began to fall, and investors wary about risk stopped buying securities backed by many kinds of home loans. Shares of CIT fell $1.44, or 3.9 percent, to $35.76 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at $55.77.
