 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of State Street Corp. ( STT.N ) fell as much as 4 percent on Tuesday on worries about the company's $20 billion plus in commitments to asset-backed commercial paper programs. 

 Boston-based State Street, the world's largest institutional money manager, said in a statement that its commercial paper continues to be sold daily. The company issued the statement amid concerns about its exposure to short-term debt, which has been scrutinized because its collateral can include risky subprime mortgages. State Street recently said in U.S. regulatory filings that it administers four, third-party-owned asset-backed commercial paper programs, or conduits. Banks rely heavily on these conduits for cheap, short-term funding, but if they cannot continue to access this debt they could face a credit squeeze. At the end of June, State Street disclosed nearly $29 billion in off-balance-sheet conduit assets. The Boston-based bank does not hold any equity interest in the conduits. "We continue to actively monitor market developments," the company said in its statement. State Street is exposed to the conduits because it provides back-up lines of credit to them. Its commitment under liquidity asset purchase agreements and back-up lines of credit totaled about $28 billion at the end of June, according to the company's financial statements. The company said the credit quality of the assets is primarily rated "AAA" and "AA." State Street has said potential losses, if any, from these conduits' activities are not expected to have a material impact on its results. Shares were down 2.4 percent at $62.35 in late-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin )
