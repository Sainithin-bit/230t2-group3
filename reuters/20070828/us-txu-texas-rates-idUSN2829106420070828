 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - TXU Corp's TXU.N Oncor power delivery unit will not seek a rate increase this year even though it said it could justify higher rates for its North Texas customers in a filing with the Public Utility Commission of Texas. 

 Dallas-based TXU, the state's largest power company, proposed to leave its rates unchanged for at least another year and to reduce its return on equity to 10.75 percent from 11.25 percent to reflect current market conditions, according to a filing. TXU is in the process of being acquired by private equity firms led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and TPG TPG.UL, formerly Texas Pacific Group, for $32 billion. In March, the PUC launched a rate case for Oncor more than a year ahead of schedule, citing the potential impact of the ownership change on Oncor operations. Earlier this month, the commission rejected TXU's request to delay the rate case. In its filing, Oncor said it could support a rate increase of about $85 million per year. Because of an existing agreement with a number of cities in Oncor's service territory not to seek higher rates until mid-2008, the company said any earlier rate hike would create higher costs for customers in mostly rural areas of North Texas. "Because of the inherent inequity of different rates for different areas, we asked for no change," said David T. Gill, Oncor vice president for external affairs, in a statement. In a general review of Oncor's earnings last year, the PUC staff estimated that Oncor might be earning an extra $80 million above its allowed revenue. After consulting with TXU management and the buyout group, Oncor asked the PUC to affirm its current rates until it files a system-wide rate case no later than July 1, 2008, consistent with its agreement with the cities. On Tuesday, proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and Glass Lewis and Co. recommended that TXU shareholders vote in favor of the buyout. Rival proxy advisory services Egan-Jones and Proxy Governance have also recommended TXU shareholders vote in favor of the buyout. TXU has set a September 7 shareholder vote on the sale which requires a two-thirds majority to proceed. In April, the buyout group agreed to drop a labor outsourcing plan for Oncor to gain support from unionized workers for the deal. The buyers said they would terminate the InfrastruX joint venture, which was expected to reduce Oncor's costs, if the buyout is completed.
