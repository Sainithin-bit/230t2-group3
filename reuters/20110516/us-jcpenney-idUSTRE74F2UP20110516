 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co Inc's ( JCP.N ) efforts to remake itself as a more fashionable clothing chain and raise profits by shedding weak units paid off in the first quarter, but will not help profit later in the year as much as some investors expected. 

 Penney in recent years has pushed to land more exclusive lines, such as Liz Claiborne LIZ.N clothing, and lure younger shoppers with stores-within-its-stores for brands such as cosmetics seller Sephora and Spain's fast-fashion chain Mango. Penney said those initiatives will help lift sales at its stores open at least a year between 3 percent and 4 percent in the current quarter. Penney expects full-year profit of $2.15 to $2.25, which at first blush beat Wall Street forecasts. But on a call, analysts learned that, excluding a 20-cent per share boost from stock buybacks and other one-time items, the outlook is unchanged despite better-than-expected first-quarter profit, and shares reversed course after rising as much as 6.7 percent early in the session. "Some people are looking at these numbers and thinking maybe it's not as great as they thought," said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. Penney sales at stores open at least a year rose 3.8 percent during the first quarter. Yet analysts said Penney shoppers are more vulnerable to rising gas prices than those of rival Macy's. Penney, which operates 1,100 U.S. department stores, said first-quarter net income rose 6.7 percent to $64 million, or 28 cents per share, from $60 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the average analyst estimate of 24 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Much of the improvement in first-quarter profit came from lower pension expenses. On an adjusted basis, which strips out the effect of that expense, net income fell to 33 cents per share from 40 cents. Penney's shares fell 1.7 percent, or 66 cents, to $37.78, but earlier in the session rose as high as $41, the highest level since September 2008. The shares have more than doubled from their 52-week low of $19.44 last August. CUTTING COSTS Penney is also changing the way it manages inventory, closing poor performers such as its catalog operations and weak stores to cut costs. Penney expects cost savings of as much as $30 million in 2012, and up to $15 million in 2012 and $30 million in 2013. Despite rising cotton prices, Penney expects gross margin, which measures the profitability of the goods it sells, to be flat and even up a bit this quarter. "It gives encouragement that they can weather the storms," Swinand said. Penney Chief Executive Myron Ullman said that the benefits of the company's cost-cutting efforts would continue to "significantly accelerate profitability," leading Penney to return to historically high operating profit margins by 2014, as per the chain's five-year plan announced last year. Penney is eyeing a profit of $5 per share by 2014, compared with $1.59 for the fiscal year that ended in January. Ullman told analysts on a conference call that customers have not responded poorly as Penney raised prices on its higher-end items because of higher cotton costs. Exclusive lines such as Claiborne are giving Penney greater ability to set prices and protect margins as it prepares for more price increases later this summer because of higher cotton costs. Net sales rose 0.4 percent to $3.9 billion as its exit from the catalog business dampened growth. Penney, whose largest shareholder is billionaire investor William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, said gross margin slid to 40.5 percent in the first quarter, in part because of free shipping offered to online shoppers.
