 TOKYO  (Reuters) - European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said on Monday restructuring sovereign debt would be the same as a default and should be avoided because countries would be unable to access financial markets for funding. 

 Restructuring cannot be a solution to a sovereign debt crisis because that could also cause a country's banking system to go bankrupt, he said. (Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by  Michael Watson )
