 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse shares rose more than 4 percent on Monday after NASDAQ OMX and IntercontinentalExchange on Monday withdrew their proposal to acquire NYSE Euronext. 

 Here are some analyst views on the news: CHRISTIAN MUSCHICK, ANALYST AT SILVIA QUANDT: "This is absolutely excellent news. This means that the deal is done. There's no doubt about it. The reason was clearly regulatory issues in the United States. The one thing that really surprises me is just how fast it all happened. Really good news." MARTIN PETER, ANALYST AT LBBW: "Obviously, it takes away the pressure to raise the offer. However, the most interesting question remains: will shareholders think that this is a good offer? The clear winner here are NYSE shareholders while Deutsche Boerse's shareholders may ask themselves at some point whether this was such a good deal after all." KONRAD BECKER, ANALYST AT MERCK FINCK: "The fact that NASDAQ and ICE are withdrawing their offer for NYSE is no surprise -- it became clear already that the offer wouldn't be successful. It's good news for Deutsche Boerse, since it increased the chances for a successful merger." ROLAND PFAENDER, ANALYST AT COMMERZBANK: "This is certainly good news for Deutsche Boerse. A bidding war is not foreseeable now." (Compiled by Christoph Steitz, Daniela Pegna, Kirsti Knolle and Josie Cox)
