 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank stands ready to ensure price stability and preserve the integrity of the euro, European Central Bank governing council member Christian Noyer said on Monday. 

 He said the success of existing programs to support some European Union member countries remains to be demonstrated, Noyer told a seminar in Tokyo he could not immediately assess the positive impact of structural reforms required for financial support. Noyer, also governor of the Bank of France, said calculations based on European banks' exposure to EU sovereign debt would produce very reassuring number. He also predicted EU economic growth on average would be above the potential growth rate this year. (Reporting by Stanley White)
