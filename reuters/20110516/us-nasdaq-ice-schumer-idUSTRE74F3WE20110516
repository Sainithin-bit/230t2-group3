 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senator Charles Schumer said on Monday he appreciates that Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange were withdrawing their bid for NYSE Euronext, rather than engage in a long antitrust battle. 

 "The potential takeover of NYSE by NASDAQ had significant antitrust problems, and it's good federal regulators are making that clear early on in order to avoid a prolonged and unproductive fight," Schumer, a Democrat from New York, said in a statement. "The merger between NYSE and Deutsche Borse has the potential to protect New York jobs and strengthen New York's position in the derivatives markets."
