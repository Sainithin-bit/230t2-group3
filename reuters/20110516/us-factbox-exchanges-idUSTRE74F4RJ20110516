 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group and IntercontinentalExchange withdrew their bid for rival bourse NYSE Euronext, clearing the way for the $10.2-billion merger between NYSE and Deutsche Boerse. 

 Combined with two approaches for Canada's TMX, the bid interest was part of the latest dealmaking frenzy in a consolidating industry often thwarted by regulatory hurdles. The following is a list of successful and failed stock exchange mergers, as well as ongoing talks, since 2001: SUCCESSFUL DEALS: Jan 2002 - Euronext buys London International Financial Futures and Options (LIFFE) from under the nose of the London Stock Exchange. Sept 2003 - OM London Exchange merges with the Helsinki Stock Exchange. Jan 2005 - OMX merges with Copenhagen Stock Exchange in a deal that valued the CSE at 1.22 billion Danish krone. Sept 2006 - OMX buys Iceland Stock Exchange in a deal valued at 250 million SEK. Jan 2007 - Energy giant Intercontinental Exchange buys the New York Board of Trade. April 2007 - Paris-based Euronext and NYSE merge in a deal valued at 11 billion pounds. Aug 2007 - Nasdaq merges with Nordic bourse operator OMX in a deal worth $3.7 billion. Oct 2007 - Nasdaq OMX acquires the Boston Stock Exchange Oct 2007 - LSE completes the purchase of Milan-based exchange operator Borsa Italiana in a $2.15 billion deal. Dec 2007 - The Toronto Stock Exchange acquires the Montreal Stock Exchange in a $1.3 billion merger. Mar 2008 - CME Group, the world's largest futures market, buys Nymex Holdings for $8.9 billion. Oct 2008 - NYSE Euronext buys the American Stock Exchange for $260 million in stock. May 2010 - Intercontinental Exchange acquires Climate Exchange at a deal that valued Climate Exchange at about 395 million pounds. UNSUCCESSFUL DEALS Dec 2004 - Deutsche Boerse offers 520 pence a share for LSE, valuing it at 1.3 billion pounds. Proposed offer is withdrawn in March 2005 after Deutsche Boerse fails to win a recommendation from LSE management. Dec 2005 - Macquarie, Australia's largest investment bank, makes a formal cash offer at 580p a share for the LSE, valuing it at 1.5 billion pounds. Macquarie drops bid in Feb 2006 after LSE said it was doubling its cash return and holding a share buyback. March 2006 - LSE rejects $4.2 billion, 950 pence-per-share cash offer from Nasdaq. Bid turns hostile and Nasdaq's approach falls through in February 2007. Nov 2006 - Deutsche Boerse withdraws offer for Euronext, which had accepted a merger with the NYSE. Sept 2007 - Boerse Dubai makes $4 billion bid for OMX in a bidding battle with Nasdaq. 2007 - Exchange giant CME Group Inc. discussed a merger with Deutsche Boerse AG in late 2007 but the two companies failed to agree on a price, according to people familiar with the matter. Oct 2010 - Singapore Exchange $8 billion cash and shares offer for Australia's ASX Ltd bid is blocked by the Australian government on national interest grounds. May 16, 2011 - Nasdaq OMX and IntercontinentalExchange withdraw $11.2 billion bid for NYSE Euronext. NYSE's board had twice rejected the $11 billion unsolicited offer in favor of its deal with Deutsche Boerse. ONGOING TALKS April 2010 - Reuters reports ongoing merger talks between Dubai Financial Market and the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange Feb 2011 - BATS, U.S. third-largest exchange, said it was buying Chi-X Europe for an undisclosed amount. Feb 2011 - Hong Kong Stock Exchange says it is open to international alliances. Feb 2011 - Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext say they are in advanced merger talks in a deal valued at $10.2 billion.

May 2011 - Maple Group -- a consortium of leading Canadian banks and pension funds -- approaches TMX to make a C$3.6 billion cash and equity bid to rival the LSE's.
