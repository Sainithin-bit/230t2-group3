 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Hot weather in key European markets and an Easter holiday helped Swedish budget fashion chain Hennes & Mauritz AB post its biggest rise in sales in eight months in April. 

 The world No. 2 clothes retailer posted an 11 percent year-on-year rise in sales at established stores in local currencies, beating an average forecast in a Reuters poll for 9 percent. Shares rose 1.2 percent by 4:29 a.m. EDT, outperforming a 0.1 percent drop in Stockholm's blue-chip index. Warmer weather in many European centers -- where H&M earns the bulk of its revenue -- encouraged shoppers to renew their summer wardrobes with items such as jumpsuits, bandeau swimwear and sandals. However, monthly sales figures can be volatile and the strong April sales figure followed a 5 percent drop in March. "For clothing retailers, things are going to remain fairly challenging with low GDP growth," said Anne Critchlow, an analyst at Societe Generale. "There are some difficult economies around Europe which are still very much affected." Powerful performances by the German and French economies propelled growth in the euro zone well above forecasts in the first quarter but for the euro zone's most debt-ridden economies, solid growth is a distant dream. Portugal's economy slipped back into recession while Greece and Spain grew moderately and the International Monetary Fund has warned that Europe's debt crisis could yet spread to core nations. MARGINS IN FOCUS U.S. retailers also beat sales expectations in April but have warned of rising costs and cautious consumers. Gap Inc estimated earnings for the April quarter below analysts' expectations and said merchandise margins were down significantly due to high raw materials costs. European retailers are also cautious, with consumer confidence still fragile amid government austerity measures and stubbornly high unemployment. DnB NOR analyst Asgeir Birkeland said in a note that while the H&M share price would take support from the sales figures, the bank was reiterating its sell recommendation. "We find its valuation stretched and see gross margin worries ahead of the Q2 report due on 22 June," Birkeland said. Rising costs are pressuring clothing manufacturers, some of which are trying to pass some of them on to consumers who may not be willing to pay more for items that do not stand out. H&M, conscious of its market share and low-price image, has resisted passing on costs to its customers. H&M, the world's second-biggest clothes retailer by sales after Spanish rival Inditex, owner of the Zara brand, does not release absolute sales figures on a monthly basis and does not comment on the growth data. Total sales, which include stores opened in the past year, rose 21 percent in April, topping analysts' average forecast for 17 percent.
