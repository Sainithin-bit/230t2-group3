 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should not wait too long to normalize monetary policy, ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said, adding that the extent of potential tightening was a matter of debate. 

 The ECB is currently expected to increase euro zone interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.5 percent in July and follow it up with another hike later in the year. "We are moving from a period of very low interest rates toward a normalization. I think it is problematic to wait too long for this normalization," Nowotny, who heads Austria's central bank, told German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview published on Monday. "Of course a rise of rates is being debated. But how big this rise will be remains to be seen. "If the economy normalizes further then the ECB will act accordingly," he added. Nowotny also said euro zone problem child Greece may need further IMF/EU aid "but you have to grant (it) under very strict conditions," and EU finance ministers meeting Monday needed to insist Greece step up its fiscal repair efforts. Monday's finance ministers meeting in Brussels is expected to pressure Greece to announce more austerity steps to secure further emergency funding. It is also set to back a 78 billion euro, three-year bailout package for Portugal. (for story click [ID:nLDE74E0N7]) (Reporting by  Christoph Steitz  and  Paul Carrel ; Editing by John Stonestreet)
