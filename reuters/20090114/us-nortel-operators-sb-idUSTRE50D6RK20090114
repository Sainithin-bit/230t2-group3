 (Reuters) - Nortel Networks, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, and its rivals are facing a falling market as telecom operators around the world are cutting jobs and slashing other costs. 

 The following is a list of major operators' recent cost cutting announcements: TELIASONERA -- The Nordic operator said on January 14 it aims to cut some 400 jobs in Finland, after giving notice to 1,200 in Sweden on January 12. The firm said on November 19 its capital spending will certainly not rise in 2009, but a major decrease is equally unlikely. MEGAFON -- Russia's No. 3 carrier said on December 23 the company would closely monitor the economic situation and would be ready to respond by cutting investment or operating costs if necessary. SPRINT NEXTEL -- Chief Financial Officer Bob Brust said on December 9 the No. 3 U.S. wireless service would continue spending on network maintenance in 2009, but would hold off on network expansion to help maintain the company's cash position. AT&T -- The top U.S. carrier said on December 4 capital spending in 2009 will be lower than in 2008. The company is seen spending less in its traditional wireline business, focusing more of its investment in wireless and advanced Internet and video services. It also said it will eliminate 12,000 jobs, or about 4 percent of its workforce, to cope with an economic downturn as well as a decline in traditional phone sales. TELECOM ITALIA -- The debt-laden operator said on December 3 it will shed assets worth nearly $4 billion and cut another 5 percent of its workforce to slash borrowings and costs amid a weak economy. TIM PARTICIPACOES -- Telecom Italia's Brazilian subsidiary has earmarked 2.3 billion reais for investments in 2009, down from 3.3 billion reais in 2008, according to a filing with Brazil's securities regulator on December 3. VIMPELCOM -- Russia's No. 2 mobile carrier on November 25 promised to cut capital spending in 2009 by "tens of percent" from a planned $2.6 billion this year, to focus on repaying its debt. TELEFONICA -- The Spanish telecoms group said on November 19 it was confident of reaching its medium-term targets despite an economic slowdown, saying it had a great deal of control over costs. MILLICOM -- The Swedish firm, which specializes in emerging markets, said on November 19 it expected capital expenditure to fall to about $1 billion in 2009 from slightly less than $1.4 billion this year. MTS -- The largest mobile phone operator in Russia cut on November 13 its capital expenditure forecast for 2008 to $2 billion from $2.5 billion. BT GROUP -- The operator announced on November 13 10,000 job cuts and a plan to trim the cost of its pension scheme just days after it issued a profit warning. VODAFONE -- The operator said on November 11 it aims to maintain profits and boost free cash flow by cutting 1 billion pounds of costs. TELEKOM AUSTRIA -- The company said on November 11 it plans to slash about 1,250 employees from its workforce in 2009. (Compiled by Tarmo Virki; Editing by  Gary Hill )
