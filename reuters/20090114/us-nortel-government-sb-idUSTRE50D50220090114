 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian government pledged on Wednesday to help Nortel Networks Corp emerge from bankruptcy protection. 

 "The government of Canada appreciates the importance of the telecommunications industry to our economy and will continue to work with Nortel during its restructuring through Export Development Canada (EDC)," Industry Minister Tony Clement said. EDC, a government agency, has agreed to provide up to C$30 million ($24 million) in short-term financing through an existing bonding facility. In addition, Clement said, EDC is open to discussing financing for Nortel in conjunction with other financial institutions. The Conservative government has traditionally opposed using public money to rescue ailing companies but announced C$4 billion in emergency loans to the auto industry last month and has said extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. Clement's statement emphasized the idea of Nortel continuing on, rather than going under, and said the government would monitor its progress closely. "The decision to file for creditor protection was made by its board of directors in an effort to turn the company around," Clement said. "It is important to note that Nortel is filing for court-supervised restructuring under the CCAA (Canada's Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act), not bankruptcy. Nortel has stated that it has every intention of emerging from this restructuring under the CCAA as a viable business." EDC spokesman Phil Taylor said the agency's risk tolerance was higher than that of banks, but said its financing would not amount to a bailout. "EDC always operates on the basis of commercial principles. From the EDC perspective, there are no bailouts, no handouts. There has to be a viable plan," he said.
