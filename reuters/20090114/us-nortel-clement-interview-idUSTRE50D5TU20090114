 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian government, which announced financing on Wednesday for struggling Nortel Networks Corp, intends to make sure Canada keeps a strong telecommunications industry, Industry Minister Tony Clement said on Wednesday. 

 "We have a very competitive and very viable telecoms industry in this country, and our government is committed to ensuring that that continues to be the case," he told Reuters. As for extending financing to Nortel, Clement said he did not see the government picking winners or losers. He said that any long-term provision of money through government agency Export Development Canada would be made only on the basis of a good business case.
