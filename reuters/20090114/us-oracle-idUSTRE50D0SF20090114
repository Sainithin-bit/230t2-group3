 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O, the world's No. 3 software maker, has fired "several hundred" of its more than 86,000 workers, according to two sources close to the situation, as the business software maker struggles in an economic downturn. 

 Redwood City, California-based Oracle laid off the employees on Friday, trimming its force of sales consultants who advise clients on how to integrate its business management software and database programs into their operations, the sources said on Tuesday. Oracle declined comment. The scale of the job cuts is far smaller than some investors had expected. Rumors surfaced last week that the company was preparing to lay off thousands of its workers. While Oracle joined a growing list of technology industry giants that are cutting workers, the scope of the reductions is smaller than ones planned by peers. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Tuesday Oracle has cut around 500 positions. (Reporting by  Jim Finkle ; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
