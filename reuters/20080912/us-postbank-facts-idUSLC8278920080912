 (Reuters) - Germany's biggest lender Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) has agreed to take a minority stake in Deutsche Postbank ( DPBGn.DE ) with an option to increase it later. 

 Here are the key terms of the agreement with Postbank parent Deutsche Post ( DPWGn.DE ): * Deutsche Post sells a minority stake of 29.75 percent in Postbank to Deutsche Bank for 2.79 billion euros in cash, or 57.25 euros per share. The acquisition is subject to approval by regulatory authorities and the German government, and will close in the first quarter of 2009. * Deutsche Bank intends to fund the acquisition through an equity raising of up to 2 billion euros. The timing and precise conditions are subject to market conditions. * Deutsche Post grants Deutsche Bank an option to acquire an additional 18 percent of Postbank for 55 euros per share. This option can be exercised between 12 months and 36 months after acquisition of the initial 29.75 percent stake. * Deutsche Post grants Deutsche Bank a five-year right of first refusal for its remaining Postbank shares. * Deutsche Post gets a put option to sell its remaining stake of 20.25 percent plus one share in Postbank to Deutsche Bank. Deutsche Post can exercise this option between 21 months and 36 months after acquisition of the initial stake at a price of 42.80 euros per share. Deutsche Bank can settle both options either in cash or fully or partially with its own shares. (Reporting by  Michael Shields ; editing by Simon Jessop)
