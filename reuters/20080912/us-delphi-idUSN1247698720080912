 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK said on Friday that former parent General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) has increased its support to $10.6 billion, from $6 billion, to speed the auto parts maker's emergence from bankruptcy. 

 Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States. in 2005, said in a Bankruptcy Court filing that without GM's stepped-up support, "a viable stand-alone business plan may not be possible." As part of the plan, which needs approval of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, GM will assume $3.4 billion in pension liabilities for Delphi's hourly factory workers, more than double the amount GM had agreed to in the initial restructuring plan, Delphi said. Delphi has been trying to negotiate a revised reorganization plan since investors led by Appaloosa Management backed out of a $2.55 billion equity plan to support its emergence in April. The auto parts maker said the changes would put Delphi in a position to pursue exit financing, including through an equity-based rights offering, to support its business plan under current market conditions. Representatives of GM and Delphi could not be reached immediately for comment. GM has taken a total of $11 billion in charges for Delphi's reorganization, including $2.8 billion in the second quarter. Delphi also filed a motion to freeze its hourly and salaried worker pension plans ahead of its emergence from court protection. The current reorganization plan called for a pension freeze upon its emergence from bankruptcy. The company would like to freeze the salaried pensions effective at the end of September. Union approval would be needed to freeze the hourly pension plans before the company's emergence from bankruptcy. Delphi had faced the threat of legal action by the U.S. Pension Benefit Guarantee Corp. unless it reached an agreement with GM to transfer part of its pension liabilities to the automaker.
