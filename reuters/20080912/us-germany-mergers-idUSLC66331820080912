 (Reuters) - Germany's banking sector is undergoing a major shakeup in the wake of the global credit crisis and now looks set to see the country's No.1 bank, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), take a large stake in retail bank Deutsche Postbank ( DPBGn.DE ). 

 The move comes just a fortnight after Germany's No.2 lender, Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ), struck a 9.8 billion euro ($13.73 billion) deal to buy No. 3 player Dresdner Bank from its owner, insurer Allianz ( ALVG.DE ). Following is a chronology of major mergers in recent years. April 2001 - Allianz buys Dresdner Bank for 24 billion euros. The insurer had already held a 19 percent stake in the bank. December 2004 - Private bank Sal. Oppenheim buys BHF Bank for about 600 million euros. June 2005 - Italy's No.1 lender, UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), pays nearly 20 billion euros to take over Munich-based HVB. October 2005 - Deutsche Postbank buys mortgage lender BHW, paying 1.8 billion euros. November 2005 - Commerzbank pays 4.5 billion euros to take over property financier Eurohypo, in which it held a one-third stake, by buying out the other two large shareholders, Dresdner Bank and Deutsche Bank. December 2005 - U.S. private equity investor Lone Star LS.UL buys troubled Allgemeine Hypothekenbank Rheinboden (known today as Corealcredit), whose bad debts and interest rate speculation had threatened to make it Germany's biggest bank failure in 30 years. June 2006 - Deutsche Bank buys Berliner Bank for 680 million euros and a few weeks later buys 98 Norisbank branches for 420 million euros. June 2007 - Around 450 savings banks claim victory in a months-long takeover battle to buy Landesbank Berlin (LBB) BEBG.DE, paying more than 5 billion euros to keep the regional state-sector lender from falling into private-sector hands. July 2007 - Property investment bank Hypo Real Estate HRXG.DE unveils a 5.5 billion takeover of Depfa Bank, a lender to governments. December 2007 - Germany's biggest regional state-backed lender, LBBW LBBW.UL, takes over wayward fellow landesbank SachsenLB in an emergency rescue amid the global credit storm. July 2008 - France's Credit Mutuel pays around 5 billion euros to buy Citigroup's ( C.N ) retail banking operations in Germany, known as Citibank. August 2008 - Lone Star pays over 100 million euros to buy IKB IKBG.DE, a troubled lender to medium-sized companies, from state development bank KfW KFW.UL after a series of state-led bailouts costing some 8.5 billion euros. August 2008 - Commerzbank agrees to buy Dresdner Bank from insurer Allianz for 9.8 billion euros in a two-step transaction that will completed by the end of 2009. The deal means that Allianz will become the biggest shareholder in Commerzbank, with a stake of nearly 30 percent. (Compiled by Patricia Uhlig and Jonathan Gould; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
