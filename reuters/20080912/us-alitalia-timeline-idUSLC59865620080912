 (Reuters) - Italian investors trying to help save Alitalia SpA AZPIa.MI from collapse have broken off talks with the airline's unions, saying they see no way to break an impasse.  

 Below is a timeline of Alitalia's troubled sale process: DECEMBER 2006 -- INITIAL AUCTION The previous centre-left government announces it is putting its Alitalia stake up for sale. The state owns 49.9 percent and sought bids for at least 39.9 percent of the carrier, which would automatically trigger a full bid under Italian takeover law. There were 11 bidders initially but the auction collapsed in July 2007 as the number shrank gradually, until the only remaining bidder -- smaller rival Air One -- also pulled out. DECEMBER 2007 -- SECOND TRY Alitalia then draws up its own list of six potential partners and French-Dutch carrier Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) and Air One put in non-binding bids. The centre-left government overlooked lobbying by unions and regional politicians to pick Air France-KLM for exclusive talks. The two airlines agreed on a takeover that valued Alitalia shares at 10 euro cents, or $184 million, an 81 percent discount to the price they were trading at the time. Criticism from the then leader of the opposition Silvio Berlusconi during the election campaign, plus a lawsuit by Milan's airport operator, put the deal at risk and it ultimately fell apart over union opposition. APRIL 2008 - THIRD TIME NOT SO LUCKY After returning to office as prime minister for a third spell in April, Berlusconi launches third attempt to secure Alitalia's future, promising a group of Italian investors would buy it. Normal disclosure requirements on the sale progress were waived and Alitalia shares were suspended indefinitely in June. The new centre-right government asked bank Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ) to draw up a plan, which eventually had Alitalia seek bankruptcy protection under a new process for "public service" companies on August 29. Berlusconi's cabinet suspended antitrust laws and overhauled bankruptcy law to accommodate the rescue. It hired a special administrator to sell assets to a single buyer of his choice rather than the highest bigger. A group of investors led by Roberto Colaninno called Compagnia Aerea Italiana (CAI) on September 3 submitted an offer for parts of Alitalia to create a smaller airline with the help of Air One, a domestic rival. The plan's success was dependent on union approval and a partnership with a foreign airline and the administrator gave unions until September 11 to accept the plan, warning he would liquidate the airline if they refused. Despite the reluctant support of one union, the others rejected the plan. (Writing by  Deepa Babington  and  Gilles Castonguay ; Editing by  David Holmes )
