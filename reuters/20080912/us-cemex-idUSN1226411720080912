 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Shares of Mexico's Cemex plunged 7.5 percent in morning trade on Friday, after the cement maker cut its 2008 EBITDA forecast. 

 Stock of Cemex ( CMXCPO.MX ) traded at 19.70 pesos while its New York-traded shares ( CX.N ) fell 7.69 percent to $18.60. Cemex ( CX.N )( CMXCPO.MX ) forecast earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of between $4.6 billion and $4.7 billion in 2008, down from an earlier $5.3 billion estimate. "The reduction in EBITDA and free cash flow makes Cemex look expensive ... a significant premium of 35 percent to Lafarge and Holcim," Credit Suisse said in a report, referring to Cemex's European competitors. "Due to no upside potential ... we are reiterating our underperform rating for Cemex and we continue to recommend selling the stock," the investment bank added. Monterrey-based Cemex, which has operations in 50 countries and has long impressed investors with its smooth sailing, faces mounting problems as the United States goes through its worst home market crisis since the Great Depression. Cemex increased its U.S. market share just as the U.S. crisis hit, taking over Australia's Rinker -- with 80 percent of its operations in the United States -- last year. Cemex is also juggling $18 billion in net debt, weak European markets and a share price that has fallen more than 40 percent since May. "The share price is at levels we haven't seen since February 2005," said Gonzalo Fernandez, an analyst at Santander in Mexico City.
