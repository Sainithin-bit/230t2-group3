 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The U.S. auto market should start to see some improvement toward the end of 2009, Chrysler LLC President Jim Press said on Friday. 

 U.S. auto sales were down more than 11 percent through the first eight months of 2008 compared with a year earlier as tight credit markets, a weak economy and rising gasoline prices pressured demand for large trucks and SUVs. Press, who was speaking at a Chrysler event on the redesigned Dodge Ram pickup truck, said the timing of the vehicle's launch is "good" and he anticipates sales growth. Chrysler is controlled by Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta  and  Soyoung Kim , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
