 ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE  (Reuters) - The U.S. financial industry is dealing with challenges and the Bush administration is paying close attention to Wall Street and the state of the markets," the White House said on Friday. 

 "I am not going to try to characterize the state of Wall Street," White House spokesman Tony Fratto told a briefing amid reports the administration is trying to help arrange the sale of Wall Street investment bank Lehman Brothers. "Obviously we're paying very close attention to the markets," Fratto told reporters on President George W. Bush's plane to Oklahoma City. "The Treasury Department is closely monitoring the markets and they stay in contact with market participants. There's no question that the financial industry is dealing with challenges and that's something that we keep an eye on," he said. (Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
