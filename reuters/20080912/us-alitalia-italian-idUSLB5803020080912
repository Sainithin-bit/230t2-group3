 (Reuters) - Italy's rescue of Alitalia followed a familiar "Italian solution" script favored by governments in the country, where domestic investors step in to bail out a company considered strategic to thwart foreign control. 

 But critics and the opposition say the patriotic rescue called for by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi ultimately will be financed by Italians, whose taxpayer funds were also used to lend 300 million euros to the cash-strapped airline in April. The Economist magazine estimated that at the end of the rescue, about 5 billion euros of public money will have been pumped into saving Alitalia over the years, or about 125 euros by each Italian taxpayer. Here's how the Italian solution could end up costing the state and taxpayers: HIGHER AIRFARES Consumer groups and competitors complain that the government's suspension of antitrust laws to permit Alitalia to merge with domestic rival Air One will give it monopoly control over the lucrative Milan-Rome route and hike fares. Noting that Alitalia and Air One together control 67 percent of traffic at Milan's Linate airport and 58 percent at Rome's Fiumicino airport, low-cost rival carrier Easyjet was one of several critics to warn that this could restrict choice and lead to "extremely high" fares. GOLDEN PARACHUTES FOR BAGGAGE HANDLERS? Alitalia's employees have long enjoyed generous benefits and pay and fended off successive restructuring efforts thanks to the political muscle of their unions, who felled a sale of the airline to Air France-KLM this year. Eager to avoid a fresh union backlash, the government has promised welfare benefits for seven years and the option of jobs at other public or private firms for the more than 3,000 employees who will be laid off. One newspaper estimated the welfare benefits alone for fired employees will cost the state 1 billion euros. BAILING OUT SMALL INVESTORS The government also plans to refund small savers who had invested in Alitalia by turning to dormant public funds available to it, a move expected to cost 200-300 million euros according to La Repubblica newspaper. A group representing investors had threatened lawsuits if they were not compensated. ALITALIA'S "BAD COMPANY" Under the "Phoenix" plan, Alitalia's profitable parts will be sold off to Italian investors while its troubled parts and debt of more than 1 billion euros will likely be liquidated, with the state likely to absorb the losses.
