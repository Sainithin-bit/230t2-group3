 ROME  (Reuters) - Alitalia has told unions it will start ending labor contracts and sending layoff letters to its employees on Friday after talks with a group of investors to rescue the airline failed, a union official said. 

 "Informally, we were told (the layoff process) would start today," Renata Polverini of the UGL union told reporters.
