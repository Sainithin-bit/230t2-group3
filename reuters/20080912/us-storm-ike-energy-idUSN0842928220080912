 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Powerful Hurricane Ike bore down on the heart of the U.S. oil sector in Texas on Friday, idling production and threatening nearly a quarter of the nation's refining capacity with a possible 20-foot (6-meter) wall of water. 

 Fears the storm will cut deeply into already threadbare U.S. fuel inventories by causing lasting damage to the cluster of refineries around Houston triggered a spike in wholesale gasoline prices on the Gulf Coast to $5 a gallon -- an increase that could hit the gas pumps in coming days. "We're already seeing some big price hikes at some of the retail stations," said Geoff Sundstrom, spokesman for travel and auto group AAA. "People should brace themselves for a potential return of gasoline close to $4 a gallon in the next couple of weeks nationwide." Forecasters said the storm, packing winds of more than 100 mph (160 kph), will likely hit near Houston early Saturday, after oil companies shut down about 25 percent of the nation's crude production and nearly 22 percent of its refined fuel output as a precaution. "Hurricane Ike is a gigantic Category 2 monster and is likely to generate a massive and particularly destructive storm surge at key refinery centers," said Jim Rouiller, meteorologist with private weather forecaster Planalytics. "Close to 20 percent of the U.S. refining capability could be lost for a long period of time." U.S. gasoline supplies are already running at their lowest levels in eight years, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The last time hurricanes shut down as much crude oil and refining production in the United States was in 2005 when hurricanes Katrina and Rita ripped through the region and devastated swaths of the Gulf Coast. Already, some 13 refineries in Texas were shut down as a precaution ahead of Ike, while another one in Louisiana was also shut in a slow recovery from Hurricane Gustav earlier in the month.  Together, the refineries account for 3.8 million barrels per day of gasoline, diesel and other fuel production, or about 22 percent of the nation's capacity. Ike also halted shipping and port operations along the Texas coast and led to the shutdown of several crude oil and fuel pipelines supplying other parts of the United States. Offshore, oil companies shut more than 97 percent of their Gulf of Mexico oil production and more than 94 percent of their natural gas output, according to the latest data from the Minerals Management Service. The Gulf is home to a quarter of U.S. crude oil production and 15 percent of U.S. natural gas production. Offshore production was expected to recover fairly quickly, as Ike veered just south and west enough to reduce the risk of damage to platforms, experts said. "The platforms are not as vulnerable as the refineries in this case because of the track of the storm," said Sarah Emerson, director of Energy Security Analysis Inc. "This is about the refineries."
