 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence soared unexpectedly to an eight-month high in September as lower fuel prices soothed inflation fears and made Americans more hopeful about the economy, a survey showed on Friday. 

  KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index of confidence jumped to 73.1 in September -- the highest since January 2008 -- from 63.0 in August, for the biggest monthly jump since January 2004. * September's reading was well above economists' median expectation of 64.0, according to a Reuters poll. * Consumers' sunnier mood can be traced mostly to lower prices at the gas pump, according to the survey, whose reading on one-year inflation expectations plunged to 3.6 percent, matching February's low, from 4.8 percent last month.  COMMENTS:  IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY  ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: "Both the current conditions and the expectations indexes rose, but the latter, which is much more gas-sensitive, jumped most, to 70.9 from 57.9. Before we all get excited note that (a) in order to keep pushing the index up further, gas prices have to keep falling rapidly. And while we do expect further declines, most of the drop in oil prices is now reflected in gas prices; (b) At 70.9, the expectations index is still consistent with very weak real consumption. So, better news, but still grim."  TERRIN GRIFFITHS, ECONOMIST AND INDUSTRY ANALYST, CALIFORNIA  AND NEVADA CREDIT UNION LEAGUES, RANCHO CUCAMONGA, CALIFORNIA: "The rise in the consumer sentiment index was not a big surprise, given the decline we've seen in gas prices. Higher gas prices directly impact consumers' wallets, especially in a tough economic environment, so when gas prices eased over the past month, that boosted consumer confidence."  SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR &  ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "Consumer sentiments tend to be quite volatile. This is more gasoline price-related." "The consumer area remains tough. Consumers will be value-driven in their spending activity."  GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS,  MISSOURI: "The most interesting thing is the rebound in consumer sentiment. We were anticipating that lower energy prices would boost sentiment but that the deteriorating job market would hold it down but it appears that more consumers benefit from lower energy prices and helping sentiment recover from very depressed levels. And the inflation expectations component has declined significantly. On the inventory side we saw a big jump in wholesale auto inventories that is likely to lead to low production schedules in the third and fourth quarters and that could dampen some of the economic numbers. Companies have been holding the line on inventories, but in July they probably saw an unwanted jump in unsold goods."  DUSTIN REID, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, ABN AMRO, CHICAGO: "A stronger-than-expected University of Michigan sentiment data has helped the dollar versus the euro. We should see some short-term strength in the dollar after this. But in the face of today's mixed data, it's hard to get a feel for the dollar's direction going forward."
