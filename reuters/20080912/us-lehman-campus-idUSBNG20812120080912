 (Reuters) - Campus Door, a student-lending company owned by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc is closing its Pennsylvania headquarters and laying off 124 employees starting from October 26, The Wall Street Journal said in a report. 

 A Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry spokesman told the paper that the department had already begun working with employees to help them look for other jobs. Lehman could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore, Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
