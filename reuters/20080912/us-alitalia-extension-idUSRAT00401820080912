 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy's government has given Alitalia's unions one more day to avoid the collapse of a rescue bid for the airline, a government statement said on Friday. 

 Earlier, a group of investors that is offering to buy the profitable parts of Alitalia said it saw no reason to return to the negotiating table with the unions, after talks stalled overnight. A statement from the transport and labor ministers said the government was committed to avoid "irreversible acts" by the group of investors and the bankruptcy commissioner in charge of the carrier. It said unions had until the end of Friday to come up with a possible common position to break the deadlock. (Reporting by  Silvia Aloisi )
