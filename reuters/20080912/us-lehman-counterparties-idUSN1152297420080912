 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some Lehman Brothers' clients are wary of entering new trades with the struggling investment bank and others have withdrawn from doing business with it altogether, traders and risk managers said. 

 Two major banks said on Thursday they continue to trade with Lehman normally, and traders at other banks said that is generally true across Wall Street. But some clients are pulling back, in part because of fears Lehman's credit ratings will be downgraded, the traders said. Clients closing out business with Bear Stearns brought that investment bank to the brink of bankruptcy in March. The fact that clients are pulling back from Lehman underscores the urgency of its efforts to shore up its capital or sell itself altogether, before its business melts away. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday the investment bank was looking to sell itself, and the U.S. government could intervene. Lehman spokeswoman Monique Wise declined to comment. One hedge fund manager told Reuters his fixed-income traders stopped doing business with the firm on Monday, while a head trader at a mid-sized mutual fund said his company had reduced its credit default swap positions with the bank and is reviewing cutting its remaining exposure. And at one insurance company, traders of equity derivatives -- including stock options and forwards -- said they were not entering new over-the-counter positions with Lehman Brothers. "The derivatives books are probably shut down at this point, counterparties are probably not doing derivatives with them," said Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and a former Lehman Brothers chief financial officer. 'STILL TRADING?' Banks lose business all the time, and many investment banks have lost business to commercial banks in recent months. Hintz said that clients should have no problem trading short-dated instruments with Lehman. For these instruments, clients are only exposed to Lehman for short periods of time, generally under one year. Many derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, can span a number of years. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup said they were still trading with Lehman Brothers, echoing statements they made on Tuesday, when Lehman shares tumbled 45 percent. Lehman Brothers, which announced a record $3.9 billion quarterly loss on Wednesday, has been hit hard by losses resulting from its holdings of complex packages of debt. Rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday the investment bank "is experiencing a crisis of confidence" and must find a strong partner. The company's share price fell on Thursday to $4.40, more than 40 percent below Wednesday's close. If Lehman's credit ratings were downgraded, as Moody's and Standard & Poor's are considering, Lehman could be forced to post as much as $2.9 billion in collateral to counterparties, according to research from independent firm CreditSights. Lower credit ratings would also freeze Lehman out of some derivatives markets. Lehman Brothers clients have asked the firm to transfer trades to other banks, so the clients are no longer connected to Lehman, according to executives at two dealers. Both executives said their firms were getting enquiries from clients wanting to exit derivatives such as credit-default swaps with Lehman, and enter them with his firm instead. FED WINDOW In most of these cases the counterparties have bought credit protection from Lehman and are worried that the firm may not have the wherewithal to make good on those trades over time. Bear Stearns suffered a run on the bank in March after clients, particularly hedge funds in its prime brokerage business, pulled assets from the firm. Lehman has a much smaller prime brokerage operation than Bear Stearns did, and the long-term derivatives trades that clients seem to be shying away from make up only about 10 percent of its trading business, according to Bernstein's Hintz. Another key difference between Lehman's difficulties and Bear Stearns' prior to its collapse is that the Federal Reserve is now providing short-term funds to dealers that need them. But the outlook for Lehman was cloudy on Thursday night, as sources said the bank was in talks to sell itself. U.S. regulators are talking with Lehman about a number of options for the firm, and the government is hoping to avoid spending money on a bailout.
