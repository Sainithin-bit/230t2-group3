 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's ( JNJ.N ) board vice 
chairman, Christine Poon, who also is worldwide chairman of its 
pharmaceuticals group, will retire from the company and the 
board on March 1. 

  The diversified health care company said on Friday that a 
timely announcement of succession plans will be made to ensure 
a smooth transition for Poon's pharmaceutical responsibilities, 
although it did not immediately name a successor.  Poon, 56, has become one of the most prominent female 
executives in the pharmaceutical industry since she joined 
Johnson & Johnson in 2000. In 2001, she was named worldwide 
chairman of the company's pharmaceuticals division and was 
promoted to Johnson & Johnson's executive committee.  In 2005, she was elected to the Johnson & Johnson board and 
also named the board's vice chairman.  Before joining J&J, Poon worked for 15 years at 
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ).  Poon has not indicated to the company that she is leaving 
for another job, a Johnson & Johnson spokesman said.  In an e-mail sent to J&J employees on Friday, Poon said she 
was drawn by "a deep desire to take on new challenges and find 
opportunities to advance society and health through my 
continuing involvement with science, technology, innovation and 
business."  In a statement, J&J Chief Executive William Weldon said 
Poon had been instrumental in helping to build the company's 
pipeline of medicines and praised her "strong leadership and 
personal involvement in building a skilled and diverse 
workforce."  Poon is the second prominent pharmaceutical executive to 
announce their departure this week. GlaxoSmithKline's ( GSK.L ) 
Chris Viehbacher is leaving to take the CEO job at 
Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ).  (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
