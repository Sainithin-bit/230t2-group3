 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's analyst Scott Sprinzen on Friday said he does not expect Lehman Brothers to fail and said its near-term liquidity is satisfactory. 

 "We don't expect Lehman to fail," Sprinzen said on a conference call sponsored by the Argyle Executive Forum. Asked about S&P's concerns over counterparty and systemic risks in the market, S&P analyst Tanya Azarchs said concerns are "very, very high" because of the markets' skittish condition and tight liquidity.
