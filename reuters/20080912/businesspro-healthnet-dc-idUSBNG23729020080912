 (Reuters) - Health Net Inc ( HNT.N ) has agreed with the 
California Department of Insurance to pay $3.6 million in 
penalties and about $14 million in reimbursements for medical 
charges, The Los Angeles Times reported. 

  The Woodland Hills, California-based company will also 
reinstate coverage of 926 people whose policies it canceled 
after they got sick, the paper said.  The company, however, did not admit any wrongdoing, the 
paper added.  The LA Times quoted Health Net Chief Executive Jay Gellert 
as saying the settlement was an opportunity "to move forward 
and make sure these affected individuals can obtain coverage."  The agreement allows Health Net to avoid being targeted for 
more enforcement action relating to potential legal violations 
uncovered by auditors.  Health Net may be required to pay an additional penalty of 
as much as $3.6 million if a follow-up examination finds that 
it did not correct all deficiencies.  The Department of Insurance has been imposing a series of 
similar insurer fines and penalties through the State 
Department of Managed Health Care. The two agencies together 
regulate health insurance in California.  The department has yet to release a formal report of its 
investigation, but officials told the paper there was evidence 
that Health Net failed to follow state laws intended to 
guarantee that policyholders are treated fairly.  Health Net has been facing several lawsuits, fines and 
penalties related to delaying or denying payment of thousands 
of medical claims.  Health Net and The California Department of Insurance were 
not available for comment.  (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Paul
