 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's said on Friday it is evaluating its rating on Lehman Brothers with the possibility of raising, lowering or leaving them unchanged, following reports that the bank is in discussions to be potentially acquired. 

 S&P previously had its rating on Lehman on review for downgrade from "A," the sixth-highest investment grade. "Press reports over the past day, which have not been commented on by Lehman, have indicated that it is negotiating with other financial institutions regarding the potential sale of the company," S&P said in a statement. If Lehman is acquired the ratings may be raised, depending on the credit quality of the combined company, as well as its business strategy of the company and the structure of the transaction, S&P said. A downgrade would be likely if no acquisition is made, the rating agency said. (Reporting by  Karen Brettell ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
