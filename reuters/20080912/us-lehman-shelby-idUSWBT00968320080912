 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury and Federal Reserve are trying to work out a deal with troubled investment bank Lehman Brothers that involves no U.S. government money, Republican Sen. Richard Shelby told CNBC television on Friday. 

 But he said he couldn't guarantee that government money wouldn't be needed at some point to prevent Lehman from collapsing. "I'm hoping that some big firm will want them more than the Fed wants them," Shelby said. "The government right now, the Treasury and the Fed among others, they're trying to work the deal with no government money, as they should." Shelby of Alabama is the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. Lehman Brothers, the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, has been forced into talks about a sale after the Wall Street investment bank's shares plunged this week on doubts about its survival. The firm has suffered massive asset writedowns and a $3.9 billion loss from bad real estate investments. The Federal Reserve in March provided $29 billion in loan guarantees to facilitate a Fed and Treasury-brokered deal for JPMorgan Chase to buy Bear Stearns for a bargain price and save the investment bank from collapse. In response to the Bear Stearns collapse, the Fed set up a dealer lending facility, allowing Wall Street investment banks to borrow directly from the U.S. central bank to avoid the same type of liquidity crunch that felled Bear. "I don't like regulation, but I don't like an open-ended blank check, either," Shelby said. "I think sooner or later... somebody's got to say something's not too big to fail."
