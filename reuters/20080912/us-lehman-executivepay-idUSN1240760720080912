 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's chief executive would likely walk away with millions of dollars in accumulated stock and other compensation in the event he leaves the struggling firm -- but it's a payout that's quickly losing value. 

 Were CEO Richard Fuld to follow in the footsteps of other top Wall Street executives who have departed amid the credit crisis, he could leave with about $65 million, based on Lehman's Friday morning stock price of $3.73, according to an analysis by executive pay consultant James F. Reda & Associates. The $65 million calculation is based on what the 62-year-old Fuld could be entitled to collect if he retires, as outlined in compensation arrangements detailed in the company's annual proxy filing in March. Fuld, who joined Lehman in 1969 and has been CEO for 15 years, is its biggest individual stockholder. Fuld's tenure at Lehman has come into question not only because of the dramatic 76 percent loss in value of its shares this week but because of the possibility the firm will be sold, a development that could occur as soon as this weekend. Lehman and U.S. officials were in discussions about a number of options, including a complete sale, sources with direct knowledge of the talks told Reuters on Thursday night. A Lehman representative, Randy Whitestone, declined to comment on Friday on Fuld's future or his compensation arrangements. The $65 million tally includes 8.6 million in unrestricted shares Fuld holds that were worth $32.1 million as of Friday morning. The value of those shares is down from $582 million in November 2007 when Lehman stock traded at a 12-month high of  $67.73. NO SEVERANCE The sum also includes about $16.8 million amassed in pension plans, $5.6 million in deferred compensation and $10.5 million in restricted stock that would become fully vested upon retirement, Reda & Associates calculated. Fuld would potentially "walk away with at least in the neighborhood of $60 million, which is a lot, but it is a lot less than $600 million that he was worth 10 months ago," said David Schmidt, a senior consultant at the pay advisory firm. Fuld does not have a severance arrangement with the company in the event he is forced out. Were his employment to be terminated "without cause," his exit compensation -- including accumulated stock, pension pay, deferred compensation and a portion of the restricted stock -- would total $58.5 million, based on Friday's share price, according to the Reda & Associates analysis. Fuld has been one of Wall Street's top-paid executives, benefiting from Lehman's rich run of profits in recent years. It is only this year that its write-downs of real estate and other investments have led to huge losses. He took home an estimated $466 million in compensation from 1993 to 2007, according to executive compensation research firm Equilar Inc. Stock option gains, totaling about $363 million, account for the bulk of that sum. "The real egregious problem is that between 1993 and 2007, he made half a billion dollars in compensation," said Richard Ferlauto, director of pension and benefit policy at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a frequent critic of executive pay plans. He said companies must stop devising compensation plans "that let CEOs cash out at the high point in the market and leave shareholders dangling in the wind." (Editing by  Brian Moss )
