 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Southeastern Asset Management, a Memphis-based value investment firm, has sold a 7.9-percent stake in General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and swapped into a large position in the automaker's senior convertible debt, according to filings with securities regulators. 

 The move by Southeastern, one of GM's largest investors, came after GM announced earlier this quarter that it was suspending its common stock dividend as part of a plan to shore up cash and survive a deep slump in the U.S. auto market. A representative of Southeastern, which is headed by O. Mason Hawkins, was not immediately available to comment. The shift in the firm's GM holdings was detailed in a pair of filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. As of the end of June, Southeastern, which manages the Longleaf Partners Fund and other discretionary accounts, held almost 45 million shares of GM common stock, equal to a 7.9 percent stake in the automaker. In Wednesday's filing, Southeastern said it held 34 million shares of GM's Series B Senior Convertible Debt. That holding can be converted into a 2.3-percent stake in GM's common stock, the firm said. The filings did not say when Southeastern sold its common stock in GM or when it had bought the convertible debt. GM shares rallied by almost 12 percent on Thursday on low oil prices and rising hopes that funding for $25 billion in federal loan guarantees to the auto industry could be cleared by lawmakers and ease some of the pressure on GM's liquidity. Despite the rally, GM shares remain down about 50 percent this year and over 80 percent since Chief Executive Rick Wagoner took over in 2000. The No. 1 U.S. automaker burned through about a $1 billion a month in the most recent quarter as sales of once-profitable SUVs and trucks sank. GM has responded with a plan to cut costs by $10 billion and sell some $4 billion in assets to protect its remaining $24 billion in cash and address Wall Street concerns. As of the first quarter of this year, Southeastern's Longleaf Partners Fund ranked as the mutual fund with the second largest stake in GM, according to Reuters data. In a commentary released with its report for the June-ended quarter, fund managers at Longleaf Partners said GM shares appeared to be "deeply discounted versus any conservative estimate of its worth and earnings power in 2010." The fund said it estimated that GM's overseas operations were generating earnings per share of over $4 and said it expected that the company could post between $6 and $10 in earnings per share by 2010 once it realizes savings from a health care deal with the United Auto Workers union. But the fund said it was not adding to its GM stake because it saw "higher quality" alternate investments that could be expected to generate higher returns.
