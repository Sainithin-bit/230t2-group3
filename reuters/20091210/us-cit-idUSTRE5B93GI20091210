 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc's ( CIT.N ) new shares rose in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, as the lender to small businesses emerged from one of the largest bankruptcies in U.S. history. 

 CIT, one of the biggest financial sector victims of the credit crisis, is also the only major company in the sector to emerge from bankruptcy. Others, such as Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual and IndyMac have been unable to continue on their own. Hundreds of thousands of small and mid-sized businesses depend on CIT for financing and company lawyers had said the company needed to get through bankruptcy quickly to avoid customer defections. But the comeback may not be easy. "In the space they are working, it is a tough time trying to secure customers for a company that has gone bankrupt," said Robert Lutts, president and chief investment officer at Cabot Money Management. "Today, executives making decisions in the financial area are making very low-risk decisions. That means don't work with the problem childs of the world and I think that is going to mean tough sledding for CIT." CIT's new stock ended up 7.37 percent at $28.99 after opening at $27. The stock rose as much as 13.55 percent to $30.66 in the last 30 minutes of the session. "CIT is in a new category for that kind of investor that likes to play risk reward associated with a turnaround" of the economy, said Keith Wirtz, president and chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management. "It has a higher degree for risk, but also higher potential for reward." The more than 100-year-old lender filed for bankruptcy last month after a debt exchange offer failed. Earlier this week, it won approval from a New York bankruptcy judge for a prepackaged reorganization plan. CIT's reorganization plan will reduce its debt by about $10.5 billion to about $55 billion and defer significant debt obligations for three years. Under the plan, holders of CIT's unsecured debt will receive new notes representing 70 cents on the dollar of original debt, plus new common stock. The company had won support from bondholders for the plan substantially in excess of the minimum amount required under U.S. bankruptcy law. Common and preferred stockholders, including the U.S. government, will be wiped out. CIT's problems stemmed in part from Chief Executive Jeffrey Peek's decision earlier in the decade to expand into subprime mortgages and student loans. Peek will leave the company by the end of the year. The New York-based lender has lost close to $6 billion since the end of 2007. (Reporting by Juan Lagorio; editing by  Ted Kerr  and  Andre Grenon )
