 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices dipped below $70 a barrel for the first time in two months on Thursday, extending losses for a seventh consecutive session, as excess fuel inventories created concerns about weak demand. 

 U.S. crude for January delivery settled at $70.54 a barrel, down 13 cents, after hitting a low of $69.81. In London, Brent crude settled at $71.86, down 53 cents. In the latest losing streak, front-month crude has fallen $7.83, or about 10 percent, the biggest loss for front-month crude since July. On Wednesday, U.S. Energy Information Administration data showed builds in refined product stocks, highlighting the weakness of demand in the world's largest energy consumer. "The $70 level is just an arbitrary number. More importantly, prices have eroded over $6 during a week that contained no negatively jarring economic data. A fact, I think, shows conclusively the sentiment pendulum swinging more toward pessimism about a potential recovery," said Mike Fitzpatrick, vice president at MF Global in New York. There were further signs that global oil supplies were rising on Thursday as fuel inventories held by two top oil firms in China, the world's second-largest consumer of oil, also climbed as domestic sales dropped. Saudi Arabia restored full-term crude allocations to at least two Asian buyers for January and kept contracted volumes to six others, according to industry sources. However, the world's top oil exporter will keep crude oil supplies to customers in Europe unchanged in January compared with December. The Organization of the Oil Exporting Countries, which will hold its next meeting on December 22, is unlikely to raise production targets, according to most members. Ecuador's energy minister on Wednesday said he expected OPEC to leave oil output targets unchanged at the meeting, setting the stage for prices to remain between $70 and $80 per barrel. Gains on Wall Street, after a drop in continuing claims for jobless benefits and upbeat trade balance data, failed to support oil prices. .N The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose more than expected last week, but continuing claims fell, the Labor Department said. U.S. exports of goods and services hit their highest level since November 2008, narrowing the trade gap as the U.S. dollar helped boost exports, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
