 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co said on Thursday it won a $1.4 billion contract from energy producer Caithness Energy LLC to supply wind turbines for what will eventually be the world's biggest wind farm. 

 The Shepherds Flat wind farm in Oregon, a $2 billion project, has received most of its government permits and is ready to be built, the companies said. A total of 338 turbines are to be installed in 2011 and 2012, when construction is scheduled to be completed. The Shepherds Flat wind farm will supply energy to Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison International. Shepherds Flat is the first North American deployment of GE's 2.5xl wind turbine, which operates in Europe and Asia, and is the largest global order for such turbines. GE will also provide operational and maintenance services for 10 years. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
