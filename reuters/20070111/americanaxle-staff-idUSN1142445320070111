  (Adds closing share price, detail on fourth-quarter charge) 

  By  Kevin Krolicki DETROIT  Jan 11 (Reuters) - American Axle & Manufacturing
Holdings Inc. ( AXL.N ) on Thursday said almost 1,500 workers
represented by the United Auto Workers had taken buyouts and
early retirement offers, cutting its unionized factory work
force by a quarter.  The result represented deeper job cuts than analysts had
forecast and at a lower cost than the company's initial
estimates. American Axle shares closed over 7 percent higher,
the biggest percentage gain in over eight months.  American Axle, which supplies axles, drive shafts and
chassis systems for General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and other
automakers, offered buyouts in October to the 6,000 workers
that had been represented by the UAW, as it looked to cut costs
in the face of weaker U.S. auto production.  American Axle becomes the latest U.S. auto company to
complete major deals to cut its unionized work force after
similar voluntary programs at GM and Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) cut
over 70,000 jobs.  The Detroit-based supplier said on Thursday it would idle a
portion of its production capacity at plants that make
components for mid-sized light trucks.  It expected to take restructuring charges of between $175
million to $200 million for 2006, although the cost of its job
cuts -- $140 million -- was lower than initial estimate.  In addition, American Axle also said it would take a
fourth-quarter asset impairment charge of $200 million.  Richard Dauch, chairman and chief executive of American
Axle, said the industry faced another tough year in 2007 with
flat to weaker U.S. auto sales, continued overcapacity and
pressure on costs from commodities to health care.  "2007, bluntly, will be another ball buster," he told
analysts. "I sort of enjoy it. My people learn to enjoy it. The
domestic auto industry is not for timid people."  The company said about 265 workers had accepted early
retirement. Another 1,208 workers took buyouts, meaning they
surrendered retirement benefits for a lump sum payment of up to
$100,000.  American Axle shares closed 7.35 percent, or $1.30, higher
at $18.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.  OUTLOOK FOR 2007  Dauch declined to give a specific profitability forecast,
but said American Axle would post positive earnings and
improved cash flow in 2007 on net sales of $3.3 billion.  He forecast industry-wide U.S. light vehicle sales of
between 16 million and 16.5 million in 2007, with domestic
production of about 15.4 million, in line with the industry
consensus.  Production of the major vehicle lines supplied by American
Axle is expected to drop 2 percent in 2007, Dauch told analysts
at a meeting in Dearborn, Michigan monitored via Web cast
.  American Axle has a backlog of $1.1 billion in orders out
to 2012, Dauch said, including $140 million for Asian
automakers who have been winning market share from Detroit.  JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note issued on
Thursday the job cuts had exceeded the expectations of Wall
Street analysts for a reduction of up to 15 percent.  Patel said savings would top $100 million per year,
equivalent to $1.30 in earnings per share.   American Axle said more than 1,300 workers had left the
company before the end of 2006. It said 67 salaried workers had
taken buyouts and added that it would cut another 300 salaried
positions this year.  American Axle said the buyout program would cost the
company about $140 million, below the lowest cost estimate it
provided in October, when it estimated the cost of the program
at between $150 million and $250 million.  American Axle was founded in 1994 when Dauch led an
investor group that bought production assets from GM, which
remains the company's largest customer. It went public in 1999
as a listed company.
