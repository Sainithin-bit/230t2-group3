 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N is 
expected to raise its offer for Midwest Air Group Inc. MEH.A 
on Thursday while pressing the board to complete a transaction 
that it has resisted, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing 
a person familiar with the matter. 

  The airline is expected to bump up a previous offer for 
Midwest by about $2 per share, making the total value about 
$345 million, the Journal reported, citing a source.  About $6.62 would be in cash, and the rest in AirTran 
common stock, the Journal said.  An AirTran spokesman was not immediately available for 
comment.  Midwest said on Wednesday that it will add routes and 
replace its fleet as it tries to convince investors that it 
should stay independent.  It rejected an unexpected $290 million offer by AirTran 
last month, saying it significantly undervalued Midwest.  AirTran has said that the combination would create a 
low-cost airline with revenue of about $3 billion in 2007 and 
generate more than $60 million in estimated cost savings.
