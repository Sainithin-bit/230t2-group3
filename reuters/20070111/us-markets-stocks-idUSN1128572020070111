 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks gained sharply on Thursday, with tech shares driving the Nasdaq up more than 1 percent as investors continued to look to the sector to outperform, and as a drop in jobless claims signaled strength in the economy. 

 Shares of Google Inc. rose 2.5 percent to $501.60 and were among the top positive influences on the Nasdaq, which climbed to a six-year high. Goldman Sachs raised its profit view of the Web search company. "This year tech stocks have outperformed," said Frank Gretz, market analyst and technician for Shields & Co., a brokerage in New York. "It's momentum. You're seeing reinvestment from pension funds" and other investors, he said. Shares of energy companies, which helped lift the market earlier in the day, lost ground as oil prices fell 4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 91.16 points, or 0.73 percent, at 12,533.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 10.52 points, or 0.74 percent, at 1,425.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 27.65 points, or 1.12 percent, at 2,486.98. The Dow was on course to close at another record high. Earlier in the day, a government report showed a larger-than-expected drop in the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits. February crude was down at $51.88 a barrel. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. were up 0.4 percent to $71.29 on the NYSE, after trading as high as $72.85 earlier in the day.
