 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - European regulators said on Thursday 
they had approved proposals for pan-European bourse operator 
Euronext ENXT.PA to merge with the New York Stock Exchange 
NYX.N to form the first transatlantic bourse. 

  "This approval was based on the documentation made 
available during the assessment process and on the various 
assurances and commitments provided by NYSE Euronext Inc. and 
Euronext N.V.," the regulators said in a statement.  The chairmen's committee of Euronext regulators said the 
approval was conditional on the submissions Euronext and its 
subsidiaries need to make to national authorities.  NYSE Euronext Inc., the vehicle set up by New York Stock 
Exchange for the merger, filed its offer document on Tuesday.  The document reaffirmed the offer of 0.98 new NYSE Euronext 
shares plus 21.32 euros in cash for each Euronext share, or 
alternatively the equivalent of 1.2633 NYSE Euronext shares or 
95.07 euros in cash.  Euronext shareholders approved overwhelmingly the merger 
plan in December after concerns among some shareholders were 
soothed about the risk of U.S. regulatory spillover into 
European markets.  Shares of Euronext, which operates the Paris, Amsterdam, 
Brussels and Lisbon bourses and the Euronext.Liffe derivatives 
exchange, were up 3.3 percent at 98 euros at 0821 GMT.  Euronext committed to merge with NYSE in June after 
rebuffing a rival offer from Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ), 
incurring the wrath of some shareholders as well as top 
European politicians who favored a pan-European combination.
