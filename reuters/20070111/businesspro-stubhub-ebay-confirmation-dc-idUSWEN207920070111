 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Online auctioneer eBay Inc. 
( EBAY.O ) said on Wednesday its plans to buy sports ticket 
reseller StubHub for around $310 million in cash, confirming an 
earlier report that the deal was imminent. 

  In a statement, eBay said the agreement would have an 
estimated total value of about $310 million, which will include 
the company's net cash at the time of the deal's closing. The 
final amount will be determined based on a formula at closing.  The deal is expected to close in the current quarter, 
subject to approvals by regulators and StubHub shareholders. 
More details will be revealed at the time of eBay's 
fourth-quarter conference call on January 24, it said.
