 PARIS  (Reuters) - French optics company Essilor International ( ESSI.PA ) might acquire U.S. contact lens maker Cooper Companies ( COO.N ) for 2.1 billion euros ($2.7 billion), brokerage Oddo Securities said in a research note this week. 

 The research note, also picked up by French magazine Challenges, sparked a sharp rise in Cooper's share price, which closed up 11.1 percent on Wednesday, while Essilor shares were up 0.6 percent at 82.15 euros by 0853 GMT on Thursday. Essilor, the world's largest maker of eye lenses, including the Airwear and Varilux brands, declined to confirm or deny the report's content which it called speculation. "We don't comment on speculation," a spokeswoman said. The company has been on an acquisition spree in recent years, snapping up prescription lens laboratories in North America, Europe and India. It made 20 acquisitions in the first nine months of the 2006, and 18 companies in 2005. The Oddo Securities note, which was dated January 8, said that an acquisition of Cooper Companies by Essilor would enhance earnings from year two. Oddo said it assumed an acquisition price of 2.1 billion euros, with the bid being split into 60 percent cash and 40 percent paper. It added that this would imply a capital increase of 840 million euros by Essilor. "Although other players in the contact lens market are natural predators, Essilor may also be interested. The group has made no secret of the fact that it is considering a strategic acquisition in 12-18 months. Moreover, contact lenses are one of the possibilities being explored by Essilor," said Oddo. Cooper Companies' share price has risen sharply since the start of the year after a decision to cancel its presentation at a JP Morgan healthcare conference sparked talk that it was a takeover target. The company, which had been due to make its presentation at the conference on January 8, cited a "conflict" as being the reason for its decision to pull out, said JP Morgan analyst Michael Weinstein earlier this month.
