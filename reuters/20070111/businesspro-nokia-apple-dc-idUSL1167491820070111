 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Apple's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone is an 
interesting product, but its sales goal is not very high, Anssi 
Vanjoki, the head of the multimedia unit at Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) 
was quoted as saying on Thursday. 

  Apple unveiled its much-anticipated take on the smart phone 
on Tuesday, presenting a sleek device with a large screen that 
combines a phone, an iPod and instant messaging.  "It is quite an interesting product but it is lacking a few 
essential features, such as 3G, which would enable fast data 
connections," Vanjoki, whose multimedia unit is a direct rival 
to Apple, was quoted as saying by Finnish business daily 
Taloussanomat.  Apple's Chief Executive Steve Jobs said it could sell 10 
million iPhones in 2008. This would be roughly 1 percent of the 
number of mobile phones forecast to be sold that year.  "Apple's objective is not at a very high level," Vanjoki 
was quoted as saying.  Vanjoki said Apple's entry would give an additional boost 
to the market and that the iPhone proved Nokia's multimedia 
strategy was right.  "This is another piece of evidence that we have been on the 
right track from the beginning," he said.  Nokia said earlier this week it had sold close to 70 
million phones with integrated MP3 players last year but 
analysts say sales of Nokia's music-focused devices account for 
only a small share of that total.
