 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Group NYX.N said on Thursday it 
would introduce new options pricing in conjunction with a penny 
pilot program that begins on January 26. 

  The Big Board's penny pilot program was proposed in October 
to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and was the 
first proposal from an exchange to provide penny quotes for 
pricing options, a move requested by the SEC.  New pricing announced on Thursday will encourage activity 
in penny pilot issues by reducing certain fees.  "The trading of options in penny increments fundamentally 
changes the options marketplace to the benefit of all 
investors," said NYSE Group President and Co-Chief Operating 
Officer Jerry Putnam.  "Our new pricing structure in penny pilot stocks is 
designed to further enhance those benefits by encouraging more 
competitive and tighter markets," he said.
