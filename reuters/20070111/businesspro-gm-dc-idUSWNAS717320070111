 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) said on 
Thursday it will increase capital spending to an annual range 
of $8.5 billion to $9 billion for 2007 and 2008, calling 
product excellence its top focus. 

  The world's largest automaker posted capital expenditures 
of less than $8 billion for 2006.  GM, which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, is in the middle of a 
broad restructuring that includes slashing more than 34,000 
jobs, closing 12 plants and cutting $9 billion in structural 
costs.  "We expect to reflect at least $6 billion of these savings 
in our 2006 financials," Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said in a 
statement, referring to the reduction in fixed costs.  GM said it reduced its structural costs to between 29 and 
30 percent of global revenue in 2006 from 34 percent in 2005. 
The automaker plans to bring that number down to 25 percent by 
2010.  "GM's North America turnaround plan moved faster and 
further than people expected a year ago," Wagoner said.  He added that his priorities for 2007 included staying 
focused on the North American turnaround; continuing to "drive 
aggressively" in emerging markets such as China, Brazil, Russia 
and India; and maximizing the benefits of running the business 
globally.  GM's product chief Bob Lutz last year developed a new way 
to engineer cars in a bid to cut costs and run GM globally, 
getting different regions in the world to focus on specific 
vehicle genres.  A team based in the U.S. will focus on SUVs and pickups for 
GM, while Europe will handle mid-size cars, ensuring that the 
automaker uses fewer vehicle platforms around the world.  "Overall, there is a lot more work to do, but we stand 
today in a much more favorable position that we did just 12 
months ago," Wagoner said.
