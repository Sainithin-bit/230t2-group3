 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Video game maker THQ Inc. THQI.O raised its quarterly and annual outlook on Thursday on strong original property launches and better-than-expected sales of franchises like "Disney/Pixar Cars" and "WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2007." 

 THQ said it expected to report earnings of 91 cents a share for the third quarter ended on December 31, up from a previous estimate of 65 cents to 70 cents. The average forecast from analysts polled by Reuters Estimates was 75 cents. The company raised its sales outlook for the period to $475 million from a range of $400 million to $425 million. Analysts were expecting revenue of $425.2 million. For the fourth quarter, THQ expects earnings of 9 cents per share on sales of about $146 million. It said the outlook reflected the move of an unannounced title for the Sony PlayStation 3 to the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates were expecting earnings of 18 cents per share on revenue of $167.7 million. For the current fiscal year, THQ forecast earnings of $1 per share on revenue of about $1 billion. It had expected profit of 77 cents to 87 cents a share on revenue of $925 million to $975 million.
