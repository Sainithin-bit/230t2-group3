 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Susan Bies said on Thursday that the soft U.S. housing and automobile sectors had not dampened the rest of the economy, which was still pulling "at a very, very healthy pace." 

 "If you take out housing and ... if you take out autos right now too, the rest of the economy seems to be running pretty much at full capacity," she told reporters after delivering a speech on risk management at a conference. "We're hearing there are shortages of skilled labor in so many industries. So it's that construction piece of it that is affecting the aggregate number. But the rest of the economy seems to be moving along at a very, very healthy pace." Asked if the housing market was over the worst of its slowdown, Bies said it was passing through a necessary correction after excess building activity in 2004 and 2005, but warned this would take longer in some areas than others. "Markets that have got robust underlying employment growth or where you have got continued in-migration are going to get through that inventory correction faster. But it is a needed correction because of the excess construction," she said. However, builders were taking aggressive steps to cut back and the underlying strength of the economy would also make this process easier, because buyers were still financially sound. "We have strong employment growth. We have strong wage growth. You've got the stock market recovering. You've got net wealth continuing to build for households. "So that (ensures) a sound demand foundation and they can adjust the inventory much better than you could maybe in some other cases where housing markets have collapsed (when we) were in a recession and people were losing their jobs," Bies said.
