 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Visteon Corp. ( VC.N ) said on Thursday it expects a challenging 2007 -- with production down on platforms it supplies to key customers -- and also added to a previously announced restructuring. 

 The auto parts supplier expects to see operational and financial results improve in 2008 under benefits from the restructuring and business portfolio changes, Visteon said at an analysts' conference near Detroit that was Webcast. Visteon said it expects production to be down year over year on key platforms for which it supplies parts to Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) in North America and Europe. The auto parts maker also expects lower production on platforms it supplies to Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), Peugeot S.A. ( PEUP.PA ) and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) in North America. It expects production increases for Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. ( 005380.KS ) and Kia Motors Corp. ( 000270.KS ) Visteon, which Ford spun off in 2000, did not specify by how much it expected production on those key platforms to decline in 2007 from 2006. Production cuts and high commodity costs have pressured suppliers in recent years. A Visteon spokeswoman declined to comment on a Detroit Free Press newspaper report that the head of French automotive parts supplier Valeo ( VLOF.PA ) had not ruled out making an offer for Visteon. The question did not come up in the presentation. Visteon has narrowed its focus to interiors, climate controls and electronics where new business is concentrated. Visteon plans to fix, sell or close 30 facilities, up from the 23 it had expected to address under restructuring plans announced last year, it said. Visteon has addressed 11 so far and expects to address the rest over the next three years. "Our largest customer has suffered remarkably here in North America and that has put some plants on the list to be closed that were not on the list in 2006," President and COO Donald Stebbins told analysts at the conference. Stebbins also said there probably would be more plant closings in 2010. Visteon in 2005 completed a massive bailout deal with Ford that allowed it to return 23 facilities to Ford and sever ties to thousands of high wage union employees, but further restructuring was required. The Ford deal cut Visteon's revenue by about 40 percent and it still plans to sell some units to narrow its focus. Visteon expects product sales to rise to $11.1 billion in 2007, from $10.9 billion in 2006. Visteon expects free cash flow to be negative in 2007 and 2008 before turning positive in 2009. The parts maker said it had a cash balance of $1 billion at the end of 2006 and no significant debt maturities until 2010. Visteon cut its 2006 outlook for earnings before net interest expense, income taxes and extraordinary items and excluding unreimbursed restructuring costs and impairment of long-lived assets. The company now expects earnings on that basis of $20 million in 2006, down from an October forecast ranging from $40 million to $50 million. It expects a loss of $50 million on that basis in 2007. Visteon shares were up 8 cents at $7.81 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.
