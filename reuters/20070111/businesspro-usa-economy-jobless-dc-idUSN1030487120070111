 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new 
claims for jobless benefits plunged a larger-than-expected 
26,000 last week to its lowest level in more than five months, 
a government report showed on Thursday. 

  Initial filings for state unemployment insurance aid fell 
to 299,000 in the week ended January 6 from a revised 325,000 
for the previous week and to its lowest since a matching 
299,000 in July 2006, the Labor Department said.  U.S. government bond prices extended losses after the data 
signaled the labor market was surprisingly resilient and the 
10-year Treasury note's yield rose to a two-month high. But 
analysts pointed out that claims data tend to be difficult to 
read during the holiday period at the turn of the year.  "Obviously it's a strong number, but you have to kind of 
couch it against the fact that there is some seasonal noise 
that influences it and also the unseasonably warm weather also 
had an impact," said George Goncalves, treasury and agency 
trading strategist for Banc of America in New York  "I think people are trying to come to terms with what it 
really means (to have) a sub-300 number," Goncalves said. "It's 
coming at a time when you had a strong nonfarm payrolls a week 
earlier."  A Labor Department analyst said there were no special 
factors behind the sharp drop but noted seasonal adjustment of 
data is particularly hard through the holiday season.  The drop in new claims came during a holiday-shortened work 
week that included New Year's Day and a national day of 
mourning for the funeral of former President Gerald Ford.  Jobless claims are at a level economists see as consistent 
with the solid pace of employment growth. Last week, a Labor 
Department report showed job growth surprisingly strong in 
December with the economy generating 167,000 jobs.  Analysts on Wall Street had expected claims, which provide 
a rough guide to the pace of layoffs, to fall to 324,000 from 
the 329,000 initially reported for the December 30 week.  A four-week moving average of claims, which smooths weekly 
volatility to provide a better sense of underlying job-market 
trends, also fell, dropping to 314,750 from 316,500 in the 
prior week.  The total number of unemployed still on the benefit rolls 
after drawing an initial week of aid dropped for the second 
straight week.  So-called continued claims edged down 3,000 to 2.43 million 
in the week ended December 30, the latest period for which 
figures are available.
