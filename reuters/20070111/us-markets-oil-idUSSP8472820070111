 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices slumped below $52 a barrel on Thursday for the first time since May 2005, extending a decline to 15 percent since the start of the year on fund selling and weak demand for heating fuel. 

 The slide, on track to be the biggest two-week drop in two years, rang alarm bells for producer group OPEC which has been cutting output since autumn to stem crude's losses from record heights last summer. "We are monitoring the market on a daily basis. The price drop is a big concern," OPEC President Mohammed al-Hamli, who is also the energy minister of the United Arab Emirates, told Reuters in a telephone interview. U.S. light crude CLc1 settled down $2.14 to $51.88 per barrel after touching $51.80, the lowest price since May 31, 2005. London Brent crude LCOc1 was down $1.99 at $51.70. The heavy losses came as a mild start to winter slashed fuel demand in the United States and other top consumers, and as poor returns forced commodities investors to alter their trading strategies, experts said. "Continued fund selling is pushing prices down," said Eric Wittenauer, analyst at A.G. Edwards. "The selling, part reallocations and part liquidations, is bearish for commodities such as crude." Trading volumes and open interest in the benchmark energy contracts are on the rise despite the slide in prices, signaling that speculators who had helped oil reach peaks near $80 in July may not be fleeing but rather taking a bet on a weakening market. <ID:nN11368263> The U.S. National Weather Service said on Thursday that warmer-than-normal weather was expected to prevail in the northern United States through spring, extending a balmy stretch that has undercut use of heating oil and natural gas in the world's top consumer. The soft demand has caused U.S. heating oil stocks to rise during a time of the year they normally fall, and comes after a quiet hurricane season left U.S. oil production from the Gulf of Mexico unscathed. Merrill Lynch analysts estimated "synchronous global warm winter weather" had reduced oil demand in industrialized countries by 300,000 barrels per day in December and was likely to cut back January demand by 600,000 bpd. Adding pressure to oil prices, Russia restarted crude exports through a pipeline to Europe after a three-day halt caused by a trade dispute with Belarus. The pipeline carries a tenth of Europe's oil supply. OPEC President Hamli told Reuters on Thursday the cartel would take further action to stabilize the market, if needed, but no decision had been taken on holding an emergency meeting. OPEC already agreed to cut 1.2 million barrels of daily output from last November and another 500,000 bpd from February. (Additional reporting by  Simon Webb  in London)
