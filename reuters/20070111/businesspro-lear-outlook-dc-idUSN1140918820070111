 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ) gave a solid outlook 
for 2007 on Thursday as the auto parts maker benefits from more 
sales with Asian automakers and lower costs, sending its shares 
up more than 15 percent. 

  The company sees 2007 net sales, excluding the interior 
business it is divesting to billionaire Wilbur Ross, rising 3.4 
percent to about $15 billion, from an estimated $14.5 billion 
last year, it said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission.  It also sees 2007 core operating earnings, excluding the 
interior business, rising as much as 15.4 percent to a range of 
$560 million to $600 million, up from an estimated range last 
year of $520 million to $550 million.  U.S. auto suppliers have been hurt by production cuts at 
the domestic automakers, as well as increased costs for steel 
and other raw materials, causing financial losses and forcing 
companies to slash jobs and restructure operations.  Lear, however, sounded optimistic despite what it described 
as a challenging pricing environment. It sees growth in Asia 
and with Asian automakers globally, potential for moderation on 
commodity costs, lower launch activity costs, improving profit 
margins, new global business and favorable foreign exchange 
rates.  The Southfield, Michigan-based company expects industry 
production of vehicles in North America this year to be about 
flat with last year's 15.3 million vehicles, while North 
American output at the Big 3 U.S. automakers should be down 
about 2 percent from last year, according to the filing made 
ahead of a conference in suburban Detroit.  Most analysts and industry officials expect U.S. auto sales 
to be flat to down this year.  Lear said it sees industry production in Europe up about 1 
percent from last year's 19 million units, according to the 
filing made ahead of a company presentation in New York.  The company, in the midst of a $300 million restructuring, 
said it sees new global business this year of about $800 
million in its core seating and electronic and electrical 
businesses, according to the filing. It also sees "solidly 
positive" free cash flow and capital spending of about $250 
million.  The restructuring costs include $200 million the company 
has already incurred, and another expected $100 million this 
year for severance and asset impairment charges related to 
changes in its manufacturing capacity, the company said.  Lear said its restructuring, which it launched in mid-2005 
and expects to complete this year, includes job cuts and asset 
impairment charges. The asset impairment charges will be 
noncash, while the rest will be cash charges. It expects about 
80 percent of the restructuring costs to result in cash 
expenditures.  The company said in the filing it has no significant debt 
maturities until 2010.  Shares of Lear rose as high as $32.00, and were up $4.11, 
or 14.8 percent, at $31.90 in morning trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.
