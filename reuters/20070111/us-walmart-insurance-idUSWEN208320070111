 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Thursday that the number of workers covered by one of the retailer's health plans climbed nearly 8 percent. 

 Of Wal-Mart's 1.3 million workers 47.4 percent are covered by its health plans. During a recent open-enrollment period, 636,391 workers enrolled in a company plan. Another 43 percent have health care coverage through another source, such as spouses, Medicare, the military or another employer, Wal-Mart said. About 90 percent of the company's workers have some kind of health insurance coverage, Wal-Mart said. "Our associates are telling us these are the health plans they want and need," said Linda Dillman, Wal-Mart's executive vice president of risk management, benefits and sustainability, in a statement. She attributed the rise to efforts the company has made to help workers understand the importance of coverage, including enrollment magazines, videos, conference calls and training sessions. Wal-Mart has long faced criticism that it pays too little and offers inadequate health care in the United States, forcing some people onto public health-care assistance and into emergency rooms. Wal-Mart said on Thursday that 76.3 percent of its workforce were eligible for health benefits in the most recent open-enrollment period. That beats the average of 59 percent of workers in the retail sector who are eligible for benefits, Wal-Mart said, citing a 2006 Kaiser Family Foundation survey.
