 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada's Sun Life Financial Inc. ( SLF.TO ) said on Thursday it will buy Genworth Financial Inc.'s ( GNW.N ) U.S. employee group benefits business for $650 million in cash, adding new products such as group dental insurance and extending its geographic reach. 

 Sun Life, Canada's third largest insurer by market value, said the deal will boost operating earnings per share and return on equity immediately, but did not provide 2007 estimates. "We would expect the accretion to be relatively minor," UBS analyst Jason Bilodeau said in a research note, nonetheless calling the deal "a nice addition" for Sun Life. By 2008, Sun Life executives said they expect to reap annual cost savings of $20 million and operating earnings to rise by about 5 cents a share. Describing the purchase as an "excellent fit," Bob Salipante, president of Sun Life Financial U.S., told Reuters that the acquisition, including three planned new offices, will boost Sun Life's regional sales offices to 34 from 24 and will give the company greater coverage on the U.S. West Coast and in the South. Genworth's employee benefits group business provides life, disability, medical stop-loss and dental insurance to about 32,000 organizations. It serves 2.9 million plan participants. "The fact that they have a dental product extends our product line, so now both sales forces have an extra product in their kit," Salipante said in an interview. "We see dental as an important aggregation product so that our clients would use that in a one-stop-shopping approach." Toronto-based Sun Life will finance the acquisition with existing capital and expects to close the transaction in the second quarter, pending regulatory approvals. "We've retained sufficient capital flexibility to meet our medium-term objectives for share repurchases and dividends, and to pursue similar acquisitions elsewhere," Sun Life President and Chief Executive Don Stewart said on a conference call. On Wednesday, Sun Life said it might buy back up to 5 percent of its own shares under its 2007 repurchase program. Genworth's extensive distribution network will help accelerate its group insurance strategy, Sun Life said. The cost of integrating the two organizations is estimated at about $38 million over several years, Salipante said. On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Sun Life shares gained 37 Canadian cents to C$48.47 early on Thursday afternoon. In New York, Genworth was up 16 U.S. cents at $34.63. Ken Zerbe, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, said the deal appears positive for Sun Life, which had been "a sub-scale player" in the U.S. group insurance market and was searching for a chance to bulk up. In a separate press release, Genworth said it expects to record "a modest gain" on the sale. Its group business reported $24 million in net income on revenues of $554 million in the first nine months of 2006. Richard McKenney, a former Genworth chief financial officer who became a Sun Life executive in September, said he knew the Genworth business and people well. "This is a good book of business for us to be acquiring," McKenney said on the call. Sun Life is paying between 10 times and 14 times expected 2007 earnings for the Genworth group business -- the number varies if anticipated cost savings are included or excluded, McKenney said. He is due to take over as Sun Life's chief financial officer when current CFO Paul Derksen retires this year. With the Genworth business, Sun Life said it will have a bigger share of the U.S. markets for group disability insurance products. It will be the 10th largest player in the U.S. group life business, and fifth largest in North America for combined group life and disability.
