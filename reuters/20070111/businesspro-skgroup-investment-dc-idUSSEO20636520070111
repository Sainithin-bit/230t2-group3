 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Group, parent of oil 
refiner SK Corp. ( 003600.KS ), said on Thursday it will invest a 
record 7 trillion won ($7.47 billion) in 2007, up 16.7 percent 
from last year. 

  It also aims to reach 73 trillion won in sales revenue in 
2007, from last year's target of 70 trillion won, said the 
group, which also includes SK Telecom ( 017670.KS ).  Of SK's total investment, 3.5 trillion won will be 
allocated to energy and petrochemical businesses, while the 
rest will be invested in telecommunications and other 
businesses, the group said in a statement.  The capital expenditure portion of the budget, about 6 
trillion won, will cover upgrading energy and petrochemical 
facilities, extending infrastructure for the telecommunications 
sector and expanding exploration and production activities, 
said SK Group.  South Korean refiners are keen on upgrading their units to 
produce lighter products, as simple refining margins to produce 
cheap, heavy fuels remain weak.  ($1=937.6 Won)
