 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Tuesday said U.S. sales fell 24 percent in June, a decline much larger than analysts expected. 

 The automaker attributed the decline to a cutback in fleet sales to daily rental companies, a "soft industry" and lower incentive spending. GM said it sold 326,300 vehicles in the United States last month. The results were adjusted for an extra selling day this year. GM's chief sales analyst Paul Ballew said the industry was "underperforming" as it hurt from high gas prices and a weak housing market in key states such as Florida and California, which account for about one-fifth of the industry's sales volume. He also said the comparisons with a year earlier were tough because of strong retail sales last summer and a major cutback in fleet sales to daily rental companies. GM, which lost more than $10 billion in the past two years, has cut low-margin fleet sales by almost 100,000 units this year in an effort to return to profitability and increase the resale value of its vehicles. Ballew also said a competitive environment in incentive spending hurt the automaker's sales, particularly in pickup trucks. GM has held incentive spending largely flat this year as part of an attempt to move away from the kind of big discount programs and volatile monthly sales tallies that dogged results for the Detroit automakers earlier this decade. Still, GM launched a program toward the end of June, which offered qualified buyers zero-percent financing for three years with an additional $1,000 cash on some Chevrolet, Pontiac, Buick and GMC vehicles. That program runs through July 9. Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), which has overtaken GM as the world's largest automaker this year, reported a 6.1 percent increase in U.S. sales. Ballew said Toyota's incentives, which included zero-percent financing for five years on its new Tundra pickup truck, surprised GM and hurt its sales in that category. GM's average incentive spend was $2,830 per vehicle in June, down from $3,135 a year earlier, according to industry tracking firm Edmunds. Toyota's average spend, on the other hand, rose to $1,308 per vehicle from $961. GM's shares fell 4 cents to $37.98 in Tuesday afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
