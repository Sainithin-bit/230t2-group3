 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. fund Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL is likely to sell its stake of about 40 percent in Japan's Imperial Hotel Ltd. ( 9708.T ), the Nikkei business daily reported in its evening edition on Tuesday. 

 The investment firm has narrowed its list of bidders to property firms Mitsubishi Estate Co. Ltd. ( 8802.T ) and Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd.( 8801.T ), and it hopes to select a buyer by the end of the year, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. The news sent Imperial Hotel's shares up by their daily limit of 500 yen, or 11.4 percent, to 4,880 yen in afternoon dealings. Based on Monday's closing price, the hotel had a market value of 145 billion yen ($1.2 billion), valuing Cerberus's stake at about 58 billion yen. Cerberus came to own the stake in the prestigious Tokyo hotel after it acquired Kokusai Kogyo Co. 9231.T, an aerial surveying contractor and a leading shareholder in the hotel. The Nikkei report said Cerberus has hired Mizuho Securities Co. as its merger and acquisition adviser.
