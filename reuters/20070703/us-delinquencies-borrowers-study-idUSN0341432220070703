 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The housing slowdown has caused Americans to miss more payments on home loans, though more appear to be paying their credit card bills on time. 

 In its quarterly study of U.S. consumer borrowing, the American Bankers Association said late payments rose in the first quarter from the fourth quarter in every category related to home ownership. Delinquencies rose to 2.15 percent from 1.92 percent on home equity loans, to 2.94 percent from 2.82 percent on mobile home loans, and to 0.60 percent from 0.57 percent for home equity lines of credit. These increases offset a drop in late credit card payments to 4.41 percent, from the fourth quarter's 4.56 percent. The composite ABA delinquency rate, tracking eight loan categories, rose to 2.42 percent -- the highest since the 2001 recession -- from 2.23 percent. "The economy was not firing on all cylinders, as wage growth was restrained and people felt more pressure managing their finances," ABA Chief Economist James Chessen said in an interview. "I worry we will not get through the housing slump until late this year, which means more pressure on individuals to meet home payments and other obligations," he continued. "The key for delinquencies is job growth." The U.S. economy grew at a 0.7 percent annual pace from January to March, the weakest quarter in more than four years, according to the Commerce Department. Payment delinquencies and defaults have risen among homeowners with poor credit histories, or with mortgages whose rates are resetting higher. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke last month called the housing downturn "sharp," and urged lenders to work with homeowners who are falling behind on their mortgages. Meanwhile, the Mortgage Bankers Association has said lenders began foreclosure actions against one of every 172 U.S. mortgage borrowers in the first quarter, a record pace. The ABA surveys more than 300 banks nationwide. It considers payments late if they are 30 or more days past due. Chessen said the first-quarter weakness may persist. "The big thing that worries me in the second quarter is rising energy prices," he said. "If you're at the margin, any increase in expenses can make it more difficult to make payments." Among other borrowings, first-quarter late payments rose on marine, personal, property improvement and recreational vehicle loans, and auto loans made through dealers, the ABA said. Late payments on other auto loans declined. Many such loans are bundled into "asset-backed" securities, and sold to investors including institutions, pension funds and mutual funds. Further economic slowing might drive late payments higher, hurting the value of these securities.
