 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Pending sales of existing U.S. homes hit the lowest level in more than five years in May and factory orders dipped modestly, according to data on Tuesday that suggested the economy was struggling. 

 In addition, Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), Chrysler Group and General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) reported lower U.S. sales for June as high gas costs, fierce competition and the housing slump took a toll on the industry. The National Association of Realtors said its index of pending home sales -- a forward-looking gauge -- slumped 3.5 percent in May to 97.7, its lowest since September 2001. Separately, the Commerce Department said factory orders eased 0.5 percent in May after an upwardly revised 0.5 percent April gain. The May drop, which was smaller than economists had expected, was led by a downturn in civilian aircraft demand. Excluding transportation, orders were up 0.7 percent. Economists said that while factory orders had dipped, the data nonetheless suggested businesses and consumers were holding their ground despite stiff headwinds from housing. "You have to look at the underlying trends. Things look good past the month-to-month volatility" in orders, said Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York. In the second quarter, nondefense, nonaircraft capital goods orders -- a signal of business investment plans -- are up at an annual rate of 15.8 percent while shipments are up 10.8 percent, he said. The May reading on factory orders, while lower, was better-than-expected and helped give a lift to U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 0.31 percent, at 13,577.30. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell as the factory data and rise in stocks led investors to pull money away from that market, despite some support from the weak housing report. HOUSING SLUMP PROLONGED The drop in pending home sales came as a surprise to economists, who had been looking for a 0.2 percent rise. A sale is listed as pending when the contract has been signed but the transaction has not closed. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told Reuters on Monday that he thought the housing market downturn was nearing an end but declined to forecast when a rebound will occur, "In terms of looking at housing, most of us believe that it's at or near the bottom," he said in an interview. "It's had a significant impact on the economy. No one is forecasting when, with any degree of clarity, that the upturn is going to come other than it's at or near the bottom." However, many analysts said the data on pending home sales suggested the housing slide was not yet over. "I do not see a bottoming in the housing market. There is not a light at the end of the tunnel," said Kevin Flanagan, a fixed income strategist at Morgan Stanley in Purchase, New York. At the same time, economists said a pickup in factory activity that has been apparent in other reports would help keep the economy afloat. "Manufacturing appears to be providing a counterweight to the weakness in housing," Flanagan said. However, June results from automakers showed the U.S. sales under pressure, despite more aggressive discounting. Overall monthly sales at Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, were down 11.4 percent from a year ago when adjusted to reflect an additional selling-day this June; sales at Chrysler Group, a unit of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, fell 5 percent; and sales at GM dropped 24.6 percent. Two other reports on major chain store sales pointed to a softening in consumer spending during late June, possibly a seasonal break as summer weather meant reduced shopping. The International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities said in a joint report that sales last week rose 2.5 percent from the comparable period a year earlier. "The 'feel' of the consumer spending trend might best be characterized as slow, choppy and uncertain," said Michael Niemira, chief economist for the ICSC. The softer trend was similarly evident in the Johnson Redbook Retail Sales Index, which showed sales last week up only 1.2 percent on a year-over-year basis.
