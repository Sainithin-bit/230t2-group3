 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The withdrawal of private equity bidders from an auction for Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX has underscored how the demands of increasingly risk averse borrowers threaten some of the more debt-laden deals. 

 Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX, which agreed to buy Coles for A$20.7 billion ($17.7 billion) in cash and stock on Monday, was the lone bidder after the owner of hardware stores saw its private equity partners, Permira and Pacific Equity Partners (PEP), withdraw over the weekend on concerns about the rising cost of debt, according to a source familiar with the matter. Rival private equity firm Texas Pacific also quit the Coles auction last week on debt market worries. Private equity firms, which buy and sell companies by borrowing most of the money, have been propelled by frothy debt markets. In turn, the merger and acquisition boom, led by leveraged buyouts, has helped drive stock markets to record highs. The worries surrounding the Coles deal were stoked by mounting pressure on the debt financings of several major U.S. leveraged buyouts. Retailer Dollar General Corp. ( DG.N ) restructured a debt sale to finance its private equity buyout last week, as high-yield debt investors continued to push back. That restructuring came in a week when a number of companies, including retailer ServiceMaster Co. ( SVM.N ), were forced to make changes to their debt sales and others, such as distributor U.S. Foodservice, pulled deals from the market. The push back from debt investors shows that the tolerance for the popular "covenant light" loans, or those lacking traditional restrictions on borrowers, is waning. Creditors are also resisting pay-in-kind notes, that allow companies to defer interest payments in favor of issuing more debt. What the private equity pullout from Coles showed was that the debt market concerns were not just impacting deals in the financing phase, but deals currently in the pipeline. "We are avoiding deals where we think the financing is stretched," said John Orrico, portfolio manager of the Arbitrage Fund, which takes arbitrage positions in M&A deals. "I don't think there's a deal that we're going to be in that doesn't have tougher bond covenants going forward, or financing with tougher issues to face." The debt pull-back also appears to have impacted the quality of the underlying assets targeted by private equity buyers. Casino operator Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. TRMP.O said on Monday it did not reach a deal with potential acquirers and has ended talks to sell itself, sending its shares down 18 percent. The failure for Trump to strike a deal came even amid a recent spate of private equity deals in the sector. Debt market jitters do not mean the buyout boom faces a screeching halt. That point was illustrated over the weekend when Canadian telecoms firm BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ) agreed to be bought for $32.6 billion by a pension fund and private equity buyers. Still, signs of debt worries were woven into the deal. Sources close to the BCE deal say the winning consortium, which includes private equity firms Providence Equity Partners and Madison Dearborn, does not have the standard "covenant light" arrangement, giving the banks financing the deal some leeway when it comes to restrictions. "I think the purchasers of bonds are looking more closely at the bonds," said Morton Pierce, partner law firm Dewey Ballantine and chairman of the firm's mergers and acquisitions group. "I think you'll see pressure on the (pay in kind) feature and pressure on covenants."
