 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Tuesday said U.S. sales fell 8.1 percent in June, as a big decline in car sales more than offset a slight rise in truck sales. 

 The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 247,599 vehicles in June, compared with 269,404 vehicles in the same month last year. Ford said car sales fell 24.6 percent while truck sales rose 2.9 percent. Results for Ford -- which had sought to curb its lower-margin fleet sales to car rental companies -- include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks and are not adjusted for an extra selling day in June 2007.
