 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Leonard Green & Partners LP and retailer The Container Store said on Tuesday they have agreed to a financial partnership in a private transaction whose terms were not disclosed. 

 The retailer of storage and organizational products, which has 39 U.S. stores, said it expected 2007 sales to reach $600 million. The privately held company put itself up for sale in February.
