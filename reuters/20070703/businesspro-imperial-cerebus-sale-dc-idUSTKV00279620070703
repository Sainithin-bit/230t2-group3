 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. fund Cerberus Capital Management LP 
CBS.UL is likely to sell all of its 40 percent stake in 
Japan's Imperial Hotel Ltd. ( 9708.T ), the Nikkei business daily 
reported in its Tuesday evening online edition. 

  The fund has narrowed its list of buyers to Mitsubishi 
Estate Co. Ltd. ( 8802.T ) and Mitsui Fudosan Co. Ltd.( 8801.T ), 
it said.  The prestigious hotel in central Tokyo is 40 percent owned 
by Kokusai Kogyo Co. 9231.T, an aerial surveying contractor 
that Cerberus bought and is restructuring.  Imperial Hotel's shares were up by their daily limit of 500 
yen, or 11.4 percent, at 4,880 yen in afternoon dealings.
