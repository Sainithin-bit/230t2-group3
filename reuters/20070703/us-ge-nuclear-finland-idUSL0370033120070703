 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) sees opportunities in nuclear investments in Europe and China, but a nuclear boom in the United States would require some form of carbon emission pricing, GE's Chief Executive said. 

 GE Chairman and CEO Jeff Immelt told Finnish financial daily Kauppalehti GE believes it could win at least one major nuclear project in the Baltic countries, Poland or elsewhere in eastern Europe, where nuclear energy is currently being considered. "First, carbon emissions need to be given a price in some way. If that is done, nuclear power investments will surge everywhere, not just in the United States," Immelt told Kauppalehti in comments published on Tuesday. Immelt told the paper GE expects nuclear deals from China after five to 10 years, but not so much from Russia unless it was with a Russian partner. New nuclear projects are currently planned also in Finland, but Immelt said GE would not necessarily be interested in them. "This needs not to be taken the wrong way, as I am not saying 'definitely not'. We just want to see how everything goes and which technology is chosen," Immelt said. Finnish utility Teollisuuden Voima (TVO) is currently building the country's fifth nuclear reactor and the first new reactor in western Europe for more than a decade. GE took part aggressively in the bidding for the TVO project so2me years ago, Immelt said, but lost to a consortium led by France's Areva CEPFi.PA.
