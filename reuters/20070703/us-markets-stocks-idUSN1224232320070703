 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street was set to start a shortened session higher on Tuesday, helped by the latest merger and acquisition news and before data on the manufacturing and housing sectors. 

 Kraft Foods KFT.N is in exclusive talks to buy Danone's ( DANO.PA ) biscuit and cereal unit for 5.3 billion euros ($7.20 billion) in cash, the companies said. Kraft's shares rose 0.8 percent in Europe. Kraft's widely rumored bid for Danone's cookie unit, which includes the LU, Prince and Tuc brands, will give the U.S. food company a stronger foothold in Europe and in emerging markets. "M&A in the news again is always a positive. But I think it will be a quiet, holiday session," said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Avalon Partners in New York. The market will close early at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT) ahead of Wednesday's U.S. Independence Day holiday when financial markets will be closed all day. S&P 500 futures rose 5 points, above fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures rose 37 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 6.75 points. U.S. stocks rallied on Monday, the first day of the third quarter, boosted by takeover activity and data showing a pickup in manufacturing in June. Investors will scrutinize data on factory orders and pending home sales at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) for more clues on the strength of the economy, as well as figures on June domestic car and truck sales. Shares of software maker Oracle ORCL.O rose 1.7 percent in Europe, after rival SAP ( SAPG.DE ) admitted a subsidiary had carried out "inappropriate downloads" of documents belonging to Oracle.  Ford Motor Co.( F.N ) fell 1.1 percent in Europe, after it said on Monday it is offering a premium to holders of its 5-year-old debt securities to convert them to common stock, a move that could hit the automaker's third-quarter results.  Mortgage finance company Fannie Mae's FNM.N shares gained 1.3 percent in Europe after Citigroup raised its recommendation on the stock to buy from hold. In other news, United Capital Markets Holdings Inc. AFP.A has stopped honoring refunds to investors in some of the firm's Horizon Strategy group hedge funds that invested in subprime-mortgage bonds, Bloomberg reported on its Web site.
