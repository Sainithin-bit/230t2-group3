 (Reuters) - Canada posted a larger-than-expected trade deficit of C$1.81 billion ($1.83 billion) in June from a revised C$954 million deficit in May, according to Statistics Canada data on Thursday. 
 Imports grew 2.3 percent to hit a second-straight record high, led by the machinery and equipment sector. Exports edged up 0.2 percent, as a strong gain in exports of car products offset declines in five out of seven sectors.
