 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc on Monday unveiled its latest high-end, ultra-thin personal computer, bringing some fresh design appeal to its enterprise models. 

 Dell called the new Latitude Z the world's thinnest and lightest 16-inch laptop, at 4.5 pounds and less than one inch thick. However, the Latitude Z does not come cheap, starting at $1,999. Dell, the world's No. 2 PC maker said it is targeting the PC at what it calls "impression makers," such as creative professionals. Thin and light is undoubtedly a priority for PC makers this fall, in both consumer and business segments. Technology advances are allowing PC makers to cram ever more performance into a shrinking form factor. Dell launched its premium consumer ultra-thin PC, the Adamo, earlier this year. "We're seeing thin and light spread throughout our portfolio," said Todd Forsythe, vice president in Dell's commercial client product group. Dell said the Latitude Z is the first laptop to offer wireless docking and "inductive charging." It can be recharged without a power cord just by placing it in a special docking station, in the same way many electric toothbrushes charge. The docking station is sold separately. The Latitude Z also comes with an always-on function that allows instant access to email and the Internet, and offers a screen frame that is touch-sensitive and can be used to launch applications and scroll through Web pages.
