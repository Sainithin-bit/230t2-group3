 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence fell unexpectedly in September as the worst job prospects in 26 years fueled worries over personal finances, according to a report released on Tuesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes fell to 53.1 in September from a revised 54.5 in August. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a rise to 57.0 from an originally reported 54.1. * Reflecting Americans' worries about employment prospects, the index measuring jobs "hard to get," rose to 47.0 from 44.3. At the other end of the scale, the gauge of "jobs plentiful" fell to 3.4 from 4.3. That was the lowest since February 1983. * The poor outlook overall led consumers to evaluate their present situation as the worst since March. The present situation gauge fell to 22.7 from 25.4. * In a bit of good news for the Federal Reserve, which has pumped easy money into the financial system in an effort to revive the economy, one-year inflation expectations fell to 5.2 percent from 5.4 percent in August. COMMENTS: JOE MANIMBO, CURRENCY TRADER, TRAVELEX GLOBAL BUSINESS PAYMENTS, WASHINGTON: "Consumer confidence data was a bit weaker than expected. That kind of spurred some (safe-haven) demand for the dollar and helped the dollar push to a new two-week high against the euro as a result. That's the type of data that would reinforce expectations for a sluggish recovery going forward. It's just more evidence that it's going to be a protracted recovery." STEPHEN MASSOCCA, MANAGING DIRECTOR, WEDBUSH MORGAN, SAN FRANCISCO: "It was not as good as people expected. For a very long period of time it seemed like every single economic indicator that came out was beating expectations. And obviously that has caused expectations to grow. And now it seems like expectations have gotten ahead of where the economy is at and so we are starting to see, not all of them, but certainly a majority of data is beneath expectations. That's going to weigh on the market." CARY LEAHEY, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The number is certainly disappointing and unfortunately may be in keeping with the kinds of numbers investors have been seeing recently that suggest that the pickup in the economy is slowing down, meaning not that the numbers aren't getting necessarily better, but that they are not getting better at a faster pace. In other words they are still getting better but the pace of improvement is diminishing." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC., TOLEDO, OHIO: "It was a little disappointing and that's why you saw a turn in the market. This is one of the quandaries in the market: As it's moved up, the economic numbers and statistics have to start being above expectations as the expectations have growth. "This could be a concern over the next couple of weeks as companies start reporting their third-quarter results. Expectations are high, and if they're not exceeded the market will struggle to advance. "This is just one of a string of bad numbers. It could be a sign that expectations are too high. I don't think this is extremely bearish, its more a matter that the market's valuation is fully valued, if not better, for what the expectations are now. You'll have to beat in order to have this rally continue." GARY THAYER, MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It looks like the job situation is still damping confidence. People still believe that jobs are hard to get and until the job situation turns around, confidence will remain depressed." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes turned negative. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices trimmed losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar was weaker against the yen and stronger against the euro.
