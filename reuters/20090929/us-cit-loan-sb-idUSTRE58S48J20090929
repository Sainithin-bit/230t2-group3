 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) is negotiating a new credit facility that could be $10 billion, which could help the finance company pay off maturing debt and stave off bankruptcy, people familiar with the situation said. 

 The details of the facility are still being negotiated, and its size might be substantially smaller than $10 billion or even zero if the company successfully renegotiates the terms of some of its existing credit lines, two people familiar with the matter said. Those existing credit lines include a $3 billion loan that CIT clinched from bondholders in July and a financing facility from Goldman Sachs.
