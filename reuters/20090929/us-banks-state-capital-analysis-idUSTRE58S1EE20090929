 LONDON  (Reuters) - Emboldened by a stock market rally, more European banks are set to follow in the footsteps of BNP Paribas in repaying government aid as they seek to avoid restrictions on lending, pay and dividends. 

 Italy's UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo are likely to join the list later on Tuesday and the chief executive of Switzerland's UBS said he wants to cut ties with the government by buying its way out of a bad bank deal. BNP, France's biggest bank by market value, launched a 4.3 billion euro capital increase, part of a move to repay the French state early on its 5.1 billion euros capital advance.. "Reducing the big brother effect is clearly a priority for a number of banks in Europe," said Antony Isaacs, head of equity capital markets in Europe for Macquarie. As well as UniCredit and Intesa, Britain's Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland are considering raising billions from equity raising or asset sales to limit the state's stake. Europe's banks have replenished capital and are expected to have an average Tier 1 ratio of 10.1 percent by the end of the year, up from 7.5 percent two years earlier, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods estimates. Pressure remains on banks to hold more common equity, however, and banks including France's Credit Agricole or Societe Generale and Spain's Sabadell or Bankinter could come under scrutiny, analysts said. Dutch bank and insurer SNS Reaal last week sold shares to follow rival Aegon in raising funds, leaving ING alone in the country in not repaying part of state aid taken a year ago. Spain's BBVA on Sunday raised 2 billion euros from a sale of convertible bonds, while Norway's DnB NOR on Friday launched a $2.4 billion rights issue. European banks are lagging global rivals in terms of raising equity this year, partly after last year's record fundraising. They have raised $47.7 billion this year, excluding BNP's cashcall, representing 35 percent of the total raised by global banks, according to Thomson Reuters data. Last year Europe's banks raised $111.4 billion, or 55 percent of the global total, the same share as in 2007. WAY OUT A 35 percent rally by the DJ STOXX European bank index since mid-July shows the market is "open" for fundraising, though maybe only for a limited period. That gives banks the option of showing they have investor support and avoiding state help with strings attached. "Once you've got the government in your capital structure they tend to want an increasing say in how to run the business, they have demands above and beyond the normal demands of capital providers so there's a higher cost," said David Williams, analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton. UniCredit, Italy's biggest bank, is discussing options to raise at least 4 billion euros ($5.9 billion) instead of bonds backed by the Italian and Austrian governments. Its board is on Tuesday expected to approve a rights issue. Intesa's board meets the same day, and has said it also has options to avoid taking the so-called Tremonti bonds on offer. It has options including selling assets and issuing bonds to allow it to avoid the more expensive government scheme, analysts said. Lloyds and RBS may want to slam the door on the government and avoid costly terms, but they have fewer options and more uncertainty, analysts said. The European Commission could force Lloyds to sell major assets to win approval for its state aid package, and investors would be unlikely to back a massive fundraising before that uncertainty is resolved, investors and analysts have said. RBS is seeking to raise 3 billion to 4 billion pounds, people familiar with the matter have said. Leaders from G20 countries on Friday said banks need to build up their capital, but fell short of setting a level. The result will be lower returns for banks, but that had been widely expected and banks will have time to replenish capital. (Editing by Sitaraman Shankar)
