 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks shed gains and were little changed while U.S. Treasury prices trimmed losses on Tuesday after a drop in consumer confidence in September caused investors to retreat to the sidelines. 

 The U.S. dollar firmed against the yen, rallying from an eight-month low hit the previous day. The unexpected fall in U.S. consumer confidence, a possible precursor to slower growth, reflected worries about the worst job market in 26 years. Despite a rise in U.S. housing prices in July, the weakness of the consumer sector bodes ill for the year's end, traditionally a period of spending and shopping. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity, so the weak consumer confidence suggests it could take a long time before consumers contribute to growth. After a U.S. stock market rally on Monday, investors took the economic data as an excuse to pause and take some profits. "Investors seem to be looking for an opportunity to take profits and the consumer confidence numbers are the latest excuse to take a little bit off the table," said Carmine Grigoli, chief U.S. investment strategist in the equity division at Mizuho Securities USA Inc in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 0.12 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  were flat. MSCI world equity index was almost unchanged, up 0.1 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares  .FTEU3  rose 0.08 percent. U.S. data on housing prices in 20 metropolitan areas rose 1.6 percent in July, suggesting the domestic housing market was bottoming out, which in turn boosted home construction stocks. "The housing market does seem to have found a base and prices seem to be in recovery, which is quite significant," said David Sloan, Economist at 4CAST Ltd in New York. U.S. government bonds, a safe-haven asset, trimmed earlier losses after the weak economic data was released. The price on benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was briefly unchanged on the day at 102-29/32, rebounding from a session low of 102-11/32. The dollar gained against the yen after Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii appeared to backtrack on comments suggesting he was comfortable with the yen's recent strength, adding he would not rule out taking action if currency moves were sharp and irregular. In his initial remarks after being appointed finance minister, Fujii had said he was comfortable with a strong yen given that the government intends to boost domestic consumption, prompting investors to buy the Japanese currency. Crude oil prices slipped following the dollar's rise and on concerns about demand ahead of the government's weekly inventory report published on Wednesdays. Oil fell 23 cents, or 0.34 percent, to $66.61 a barrel. In currencies, the dollar was up against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.11 percent at 77.139 from a previous session close of 77.051. The euro was down 0.36 percent at $1.4567 from a previous session close of $1.4619. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.67 percent at 90.20 from a previous session close of 89.600. Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index rose 90.68 points to 10,100.20  .N225 . The index slid 2.5 percent the previous day to mark its lowest close since July 24.
