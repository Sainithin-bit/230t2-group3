 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Details are still emerging about how JPMorgan Chase & Co lost at least $2 billion from a failed hedging strategy. Perhaps that doesn't sound like much for a global financial services company with $2.2 trillion in assets, but it's still plenty. 
 So how much is $2 billion? The cost of Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team: A group of investors led by legendary basketball star Magic Johnson and Guggenheim Partners paid about $2 billion this year for the Los Angeles Dodgers. A lot of cookies: Kraft Foods reported in May that annual sales of its popular Oreo cookies surpassed $2 billion in 2011. Nearly the annual GDP for some countries: The 2011 gross domestic product of the Central African Republic was $2.2 billion, according to the International Monetary Fund. Eritrea's was $2.6 billion. More than some JPMorgan businesses earned in the first quarter: JPMorgan's investment bank earned $1.68 billion the first quarter of 2012, while its retail bank generated $1.8 billion. The company earned $2 billion on mortgage fees and related income. A lot less than JPMorgan's compensation costs: JPMorgan spent $8.6 billion in the first quarter of 2012 on salaries, benefits and other compensation. It paid another almost $2 billion to outside consultants, lawyers and other professionals. (Reporting By Joe Giannone; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
