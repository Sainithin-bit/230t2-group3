 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York had been aware of JPMorgan Chase & Co's big trading loss and is currently monitoring the situation, according to a source close to the situation. 
 The Fed bank, which is JPMorgan's primary regulator, aims to ensure banks are sufficiently capitalized to withstand such trading mistakes, not to prevent them, the source said. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer )
