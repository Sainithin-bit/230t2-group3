 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Mortgage Acceptance Co AMC.A said it was exploring strategic options after the real estate investment trust liquidated certain investments to meet margin calls, sending its stock down more than 40 percent in after-hours trading. 

 American Mortgage said it sold its Fannie Mae and Ginnie Mae debt securities and may need to sell additional assets to maintain liquidity. It is withdrawing financial forecasts for 2007 because they "are no longer relevant," the company said. Its shares dropped 41.2 percent to $2.50 in after market trading for the American Stock Exchange listed group. The company, which originates and buys mortgage loans and other debt instruments usually secured by U.S. multifamily and commercial properties, said its board also decided not to declare its regular fourth-quarter dividend to common shareholders. The board did declare a dividend of $0.453 per share on the company's 7.25 percent series A cumulative convertible preferred shares payable on January 15. The New York-based company borrows money short-term to originate and buy commercial mortgage loans and securities. To permanently finance its purchases, it creates and sells collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which are ultimately backed by the commercial loans and securities. The company was warehousing newly purchased or originated commercial mortgages and securities to create a new CDO when the credit crisis deepened. American Mortgage decided not to proceed with the CDO. Meanwhile, it needed to repay its $400 million repurchase facility. The company said it sold the debt securities, two commercial mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap contracts that resulted in a total of $13.5 million in realized losses. The collapse of the subprime loan market has sent shocks through the credit market, making debt more expensive, the value of property lower and, pressuring scores of mortgage companies, such as American Mortgage.
