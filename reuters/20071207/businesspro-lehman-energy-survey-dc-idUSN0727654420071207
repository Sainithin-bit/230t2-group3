 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Global spending on exploration and 
production by oil and natural gas companies is expected to rise 
more than 11 percent to $369 billion in 2008, fueled by 
investment outside North America, according to a survey by 
Lehman Brothers released on Friday. 

  In recent years, energy companies have accelerated spending 
worldwide to produce more oil and gas and take advantage of 
record high prices that have generated big profits.  Spending outside North America is seen increasing 16 
percent in 2008 to $267 billion, according to the twice-yearly 
survey of 344 energy companies.  "Whereas last year the growth was the strongest from 
Russian oil companies and from Middle East and North African 
national oil companies, this year the strong gains are coming 
from a variety of sources," Lehman said in its report.  For example, Mexican state-owned oil company Pemex is 
expected to raise its 2008 spending 23 percent, the survey 
found.  In the United States, exploration and production spending 
is seen rising a modest 3.5 percent to $81 billion due to 
uncertainty about natural gas prices, the survey said.  Canadian spending is forecast to fall 12 percent to $20.3 
billion, hit in part by higher royalties, Lehman said.  The oil price companies use to set their 2008 budgets rose 
to $67.91 per barrel, up sharply from last year's survey price 
of $55.65.  The natural gas price used to set 2008 spending rose to 
$6.78 per thousand cubic feet from $6.70 a year ago, Lehman 
said.  (Reporting by  Anna Driver ; editing by John Wallace)
