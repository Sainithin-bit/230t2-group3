 LONDON  (Reuters) - An investment group led by veteran troubleshooter Luqman Arnold made a long-awaited rescue proposal for Northern Rock NRK.L on Friday, as another suitor, U.S. buyout firm JC Flowers, pulled out of the bidding. 

 Britain's government, which has sanctioned 25 billion pounds ($50 billion) of Bank of England loans for Northern Rock since it became the country's biggest casualty of the global credit crunch in September, has picked a group led by Richard Branson's Virgin Group as its preferred bidder for the bank. But it has said it is open to talks with other parties and Arnold said he was optimistic his proposal better meets the needs of government, shareholders and other stakeholders. "The government has indicated its complete openness to any proposals that address the issues and the needs ...(we) can repay the loan while treating shareholders very well," he said. "Our proposal is simpler, smoother and quicker," he added, saying it was based on stabilizing the bank, bringing in new management and then developing the company as "a strong, independent brand" -- keeping the Northern Rock name. Olivant, the group headed by Arnold, the former boss of British bank Abbey, said its proposal would enable Northern Rock to quickly repay between 10 billion and 15 billion pounds of Bank of England (BoE) loans. It aimed to repay the BoE loans in full by the end of 2009. The Virgin group has said it would immediately repay 11 billion pounds of the BoE loans. "There's a pretty finite amount that can be raised in today's market for this company with its assets, and the range right now is 10-15 billion (pounds)," Arnold said. He declined to say who would fund his proposal, but said a lot of banks are involved across the different offers and suitors couldn't get committed financing until details of a rescue are confirmed. Olivant said it planned for Northern Rock to raise between 600 million and 800 million pounds through a rights issue. Olivant would subscribe for shares worth about 150 million pounds, giving it a stake of about 15 percent. It said the rights issue would raise between 450 million and 650 million pounds and would be pitched at or around the prevailing market price at the time of subscription. The company said it had non-binding support from shareholders owning 23 percent of Northern Rock to take up their share of the rights issue and to sub-underwrite approximately 440 million pounds of the issue near the current market price. The Virgin group has said it would raise money in a rights issue at 25 pence a share, about a quarter of the current value of the shares. By 0345 EST Northern Rock shares were down 0.2 percent at 102.8 pence, valuing the bank at 430 million pounds. Buyout firm J.C. Flowers withdrew from the auction as it had found it "impossible" to construct a deal that would deliver required value for Northern Rock shareholders alongside its own profitability criteria, a person familiar with the matter said. Flowers remained interested in Northern Rock and it could re-enter talks if the auction process stumbles, he said. That would be based on a proposal made in mid-November, which included an offer to shareholders at a "nominal value".
