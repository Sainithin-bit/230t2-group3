 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd ( RANB.BO ) has won tentative approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to make a generic version of Eisai Co Ltd's ( 4523.T ) Alzheimer's treatment Aricept, the regulator's Web site showed. 

 The U.S. patent on Aricept, which is co-marketed with Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ), runs out in November, 2010. Aricept, known generically as donepezil hydrochloride, garnered some $2.3 billion in sales for Eisai in the year ended March 31. Eisai shares ended down 1.3 percent, in line with the Tokyo pharmaceutical subindex .IPHAM.T. (Reporting by  Rina Chandran  in Mumbai and  Edwina Gibbs  in Tokyo; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)
