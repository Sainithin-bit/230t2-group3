 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investment group Olivant said on Friday it had made a rescue proposal for Northern Rock NRK.L that would enable the stricken bank to quickly repay up to 15 billion pounds ($30 billion) of its Bank of England loans. 

 Olivant, led by the former head of UK bank Abbey and veteran troubleshooter Luqman Arnold, said it planned for Northern Rock to raise up to 800 million pounds through a rights issue and an equity subscription by Olivant. It said the rights issue would raise up to 650 million pounds and would be pitched at or around the prevailing market price at the time of subscription, and that it had non-binding support from shareholders owning 23 percent of Northern Rock to take up the rights issue at or around the current market price.
