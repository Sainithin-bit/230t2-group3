 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Friday the U.S. economy is basically strong in spite of risks from a housing downturn and financial market turmoil. 

 "We have an economy in the U.S. that is fundamentally healthy," he said in an interview with with CNBC television. "The biggest risk we have is housing, and housing is a big drag on our economy... we are going through a turbulent time in the capital markets, that's a risk. So we're focused on the risk, but let's not forget that we have a healthy economy," he added. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
