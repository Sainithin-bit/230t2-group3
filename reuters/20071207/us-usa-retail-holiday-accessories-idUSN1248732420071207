 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - In a ho-hum holiday season, a scarf, handbag or string of beads may be the glimmers of hope that lift the spirits of U.S. consumers and retailers alike. 

 Accessories -- which tend to carry higher profit margins than clothing -- could be the best sellers for apparel retailers this year, given the lack of one particular fashion item experts deem "must-have" and general consumer cautiousness. "Accessories are benefiting at apparel's expense," said NPD Research Group's Marshal Cohen, who cited their lower price. "Accessories have now become the primary purchase." Although every holiday sees its share of accessories as gifts -- remember all those socks from Grandma? -- the category can be especially resilient in weak spending years. While people may forgo an entire new outfit, they are less averse to spending on one special accessory that won't cost as much yet will bring flair to their wardrobe, the theory goes. And especially when no one particular competing fashion choice steals focus, or, conversely, when a variety of choices confuse shoppers, accessories might just be a safe "default" choice for gift-giving, some experts say. "In the eyes of the consumer there are must-have items, and the must-have items are accessories," said David Wolfe, creative director of the Doneger Group, a New York-based retail forecaster and consultancy. Eye-catching accessories can be seen at retailers as diverse as fast-fashion chain H&M, apparel giant Gap Inc, whose holiday windows pop with brightly colored scarves this season, and upscale retailers Nordstrom Inc and Saks Inc. While the kimono-style dress or baby-doll top were last year's top picks in apparel, this season's offerings are more diverse, with retailers trying to lure shoppers with everything from trench coats to fleece hoodies, in bright colors to metallics. So, with no particular item stealing focus, accessories may have an advantage over apparel for shoppers unsure of what to buy. Retailers this year are doing a better job coordinating their "winter wear" assortments -- scarves, hats and gloves -- with their apparel offerings, Wolfe said, adding he was surprised to see the amount of space given to the category at Abercrombie & Fitch's Hollister chain. "Virtually every store told me what they're calling winter wear is doing just fantastic," Wolfe said, citing a recent trip to the mall visiting retailers from Abercrombie to New York & Co. Analysts also cite the continued popularity of the handbag, which has been selling particularly well at opposite sides of the price spectrum -- a fashion clutch can be had for less than $20 at Forever 21, or nearly $2000 at Louis Vuitton. "Accessories have been taking share," said Lazard analyst Todd Slater. "It continues to be very strong, especially in the handbag and shoe category." PROFITABLE LITTLE THINGS That little bit of fabric, leather or plastic making up a bag, scarf, or bangle may not look like much, but it's more profitable for retailers than apparel. While basic sportswear yields profit margins for retailers of about 25 to 32 percent, accessories start there and can reach 40 percent, according to  NPD. Still, prices are lower on, say a cashmere scarf than a cashmere sweater, so retailers will have to sell many more scarves than sweaters to bring in the same dollars. "Gross margin dollars might be less, but your profitability is more," said retail analyst Marie Driscoll of Standard & Poor's Equity Research. "The margin is nice, but you need the dollars to pay the rent and to pay the workers. So we want both." Furthermore, apparel has seen intense competition from electronics in recent years, and this year is no exception, with Apple Inc's iPod, high-definition televisions and video games still popular this holiday season. "If people aren't buying a baby-doll dress, they're buying something else," Wolfe said. "Often that thing is an accessory. Sometimes that thing is an electronic accessory -- that's a real problem."
