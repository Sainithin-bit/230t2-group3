 (Reuters) - Merck & Co will pay roughly $950 million to settle criminal and civil charges that it promoted the painkiller Vioxx for an unapproved use, the U.S. Justice Department said on Tuesday. 
 The settlement is the latest in a broader U.S. clampdown over pharmaceutical industry practices that may have put commercial goals above the interests of payers and patients, such as illegally marketing drugs. Below is a list of companies that have reached big-ticket settlements or set aside money to cover a deal with authorities: GlaxoSmithKline Plc -- $2.3 billion The world's biggest drugmaker in 2009 reached a settlement for pitching its now-withdrawn Bextra pain drug and a dozen more medicines to patients and doctors for unapproved uses, after the U.S. government deemed the company a repeat offender for illegal marketing. The company also agreed to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge related to its promotion of Bextra. Eli Lilly and Co -- $1.42 billion The pharmaceutical company settled criminal and civil charges in 2009 for off-label promotion of its antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for use in children and elderly patients. Zyprexa, a $4.5 billion a year schizophrenia treatment and the company's best-selling product, began facing generic competition in the United States last month. Abbott Laboratories -- $1.4 billion The drugmaker took the charge in October as it attempts to settle a U.S. federal investigation into marketing of its Depakote epilepsy drug. Federal officials are probing whether Abbott's marketing of the drug violated civil or criminal laws. The drug had been one of the company's biggest-selling products until it began facing generic competition in the third quarter of 2009.
