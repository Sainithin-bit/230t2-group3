 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A business news cable channel planned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N NWS.N reached a deal to be carried by Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), the nation's largest operator of cable television systems, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. 

 While Comcast has agreed to carry the channel for its digital subscribers, a final decision on whether to start the channel has still not been made, the Times reported, citing two executives briefed on the arrangement. Murdoch has said the new Fox channel would begin in 2007. The new network would be spun off from the Fox News Channel. Comcast's roughly 12 million digital subscribers would get the channel as part of their service, the newspaper said.
