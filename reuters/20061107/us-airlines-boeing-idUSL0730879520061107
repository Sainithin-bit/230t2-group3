 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. plane maker Boeing Co ( BA.N ). has confirmed it will boost production rates for its new 787 long-range aircraft in response to higher-than-expected demand, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday. 

 Mike Blair, Boeing vice president and general manager of the 787 program, said on a conference call that strong sales and a review of production rates was expected to see output lifted from 2011, according to the newspaper. "I think it's a fairly obvious conclusion that we're going to go up higher than we originally planned," he said. Boeing was not immediately available for comment.
