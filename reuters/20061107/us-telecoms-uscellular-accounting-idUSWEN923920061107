 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Telephone and Data Systems Inc.TDS.A and its wireless business U.S. Cellular Corp USM.A both said on Monday that they would will restate financial results dating back to 2002, to make changes related to hedge fund accounting. 

 TDS said its restatement, which concerns forward contracts related to the company's holdings of Vodafone Group PLC ( VOD.L ) and Deutsche Telekom AG ( DTEGn.DE ), affects 2002-2005 annual financial statements as well as quarterly information for 2004-2005 and the first and second quarters of 2006. In a separate statement, U.S. Cellular said it would also restate reports dating back to 2002 to correct accounting for prepaid forward contracts related to its ownership of U.S. shares of Vodafone. The wireless provider said it was making the changes because it did not meet regulatory requirements for hedge accounting for the forward contracts after receiving Vodafone dividends in 2002. Both companies also reported preliminary results for the third quarter. U.S. Cellular said it expected to report operating revenue of $880 million to $900 million for the third quarter ended September 30 and operating income of $70 million to $90 million. TDS said it expects to post a quarterly operating profit of $100 million to $120 million on operating revenue of $1.1 billion to $1.13 billion for the third quarter.
