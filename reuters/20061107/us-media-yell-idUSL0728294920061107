 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's top telephone directory publisher Yell Group Plc YELL.L on Tuesday reiterated full year guidance as it posted a 19.4-percent rise in revenue to 848.8 million pounds ($1.61 billion). 

 Yell, which owns Britain's Yellow Pages and is the largest independent U.S. directory publisher, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were up 15.6 percent to 269.2 million pounds in the six months to end-September. "These results underpin our confidence in the future outlook for Yell," Chief Executive Officer John Condron said. Yell's UK revenue increased 3 percent to 351.6 million pounds, driven entirely by growth from Yell.com which made up for a weaker performance from its UK printed directories which were down 2.7 percent at 297.1 million pounds due to competition. Total U.S. revenue grew 23 percent to 455 million pounds or 26.4 percent at a constant exchange rate. This included revenue from directories publishing for the first time, mainly from the acquisition of Transwestern which was completed in July 2005, of 105.8 million pounds. The company's H1 results also included a first-time contribution from Spanish directory firm TPI which Yell acquired on July 31 as two months of consolidation. Yell said it had consolidated less than 10 percent of the annual revenue owing to the low number of directories distributed in the summer months. TPI revenue during the two months was 42.2 million pounds. The company raised the interim dividend 11.8 percent to 5.7 pence per share.
