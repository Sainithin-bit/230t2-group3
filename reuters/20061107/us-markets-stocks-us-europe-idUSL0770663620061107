 PARIS  (Reuters) - U.S. shares headed for a flat to modestly higher opening on Tuesday, with the mid-term congressional elections likely to take center-stage and outshine a thin corporate and economic agenda. 

 Food makers Sara Lee SLE.N and Dean Foods ( DF.N ), and printing services company R R Donnelley & Sons RRD.N head corporate earnings, and Altera ( ALTR.O ) is a possible market mover after the programmable chipmaker posted a 12-percent rise in quarterly net income. By 1110 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening gains of around 0.05 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1, with many investors likely to postpone big investment decisions until after the result of the U.S. election. Many analysts and insiders of both major U.S. parties have forecast that the Republicans may lose control of the House of Representatives and they believe the Senate will be a close contest. Historically, the U.S. mid-term elections have been bullish for the stock market, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac, but politically sensitive stocks could experience some volatility on Tuesday, traders said. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  climbed 1 percent to end at 12,105.55 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.1 percent to 1,379.78 -- their biggest one-day gains in a month thanks to a string of corporate takeovers. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  shot up 1.5 percent to 2,365.95. Lingering worries about the scope of a U.S. economic slowdown could also hold back sentiment, as does uncertainty over the course of monetary policy after two Federal Reserve officials went on the offensive against inflation on Monday, not ruling out the prospect of another interest rate increase. Despite the recent set of robust corporate earnings, investors will probably soon start to price in a slowdown in profits in coming quarters, some strategists said. "The outlook for earnings per share in the first three quarters of next year is not desperately encouraging... The market will probably react badly to this scenario, especially if slower U.S. economic growth prompts further downward revisions," said Jacques Chahine at Facset JCF in Paris. Other companies in the spotlight could include Toll Brothers ( TOL.N ) after the luxury home builder said it expected to report a 10 percent drop in quarterly home building revenue, below Wall Street estimates. Elsewhere, EchoStar Communications Corp. ( DISH.O ) could also disappoint after reporting a lower third-quarter profit. The U.S. No. 2 satellite television provider said net income fell to $140 million, or 31 cents per share, from $209 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier.
