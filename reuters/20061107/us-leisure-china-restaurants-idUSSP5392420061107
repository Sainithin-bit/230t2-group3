 (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about major U.S. restaurant chains in China: 

 -- McDonald's ( MCD.N ): America's largest fast-food restaurant chain entered mainland China in 1990 with its first outlet in the southern city of Shenzen. Of 30,000 outlets worldwide, McDonald's has some 770 restaurants in 120 cities in China and expects to reach 1,000 outlets by the time Beijing hosts the Olympics in August 2008. Expanding car ownership in China has put drive-thru restaurants at the core of McDonald's growth strategy, and they could account for more than half of new outlets. Revenues from the Asia-Pacific, Middle-East and Africa division, which includes China, rose 9 percent in July-September, to $804.7 million. Australia, China and Japan contribute about 50 percent of the region's revenues. -- Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ): The operator of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell is by far the biggest U.S. restaurant chain in China, with 1,700 KFC restaurants and 261 Pizza Huts. Yum's China division, which includes Thailand and KFC Taiwan in addition to mainland China, makes up nearly a third of the company's operating profit. In 2005, the division opened 375 new restaurants in mainland China, making it the largest restaurant company in the country, with over $1.2 billion in revenue and more than $200 million in operating profit. Yum's third-quarter operating profit in its China division jumped 26 percent to $105 million, while sales rose 28 percent to $445 million. In the U.S., where Yum has 20,000 restaurants, operating profits rose less than 1 percent, to $183 million, while sales fell 7 percent, to $1.3 billion. Yum opened its first KFC in Beijing in 1987, and on average opens a new restaurant in China every day. Yum estimates that roughly three out of four Chinese ate at KFC at least once in 2004, and that number should have grown further this year. Based in Louisville, Kentucky, it operates more than 34,000 fast-food restaurants in more than 100 countries. -- Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ): Starbucks expects China, where it has more than 400 stores, to one day be its biggest market outside the United States. CFO Michael Casey said in August the company could expand the number of its stores by five to 10 times. Beyond saying the China business is profitable, however, the company has laid out few financial details. Starbucks, which currently has more than 12,000 stores, including 8,800 in the United States, entered China in 1999 with a store in Beijing. Source: Reuters
