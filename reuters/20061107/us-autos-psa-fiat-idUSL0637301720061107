 HORDAIN, France  (Reuters) - France's PSA Peugeot Citroen and Italy's Fiat launched new utility vehicles on Tuesday with the two groups preferring limited partnerships over a big global alliance for their future. 

 PSA is battling with declining sales in its main western European markets and aims to accelerate sales in east Europe and China after four profit warnings in five quarters, while Fiat is returning to financial health after cost cuts following a 2001-2002 crisis that was the worst since its creation in 1899. The new compact utility vehicles, which are no longer solely for small and medium-sized firms but increasingly tempt private buyers as well, build on 28 years of cooperation between the French and Italian firms at the Sevel Nord factory here in the north of France near Valenciennes. Another 50/50 joint factory in Italy makes larger light commercial vehicles while the two makers also plan to produce cars with Turkey's Tofas in Bursa from 2008. The new compact utility vehicle versions -- Peugeot Expert, Citroen Jumpy and Fiat Scudo -- will be on sale in early 2007. With a loading space of seven cubic meters, the small vans will be sold at about 19,500 euros ($24,790). The companies jointly invested 440 million euros in the new vehicles, which will be made at a rate of 130,000 per year. "This marks nearly 30 years that Fiat and PSA Peugeot Citroen are engaged with the same conviction of sharing the costs of development and investment," PSA chief executive Jean-Martin Folz said, in what may be his last news conference in his role before he retires in early 2007. The new cars, developed for professionals, can also be used as so-called "ludospace" -- a combination of play and space -- for families able to carry up to nine people. "These allow us to better respond to the demands of professionals and attract private buyers," he said. PLATFORM They are built on the same platform as the big multi-purpose vehicles Peugeot 807, Citroen C8, Fiat Ulysse and Lancia Phedra that are also produced at Sevel Nord, which employs 4,400 people. Since 1998, PSA has a platform policy which means that at least 60 percent of a vehicle should be made up of common parts -- the subframe, powertrain, transmission and chassis. The group has three platforms of its own and three cooperation platforms, of which two are with Fiat and one with Toyota for the very small Aygo, 107 and C1 cars made at Kolin in the Czech Republic. Shared platforms allow for lower costs per vehicle. In the specific market for light commercial vehicles, Volkswagen is the leader with its Transporter followed by the Renault Traffic. But in the larger commercial vehicle sector of up to 3.5 metric tons, PSA had a market share of 17.8 percent in western Europe in the eight months up to August, against Renault's 14.6 percent, Fiat's 13.3 percent and Volkswagen's 10 percent. NO BIG ALLIANCE PSA has several co-operation deals such as the ones with Fiat and Toyota, as well as with BMW, Ford and Renault for engines and Mitsubishi Motors Corp for the new C-Crosser and 4007 four-by-four sports utility vehicles. For Folz, these deals made more economic sense than a big alliance such as DaimlerChrysler or Renault-Nissan. Fiat's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, is also relying heavily on partnerships after his predecessors flirted with General Motors Corp for an all-out tie-up that ended in a $2 billion settlement in 2005. That same year he signed a deal with Ford for a small car to replace the 500 and Ka models in 2007/08, based on the Panda platform and made in Poland and Italy. On Wednesday and Thursday, he will unveil the 2007-2010 strategy for the group to analysts, investors and journalists. He said last month that alliances were "absolutely crucial" for the long-term viability of Fiat and added the group was studying an alliance with India's Tata Motors Ltd.
