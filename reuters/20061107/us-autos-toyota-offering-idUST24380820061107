 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) said on Tuesday that a state-backed body would unload 43.4 million of the automaker's shares in a secondary offering worth about 308 billion yen ($2.6 billion.). 

 Separately, Toyota also announced plans to buy back up to 20 million of its own shares, or up to 150 billion yen worth, over two days from November 9. as part of a previously unveiled scheme to buy back up to 200 billion yen of its stock. In the secondary offering, Japan's top automaker said the Banks' Shareholdings Purchase Corp. had entrusted 43.4 million of its shares to a trust bank to be sold to Japanese and overseas investors sometime between November 30 and December 4. The sale is equivalent to 1.2 percent of Toyota's outstanding shares. The Banks' Shareholdings Purchase Corp. is a state-backed entity set up in 2002 to buy shares from banks, which at the time were unloading their massive shareholdings in companies like Toyota, helping drive the stock market to a two-decade low. The body, which bought 1.6 trillion yen worth of shares in Japanese companies between February 2002 and April 2006, has recently started to sell its holdings, having already unloaded shares in Matsushita Electric Industrial ( 6752.T ) and Yamaha Corp. ( 7951.T ). The body's stake in Toyota will drop to zero after the sale. Nomura Securities and Nikko Citigroup will lead manage the domestic offering, while Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., and Nomura Securities International Inc. will manage the offering in the overseas markets. Before the announcement, shares in Toyota closed up 1 percent at 7,100 yen. The Nikkei average  .N225  ended up 0.18 percent.
