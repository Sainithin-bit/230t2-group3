 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) said on Tuesday its third-quarter loss was a bit smaller than it had announced due to a late loan sale by its finance arm. 

 The world's largest automaker, in its quarterly filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, revised the loss to $91 million, or 16 cents a share, from the $115 million, or 20 cents a share, it had reported late last month as part of its preliminary quarterly results. GM also increased third-quarter revenue to $48.9 billion from $48.8 billion. A spokeswoman for GM's finance arm General Motors Acceptance Corp. said the unit settled a deal to securitize a loan after GM reported preliminary earnings. "There is always a period of time between the preliminary results and the filing. We had a securitization clear in that time, so it's more a function of reporting timeline than anything else." GM said it still estimates its exposure for benefit guarantees to bankrupt Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, a former GM unit, to be between $6 billion and $7.5 billion, but added it would likely be "near the low end" of the range. GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, has been in talks with the parts supplier and its unions over a cost-saving labor deal that would allow Delphi to emerge from bankruptcy. A deal between the United Auto Workers union, Delphi and GM would avert a strike that could shut down GM's production. On Tuesday, GM said Delphi continues to assure the automaker it expects no disruption in its supply of systems, components and parts. "Although the challenges faced by Delphi during its restructuring process could create operating and financial risks for GM, that process is also expected to present opportunities for GM," the automaker said in the filing. "These opportunities include reducing, over the long term, the significant cost penalty GM incurs in obtaining parts from Delphi," it added. In another closely watched matter, GM repeated it expects to close the $15 billion sale of a 51 percent stake in its finance arm in the fourth quarter. GM also said GMAC continues to cooperate with SEC and federal grand jury subpoenas related to investigations into industrywide practices on loss mitigation insurance products, such as finite risk insurance. The automaker is also under investigation for its transactions in precious raw metals as well as its method of booking credits from suppliers. UNDER PRESSURE The quarterly results come as Chief Executive Rick Wagoner is under pressure to show progress in the company's turnaround. GM, which lost $10.6 billion in 2005, saw global sales fall 2.5 percent in the first nine months of 2006 as it lost U.S. market share to Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ). GM executives are also bracing for a possible proxy fight with billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian, the automaker's largest individual shareholder. Kerkorian's financial adviser, Jerry York, quit GM's board in October, after the automaker turned down a potential three-way alliance with Japan's Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) and France's Renault SA ( RENA.PA ). GM shares, which have risen nearly 80 percent so far this year, were up 8 cents at $34.78 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
