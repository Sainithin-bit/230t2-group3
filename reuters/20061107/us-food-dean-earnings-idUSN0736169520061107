 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dean Foods Co. ( DF.N ) on Tuesday lowered the top end of its full-year earnings outlook, forecast next year's profit growth below Wall Street estimates and said it found administrative errors in stock options grants in 1997 and 2000, sending shares down 5 percent. 

 The news came as the No. 1 U.S. dairy company reported quarterly earnings in line with Wall Street expectations. Dean, which last week said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was conducting an informal inquiry into its stock options practices, took a noncash charge of about $500,000 in the latest quarter related to the options, but said it will not have to restate any historical results. Dean is one of more than 150 companies that have launched internal reviews or are subject to SEC probes to determine whether the dates of stock options were manipulated. The company, whose products include Silk Soymilk and Horizon Organic milk, said it revised its 2006 forecast in part due to costs associated with the options inquiry and investments in its business. The company said it now saw 2006 earnings of $2.10 to $2.12 per share, compared with its prior forecast of $2.10 to $2.15. For 2007, it expects earnings per share growth before items in the range of 11 percent to 13 percent. J.P. Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic said those forecasts implied fourth-quarter earnings of 59 cents to 61 cents per share, and 2007 earnings of $2.34 to $2.38 per share, which are both shy of Wall Street's consensus estimates. Zuanic rates Dean shares "overweight." Analysts were looking for profit of 63 cents per share for the fourth quarter and $2.40 for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said third-quarter income from continuing operations had risen to $74.5 million, or 54 cents per share, from $62.2 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the Dallas-based company earned 56 cents, meeting Wall Street expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell 2 percent to $2.5 billion, hurt by a planned reduction in the range of products sold and lower dairy prices, as the company passed on savings from lower costs for raw milk and butter. But the company's dairy unit sold 1.3 percent more milk by volume, a measure that excludes currency and price fluctuations, and saw its operating income and margins boosted by the lower costs, operating efficiencies, and the favorable settlement of a dispute with a supplier. Operating margins in its WhiteWave organic food and soy milk unit were hurt by higher costs for organic milk, sugar and fuel and higher information technology investments. Some analysts have been concerned about whether the supply of organic milk can meet growing demand, since Dean limited supplies to retailers earlier this year. Chief Executive Gregg Engles told analysts the forecast of 20 percent growth in 2007 sales of Horizon brand organic milk was based on the company's business plans and a pipeline of new supply. Dean shares, which had gained 12 percent this year, were down $2.26 at $39.89, or 5.36 percent, in mid-day trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
