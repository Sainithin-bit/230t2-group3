 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. said on Tuesday it would buy a 5.9 percent stake in Japanese truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd. for 44 billion yen ($372.7 million) as part of a broad tie-up to develop low-emission diesel and other engines. 

 The move comes as auto makers around the world race to come up with advanced technology to meet ever-tighter standards for emissions and fuel economy, with many forming operational alliances to sharpen their competitive edge. It also marks a recognition by Toyota, which has been trying to steer the industry toward gasoline-electric hybrids, that it urgently needs a broader line-up of diesel cars as consumers seek to get more mileage out of expensive fuel. Diesel cars are typically 20 to 30 percent more fuel-efficient than gasoline cars, although they emit more harmful nitrogen oxide and particulate matter. Rival Honda Motor Co. earlier this year announced plans to beef up its work on diesels, betting on growth in North America, Japan and other markets where they still occupy a niche. "We consider hybrid technology as one effective solution, but in light of the varying regulations and energy policies in different countries, as well as the proliferation of fuel sources, we need stepped-up efforts in the diesel field," Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe said. "That's why we approached Isuzu with this proposition," he told a joint news conference in Tokyo. The latest step marks Toyota's second capital link-up with a Japanese auto maker in 13 months. In October 2005, it took 8.7 percent of Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd., the maker of Subaru cars. Both Fuji Heavy and diesel-savvy Isuzu, a 69-year-old truck maker valued at $4.0 billion, were formerly affiliated with U.S. auto giant General Motors Corp., which had dissolved those ties to raise much-needed cash. Toyota, the world's second-biggest auto maker after GM, will buy 60 million shares in Tokyo-based Isuzu from Mitsubishi Corp. and 40 million from Itochu Corp., for 440 yen a share. The purchases are scheduled for November 10. The price would represent a 6 percent premium on Isuzu's closing share price of 415 yen on Tuesday. Mitsubishi will remain Isuzu's top shareholder with more than 9 percent, followed by Itochu with more than 7 percent, if all preferred shares purchased by Toyota are converted. POSITIVE MOVE Analysts cheered the tie-up. "It's positive for both sides," said UBS Securities auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida, saying the ties could hasten Toyota's diesel efforts while enabling Isuzu to tap its partner's experience with other advanced technology. "It's especially good for Isuzu -- being under Toyota's umbrella will help as it tries to expand in emerging markets," he added. The tie-up will focus on development and production of small diesel engines, joint development of emission-reducing technology for diesel engines and other powertrain-related technologies. Watanabe and Isuzu counterpart Yoshinori Ida said they have yet to decide what shape the cooperation will take, including whether Isuzu will supply its existing engines to Toyota. Isuzu already supplies small diesel engines to GM and Renault SA, and until recently also to Honda. The partners will form a team within the month to work out details. Toyota sells most of its diesel passenger cars in Europe through the Yaris, Avensis, Corolla and RAV4. "We want to broaden our diesel line-up and improve on the current technology," Watanabe said, adding he believed an equity participation would help to get results fast. Toyota, which announced rosy second-quarter results and lifted its full-year profit forecasts earlier, also holds stakes in Japanese truck maker Hino Motors Ltd., minivehicle maker Daihatsu Motor Co. and motorcycle maker Yamaha Motor Co.. Before the news, shares in Isuzu ended down 1.19 percent, while Toyota ended up 1 percent at 7,100 yen. The Japanese transport subindex closed 0.9 percent higher. (Additional reporting by Yuko Inoue)
