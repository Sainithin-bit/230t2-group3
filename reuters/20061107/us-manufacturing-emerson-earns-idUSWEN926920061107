 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Emerson Electric Co. ( EMR.N ) on Tuesday reported a 26 percent increase in quarterly earnings on strong global demand and said it expected a double-digit profit increase in 2007. 

 The company, whose products range from power systems and heating and cooling units to storage products and hand tools, said many of its markets remain strong, but growth rates are expected to moderate from their 2006 pace. It also raised its dividend and announced a stock split. Emerson shares rose $5.24, or 6.4 percent, to $87.80 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, touching their highest level in six months. The company earned $526 million, or $1.29 per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with $419 million, or $1.01 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain related to the sale of a business, the company posted a profit of $1.24 a share, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $1.20 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 19 percent to $5.52 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts for $5.27 billion. Sales from existing businesses contributed 11 points of the sales growth, with recent acquisitions and exchange rates adding the rest. Demand for Emerson industrial automation and network power systems reflects a strong manufacturing economy worldwide, with high factory use rates and durable goods orders, FTN Midwest Securities analyst John Baliotti said. "Customers have maintained current production levels at their plants if not increased them," he said. "That would drive further demand for automation and probably provide good pricing." RECORD-SETTING Emerson has posted a series of record earnings in recent quarters, driven by worldwide investment in manufacturing and energy infrastructure, while realizing the benefits of past cost cutting. For the full year 2006, four of Emerson's five divisions reported double-digit sales increases and three out of five showed improved profit margins, the company said. Profit margins were lower in Emerson's appliance and tools segment and in its network power division. Looking ahead, Emerson expects underlying sales growth, excluding the impact of acquisitions and exchange rates, of 5 percent to 7 percent in its 2007 fiscal year, and total sales growth of 7 percent to 11 percent. It expects earnings in 2007 to grow by 12 percent to 15 percent from 2006 earnings of $4.48 per share. It said first-quarter comparisons would be affected by unusually low expenses and strong climate technologies sales in the year-ago first quarter. Analysts on average expect 2007 sales to increase 7 percent to $21.59 billion and estimate earnings per share will be up 12 percent to $5.02, according to Reuters Estimates. Emerson's estimates may prove too low, FTN's Baliotti said. "I think the outlook is a good start. We know it to be a conservative company." A key question now is whether the most recent quarter's drivers are in place for the longer term, Baliotti said. "I want to know how much of this we can extrapolate into future periods," he said. Emerson's earnings conference call is set for after Tuesday's market close. Emerson's board also approved an 18-percent increase in the quarterly cash dividend to 52.5 cents per share, and a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend. Both dividends are payable on December 11 to shareholders of record on November 17, with the cash dividend paid on a pre-split basis.
