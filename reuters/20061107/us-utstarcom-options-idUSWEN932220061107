 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Networking technology company UTStarcom Inc.( UTSI.O ) said on Tuesday it had begun a voluntary review of equity award grant practices but had not reached any conclusions about whether adjustments to financial statements would be necessary. 

 The company said it would not announce third-quarter results or make its quarterly filing until after completing the review and did not expect to do so by the extended deadline of November 16.
