 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Playboy Enterprises Inc. PLA.N on Tuesday reported lower quarterly profit, but shares rose more than 9 percent as the company overturned Wall Street expectations of a loss. Lower revenue at the adult entertainment company's namesake magazine and higher expenses in other divisions contributed to the fall in net income. But a strong performance for Playboy's digital media and licensing businesses helped the company avoid a loss and bolstered its strategy to build up its brand across media and other product lines. The company also said it expects advertising sales to rise at the magazine and Web site during the fourth quarter, thanks to increased entertainment and fashion advertising. "We're pleased because this has been a challenging year for the men's (advertising) market," Chief Executive Christie Hefner told Reuters in an interview. Third-quarter net income fell to $1.1 million or 3 cents a share from $3.2 million, or 10 cents a share in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue rose 2 percent to $82.3 million. Analysts on average had forecast a loss of 3 cents per share on revenue of $79.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Playboy, like other magazine publishers, is fighting lower advertising and newsstand revenue as more readers migrate to the Internet and other media. The Chicago-based company has taken several steps to improve performance, including an increased Web presence and placing its famous "Bunny" logo on all manner of clothing and accessories. PLAYBOY ON THE GO Playboy's global licensing profit rose 41 percent to $4.6 million while online subscriptions and purchases revenue grew to $12.6 million from $9 million a year before. But revenue was weak in its U.S. television division and publishing, while corporate expenses rose 31 percent. The company said it is maintaining its forecast of 2006 earnings per share at 5 cents to 10 cents. Playboy also is looking abroad to expand its consumer brand reach and its Playboy clubs, following the opening in October of a club at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas. It hopes to open similar themed venues in London and Macau and could explore other countries such as India, Hefner said. "I certainly think that the more pluralistic, secular societies of countries like Turkey that have pretty vibrant economies would be of interest to us," she said. The debut of Playboy's Indonesian edition sparked protests from Islamic groups and attacks on the publisher's office in Jakarta after it launched in April. The magazine is now in its fifth edition there. "We seem to have worked through it," Hefner said. Brazil is another possibility for the company's consumer products, she added. "The culture is a perfect fit with Playboy." Playboy shares were up 90 cents, or 8.7 percent, to $11.36 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, they reached as high as $11.43. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg )
