 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - EchoStar Communications Corp. ( DISH.O ), the No. 2 U.S. satellite television provider, on Tuesday reported stronger-than-expected subscriber growth in the third quarter, sending shares up 2 percent. 

 While profit fell due to higher costs for servicing a bigger subscriber base, revenue topped the average forecast from analysts, who had expected much slower subscriber growth in the face of competition from cable TV providers. EchoStar said it added 295,000 subscribers to its DISH network in the quarter, up from 255,000 a year earlier. It now has 12.8 million subscribers. According to Cowen & Co., analysts on average forecast a slowdown in subscriber additions to 214,000. Analysts have said growth appeared to be running out of steam at EchoStar and its larger rival DirecTV Group Inc. DTV.N as cable companies win subscribers by bundling television, high-speed Internet and telephone service in competitively priced packages. The two satellite TV providers are benefiting from changes in the TV distribution sector, in particular, winning customers from bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp. ADELQ.PK, whose subscribers are currently being migrated to cable operators Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) and Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), said Oppenheimer analyst Thomas Eagan. "We still think that cable will end up growing subscribers this year for the first time in many years, but satellite companies will add 1.7 million subscribers," said Eagan. EchoStar said third-quarter revenue rose 16 percent to $2.47 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $2.44 billion as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter net income fell to $140 million, or 31 cents per share, from $209 million, or 46 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected 35 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. EchoStar closed up 2 percent at $35.98, after hitting a session high of $37.28 on the Nasdaq. DirecTV shares fell 2.7 percent to $21.84 on the New York Stock Exchange. EchoStar shares have risen by around 12 percent and DirecTV shares have risen around 30 percent since mid-July on reports the two companies might merge. Previous merger talks failed to pass muster with government regulators in 2002. EchoStar Chief Executive Charlie Ergen, who has a controlling stake in the company, said on a conference call that he and the board would look at any "compelling" opportunities in the market, when asked about DirecTV. Investor speculation about a potential merger has been further complicated by reports that Liberty Media's John Malone was in discussions with Rupert Murdoch about News Corp.'s NWSa.N stake in DirecTV. When asked about Malone's interest in DirecTV, Ergen said, "It's a slight positive for us because it creates anxiety in management at DirecTV." But ultimately, he said he did not see any advantages one way or the other. EchoStar said subscriber-related expenses rose 22.3 percent to $1.22 billion. It attributed the rise to lower programming margins, higher maintenance costs for satellite receivers and a rise in customer service costs due to subscriber growth. It said subscriber-related expenses rose to 51.4 percent of subscriber-related revenue, from 49.6 percent a year earlier. Average revenue per customer rose to $62.86 per month in the third quarter, from $57.87 a year earlier. The average spent to acquire each new subscriber fell to $688 from $697.
