 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of major U.S. coal mining companies fell on Tuesday after Foundation Coal Holdings FCL.N said its full-year profit will miss analyst forecasts amid higher costs and lower production. 

 Foundation shares fell as much as 4.9 percent. Shares of larger rivals Peabody Energy Corp. ( BTU.N ) and Massey Energy Co. MEE.N also declined. William Burns, an analyst at Johnson Rice & Co., said the market was disappointed after Foundation said higher-than-expected costs in the Appalachian region and soft market prices would weigh on results. Foundation cut its full-year earnings forecast to between $1.39 to $1.65 per share from its prior $1.85 to $2.30 range. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had been expecting $1.77 before items. Foundation also cited production problems for its lowered forecast. In late afternoon trading, Foundation shares edged down $1.09, or almost 3 percent, to $35.76, after falling as low as $35.06 on the New York Stock Exchange. Peabody fell 93 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $41.27, and Massey declined 45 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $25.08, also on the NYSE. The Dow Jones Coal Index .DJUSCL was down 2.0 percent.
