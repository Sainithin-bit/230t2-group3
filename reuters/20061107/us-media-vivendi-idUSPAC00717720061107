 PARIS  (Reuters) - Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) on Tuesday posted flat third-quarter sales growth, slightly below forecast, as poor trading at its SFR mobile unit and music business dented solid revenues from video games and Maroc Telecom ( IAM.PA ). 

 Its shares sagged as Vivendi declined to elaborate on a failed friendly takeover approach by U.S. private equity firm KKR, and as it stopped short of updating its full year outlook. The French telecoms and media group, which owns the world's biggest record company Universal Music Group, reported sales for the three months to September 30 of 4.889 billion euros ($6.22 billion). This lagged the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 10 analysts for 4.948 billion euros. Vivendi had at the weekend confirmed press reports of the KKR takeover approach, but noted then that talks had not led to an offer. "We think that these results will disappoint and on top of the weekend's news of KKR's having ended bid talks with Vivendi we think it is increasingly difficult to see great upside in the near term," Cazenove wrote in a note. The shares fell as much as 3.10 percent on Tuesday, and were down 2.83 percent at 29.18 euros by 1040 GMT. Vivendi shares have gained 13 percent in the past three months, driven by takeover speculation and improved sentiment toward the telecoms sector. There has been market speculation that Vivendi initiated the talks with KKR to show that a buyout would be difficult to achieve and so bury the matter, at least for some time. No-one at Vivendi wished to comment on Tuesday. "We believe that:...Vivendi wanted to demonstrate that a takeover may be difficult to execute (either thorough a hostile or friendly bid)," Goldman Sachs wrote in a note on Monday. In May, investment fund Sebastian Holdings informally approached Vivendi about breaking it up, lifting the share price and the value of its then less than 5 percent holding in the media and telecoms group. Vivendi Chief Executive Jean-Bernard Levy has since said several times he was against a dismantling of the group. SFR, MUSIC LET-DOWN Sales from SFR, France's second largest mobile operator, fell 1.8 percent to 2.196 billion euros in the third quarter, undershooting an average forecast from six analysts for 2.242 billion euros. Vivendi said the decline had been caused largely by lower prices imposed by the telecoms regulator. Vivendi blamed unfavorable exchange rates for a 2.1 percent drop in revenues at Universal Music Group to 1.096 billion euros. Once stripped of a 36 million euro boost from a litigation settlement with the file-sharing web site Napster, music revenue numbers came in below an average forecast of 1.089 billion euros in a Reuters poll of six analysts. On a brighter note, digital music sales -- music that can be downloaded from the Internet to computers and mobile phones -- continued to rise, climbing 88 percent in the third quarter and now making up 11.5 percent of UMG's total revenues. The growth of digital music sales is helping, albeit insufficiently, the global record market battered by unrelenting Internet-based piracy. Sales from the video games division rose 15.2 percent year on year to 182 million euros. Meanwhile, like-for-like sales from the pay-TV unit Canal Plus rose 4.6 percent to 879 million euros and revenues, already published, from Maroc Telecom rose 12.6 percent. Overall, total year-on-year sales grew 0.3 percent in the third quarter, from 4.874 billion euros published a year earlier, and compared with 4.850 billion in 2005 adjusted for acquisitions and disposals. SPECULATION TO PERSIST? The shares are trading on a prospective price to earnings ratio of 13 times for 2007, which puts them at a discount to other European groups such as Pearson ( PSON.L ) on 17 times but a premium to French media group Lagardere ( LAGA.PA ) on 12 times. Since the start of the year, Vivendi shares have underperformed the media sector index .SXMP by 18.5 percent, the telecoms index .SXKP by 23.3 percent and the CAC-40 index of blue chips  .FCHI  by 25 percent. KKR's informal approach, unlike Sebastian's, would have preserved the group's existing structure, Vivendi said on Saturday. However, some analysts argue the group would still be worth more broken up. "We continue to believe that unless the company defines a consistent strategy, speculation will continue to swirl around Vivendi," French brokerage Natexis Bleichroeder wrote in a note.
