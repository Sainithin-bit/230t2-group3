 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) said on Tuesday it now expects its group-based global vehicle sales for the business year to next March to total 8.47 million units, up from its previous forecast of 8.45 million. 

 Sales in North America are expected to come to 2.87 million units, up from the previous forecast of 2.8 million, and 2.36 million units in Japan, against the previous projection of 2.39 million units. The figures include sales at truck maker Hino Motors Ltd. ( 7205.T ) and compact car maker Daihatsu Motor Co. ( 7262.T ). Japan's top auto maker also said it is now assuming an average dollar rate of 115 yen and a euro rate of 145 yen during the business year instead of the 110 yen and 135 yen assumed three months ago.
