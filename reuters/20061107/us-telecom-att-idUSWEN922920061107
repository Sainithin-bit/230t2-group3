 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) on Monday named two individuals and five companies in an amended lawsuit filed in Texas that charges they accessed customer information without authorization. 

 The defendants are accused of pretexting, in which data brokers, investigators or others pose as the customer in order to gain confidential information. Named as defendants in the amended complaint were: Kym McDaniel of Ellijay, Georgia; Receivables Specialist Inc. of Tamarac, Florida; A-AAA Mortgage Loans & Investments Inc. of St. Petersburg, Florida; Katherine Martens of Lutz, Florida; SRG Inc. of Richardson, Texas; DWC Research Inc. of Tampa, Florida; and Autostar USA Inc. of Corpus Christi, Texas. Efforts to reach the parties were not successful. The defendants were identified as John Does when the suit was first filed in August because of a lack of information about their real identity, the company said in a statement. The illegal practice of pretexting has been spotlighted recently due to the Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) leak scandal, in which investigators, trying to identify who was leaking information from board meetings, obtained telephone records of board members, journalists and employees without permission.
