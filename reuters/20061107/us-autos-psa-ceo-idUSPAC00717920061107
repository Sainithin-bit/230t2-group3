 HORDAIN, France  (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) was set to reveal its new chief executive later on Tuesday as it unveiled a set of new utility vehicles developed with Italy's Fiat ( FIA.MI ). 

 PSA has been looking for a new CEO since announcing in September that Jean-Martin Folz would retire early in January. "The supervisory board of PSA will meet this afternoon and will discuss the proposed candidate for CEO (Chief Executive Officer). The name of my successor will be announced later today as well as the date he will start in his job," outgoing CEO Folz told reporters. The French press has said possible candidates for the job included former Airbus CEO Christian Streiff; Jacques Aschenbroich, a managing director with construction group Saint Gobain ( SGOB.PA ); steelmaker Corus CS.L head Philippe Varin; the head of nuclear reactor maker Areva CEPFi.PA, Anne Lauvergeon; and PSA's own strategy director, Gilles Michel. PSA has declined to comment on speculation regarding who might replace Folz. Folz also declined comment. PSA shares rose 0.8 percent by 1130 GMT. The stock has underperformed rival European carmakers since the start of 2006. Based on latest prices, PSA shares have fallen around 3.5 percent while the DJ Stoxx European automotive sector .SXAP has risen around 23 percent. "Any new CEO at Peugeot is going to help the stock," said Credit Suisse analyst Harald Hendrikse, although he added it was unclear how much upside remained in PSA shares. PSA is battling with declining sales in its main western European markets and aims to accelerate sales in east Europe and China after four profit warnings in five quarters, while Fiat is returning to financial health after cost cuts following a 2001-2002 crisis that was the worst since its creation in 1899. The launch of their new utility vehicles on Tuesday showed that the two groups prefer limited partnerships over a big global alliance for their future. The new compact utility vehicles, which are no longer solely for small and medium-sized firms but increasingly tempt private buyers, build on 28 years of cooperation between the French and Italian firms at the Sevel Nord factory in northern France. Another 50/50 joint factory in Italy makes larger light commercial vehicles while the two makers also plan to produce cars with Turkey's Tofas ( TOASO.IS ) in Bursa from 2008. The new compact utility vehicle versions -- Peugeot Expert, Citroen Jumpy and Fiat Scudo -- will be on sale in early 2007. With a loading space of seven cubic meters, the small vans will be sold at about 19,500 euros ($24,790). Fiat Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne said he saw the automotive division selling more than 360,000 commercial vehicles in 2006. "We will top 360,000 this year and aim to sell 400,000 in 2008, when we aim to boost market share to 12.5 percent," Marchionne told reporters. The companies jointly invested 440 million euros in the new vehicles, which will be made at a rate of 130,000 per year. NO BIG ALLIANCE PSA has several co-operation deals such as the ones with Fiat and Toyota, as well as with BMW ( BMWG.DE ), Ford ( F.N ) and Renault for engines and Mitsubishi Motors Corp ( 7211.T ) for the new C-Crosser and 4007 four-by-four sports utility vehicles. For Folz, these deals made more economic sense than a big alliance such as DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE or Renault-Nissan. Marchionne is also relying heavily on partnerships after his predecessors flirted with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) for an all-out tie-up that ended in a $2 billion settlement in 2005. That same year he signed a deal with Ford for a small car to replace the 500 and Ka models in 2007/08, based on the Panda platform and made in Poland and Italy. On Wednesday and Thursday, he will unveil the 2007-2010 strategy for the group to analysts, investors and journalists. He said last month that alliances were "absolutely crucial" for the long-term viability of Fiat and added the group was studying an alliance with India's Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ).
