 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Telecom equipment giant Nortel Networks Corp. NT.TO NT.N reported a smaller third-quarter loss on Tuesday, helped partly by a gain related to the sale of assets and changes to its employment benefit plans. 

 Toronto-based Nortel said it lost $99 million, or 2 cents a share, in the three months ended September 30. That compares with a loss of $136 million, or 3 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier. The company said its results included the benefit of about $43 million related to changes to the North American employee benefit plan and a $16 million gain from the sale of assets. The year-ago quarter's loss was compounded by restructuring charges, costs to re-file tax returns and improve internal financial controls, and adjustments for prior periods. Quarterly revenue grew 8 percent to $2.96 billion from $2.74 billion. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts expected the company to report a profit of 1 cent per share before exceptional items, on revenue of $2.81 billion. Nortel said its third-quarter results included charges of $25 million from restructuring plans. The company expects fourth-quarter revenue growth to be in the mid to high single digits compared with the fourth quarter of 2005. Nortel is streamlining its operations amid a review of its businesses to determine which markets to exit and in which to invest further. Network backbone technology is one of the company's focuses, as Nortel bets that online demand for video, music and games will stretch the Internet to the brink and prompt big investments from carriers.
