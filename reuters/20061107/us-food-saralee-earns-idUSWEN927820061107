 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N on Tuesday said quarterly profit rose nearly fivefold, helped by a $158 million tax benefit and stronger sales, and its stock edged up 1 percent. 

 The maker of Sara Lee bread and Best Kosher hot dogs also raised its profit forecast for the full year because of lower interest expense. Sara Lee posted net income of $333 million, or 44 cents per share, for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, up from $67 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings in the latest period include about nine weeks of results from Hanesbrands Inc. ( HBI.N ), which was spun off on September 5. The spinoff was the last major step in a 19-month overhaul of Sara Lee's portfolio that saw the company divest businesses to focus on coffee and tea, U.S. deli meats and baked goods, and European household products. Excluding results from Hanesbrands, earnings per share from continuing operations rose to 34 cents from 13 cents. Quarterly sales rose 5 percent to $2.9 billion. The company posted sales growth in all of its business segments for the first time in two years, helped by strong demand for new products such as a bacon variety of Jimmy Dean Breakfast Skillets, and price increases in its bakery division to cover rising wheat costs. Looking ahead, the company raised its full-year profit forecast to a range of 86 cents to 92 cents per share. In August it forecast 80 cents to 88 cents. Analysts, on average, expected 81 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sara Lee shares were up 16 cents at $16.40 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. Through Monday, the shares were down 14 percent for the year and were trading at 19.1 times analysts' average profit forecast for next year. Rival ConAgra Foods Inc. ( CAG.N ) trades at a multiple of 19.6.
