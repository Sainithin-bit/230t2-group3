  (Adds analyst comments, share price) 

  By Tova Cohen TEL AVIV  Nov 7 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. TEVA.O ( TEVA.TA ) said third-quarter earnings rose on
strong sales of generic versions of blockbuster treatments for
depression and cholesterol, as well as its acquisition of IVAX.  Net income at the Israel-based company rose to $606 million,
or 74 cents per share, from $267 million, or 40 cents per share,
a year earlier, it said on Tuesday.  Sales for the third quarter rose 74 percent to $2.29
billion.  Analysts had forecast earnings of 64 cents a share on
revenues of $2.33 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.  Credit Suisse analyst Marc Goodman said Teva benefited from
a lower-than-expected tax rate which added 5 cents to the EPS.  Teva President and Chief Executive Israel Makov said the
company had a strong launch of Azilect, its innovative treatment
for Parkinson's disease. The drug was launched in the United
States in July and is available in 22 countries.  He also said Teva was realising "tremendous synergies" from
its acquisition of IVAX, completed in January.  North American drug sales reached $1.325 billion in the
quarter, up 87 percent from a year earlier.  Sales benefited from 22 new products that were not sold in
the 2005 quarter, including simvastatin and pravastatin for
lowering cholesterol and sertraline for depression.  Goodman said gross margins were higher than forecast,
indicating "our gross margin estimates for the big three generic
products may have been a little light", he said in a research
note.  "We think that this is peak earnings for Teva," Goodman
said. "We expect investor concerns for 2007 to outweigh
excitement over the upside in this quarter. We remain Neutral as
we don't expect much movement in the stock over the next year."  Shares in Teva, the world's biggest generic drug maker,
closed up 0.1 percent at 142.1 shekels in Tel Aviv after posting
gains of more than 2 percent earlier.  Teva's Nasdaq shares were down 1.1 percent at $32.95 in
morning trade.  Teva has 144 product applications awaiting final approval
from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The brand products
covered by these applications have annual U.S. sales of $87
billion.  Global sales of Copaxone, Teva's multiple sclerosis drug,
rose 15 percent in the quarter to $354 million.  The board declared a cash dividend for the quarter of 7.9
cents per American depositary receipt to be paid on Nov. 29.  Teva also said its board authorised the company to
repurchase up to $600 million of its ordinary shares/ADRs and
convertible debentures of its finance subsidiaries.  The repurchase programme is Teva's third in recent years.
