 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc., the No. 2 U.S. telecommunications company, is in advanced talks with YouTube Inc. to bring the Web site's videos to cellphones and television sets, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 A deal may give Verizon a marketing edge over its rivals in the wireless and cable industries, furthering the company's efforts to expand into Internet and entertainment services, the Journal reported. Under the terms being discussed, customers of Verizon Wireless -- Verizon's joint venture with Vodafone Group Plc -- would be able to view some YouTube videos on their cellphones through the carrier's premium V Cast service, the Journal said. Verizon also would offer YouTube videos as an on-demand feature of a TV service it is launching throughout the nation, according to the paper. A deal may give Verizon the exclusive right to carry YouTube videos for a limited period of time, one person with knowledge of the discussions told the Journal. YouTube recently agreed to be bought by Web search leader Google Inc. for $1.65 billion.
