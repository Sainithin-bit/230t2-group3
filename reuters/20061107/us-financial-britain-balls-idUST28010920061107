 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The British government would not be worried about the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) coming under foreign ownership if its shareholders approved of such a move, UK Treasury Minister Ed Balls said on Tuesday. 

 "It is not for the government to take a view on these kind of link-ups or ownership, and we would be relaxed to see a foreign owner of the London Stock Exchange if that's what shareholders decide," Balls told a group of reporters in Tokyo. Stock exchanges worldwide have been joining hands in alliances and mergers to share the heavy burden of investing in next-generation systems, as well as keep up with competition and the globalization of information and trading. Among moves this year, the Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) has built up a 25 percent stake in the LSE, the NYSE has struck a $10 billion deal to take over Paris-based Euronext ENXT.PA, and Chicago's two futures exchanges announced plans to merge. The Tokyo Stock Exchange TSE.UL, Asia's biggest bourse, said on Monday it is in talks with the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) about an alliance, the latest step toward realignment among the world's top exchanges. Balls, who met key economic ministers as well as Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui during his two-day trip in Tokyo, said he got the impression that the Japanese authorities were generally upbeat about domestic economic recovery. He added: "In terms of dealing with global imbalances in a steady and orderly fashion, a strengthening Japanese economy is good news for the world." Balls declined to comment on currencies when asked about the yen's fall against the euro and sterling and concerns among some European officials about the yen weakness. But he noted that putting external pressure on currency policy would hinder Japan's policy making process. "Part of the reason why there has been past difficulties in the economic policy here have been because of external pressure on exchange rates, which then led to not getting the internal macroeconomic policy mix right." "I would expect Japanese authorities to be very focused on domestic stability and growth in the coming months and that would be quite wise." Sterling has been extending its recent gains against the yen, hitting 224.61 yen GBPJPY=R on Monday, its highest since October 1998. The euro is still in sight of the 150.80 yen struck in late October, its highest since the single European currency was launched in 1999. It was near 150.20 yen EURJPY=R at 0845 GMT on Tuesday.
