 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil slid nearly 2 percent to below $59 a barrel on Tuesday as OPEC members differed on whether the producer group's recent output cut agreement was enough to stabilize the market. 

 U.S. crude CLc1 settled down $1.09, or 1.8 percent, at $58.93 a barrel. London Brent LCOc1 gave up $1.27 to settle at $58.48. The weakness came after Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah said OPEC's deal to cut supplies had successfully balanced the market -- a sign that he may not support a further cut when OPEC meets in December. "The Kuwaitis are basically somewhat contradicting the Saudi comments yesterday, saying they see the market a little more balanced," said Tom Bentz of BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc. Prices had risen 88 cents on Monday after Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would take action when it meets on December 14, if world markets remain unbalanced. Naimi, oil minister of the world's top exporter, noted "very high" global fuel stockpiles. OPEC last month agreed to trim output by 1.2 million barrels per day to help stop a 25 percent fall in oil prices since mid-July. Other Gulf OPEC ministers agreed that the group may need to cut further in December, while Iran said OPEC would not need to cut if prices stabilize. "If the market is still unbalanced we will make another cut, but I cannot predict now what the quantity will be. The market is still unbalanced," Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said. The U.S. Energy Information Administration on Tuesday said it expected the producer group to implement only about 745,000 bpd of the 1.2 million bpd in pledged cuts. Traders said the news flow was keeping prices in a range between $59 and $60. "When it's above $60, it's sold into. It's quite well supported by the prospect of OPEC cuts when it gets below $59," said Christopher Bellew of Bache Financial brokerage. INVENTORIES U.S. oil prices have fallen from a mid-July peak of $78.40, undermined by hefty stockpiles. Inventory data from the United States, to be released on Wednesday, was likely to show crude stockpiles rose by a modest 700,000 barrels last week, a preliminary Reuters poll of industry analysts showed. <EIA/S> Adding support to oil prices, militants and villagers invaded an oil production facility in Nigeria on Monday. Agip, a unit of Milan-based ENI ( ENI.MI ), said it had halted 50,000 bpd of production from the flow station at Tebidaba, the latest target in a wave of attacks against the oil industry in Nigeria. <ID:  Over the longer term, many analysts say, the risk remains of ever higher prices. In its annual World Energy Outlook on Tuesday, the International Energy Agency warned prices would be driven higher in the coming decades because investment is lagging demand. It said it considered a moderate oil price to be less than $60 a barrel. (Additional reporting by  Ikuko Kao  in Tokyo; Peg Mackey and Barbara Lewis in London)
