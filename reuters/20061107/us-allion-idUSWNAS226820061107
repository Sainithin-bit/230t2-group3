 (Reuters) - Allion Healthcare Inc. ALLI.O on Tuesday said it expects to restate financial statements for its six months, nine months and fiscal year of 2005 to include a non-cash charge of about $1.5 million to other income/expense. 

 The specialty drug distributor that focuses on patients with HIV and AIDS said the recognition of this charge will cause a reclassification in subsequent periods within shareholders' equity between additional paid-in capital and the accumulated deficit. The company said it is currently reviewing the implication of this transaction on its tax provision and this may have an effect on subsequent periods. (Reporting by Rakesh Sharma in Bangalore)
