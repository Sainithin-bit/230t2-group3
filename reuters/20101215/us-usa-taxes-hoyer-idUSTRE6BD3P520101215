 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer cited "compelling reasons" Tuesday for his chamber to pass the Senate tax bill, including an extension of expiring middle-class tax cuts and a renewal of jobless benefits. 

 Hoyer said he did not know whether there would be enough votes in the House of Representatives to tighten an estate tax provision that many Democrats see as too generous to the rich. But he said House Democrats would meet later in the day to discuss possible changes. (Reporting by  Donna Smith  and  Kim Dixon ; editing by  John O'Callaghan )
