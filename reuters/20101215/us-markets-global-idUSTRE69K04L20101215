 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prospects for a credit downgrade in Spain, combined with upbeat U.S. economic data, led to a sharp downturn for the euro versus the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, while Wall Street shed gains in a late sell-off. 

 Oil traded in New York rose after the U.S. government announced an unexpectedly large decline in U.S. crude inventories, the biggest weekly drop in eight years. U.S. stocks struggled for much of the session, but gave in to a late sell-off for a third day in a row. Early indications pointed to a flat opening for stocks in Tokyo on Thursday as Nikkei futures traded unchanged at 10,375. Stocks tracked the euro zone currency's losses, incurred after Moody's Investors Service put Spain's sovereign credit rating on review for a possible downgrade. "We had a lot of very positive data today, but we still have persistent euro-zone concerns, which is creating this tussle in the market," said Judy Moses, a San Francisco-based portfolio manager at Evercore Wealth Management. She added that seasonal issues related to the end of the year could be affecting traders. "Managers don't want to show high cash balances after such a strong year, but at this point, they also want to lock in gains." At the close of trade, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 19.07 points, or 0.17 percent, to 11,457.47. The index earlier hit a fresh 52-week intraday high. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 6.36 points, or 0.51 percent, to 1,235.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 10.50 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,617.22. A deal that President Barack Obama struck with Republicans to extend the Bush-era tax rates sailed through the U.S. Senate on Wednesday and will soon go to the House of Representatives, where it could face steeper opposition, though it is still expected to pass. Some investors say the tax deal, in addition to expected strong corporate profits, is a reason to hold stocks over the coming year. Another positive element going forward is the supportive trend in U.S. economic data. On Wednesday, reports showed November industrial output and consumer inflation, plus December New York-regional manufacturing data, pointing to an accelerating recovery. European share prices ended lower after Moody's announcement, ending a two-week rally. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed down 0.46 percent at 1,127.25. The index was up over 6 percent in the 10 days leading up to the Moody's announcement. Spain's Banco Santander fell 2.64 percent ( SAN.MC ). Share prices in Japan slipped from Tuesday's seven-month closing high. The benchmark Nikkei stock index fell 0.07 percent  .N225 . EURO DROP The euro fell early in Asian trade on Wednesday but slumped further as the global trading day came to a close. Moody's cited concerns about Spain's mounting debt and 2011 funding needs. The warning included the caveat that while the Aa1 rating could be cut, Moody's does not expect Madrid to have to follow Greece and Ireland in requiring a European Union bailout. In late New York action, the euro fell 1.26 percent at $1.3216. The euro hit an all-time low of 1.2758 against the Swiss franc on the EBS trading platform before clawing back to 1.2790, still down about 0.4 percent. The greenback climbed 0.75 percent to 84.26 yen, while rising over 1 percent against a basket of currencies of its major trading partners .DXY. Even as the euro fell, investors sniffing for a bargain swooped in and bought Spain's sovereign bonds in a hunt for yield. Spanish government bonds reversed early losses. Ten-year government bond yields shot up to a high of 6.43 percent before falling past Tuesday's closing level to 5.48 percent, down 7 basis points for the day. "It's literally a question of people thinking maybe Spain is too cheap," said Huw Worthington, a European fixed income strategist at Barclays Capital in London. "People have maybe cheapened it too much ahead of the auction." Spain holds a 10- and 15-year bond auction on Thursday. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries fell 6/32 of a point in price, lifting the yield to 3.5 percent. The 30-year bond fell 26/32 of a point, yielding 4.58 percent. Spot gold prices fell $17.05 to $1,378.80.
