 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer prices rose slightly less than expected in November, while prices excluding food and energy edged up for the first time since July, according to a report on Wednesday that implied virtually no inflation pressures amid an anemic recovery. A gauge of manufacturing in New York State rebounded in December after falling sharply in the prior month, led by growth in new orders and shipments, the New York Federal Reserve said in a report on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index nudged up 0.1 percent as energy prices rose by the smallest in five months, slowing from a 0.2 percent increase in October. * Core CPI ticked up 0.1 percent as expected, after being flat for three straight months. * Economists had expected overall consumer prices to rise 0.2 percent in November. * The New York Fed's "Empire State" general business conditions index climbed 22 points to 10.57 in December from -11.14 in November. * Economists polled by Reuters had expected a reading of 5.0 for December. * The new orders index rose to 2.60 in December from -24.38 last month, while shipments rebounded to 7.11 from -6.13. * But employment gauges showed deterioration. The index for the number of employees fell to -3.41 in December, the lowest in a year, from 9.09 in November. COMMENTS: NICK KALIVAS, VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL RESEARCH & SENIOR EQUITY INDEX ANALYST, MF GLOBAL: "Generally the Empire data was favorable for growth with the caveat that the labor numbers were a little bit on the weak side. The hours worked have dropped off the last couple of months. "The headline number's strong, there's a nice improvement in orders and shipments but the labor data was a little bit on the disappointing side. "The CPI was generally as expected. The surprise to me was that energy prices were not a shade higher and food costs were contained. I don't think that number had any major surprises or major implications for the market." OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE, WASHINGTON D.C: "The data is somewhat less impressive than the reports that we saw yesterday. CPI was pretty benign although we did see an uptick in the year-over-year core inflation figures. The Empire State came in better than expected on the headline, but we did see a pretty disappointing reading of the employment sub-component. On balance, the data doesn't really change expectations that the economy is improving gradually and because it hasn't really surprised in either direction, it essentially allows the market to revert back to what it's most comfortable with. Right now, that's selling the euro on increasing sovereign credit concerns." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "Manufacturing was favorable. Manufacturing is holding up well. Stocks should still be supported after modest declines. "Even though manufacturing in New York is not a major barometer, manufacturing in general is extraordinarily high, which should suggest some strong gains in GDP which have not come to fruition. Some smaller manufacturing (surveys) have been extremely low." JOHN CANALLY, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: N.Y. FED MANUFACTURING: "It's another acceleration point. For the most part, new orders and shipments accelerated. This first indicator for ISM is pretty good." CPI: "This report gives ammunition to both sides of the argument on QE2. The headline reading is below consensus and it's way below the Fed's comfort zone. This is not going to stop the critics who are going to say the year-over-year core reading is rising and what do you need this program for." DAVID ADER, HEAD OF GOVERNMENT BOND STRATEGY, CRT CAPITAL GROUP, NEW YORK: "CPI came in on the friendly side with headline a tad lower than expected and 0.1 percent core as expected. The surprise is the year over year core gain to 0.8 percent given the 0.1 percent as expected figure, but the difference here is due to seasonal factors versus an underlying threat. "The market is off a bit, not a lot, but the volatility makes for a difficult read. We like these levels, hate the action." DAN COOK, SENIOR ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO "The CPI data didn't provide any big surprises. This is not shocking and certainly won't have much impact on the Fed. The empire state data was better than expected, so that was mildly dollar positive. But nothing extraordinary, as there's so much going on in Europe, and the Fed still has a lot of bond buying to do. If the U.S. data continues to improve, I think we'll see the dollar strengthen." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures slightly trim losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury bond prices pare gains. FOREX: The dollar rises further versus euro, extends gains versus yen.
