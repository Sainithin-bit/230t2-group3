 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's government said on Wednesday the opposition would not be able to renegotiate the interest rate on an 85 billion euros EU/IMF bailout. 

 "The suggestion that the opposition could negotiate a better interest rate from the IMF is frankly laughable," Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told a parliamentary debate on the rescue package. "The only renegotiation possible is on the conditionality of the program not the interest rates." (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins)
