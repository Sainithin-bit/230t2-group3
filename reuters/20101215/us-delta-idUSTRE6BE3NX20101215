 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - U.S. carrier Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) said it expects solid earnings growth in 2011 but pared its operating-margin forecast for the current quarter, citing softness in the Transatlantic market. 

 Delta said on Wednesday it expects an operating margin of 6 percent to 7 percent for the fourth quarter, compared with its prior view of 6 percent to 8 percent. The carrier's shares dropped 3 percent. Shares of other airlines also fell: United Continental Holdings ( UAL.N ) was off 1 percent; AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, was down 2.1 percent, and Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) was lower by 1.3 percent. "In the Transatlantic, our yields are a little soft, given the large amount of industry capacity that's in the Transatlantic at the present time," President Ed Bastian said in a webcast of the company' investor conference. Bastian added that a softness in Transatlantic ticket prices was offset by stronger growth in Delta's domestic business. He said the fourth quarter would be "solidly profitable." Delta, the world's second-biggest airline behind United Continental, said its plans for 2011 include retiring some planes and continuing to pare debt. But it said it will also start talks with plane makers as it looks to assess domestic narrowbody-aircraft needs. The Atlanta-based carrier said ancillary initiatives such as baggage fees, cargo and commercial aviation services are expected to generate 5 percent to 10 percent revenue growth next year. The airline plans to reduce its domestic fleet by 9 percent by December 2011 from December 2009 levels. For 2011, analysts expect Delta to earn $2.20 a share, up from an expected $1.77 this year. FUEL, NEW COMPETITION Delta and other airlines returned to profitability this year, recovering from the recession that sapped corporate and consumer demand for air travel. Yet Robert Herbst, an independent airline analyst and founder of AirlineFinancials.com, cited general concern for airlines as fuel prices have risen in recent weeks. "That's definitely going to be a factor on the cost side," Herbst said. Delta said 2011 would bring other cost pressures tied to maintenance and investments in product improvements. In the past year, Delta has focused on adding passenger amenities such as fully reclining seats and expanding service to higher-growth markets such as New York. Delta on Wednesday declined to comment on a published report that it has approached British carrier Virgin Atlantic Airways VA.UL about a tie-up. Still, Chief Executive Richard Anderson said Delta needed to prepare its finances to have the flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities as the global industry consolidates, whether they be joint ventures or other arrangements. "We think we need to be prepared and positioned for being certain that Delta stays in a strong position relative to both the domestic and the international industry," Anderson said. Shares of Delta were down 39 cents at $12.68 in afternoon trading. The stock has risen about 14 percent this year, compared with a 40 percent rise in the Arca Airline index     .XAL .
