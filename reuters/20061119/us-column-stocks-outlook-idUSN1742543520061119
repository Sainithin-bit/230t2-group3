 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Trading will slow to a crawl on Wall Street this week, with the market closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, but investors' attention will quickly turn to retail sales the next day. 

 Among the scant data set for release this week is the final November reading of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan, due on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters expect the sentiment reading for November to come in at 93.1, close to the month's preliminary index at 93.6. The real test of the U.S. shopper's staying power will come on "Black Friday," the unofficial kickoff of the Christmas shopping season. If the throngs of shoppers lined up for Friday's launch of Sony's PlayStation 3 video game console and Sunday's release of Nintendo's Wii are any indication, this year's Christmas sales might prompt some dancing on the Street. This week's earnings releases will amount to just a trickle, with only six Standard & Poor's 500 components set to report results. The most closely watched will include upscale department store chain Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ), which releases its quarterly scorecard on Monday. Luxury retailers have been optimistic about the outlook for holiday shopping. Nordstrom was among the few retailers to post better-than-expected same-store sales in October. No. 2 home improvement chain Lowe's Companies Inc. ( LOW.N ) is another key company also expected to report results on Monday. Shares of home builders and related companies were battered last week after Lowe's rival Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) and housewares retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc.( WSM.N ) both cut their earnings outlooks for the rest of the year, blaming a slowdown in the U.S. housing market. LISTEN TO THE BOND MARKET Adding to housing-sector woes was a report on Friday showing October had the sharpest decline in housing starts since 2000. But its impact may not weigh heavily on the market since some investors consider it positive for stocks if the housing slowdown pushes the Federal Reserve to loosen monetary policy and reduce interest rates. "The Street has a very short memory, and there's a tremendous bullish bias, but bonds have been telling the opposite story," said Gary Shilling, president of A. Gary Shilling & Co., an investment research firm in Springfield, New Jersey. "Bonds are telling you: 'Not only is the Fed through with raising rates, but we've probably got economic weakness.' My suspicion is that bonds have it right," Shilling added. "Yes, interest rates are going down, but the damage to profits more than offsets that." The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note's US10YT=RR yield fell to 4.61 percent on Friday from 4.67 percent late on Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped more than half a point -- rising 17/32 to 100-5/32 as the surprisingly weak housing data bolstered the view that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates in 2007. Normal trading hours are in effect this week from Monday through Wednesday, with the stock market closed on Thursday and shutting early on Friday. The bond market's early closing on Wednesday may mean many stock players also will leave early for the long holiday weekend. The week ahead "is going to be a slow week unless there's some sort of geopolitical action, which could maybe move the market," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. "In a slow week, if there's some sort of big news, the move could be much more volatile than usual because volume will be light." Other economic releases include the index of leading U.S. economic indicators for October on Monday and the weekly mortgage market index on Wednesday. The Reuters poll calls for a 0.2 percent gain in the October leading indicators index, compared with September's 0.1 percent rise. DOW UP 15 PERCENT THIS YEAR "The bulls are getting tired," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. "They've done their work and you've had this crazy stampede into the marketplace. I think there's time for a rest, at least." Until they hear from retailers about Black Friday's sales, bulls and bears may just have to take a break and enjoy some turkey. While they're kicking back, though, investors have some nice numbers to ponder about the Dow hitting record after record for the past several weeks, while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also run to highs not seen for the past 5 1/2 to six years. For the year, the Dow is up 1,625.06 points -- a gain of 15.2 percent. The S&P 500 is up 152.91 points for the year -- an increase of 12.3 percent. The Nasdaq is up 240.54 points so far this year -- a gain of 10.9 percent. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 36.74 points, or 0.30 percent, to finish at a record 12,342.56 -- also its session high and a lifetime high so far. Since October began, the Dow has closed at a record 18 times. With Friday's closing bell, the Dow had booked a sixth straight session of gains -- its longest winning streak in a year. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 1.44 points, or 0.10 percent, to end on Friday at 1,401.20. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 3.20 points, or 0.13 percent, to close on Friday at 2,445.86. For the past week, the Dow rose 1.9 percent, the Nasdaq jumped 2.4 percent and the S&P 500 gained 1.5 percent. The stock market's rally this fall has been fueled in part by sliding oil prices, which result in lower energy costs for corporations and consumers. On Friday, U.S. oil futures hit a 17-month low amid rising U.S. crude oil inventories in the past week and concerns about an economic slowdown. The expiring December crude oil contract CLZ6 declined 45 cents to settle at $55.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That's a drop of almost 29 percent from the NYMEX record of $78.40 a barrel set in mid-July. Just before the November 7 midterm elections, the U.S. average cost of a gallon of gasoline fell to $2.1820, according to the nationwide Lundberg survey. That is the lowest average retail gasoline price seen in 2006. If that trend holds, that could prompt consumers to spend more on Christmas and give retailers the sound they love most at this time of year: Ka-ching!
