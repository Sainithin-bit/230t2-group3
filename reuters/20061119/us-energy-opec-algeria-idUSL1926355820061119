 ALGIERS  (Reuters) - OPEC may decide on a second output reduction at its December meeting to strengthen the stability of oil prices, Algeria's Energy and Mines Minister Chakib Khelil said on Sunday. 

 OPEC, which pumps about a third of the world's crude, agreed last month to its first formal output curbs in over two years, in order to shore up sagging prices. But in the last week prices resumed falling amid still high U.S. inventories and a broad commodities sell-off by investors, taking crude oil prices to their lowest level in 17 months. Khelil told state radio: "We may decide a second reduction in crude oil production to strengthen the stabilization of the price of oil." He said the market had started to stabilize with the approach of the northern hemisphere winter, a period when demand usually increases. He added: "But it's also very possible that we're going to see a weakening of prices in the second quarter of 2007 because normally in the second quarter there'll be a fall in demand of 2 million barrels per day." OPEC President Edmund Daukoru, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf OPEC members have all said they see scope for deepening a supply cut of 1.2 million barrels a day when OPEC next meets on December 14, pointing to high fuel stocks in top consumer the United States as evidence that the market remains oversupplied. Some traders, as well as the U.S. government, have said they doubted the resolve of the OPEC countries to comply strictly with the agreement. But in Tehran, Iran's OPEC governor said there were signs that OPEC members were complying. "There are various indications that OPEC members have been committed to their promise to cut 1.2 million barrels per day," Hossein Kazempour Ardebili was quoted as saying on the Oil Ministry's Web site SHANA. He cited falling shipping rates, indications that stocks were shrinking in some consuming countries and a halt to the slide in world oil prices. However, Hojjatollah Ghanimifard of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) was also quoted as calling for coordination between OPEC and Non-Opec countries to stabilize oil markets. "OPEC members ... and non-OPEC oil producer countries should actively take part to manage (oil) supply in international markets," Ghanimifard, NIOC's executive director of international affairs, was quoted as saying by SHANA. He said that the oil market still faced fluctuations, adding that it was unlikely to see stable oil prices in the near future. The U.S. Energy Information Administration said this month that it expected OPEC to reduce output by just 745,000 bpd.
