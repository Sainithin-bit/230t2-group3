 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group is set to announce a takeover plan for Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. 

 Citing people familiar with the matter, the newspaper said Blackstone is expected to pay about $48.50 for each share of Equity Office, the largest publicly traded office building owner in the United States. Shares of Equity Office closed on Friday at $44.72 on the New York Stock Exchange. According to Reuters data, a price of $48.50 per share would give Equity Office a value of about $17 billion. Neither Blackstone nor Equity Office representatives were immediately available for comment. Equity Office's management, including its founder Sam Zell, are not expected to be a part of the buyout group, the Journal reported.
