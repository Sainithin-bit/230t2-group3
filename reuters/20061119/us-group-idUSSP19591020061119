 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - The world's main economies face growing inflation risks but prospects for growth are strong, financial leaders said on Sunday after a meeting that also featured fresh calls for more foreign exchange flexibility. 

 The Group of 20 (G20) countries addressed a raft of financial sore spots ranging from stalled trade talks to currency values, wrapping up a two-day meeting with an upbeat but sober statement. The group did not mention China by name when referring to currency policy, but officials signaled the G20 clearly had the new economic superpower in mind. "Around a table like that it is well known who has a flexible exchange rate and who doesn't. So without getting too personal when you talk about flexibility for exchange rates, it is well known what's meant," Australian Treasurer Peter Costello said. "As I see it, there was encouragement towards more flexibility, and I think all of the countries agree with that. It is just a question of timing," said Costello, whose country was host to the meeting. In a communique, the G20 spoke of strong growth and highlighted the danger of inflation. "We need to take advantage of the present strength in the global economy to get policy settings right," it said. Interest rates throughout the industrialized and developing world have been rising this year and last, but they have been coming off of historically low levels. What is more, following wild gyrations in the prices of oil and commodities, ministers voiced concern about inflation rearing its head. "Faced with potential inflationary pressures, the normalization of monetary policy underway in many G20 countries will need to continue," the group said. A Brazilian official, however, later told reporters that both Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and European Central Bank (ECB) President Jean-Claude Trichet were positive on inflation. "Mr. Bernanke was optimistic about inflation in America," Brazil's Secretary for International Affairs, Ministry of Finance, Luiz Melin said after the meeting. "Mr. Jean-Claude Trichet also mentioned that as far as the ECB was concerned, while they cannot afford to be complacent, they were also very happy about that (inflation)." The G20 includes major economies such as the United States and Japan, as well as big emerging powers such as China and India. Together, its members represent 85 percent of global economic output. CLASHES OUTSIDE, CIVILITY INSIDE About 5,000 people had marched through Australia's second city on the first day of the meeting, chanting anti-G20 slogans, while a small group of protesters clashed with police and smashed up a police riot truck. There was no sign of violence on Sunday as the meeting drew to a close. In contrast to the conflict outside of the hotel where the meeting was staged, ministers inside spoke of polite cooperation. South Africa Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said member countries are realistic about the obstacles against more free-floating currencies. "What doesn't happen at G20 is a Monty Python-esque beating up of countries. I think that we allow ourselves to see there are difficulties in a number of countries. Whether you are talking energy or exchange rates, there is nothing to suggest that we convened in order to beat up on China." The United States had vowed to discuss currency flexibility with China, which critics have complained keeps its yuan too low to boost its exports. But U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt, in a statement after the meeting, did not mention China, instead only saying G20 members were pleased to hear from the United States about its strong and healthy growth. The communique called for "appropriate" exchange rate flexibility. "Maintaining strong world growth and containing inflation will require ongoing adjustments to monetary and fiscal policies while ensuring appropriate exchange rate flexibility and structural reform," it said. Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui said it had not been written with any specific country's policy in mind. While China's currency regime is arguably the most prominent source of economic debate, policy makers have also been increasingly focused on Japan's weak yen, which has raised the ire of European authorities because of its effect on trade. One reason for the yen's fragility has been Japan's ultra-low interest rates. The BOJ only recently increased rates to 0.25 percent from virtually zero after seven years of deflation. Fukui said he had told G20 members Japan will continue to adjust monetary policy gradually to keep its economy recovering. REVIVING TRADE TALKS Sensing a window of opportunity may be closing soon, the G20 called for an early resumption of talks to revive the Doha round of trade negotiations. The talks are aimed at a package that could help lift millions out of poverty, but they have stalled as major trading powers have refused to make big concessions. "It is urgent that we get the Doha round restarted," Costello said. "To break the impasse on agriculture will require new concessions in Europe, counterbalancing concessions in America." Ministers have warned that a failure to get Doha going could seriously dent the world economy's long-term prospects. For now, though, the overall view among member countries was of optimism over growth prospects. "G20 members noted that the world economy continues to expand at a solid pace, with growth above its long-term average for the fourth consecutive year," the group said.
