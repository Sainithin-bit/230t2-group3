 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - The Group of 20 economic powers will call for "adequate" foreign exchange flexibility in a communique on Sunday after a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers, a source told Reuters. 

 The source said the communique would also call for an "early" resumption of stalled world trade talks and urge more transparency in energy markets. Financial leaders from developed and emerging economies on Saturday expressed confidence in global growth prospects, but tensions emerged over foreign exchange rates and nagging trade imbalances. The two-day meeting, which brings together countries representing 85 percent of the world economy, will wrap up with broad agreement that the outlook for global growth is strong. Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, whose country is hosting the event, said on Saturday ministers were optimistic as the United States, Europe and Japan were all expanding. However, Costello said no country had said it believed its currency was undervalued, a tacit sign that China had not accepted complaints that the yuan was too weak. Critics of China, particularly from the United States, have charged that Beijing keeps the currency unfairly cheap to boost exports and this increases trade imbalances. China revalued the yuan by 2.1 percent in July 2005 and cut it from a decade-old dollar peg. It has since risen nearly another 3 percent. Participants at the meeting in Australia's second-biggest city have also raised concerns about the risks to inflation posed by high oil prices, despite a retreat to below $60 a barrel from a record high near $80 a few months ago. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said on Saturday he saw no sign oil prices would fall any time soon, a warning underscored by a report from U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers that saw crude prices averaging about $72 a barrel next year. Rato said the longer oil prices stay high the greater the inflationary risks and the more it will sap domestic spending power. The streets around the city centre hotel hosting the meeting were quiet on Sunday, following clashes on Saturday between police and a small group of protesters who overturned barricades and stormed a police riot truck.
