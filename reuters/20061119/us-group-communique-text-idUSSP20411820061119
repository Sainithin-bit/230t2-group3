 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Following is a communique issued from a November 18-19 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of 20 (G20) economic powers. 

 Communique We, the Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the G-20, held our eighth meeting in Melbourne, Australia, under the theme of Building and Sustaining Prosperity. Sustained economic growth is delivering rising living standards and permanent reductions in poverty. Deeper linkages are being forged between nations through trade, investment and the movement of people and capital. These developments provide unprecedented opportunities to spread the benefits of growth widely. Yet we also face shared challenges, including those arising from ageing populations in many countries and rapid population growth in much of the developing world. Meeting these challenges requires effective domestic policy responses supported by effective international policy cooperation and strong and inclusive international institutions. Global outlook G-20 members noted that the world economy continues to expand at a solid pace, with growth above its long-term average for the fourth consecutive year. The outlook remains positive. Global economic growth is expected to slow slightly from the rapid pace of the past few years. Growth in industrialized countries is expected to moderate slightly from its recent strong pace. Among emerging market countries, output growth is expected to remain strong, with key economies like China and India continuing their rapid expansion. Above average growth in the global economy has seen spare capacity decline which, combined with buoyant energy and mineral prices, has increased the risks to inflation. Maintaining strong world growth and containing inflation will require ongoing adjustments to monetary and fiscal policies while ensuring appropriate exchange rate flexibility and structural reform. We need to take advantage of the present strength in the global economy to get policy settings right. Faced with potential inflationary pressures, the normalization of monetary policy underway in many G-20 countries will need to continue. Fiscal policy needs to ensure that public-sector balance sheets are not vulnerable to slower revenue growth and higher expenditure when growth rates resume more normal trajectories, and that there is sufficient room for policy to respond if growth slows more sharply than currently anticipated. We are determined to implement these policies, which are also required to enable global imbalances between countries to unwind in an orderly manner. Stable global economic growth depends on open trade. G-20 members warned of the threat to global prosperity from rising protectionism in trade and investment. The success of the Doha Development Round is essential to securing freer, more open trade, reducing the risk of economic and financial instability, and achieving faster economic growth, development and sustained reductions in poverty. G-20 members call for an early resumption of WTO negotiations and the achievement of an ambitious outcome for the benefit of all. Global energy and minerals markets G-20 consideration of global energy and minerals markets reflects the importance of resource consumption, production, investment and trade to the world economy. Global demand for energy and minerals commodities is set to increase significantly over coming decades driven by a strong world economy, rising incomes, and ongoing industrialization and urbanization in many economies. While physical stocks exist to meet demand and investment is increasing, the expansion of supply to date has struggled to keep pace with demand growth, resulting in significant increases in prices. We agreed that enhancing global trade by strengthening markets, and ensuring sustainability by promoting investment and encouraging efficiency, are the best ways to deliver lasting resource security. We discussed the challenges to macroeconomic policy presented by energy and minerals price cycles. Monetary authorities remain vigilant in keeping inflation low and stable and stand ready to contain second-round price effects. Flexible domestic economies and exchange rates help facilitate adjustment to large movements in traded goods prices. Finance ministers are also focused on key fiscal challenges such as managing revenue surges and the appropriate level of energy subsidies. We agreed that further reform of energy subsidies is a priority in order to improve fiscal sustainability, better target poverty, and ensure that price signals work to expand supply and induce efficiency. We reaffirmed the commitment we made in the G-20 Accord for Sustained Growth in 2004 to direct domestic policies toward creating a favorable overall investment climate and enhancing domestic and international competition. We discussed how the current resources boom can be harnessed for growth and development, highlighting the importance of sound domestic policy and effective governance for boosting investment. We welcomed further work on principles for the efficient and effective governance of extractive firms, both private and state-owned. We noted the benefits of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a voluntary initiative to strengthen transparency, governance and investment-led development in resource-rich countries, and encourage governments and firms to support the initiative. We support continued progress on the World Bank-led Clean Energy Investment framework.
