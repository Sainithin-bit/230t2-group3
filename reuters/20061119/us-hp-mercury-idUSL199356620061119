 LOD, Israel  (Reuters) - Computer and software giant Hewlett Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) said on Sunday its largest research and development center will be located in Israel in the wake of its acquisition of Mercury Interactive MERQ.PK. 

 HP bought Mercury for about $4.5 billion in stock in a deal that was completed earlier in November. Thomas Hogan, senior vice president of HP Software's technology solutions group, said HP has opted to keep Mercury's 700 employees that had worked in its offices in Yehud, a town near Tel Aviv, which will bring HP's workforce in Israel to more than 3,000 -- the second largest tech firm after Intel ( INTC.O ). "HP is committed to Israel," Hogan told a news conference a few miles from Tel Aviv. "We have made a decision to continue and maintain operations in Yehud ... The people based in Israel will be responsible for HP's technology moving forward. "The R&D center in Yehud will be our largest in the world," he said. "This operation is the best of the best." Boaz Chalamish, the global head of R&D for HP Software, said the Yehud center will now have a much broader portfolio of products to produce. "It will do everything it did but with much faster execution," he said. The deal to buy Mercury was HP's largest since a $19 billion buyout of Compaq in 2002. It also matched the largest foreign purchase involving an Israeli company. The merger moved HP to the sixth largest software company in the world in terms of revenues. Hogan said that Mercury will be integrated into HP's financial results beginning in the first quarter -- HP's current quarter -- ending January 31. In 2007, Mercury will be dilutive by 4 cents a share on a proforma basis but is expected to be accretive by 2 cents a share in 2008. HP, which last week reported a jump fourth-quarter net profit that beat estimates, expects the addition of Mercury will result in annual revenue growth of 10 to 15 percent -- half of that amount coming from Mercury and above the sector's growth of 8 to 9 percent. "We expect to take more market share," Hogan said. But he noted that HP remained largely focused on enterprise management software and that HP was not seeking to compete with the likes of Oracle ORCL.O and SAP ( SAPG.DE ). "We will look to fill in the gaps to make sure we are the leader in enterprise management," Hogan said, adding HP was looking for acquisitions.
