 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Congressional negotiations on the economic stimulus package will be a delicate balancing act for President Barack Obama -- avoid too much spending so he does not lose the handful of Republicans backing it while not taking too much out so Democrats do not abandon him. 

 Democrats control both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but have been under pressure to win some Republican support to reflect Obama's promise to forge a new spirit of bipartisan cooperation in Washington. But the House passed the stimulus bill with no Republican support and very few Republicans are expected to vote for it when it comes up this week in the Senate. A group of moderate Senate Democrats with a few Republicans agreed to slash roughly 12 percent from the $937 billion package, which Democrats had hoped would usher in new spending for projects ranging from health care to education. To reach that deal -- pegged at about $827 billion -- $40 billion in aid to states was nixed as was $16 billion for school construction, among other spending. But it still differs from the $819 billion bill that passed the House on January 28. The differences will have to be ironed out in negotiations between the two chambers. After acquiescing to the Senate changes Obama is ramping up his effort to rally support for the package, first traveling on Monday to Indiana for a town hall meeting and then returning to the White House for a prime-time news conference. On Tuesday he goes to Florida for another town hall. "I think going directly to where the problems seem even more acute are important to the president, and important in his effort to convince Congress to move swiftly," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said last week. After the Senate votes on its package on Tuesday, Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate will choose a group of lawmakers to hammer out the differences, the opening for adding or deleting provisions in the legislation. But given the fragile coalition that was put together to reach the deal in the Senate, major changes to that package could prove difficult. Regardless, Obama wants it on his desk by February 16. "I expect there will be some significant improvements over the package that comes out of the Senate," said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat. He said there would be a push for more spending on infrastructure, education and aid to states. "I would say in those three areas that it will come out of conference, hopefully, stronger as a stimulus than when it comes out of the Senate," he said, referring to the conference of negotiations between House and Senate lawmakers. Republicans have complained the package was too large and that Democrats were pushing stimulus proposals that steered money toward some projects that would not help pull the economy out of the recession that began in December 2007. "I know there's been a good faith effort on the part of those involved to pare down the size of the underlying Senate measure," said Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell. "But as near as we can tell, even after those efforts, it is roughly the same size as the House bill." They have sought to cut spending for many projects even though some are considered worthy endeavors. Republicans have argued that such programs should be funded through the normal appropriations process. Attempts by more conservative Republicans to slash spending and replace it with larger tax cuts from the bill failed. But even if the House and Senate negotiators make more changes in the talks, at least one Republican said that would still not be enough to win his backing. "This package is so off base that 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent still doesn't make it a good package," Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, told Reuters. He argued that it was just a spending spree and that the legislation needed to be scrapped so that lawmakers could start over and also take into account the expected need to further address the banking and housing crisis. "I think this whole thing needs to be scrapped, and I think tinkering at the edges of it is basically taking a dog and making a smaller dog," he said. (Editing by  David Wiessler )
