 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner has postponed his bank bailout plan announcement to Tuesday to allow Congress to focus on economic stimulus legislation, the Treasury Department said on Sunday. 

 "The Senate votes on Monday, and economic officials administration wide will be working and consulting with senators throughout the day," the Treasury Department said in a statement. "Secretary Geithner will postpone the release of the administration's Financial Stability and Recovery Plan until Tuesday to allow for that to happen," the Treasury added.
