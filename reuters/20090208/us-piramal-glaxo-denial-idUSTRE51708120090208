 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Indian drug maker Piramal Healthcare Ltd ( PIRA.BO ) said reports about a potential sale of the company to GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ) or Sanofi Aventis SA ( SASY.PA ) were 'unfounded.' 

 Glaxo and Sanofi have emerged as bidders for the Indian firm, with a sale price perhaps as high as $1.5 billion, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday. "We would like to clarify that this is totally unfounded," the Indian firm said in a statement issued on Saturday. "Piramal Healthcare continues to have a strong belief about the significant potential of our core businesses. Accordingly, we have invested in our sales force, built state-of-the-art facilities and continue to pursue acquisitions opportunistically," the company said. The firm recently acquired select brands of India-based Khandelwal Labs, PlasmaSelect PSTG.DE, and U.S.-based RxElite Inc ( RXEI.PK ) and is set to complete the acquisition of U.S.-based Minrad International BUF.A. Piramal's business includes custom manufacturing, in which it helps formulate and package drugs for other firms on a contract basis, with operations in North America, Europe and Asia. For the year ended March 2008, Piramal clocked revenue of about $590 million. ($1=48.7 rupees) (Reporting by Bharghavi Nagaraju)
