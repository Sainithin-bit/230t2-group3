 WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury chief Timothy Geithner said on Saturday that banks getting public aid under a new rescue plan must help struggling homeowners by reworking their mortgages, according to Democratic sources. 

 Geithner on Monday will outline the Obama administration's plan of attack on a virulent credit crisis and proposals for spending what remains in a $700 billion financial bailout fund approved by Congress in October. Banks worldwide have been laid low by huge losses on U.S. mortgage-related debts. The scarcity of credit is choking the U.S. economy, which is mired in a deepening recession. The previous administration used the bailout program primarily to inject capital into banks in order to keep them from crumbling. Obama's team is now turning its efforts to cleaning up the "toxic" assets clogging the financial system. At a briefing with House of Representatives Democrats on Saturday, Geithner was asked about a New York Times report that the administration would not require banks to increase lending as part of the revamped effort to restore financial stability. According to the sources, who asked not to be identified, Geithner said: "We are not doing what they wrote ... Institutions that get assistance will have to participate in loan modifications and meet other standards that we set." "Public assistance is a privilege, not a right," they quoted Geithner as telling lawmakers at an annual retreat. A Treasury spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. The bank rescue is only part of the government's effort to turn around the financial crisis. Late on Friday, senators agreed on a package of measures to stimulate the economy. Congress is expected to finalize the stimulus package in the coming week. In Williamsburg, Geithner told the meeting the Treasury was "totally dismantling ... and (is) rebuilding" the bailout program but he provided few specifics, according to Democratic Representative Allen Boyd of Florida. Asked about Geithner's comments on loan modifications, Boyd said: "He's looking for something that works, that makes sense," but noted altering contracts is a "sticky subject." EXAMINING THE OPTIONS The Obama administration has already committed to using $50 billion to $100 billion from the remaining half of the bailout war chest to combat rising mortgage foreclosures, but has remained tight-lipped on other steps it might take. U.S. officials considered setting up a government-run "bad bank" to buy distressed debts from banks in the hope they could then attract private capital and resume lending. However, the cost of such an endeavor appeared daunting. A source familiar with the administration's plans said on Friday that it was focusing on two other ways in which it could help clean up the financial system. The government is likely to help the Federal Reserve expand a program which is currently aimed at supporting consumer and small business lending. Under that program, the Treasury has already pledged $20 billion to cover credit risks for the Fed in lending up to $200 billion to holders of top-rated securities backed by auto, student, credit card and small business loans. Officials have said that program could be expanded to cover an array of mortgage-backed securities, but to do so would require more cash from the Treasury. The administration may also use part of the bailout fund to offer insurance to banks against losses on assets that they would continue to hold on their books but would be "ring-fenced" from the rest of their portfolio. The hope would be that the banks could then attract private capital to restore their financial health and increase lending, helping to stem the recession in the world's biggest economy. The Treasury is also expected to continue to pump taxpayer funds into banks by taking stakes in them. The Wall Street Journal said Geithner is considering a plan under which the government would buy preferred shares in banks, thus avoiding immediate dilution of current shareholders, but which would convert into common stock within seven years. Under the current program, the government's preferred shares do not convert into common stock. Geithner is not expected to ask Congress for more funds to clean up the banking system now but some lawmakers believe they could be asked for more money later in the year, potentially a challenge for the administration, given the public anger over the way banks have been bailed out so far. "We believe liquidity needs to be restored and in order to do that we need to see lending proceed," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters before meeting with Geithner.
