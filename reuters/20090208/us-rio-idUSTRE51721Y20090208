 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) non-executive director Jim Leng has quit the board and will not move into the chairman's role as planned, adding to the global miner's woes as it struggles to cut its $39 billion in debt. Rio has been trying to sell assets and has cut jobs and projects to meet a target of reducing debt by $10 billion this year, but the sales have taken longer than expected amid the global economic slowdown. Rio has been under pressure to cut debt after bigger rival BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) scrapped a hostile takeover bid last November. Leng, who is deputy chairman of Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ), was named as Rio's next chairman just over three weeks ago. Current chairman Paul Skinner at the time said he would step down earlier than planned, after the group's Australian annual meeting in April. He will now remain in the post until mid-2009 to allow time to appoint a successor, Rio Tinto said on Monday. "Paul Skinner staying on longer could be a positive as Rio is not yet through its turmoil. It's yet to deal fully with its debt, iron ore negotiations are going on and things have yet to settle down," said Peter Chilton, analyst with Constellation Capital Management in Sydney. Skinner was considered the preferred candidate to take over as chairman of British oil giant BP ( BP.L ) in April, but some shareholders have raised concerns about the planned appointment in light of Rio's woes, according to recent news reports. Rio Tinto, due to report its annual results on Thursday, had no further comment on the statement, a spokeswoman said. (Reporting by  James Regan  and  Sonali Paul )
