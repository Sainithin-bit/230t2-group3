 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), the world's top aluminum producer, announced on Sunday it had reached a pact with the International Association of Machinists on a new four-year labor agreement at Alcoa's Cleveland Works facility. 

 The agreement, which affects 45 workers, includes a new health-care plan, provides health-care coverage for retirees, calls for annual wage increases and initiates a new attendance policy, among other details. Employees received a $1,500 signing bonus upon ratification of the contract, which takes effect immediately and expires in 2010. The company is also negotiating a new labor contract with 830 employees at the same facility represented by the United Auto Workers Local 1050. The UAW rejected the same pact last week.
