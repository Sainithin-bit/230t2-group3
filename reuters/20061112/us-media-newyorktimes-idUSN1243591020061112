 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of the New York Times Co. ( NYT.N ) may be undervalued despite strong properties and opportunities to boost margins, according to financial publication Barron's. 

 Based on discussions with two institutional investors, a Barron's analysis suggests that the company is worth about $35 a share. Shares of the company closed Friday at $23.99. A challenge by Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which owns 7.6 percent of the stock, to the company's dual-share-class ownership structure could also pressure Chairman Arthur Sulzberger Jr. and CEO Janet Robinson to improve the company's financial performance, Barron's said. Currently, class A shareholders elect four of the New York Times' 13 directors. The Sulzbergers hold class B shares, which represent less than 1 percent of the company's equity interests, but elect nine directors. The Sulzbergers are descendants of Adolph Ochs, who bought the newspaper more than a century ago.
