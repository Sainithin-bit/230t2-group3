 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street resumes its inflation watch this week with the latest figures on producer and consumer prices set for release. 

 Stock investors also may start making a holiday checklist this week when some major U.S. retailers will report quarterly results and discuss the outlook for Christmas sales. With congressional elections out of the way, analysts say there is reason to be optimistic about the coming holiday shopping season. "The fall in gas prices has psychologically been better for people and the unemployment rate is very low, so there are people out there who can spend," said Scott Vergin, portfolio manager at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis. "Plus, with Rumsfeld out, there's hope things will change for the better with the war and that may help sentiment during the Christmas season," he added, referring to U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's resignation last Wednesday, a day after the Democrats' big election victory. Rumsfeld said he quit because the political climate changed after the Democrats' win, which was driven by anger over the Iraq war. The Democratic sweep of Congress in Tuesday's midterm elections had prompted some investors to worry that it would bring about a wave of legislation unfriendly to various business sectors. Still, stocks achieved their best weekly performance in a month. "A tone will come out of Washington of cooperation or friction. In some parts, friction and gridlock are favorable to the markets -- 'don't make any new laws and let's have a stable environment,'" said Robert Lutts, chief investment officer of Cabot Money Management in Salem, Massachusetts. For the past week, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 1.02 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 1.22 percent. The Nasdaq gave its best performance in two months, with a weekly gain of 2.53 percent. Fred Dickson, director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon, said he believes the October readings on the U.S. Producer Price Index and the Consumer Price Index will be fairly benign. "I don't think we'll get any big surprises in inflation," Dickson said. "We'll probably continue in a trading range environment, with the Dow holding in the 12,000 level, maybe even a little higher." For the year, the Dow is up 13 percent, while the S&P 500 is up 10.6 percent, and the Nasdaq is up 8.4 percent. PPI, FED MINUTES AND CPI This week's economic calendar heats up on Tuesday, with the Labor Department's October report on the Producer Price Index. That will be followed on Wednesday with the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's most recent policy meeting on October 24-25, when it held its benchmark fed funds rate steady at 5.25 percent for the third consecutive time. And on Thursday, the Labor Department will release the October Consumer Price Index. Brett Gallagher, deputy chief investment officer with Julius Baer in New York, said, "The rally since the summer has been built on the change in perception that the Fed may not have to continue raising rates, and in fact after a period of pause, (it) may be getting ready to lower rates. "That drove the market and that can only happen if inflation remains in check, so I think the inflation numbers are the biggest factor," Gallagher said. Economists polled by Reuters expect the overall PPI to fall 0.5 percent in October. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the forecast calls for core PPI to rise 0.1 percent in October. "Due to the fact oil and gasoline prices have come down, we'll probably see the headline numbers on both PPI and CPI come down," Dickson of D.A. Davidson & Co. said. "The core CPI number will be up in the 0.2 (percent) or 0.3 (percent) range, flat versus a month ago, and equity investors will look at that and see inflation on a moderating course, and earnings will drive the market." Overall October CPI is forecast to drop 0.3 percent, while core PPI is projected to gain 0.2 percent in October. U.S. crude oil for December delivery CLZ6 settled on Friday at $59.59 a barrel, down $1.57 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Since hitting a NYMEX lifetime high at $78.40 in July, the price of oil has dropped 24 percent. On Friday, October housing starts and building permits are due. The Reuters poll forecasts that October housing starts slowed to an annualized pace of 1.690 million units, down from 1.772 million in September. October building permits are pegged to come in at annualized rate of 1.625 million units, down from 1.638 million in September.
