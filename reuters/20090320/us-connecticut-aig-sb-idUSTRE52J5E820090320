 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Connecticut got the bonus details it subpoenaed from American International Group, though the insurer removed the names of the 400 workers who received the payouts, state officials said on Friday. 

 AIG's money-losing financial product arm makes its home in Wilton, Connecticut, and the insurer has said that state law required it to pay the bonuses. This led Republican Governor Jodi Rell to tell the Department of Consumer Protection to determine if the payments violate state law because they are against "public policy," she explained in a statement. AIG employees, including Chairman Edward Liddy, have expressed concern about the safety of the workers who were paid a total of $165 million in bonuses. Some AIG executives have received death threats as public outrage grows because AIG could get up to $180 billion in federal bailout funds. "Depending upon the legal conclusions we reach and whether there is a need for enforcement action, our subpoena remains active and we can still get the names, should we make a determination that they are necessary," said Jerry Farrell, Connecticut's commissioner of consumer protection. Connecticut is one of at least 21 states probing AIG's bonuses, which set off a national storm because so many of the banks that also got taxpayer money made similar payments. The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday approved a bill taxing such payments at a 90 percent rate, but the Senate has yet to act. MILLION-PLUS CLUB Connecticut's governor said AIG's financial products arm paid bonuses to 400 workers, and the biggest bonus was $6.4 million. Six of them got more than $4 million each; another 66 employees received over $1 million each, Rell added. The state's attorney general, who urged AIG executives to return the bonuses, cannot sue under the Unfair Trade Practices Law, which is the state law cited by Connecticut's governor, unless the consumer protection department agrees. "The commissioner, and the commissioner alone, can authorize suit under that statute," Farrell, the state's consumer protection commissioner, explained. New Jersey Democratic Governor Jon Corzine told CBS radio the bonus backlash was "legitimate." Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, which also got billions of bailout dollars, said: "This is undermining the credibility of our financial system; it's wrong and it needs to be reversed." Corzine appointed New Jersey's attorney general, Anne Milgram, who on Thursday said she was leading a 19-state coalition investigating AIG's bonus payments. Her group does not include Connecticut, whose Democratic Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has demanded AIG's bonus details, or New York, whose Democratic Attorney General Andrew Cuomo on Thursday said AIG gave him the bonus data he had subpoenaed.
