 (Reuters) - Telecom gear makers are suffering as customers, especially those in developed markets in Europe and North America, cut costs and lay off staff to deal with the global economic crisis. 

 In a few developing markets, notably China, telecom services are still expanding, providing a boon to equipment makers, notably domestic firms such as Huawei and ZTE. AMERICA MOVIL -- America Movil plans to cut capital expenditures by about half to $3 billion in 2009. AT&T -- The top U.S. carrier said on January 28 capital spending in 2009 will be 10-15 percent lower than in 2008. BT GROUP -- The operator announced late last year 10,000 job cuts and a plan to trim the cost of its pension scheme just days after it issued a profit warning.

SPRINT NEXTEL -- The No. 3 U.S. wireless carrier said it would continue spending on network maintenance in 2009, but would hold off on expansion to preserve its cash position. TELECOM ITALIA -- The debt-laden operator said it would shed assets worth nearly $4 billion and cut another 5 percent of its workforce to slash borrowings and costs.
