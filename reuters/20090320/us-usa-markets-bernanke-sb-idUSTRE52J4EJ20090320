 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The United States needs a safer way to shut down large nonbank financial firms without destabilizing the entire financial system, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * "We have such a regime for insured depository institutions, but it is clear we need something similar for systemically important nonbank financial entities," he said in prepared remarks to a community bankers convention in Phoenix. * "Improved resolution procedures for these firms would help reduce the too-big-to-fail problem by giving the government the option of safely winding down a systemically important firm rather than keeping it operating," he said. COMMENTS: LEE OLVER, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, SMH CAPITAL, HOUSTON: "Clearly the approach we have dealt with financial companies individually hasn't worked very well." "These toxic assets are valued so low. You can't let a bank to make up value and ignore these assets." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes stay mostly lower. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold at little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends gains versus yen.
