 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez will announce a series of economic measures this weekend to offset lower oil revenues and the impact of the global financial crisis, the socialist leader said on Thursday. 

 Chavez did not hint at what the measures to be revealed on Saturday might include, but the high-spending president promised he would protect social programs and investment in infrastructure and housing. "As tough as this crisis might be, this government is here to defend the interests of the people, not the bourgeoise or the oligarchy," Chavez said, before calling on his own top officials to reduce spending on lavish lifestyles. Chavez made no mention of devaluing the bolivar currency, which many economists say is needed to help cover a budget shortfall caused by the sharp drop in oil income. Last week, Chavez complained that subsidies on water, electricity and gasoline -- which is among the cheapest anywhere in the world -- unfairly helped the rich, suggesting price rises might be on the cards. Chavez may tap into investment funds offered by China and Japan to stimulate the economy, which slowed to 4.8 percent growth in 2008 after many years of rapid expansion.
