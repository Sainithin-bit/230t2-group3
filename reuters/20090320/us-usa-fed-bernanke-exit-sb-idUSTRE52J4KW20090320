 PHOENIX  (Reuters) - As the economy recovers, demand for U.S. Federal Reserve lending programs will subside and the central bank will be able to taper off its support, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday. 

 "Obviously, as banks recover, as the economy recovers, we will want to withdraw that support from the banking system and let it stand on its own two feet," he said in response to a question at a community bankers conference.
