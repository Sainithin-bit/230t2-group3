 (Reuters) - The technology world is abuzz with speculation over IBM's ( IBM.N ) talks to purchase Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O, which would combine the world's No. 1 and No. 4 makers of computer servers. 

 The following are some major events in the history of Sun, whose name is derived from the initials of the Stanford University Network: 1982: Sun is founded by Andy Bechtolsheim, Bill Joy, Vinod Khosla and Scott McNealy at Stanford University. Produces its first workstation. 1986: Company goes public at $16 per share. 1988: Revenue hits $1 billion 1989: Sun unveils the SPARCstation 1. It is the first "pizza box" computer, fitting into a 3-by-16-by-16-inch space. 1991: Sun introduces the powerful Solaris 2 Unix-based operating system for business computers. 1992: Sun introduces the SPARCstation 10, the first multiprocessing desktop computer. 1993: Sun joins the Fortune 500. 1994: Sun creates a public Web presence at www.sun.com. 1995: Sun debuts Java, a programing language that allows developers to write one set of code that will work on machines running on the Windows, Macintosh, OS/2 and UNIX operating systems. 1995: 100 Sun computer systems are used to "film" Toy Story, the first animated movie that is created entirely on computers. 1996: Sun licenses Java to all major hardware and software manufacturers. 1997-2004: Sun sues Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) for introducing Windows-only enhancements of Sun's Java. The dispute goes on for years, until the two sides finally settled in 2004, with Microsoft agreeing to pay Sun nearly $2 billion. 2000-2001: Sun's shares hit a record high of $258.75 in September 2000 on strong demand for its expensive server computers coveted by Internet startups and large companies. Then the dotcom bubble burst and demand plummeted. 2005: Sun pays $4 billion for StorageTek, a maker of tape storage systems for mainframe computers. 2006: Pony-tailed Jonathan Schwartz, who was chief operating officer, is named CEO. Firebrand Scott McNealy steps down as chief executive but stays on as chairman. 2007: Sun changes its stock trading symbol on Nasdaq to "JAVA" from SUNW, saying the open-source software brand better represents its strategy 2008: Sun buys open-source database maker MySQL for $1 billion as Schwartz looks to expand software offerings, part of a strategy to boost sales by bundling the programs with hardware and services. But the deal and other moves fail to revive Sun's shares, which hit a low of $2.59 in November 24. 2008, November 14: Sun announces it will cut 5,000 to 6,000 jobs, or up to 18 percent of its workforce. It aims to save annual costs of $700 million to $800 million. 2009, March 18: IBM is in talks to buy Sun, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. The Wall Street Journal reports that IBM is offering $6.5 billion in cash, with the total deal value about $8 billion including $1.4 billion in cash on Sun's balance sheet. This would be a premium of about 100 percent over Sun's closing price the day before.
