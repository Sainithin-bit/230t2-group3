 LONDON  (Reuters) - Skincare specialist Stiefel Laboratories Inc is considering selling itself in a deal that could be worth more than $3 billion, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The 160-year-old privately held pharmaceutical maker is the largest independent dermatology company in the world, according to its own website. The potential sale has drawn interest from a number of major drug companies, including Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), Novartis AG ( NOVN.VX ) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ), the people told the paper. Stiefel, a maker of anti-itch creams, acne treatments and other skin treatments, is hoping to fetch somewhere in the range of $3 billion to $4 billion, they added. With a variety of both prescription and over-the-counter products, Stiefel could appeal to a number of large drugmakers looking to diversify their businesses. J&J and Novartis have long been among the world's most broad-based healthcare groups, while Glaxo's new Chief Executive Andrew Witty has made clear he wants to expand in areas other than traditional prescription drugs. Witty laid out his vision for diversification again at a Cowen & Co healthcare conference this week. Valuations of many drugmakers have fallen over the past year in the global economic downturn, making smaller companies more attractive targets for bigger ones. A spokeswoman for Stiefel told the paper the company's board has not decided to sell the company and hasn't received any offers. "Like any business, if we received an offer it would be carefully considered," the spokeswoman said. Stiefel and J&J could not immediately be reached by Reuters, while Novartis and Glaxo declined to comment. Stiefel has been controlled for more than 160 years by the founding Stiefel family. Private-equity group Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ), which invested $500 million in the company in 2007, owns a substantial minority stake. Stiefel has annual revenue of about $1 billion, the paper said, citing a person familiar with the company. Founded in Germany in 1847, the company is now based in Coral Gables, Florida. The news comes against the backdrop of three heavyweight drug deals this year. Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) has agreed to buy the 44 percent of Genentech Inc DNA.N it doesn't already own for $46.8 billion; Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) has agreed to pay $68 billion for Wyeth WYE.N; and Merck & Co Inc ( MRK.N ) plans to buy Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N for $41.1 billion.
