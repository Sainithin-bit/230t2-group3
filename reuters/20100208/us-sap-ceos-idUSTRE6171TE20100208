 (Reuters) - Bill McDermott and Jim Hagemann Snabe have been appointed co-chief executives of SAP, the world's biggest maker of business software, after the surprise resignation of Leo Apotheker on Sunday. 

 The appointments return SAP to the co-CEO structure it has successfully deployed in the past, and also mean the company will be run for the first time by non-Germans. Following are some facts about Snabe and McDermott: JIM HAGEMANN SNABE - Was propelled out of relative obscurity in July 2008 to SAP's executive board, where he took responsibility for developing the company's core software products for large enterprises and small businesses, as well as the technology platform on which they are based. - Among the responsibilities he took in on 2008 was Business ByDesign, the company's venture into Web-hosted software that has suffered several missteps and delays. - Joined SAP in 1990 and his roles before joining the executive board included running the Nordics region and managing the development of specific software for particular industries. He left for a position at IBM Denmark in 1994 and returned to SAP in 1996. - Snabe, 44, is Danish and lives near Copenhagen. He is fluent in Danish, French, German, English and Swedish. - He has a master's degree in operational research, mathematics and finance from the Aarhus School of Business in Denmark. BILL MCDERMOTT - Was also promoted to SAP's executive board in July 2008, having run sales first in the Americas, then also in Asia, and finally worldwide since joining the company in 2002. - Under his leadership, SAP aggressively increased its market share in the key North American market, and total company revenues increased 44 percent to reach 10.7 billion euros ($14.6 billion) in 2009. - Before joining SAP, he spent 17 years at office document-management company Xerox, was president of IT research firm Gartner, and ran worldwide sales at software company Siebel Systems, which has since been bought by SAP's arch-rival Oracle. - McDermott, 48, is a U.S. citizen and works in SAP's U.S. headquarters in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. - He has an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University near Chicago.
