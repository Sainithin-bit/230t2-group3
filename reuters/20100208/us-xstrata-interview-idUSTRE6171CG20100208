 LONDON  (Reuters) - Mining group Xstrata was holding no talks with its biggest shareholder -- trading house Glencore -- about a possible merger, but said such a combination had potential to create value. 

 Glencore said in December when it raised $2.2 billion that there was potential for a listing and possible combination with another group. Chief Executive Mick Davis told Reuters on Monday he did not know what group Glencore was referring to since there has been no discussions about a possible merger. "Clearly, when one puts together a great trading house and a great mining house, you have the potential for value creation," he said in an interview. "But there is a wealth of other issues that one would have to think about in looking at that sort of combination. But to start speculating about these type of things when there is nothing on the table doesn't make much sense." Anglo-Swiss Xstrata has not decided whether to buy the rest of platinum producer Lonmin or sell its 25 percent stake, Davis added. "The principal issue is we'd like to grow our platinum business... and our Lonmin stake is one of the options that we have to do that. And that is still very much a work in progress." Chief Financial Officer Trevor Reid said that there was potential to ramp up dividend payments after reinstating them with a final dividend of 8 cents a shares. "We thought it was important with our high level of earnings to recommence dividend payments, albeit at a lower level. "With this large capital commitment coming down the pipe we didn't want to be slaves to an overly high level of dividends so we started it an appropriate level and we'll seek to grow it from here." The world's top exporter of coal used in power plants and biggest producer of zinc posted a 41 percent fall in 2009 profits on Monday but said it was upbeat about the medium term outlook for commodities demand.
