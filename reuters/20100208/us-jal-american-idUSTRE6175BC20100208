 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan Airlines Corp has decided to maintain its partnership with American Airlines in the Oneworld alliance and end talks with Delta Air Lines, a source with knowledge of the matter said. 

 JAL's new management team, led by chief executive officer Kazuo Inamori, has decided that switching alliances would involve too much risk and could hinder the carrier's restructuring plan, the source said. JAL, which filed for bankruptcy last month, will make an official announcement of its plans to stay with American on Tuesday, the source said. (Reporting by  Nathan Layne )
