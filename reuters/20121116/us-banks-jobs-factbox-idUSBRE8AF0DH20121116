 LONDON  (Reuters) - Banks worldwide are shedding jobs as stricter regulations and euro zone worries take their toll on trading income and investment banking units. 
 Many began outlining layoffs plans 18 months ago and are now cutting more deeply as they reassess their entire business to cope with tougher capital rules, while some are cutting because of acquisitions or mergers they are involved in. Switzerland's UBS in October added 10,000 job cuts to the 3,500 it had earmarked last year, after deciding to exit most of the rates and debt trading. Staff cuts announced since mid-2011 or reported to be in the works at major banks have now reached 158,000. Below are aggregates of various redundancy rounds. They are likely to be conservative figures, as not all banks have announced lay-offs publicly, and the number does not take into account smaller investment banks, boutiques and brokers. The data also shows the net job losses (or job additions) at these firms since the end of 2009, when the euro zone debt crisis began. Job cuts announced since 2011: 157,969 Jobs lost at these firms since end 2009: 167,216 Jobs created since 2009: 83,553 Net jobs lost since end 2009: 83,663 For a graphic on job losses at the top 10 investment bank since 2008, click here:  link.reuters.com/zaq93t BANK	Cut plans*	Total staff** HSBC	30,000	267,000 BANK OF AMERICA	30,000	272,594 LLOYDS	15,000	95,975 UBS 13,500	63,745 ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND	6,418	140,300 UNICREDIT 6,150	157,190 ING 5,050	94,000 INTESA SANPAOLO	5,000	97,144 MONTE DEI PASCHI DI SIENA	4,600	30,422 CITIGROUP	4,500	262,000 MORGAN STANLEY	c.4,333	57,726 BARCLAYS	3,922	139,000 CREDIT SUISSE	3,500	48,400 MIZUHO 3,000	56,109 ABN AMRO	2,700	23,863 DEUTSCHE BANK	2,400	100,654 CREDIT AGRICOLE	2,350	87,451 NORDEA	2,000	31,692 DANSKE BANK	2,000	20,997 BNP PARIBAS	1,769	198,423# SOCIETE GENERALE	1,580	159,616# BANK OF NEW YORK MELLON	1,500	48,200 RABOBANK	1,200	61,103 BANCO POPOLARE	1,120	18,981 NOMURA 1,100	27,168 GOLDMAN SACHS	1,000	32,600 JULIUS BAER	1,000	5,700## JPMORGAN	1,000	259,547 NATIXIS	277	20,451 *As announced by the firms in the past 18 months or confirmed by sources ** According to latest available figure from filings # latest available staff numbers date back to year end 2011 ##headcount number includes integration of Bank of America's international wealth management unit.
