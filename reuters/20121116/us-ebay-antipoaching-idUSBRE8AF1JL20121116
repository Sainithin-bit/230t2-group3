 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EBay Inc said it will fight a suit filed against it on Friday by the Justice Department alleging the e-commerce company agreed not to hire Intuit Inc employees. 
 "The DOJ is taking an overly aggressive interpretation in their enforcement of antitrust law in this area," eBay spokeswoman Lara Wyss said in a statement. (Reporting By  Alistair Barr ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
