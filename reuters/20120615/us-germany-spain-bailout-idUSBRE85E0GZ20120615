 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Spain will not need a broader bailout that goes beyond its banks, a spokesman for the German finance ministry said on Friday. 
 Asked if he shared concerns that Spain as a whole would need to be rescued, spokesman Martin Kotthaus said "no" at a regular news conference. Euro zone finance ministers agreed on Saturday to lend Spain up to 100 billion euros ($126 billion)to shore up its teetering banks, but Spanish and EU officials insist that - unlike Greece or Portugal - the Spanish state does not require outside aid.
