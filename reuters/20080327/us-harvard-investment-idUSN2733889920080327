 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Harvard University named Jane Mendillo as its new chief investment officer on Thursday to oversee the Ivy League school's $35 billion portfolio. 

 Mendillo, 49, who built her resume in the endowment world, will begin running the country's biggest endowment on July 1, returning to Harvard after having been nearby Wellesley College's top money manager since 2002. She will be the first woman to run the endowment, having beaten out a long list of candidates with Wall Street and pension fund experience for what is often called the most prominent job in the endowment world. Harvard selected its first female president last year. The selection ended a six-month search for a successor to Mohamed El-Erian, a highly regarded emerging markets specialist who left Harvard Management Co (HMC) to rejoin Pacific Investment Management Co after less than two years in the position. Harvard's investment choices are watched closely in the money management industry because of its strong returns -- the portfolio earned a 23 percent return in fiscal 2007 -- and because it moved into alternative assets like hedge funds, emerging markets and timber long before it became fashionable. Well-respected for having grown Wellesley's endowment to $1.7 billion from $1 billion and for having delivered average annualized returns of 13.5 percent there, Mendillo will become HMC's chief executive officer amid turbulent market conditions and as wealthy schools face pressure to cut rising costs. "It feels a little like coming back home," Mendillo said about returning to HMC where she worked for 15 years and most recently ran external investments. She will not make dramatic changes, however, the Yale University educated executive said. "The hybrid model is working really well," Mendillo said, adding she expects Harvard's diversified portfolio with holdings ranging from timber to emerging markets to perform well even as global growth slows and international credit markets tighten. Harvard, unlike most other universities, relies on in-house money managers to invest roughly half of its money and allows outsiders, including many former HMC staffers who formed hedge funds, to manage the rest. Harvard's Treasurer and search committee chairman James Rothenberg called Mendillo "one of the most able and accomplished investment managers in the endowment world." Endowment industry insiders agree. "Jane is a terrific choice. She is well known and seems to possess the right experience and characteristics to lead this large organization," said John Griswold executive director of the Commonfund Institute, the educational arm of Commonfund, which manages endowments of for schools and universities.
