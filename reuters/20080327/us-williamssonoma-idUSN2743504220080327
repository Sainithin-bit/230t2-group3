 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Upscale home goods retailer Williams-Sonoma Inc ( WSM.N ) on Thursday posted a higher quarterly profit but gave a cautious outlook for the current fiscal year, citing a challenging economic backdrop. 

 The owner of the Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm chains, whose shares fell more than 6 percent before Wall Street's opening bell, said it expects first-quarter results of break-even to a profit of 3 cents a share, below analysts average estimate of a profit of 12 cents a share. The company forecast second-quarter earnings of 15 cents to 19 cents per share and expects earnings per share for the fiscal year that began on February 4 of $1.42 to $1.56. Both of these forecasts were also below analysts' average estimates. "As we look forward to 2008, we believe we will be operating in one of the most challenging macro-economic environments we have seen in many years," Chief Executive Howard Lester said in the earnings release. For the fourth quarter, Williams-Sonoma posted higher-than-expected earnings, helped by an extra week of sales than the year-earlier period. Fourth-quarter net profit rose to $124.6 million, or $1.15 a share, from $121.1 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average expected $1.12 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue rose 9.5 percent to $1.37 billion in the fourth quarter even as sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.1 percent. Lester said the fourth-quarter results reflected the company's ability to execute its business in difficult economic times. Higher gasoline and food prices, resetting of mortgage rates, a credit crunch and the U.S. housing decline has been felt by all retailers. But chains that specialize in home goods like Williams-Sonoma, Pier 1 Imports Inc ( PIR.N ) and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc ( BBBY.O ) have been especially hurt as the housing decline significantly weakened demand for new furniture and decor. Given the increasingly challenging home-furnishings industry, Williams-Sonoma said it would focus on reducing catalog circulation, containing discretionary costs and aggressively managing inventory. The San Francisco-based company also raised its quarterly cash dividend by 4.3 percent to 12 cents per share. Shares fell to $23.40 in trading before the opening bell from a close of $24.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Euan Rocha ; Editing by  Mark Porter  and Lisa Von Ahn)
