 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) is in talks with all the major music labels to sell their songs through its "Comes With Music" service, expected to be launched later this year, a company executive told the Financial Times on Thursday. 

 "We have negotiations and discussions ongoing with all the majors and a number of indies as well," Anssi Vanjoki, Nokia's executive vice-president, told the Financial Times. "Certainly our target is to have other labels on board." Nokia said in December it would offer unlimited music from at least Universal Music Group ( VIV.PA ) for buyers of certain Nokia devices. The world's top mobile phone maker was well placed to weather the economic downturn, Vanjoki also told the Financial Times. (Reporting by  Sakari Suoninen ; Editing by  David Holmes )
