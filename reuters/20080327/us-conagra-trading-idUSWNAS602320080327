 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) on Thursday said it would sell its commodity trading and merchandising operations to an investment management firm for about $1.6 billion, subject to certain conditions, and $525 million in debt. 

 The sale will let ConAgra focus on its core food business and also will let it use funds for a share repurchase, Gary Rodkin, chief executive officer, said in a news release. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
