 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) said on Thursday it would sell its commodity trading and merchandising operations in a deal valued at $2.1 billion, allowing it to focus on its core food business and to repurchase shares. 

 The company also reported much higher-than-expected quarterly profit, as results from that trading business and the company's food and ingredients segment helped offset falling profit at its largest unit, consumer foods, which has been hurt by soaring commodity costs. The company also raised its fiscal 2008 earnings forecast. Shares of ConAgra, whose brands include Healthy Choice meals and Chef Boyardee pasta, were up 5.8 percent at $23.16 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as high as $24 earlier in the session. ConAgra agreed to sell the trading and merchandising business to the Ospraie Special Opportunities fund, an affiliate of investment management firm Ospraie Management, which is focused on commodities and basic industries. The acquired business will be renamed Gavilon LLC. ConAgra will receive $1.6 billion in cash, subject to working capital fluctuations and $525 million in payment-in- kind securities of a newly created Gavilon holding company, ConAgra said. The trading and merchandising business, a vestige of ConAgra's roots as more of a commodity-based company, has helped support ConAgra's profits for several quarters, while other parts of its business have suffered. But CEO Gary Rodkin said selling the business will allow ConAgra to focus on its core food operations and address investor concerns over the long-term volatility inherent in the trading business. "The deal removes significant volatility and risk from our earnings stream," Rodkin said on a conference call. "Investors and analysts have pointed at this volatility as being inconsistent with the financial profile most desired by our owners." RIGHT PRICE, RIGHT TIME Rodkin also said this is the "right price and the right time to sell this business," referring to the unit's strength over the last 18 months, including during the latest quarter, when its profit more than tripled. "This is a way for them to at least sell the business while it is seeing strength," Matt Arnold, analyst at Edward Jones, said. "Meanwhile, it does sharpen their focus on the area that does matter long-term, branded food." Overall, ConAgra posted a profit of $309.1 million, or 63 cents a share, in the fiscal third quarter ended February 24, compared with $192.6 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast 41 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates, Aside from the strong trading and merchandising segment, profit from ConAgra's food and ingredients business rose by 33 percent. Profit from the consumer foods business, which makes up more than half of the company's sales, fell 8 percent due to higher costs, even as sales rose 8 percent. "The area investors probably want to see the strength from in the long term is the core consumer foods business and numbers there weren't very impressive," Arnold said. Total sales rose 20.9 percent to $3.53 billion, ConAgra said. Sales in the international food business, which accounts for 5 percent of the total, rose 6 percent. Excluding the impact of the weaker dollar, which boosts the value of international sales when they are converted to dollars, sales fell 1 percent, hurt by weakness in Canada, its biggest international market. ConAgra also said it has decided to reduce its presence in Europe and Japan, since they are expensive and the company was not "getting a lot of traction and didn't have critical mass." Instead ConAgra said it will refocus its international efforts on Latin America, India and China. ConAgra also forecast full-year 2008 earnings of $1.80 to $1.85 a share, excluding one-time items. The company in December forecast earnings slightly above $1.55 a share. For 2009, ConAgra said it currently expects earnings of at least $1.55 a share, excluding one-time items. That forecast assumes no contribution from the trading and merchandising business. Analysts on average were expecting $1.63 per share for 2009, according to Reuters Estimates. Even though the outlook was below Wall Street estimates, JP Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic said ConAgra's stock deserves a higher multiple without the volatile trading business. "However we would not recommend chasing a rally, as on our math the $1.55 earnings base for 2009 looks rather ambitious," Zuanic wrote in a research note.
