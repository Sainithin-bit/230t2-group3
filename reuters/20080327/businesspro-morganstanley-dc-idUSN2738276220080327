 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Influential shareholder adviser ISS 
gave Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) John Mack a vote of confidence on 
Thursday when it recommended reelection of the bank chairman 
and the rest of his board at next month's annual meeting. 

  Several Morgan directors have been under fire in recent 
weeks from unions and other proxy advisers, who recommend 
shareholders withhold their votes to protest the bank's 
disappointing 2007 performance.  Mack, who is also CEO, was singled out by union group 
Change to Win, which argued he should be accountable for a 
lapse in risk management that led to $9.4 billion in 
fourth-quarter losses.  Institutional Shareholder Services also recommended that 
pensions and other big investors support a proposal to give 
shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation.  (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone ; editing by John Wallace)
