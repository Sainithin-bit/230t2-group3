 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's ( JPM.N ) looming takeover of Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N has left some big shareholder groups looking for new targets in their fight for a say in the makeup of corporate boards at this year's annual meetings. 

 The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and other public pension funds filed shareholder proposals late last year with Bear Stearns and JPMorgan seeking to have the right to nominate directors to boards they say perform poorly. After the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it would not reprimand the firms for excluding the so-called proxy access proposal, the big shareholders began considering their legal options against the companies. But Bear Stearns and its board of directors will soon be gone, rendering the shareholder proposal moot. And AFSCME, which is leading the proxy access fight, said it would not litigate against JPMorgan because it views the deal as helping financial markets. "We were prepared to hold the board of Bear accountable," said Rich Ferlauto, director of pension and benefit policy at AFSCME. "Unfortunately the SEC did not give us the tools to intervene at a timely manner." AFSCME may have missed the boat for this year's set of annual meetings, which are mostly held in the spring, but vowed to press on. "We are looking for other places to file in the year," Ferlauto said. The SEC has adhered to rules it approved in November that restrict shareholders' access to a corporation's annual proxy document. At the time, AFSCME, which was livid over the SEC's new rules, vowed to litigate on a company-by-company basis in order to win the right to influence the makeup of the board. But earlier this month, Bear Stearns was forced to seek emergency funding from JPMorgan and the Federal Reserve and then agreed to be taken over by JPMorgan. The deal is expected to close this year. In November, the SEC voted to codify its long-standing interpretation of its proxy access rules after a 2006 federal appeals court decision involving AFSCME threw the agency's rules into question.
