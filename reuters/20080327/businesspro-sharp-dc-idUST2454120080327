 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ) said on 
Thursday it would spend $729 million to build a new solar cell 
plant in Sakai, western Japan, to better compete with Germany's 
Q-Cells QCEG.DE and other rivals. 

  Sharp said in July it would bring the new plant to 
production by March 2010 but did not disclose the size of 
capital investment.  Solar companies around the world are expanding production 
capacity rapidly to meet growing demand for green energy to 
counter global warming.  The Osaka-based company plans to invest 72 billion yen to 
bring the plant to production in two years with annual capacity 
of 480 megawatts.  The factory will be capable of housing production equipment 
for annual output of 1,000 MW, but it is unclear when the plant 
will reach the maximum capacity and how much additional 
investment is needed for the expansion, Sharp said.  The plant, which will be built next to a new 380 billion 
yen liquid crystal display (LCD) panel factory, is due to make 
thin-film solar cells, which use one-hundredth of the silicon 
needed in conventional solar cells, cutting production costs.  Sharp said it plans to build thin-film solar cell plants 
overseas to boost its total output capacity of the advanced 
solar cells to 1,000 MW a year by April 2010, although details 
such as plant location are not yet decided.  Besides the new plant in Sakai, Sharp plans to boost 
thin-film solar cell production capacity at its existing 
domestic plant in Nara prefecture, western Japan, to 160 MW per 
year by October from 15 MW.  Prior to the announcement, shares in Sharp, also the 
world's No.3 LCD TV maker behind Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 
( 005930.KS ) and Sony Corp ( 6758.T ), closed down 1.8 percent at 
1,741 yen, in line with the Tokyo stock market's electrical 
machinery index  .IELEC.T.  (Reporting by  Kiyoshi Takenaka , Editing by Michael Watson)
