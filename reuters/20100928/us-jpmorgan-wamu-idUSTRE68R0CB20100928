 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co ( JPM.N ) has told federal regulators it may seek to recoup the money it used to buy the banking assets of Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 JPMorgan has sent letters to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC), warning it could seek more than $6 billion in legal protection from the regulator's receivership, the Journal reported. The FDIC seized Washington Mutual in September 2008 and sold its assets to JPMorgan for about $1.9 billion. Earlier this month, the court-appointed examiner investigating the collapse of Washington Mutual was given several more weeks to complete his probe, a move that could delay the company's exit from bankruptcy. JP Morgan did not include specific dollar requests in its letters, but it submitted lawsuits related to Washington Mutual and expects the FDIC receiver to absorb any losses resulting from them, a person familiar with the matter told the Journal. JPMorgan Chase spokesman Joseph Evangelisti declined to comment on Monday. (Reporting by  Maria Aspan ; Editing by  Valerie Lee )
