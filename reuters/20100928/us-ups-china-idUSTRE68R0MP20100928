 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) is planning to set up a domestic postal service in China and will submit a license application to the Chinese postal regulator as early as this week, the Financial Times said. 

 UPS will roll out a next-day delivery service and second and third-day delivery products soon after the State Post Bureau approves the company's license application, the paper said. "The opportunities are tremendous," Dan Brutto, president of UPS International, told the Financial Times. "If you take a look at the growing middle class, in the future the domestic market is going to be worth billions," Brutto told the paper. The Chinese market could be as large as 5 million packages a day, Brutto said. In 2009 UPS delivered about 1.2 million packages a day in its international-domestic segment -- its term to describe deliveries within foreign countries -- worth $2.1 billion in revenue, according to the newspaper. UPS could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. Last week, Brutto told Reuters that the company's intra-Asian business will grow at a high double-digit percentage rate over the next decade.
