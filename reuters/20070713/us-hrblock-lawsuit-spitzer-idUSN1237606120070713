 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ) has failed to win the dismissal of a lawsuit by former New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer accusing it of fraudulently marketing Express IRA retirement accounts that caused hundreds of thousands of mostly lower-income clients to lose money. 

 New York State Supreme Court Justice Karla Moskowitz let the state pursue allegations of fraudulent and deceptive business practices and breach of fiduciary duty against the largest U.S. tax preparer's H&R Block Financial Advisors Inc. unit. In a decision dated July 9, however, the justice excused the corporate parent and five other units from the lawsuit, saying she lacked jurisdiction or that the state failed to make its case. She also threw out a claim alleging common law fraud. H&R Block, based in Kansas City, Missouri, said on Thursday the remaining claims lack merit, and that it plans to appeal. Jeffrey Lerner, a spokesman for current state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, said his office is disappointed that the justice dismissed some defendants and is assessing its options, but is "gratified" that the case will continue. "As the opinion makes clear, the Express IRA is a New York product, and the Attorney General has the power to seek injunctive relief and restitution for all the victims," he said. Spitzer, now New York's governor, had sought $250 million of civil penalties, among other remedies. In his March 2006 complaint, he had accused H&R Block of steering roughly 500,000 clients to Express IRAs nationwide, but failing to disclose hidden fees that often more than wiped out the interest that could be earned. The complaint said the median account had a $323 balance. Investors, it said, often failed to earn enough interest to offset such charges as a $10 annual maintenance fee, a $15 set-up fee, a $15 "re-contribution" fee and a $25 termination fee. Moskowitz said the attorney general had adequately alleged deception or fraud by alleging H&R Block Financial Advisors "failed to disclose excessive fees" and "affirmatively misrepresented" the value of an Express IRA. "The only fee disclosed in writing prior to the customer's decision to open an (Express IRA) is the $25 closing fee," the justice wrote. "These statements are not mere 'puffery' because, in this instance, the targeted consumer would not reasonably know that these statements were an exaggeration." H&R Block shares closed on Thursday down 1 cent at $22.43. They have fallen 3 percent this year. The company disclosed Moskowitz's decision after U.S. markets closed.
