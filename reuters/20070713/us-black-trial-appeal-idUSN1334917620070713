 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A lawyer for former media mogul Conrad Black told a U.S. court on Friday that Black plans to appeal the four guilty verdicts on charges that he and associates skimmed millions of dollars from the newspaper publisher he once controlled. 

 Earlier Friday, a U.S. jury found Black guilty on four of 13 counts of criminal mail fraud and obstruction of justice after a trial that lasted almost 15 weeks.
