 (Reuters) - Sun-Times Media Group Inc. said it now intends to proceed with a civil suit against its controlling shareholders and certain former officers, following the conviction of its ex-chairman, Conrad Black. 

 Earlier Friday, a U.S. jury found the former media mogul and three co-defendants guilty of criminal fraud and obstruction of justice. (Reporting by Deepti Chaudhary in Bangalore)
