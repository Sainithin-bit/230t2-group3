 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Three co-defendants tried alongside former media baron Conrad Black were found guilty of multiple fraud charges by a U.S. jury on Friday. 

 The verdicts followed guilty verdicts against Black on four of 13 charges which included fraud and obstruction of justice. The co-defendants include former Hollinger International Inc. chief financial officer Jack Boultbee, 64; Peter Atkinson, 60, former vice president and general counsel for the same company, and Mark Kipnis, 59, a former Hollinger lawyer. Boultbee, Atkinson and Kipnis were found guilty the same three counts of mail fraud as Black. The charges related to non-compete agreements connected with sales of Hollinger International newspapers, which prosecutors said Black and the others conspired to skim off for themselves. The fraud counts each carried a potential five-year prison sentence.
