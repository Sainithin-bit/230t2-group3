 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chemical company Huntsman Corp. ( HUN.N ), which agreed to be bought by Apollo Management for $6.5 billion earlier this week and scuttled a deal with Basell, said on Friday it would pay Apollo up to $325 million if it backs out of the deal. 

 Huntsman, which split the cost with Apollo of a $200 million termination fee for breaking up its previous agreement with Dutch-based Basell, said in a regulatory filing it would pay Apollo $225 million in a break-up fee if it terminated the deal under certain circumstances. It will also reimburse Apollo, which is buying Huntsman through its Hexion Specialty Chemicals unit, the $100 million it spent on the Basell deal's break-up fee for a total pay-out of $325 million, or about 5 percent of the deal's total value.
