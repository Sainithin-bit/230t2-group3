 THE HAGUE  (Reuters) - The Dutch Supreme Court is likely to sway the outcome of an acrimonious takeover battle for ABN AMRO on Friday when it rules on whether the Dutch bank can go forward with the suspended sale of its U.S. unit. 

 The court is considering whether to unfreeze the suspended sale of ABN's LaSalle Bank to Bank of America for $21 billion. If the court tells ABN it can sell LaSalle, that would strengthen a bid by Britain's Barclays to buy ABN for nearly 63 billion euros ($87 billion), since its offer is contingent on the sale of LaSalle. If the court tells ABN it must seek shareholder approval to sell LaSalle, then the rival consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland, Fortis and Santander can go forward with a 71 billion euro offer for ABN, which is contingent on LaSalle remaining part of ABN. Supreme Court judge Hans Fleers will begin reading the ruling of the five-judge panel at 0800 GMT. The sale of LaSalle to Bank of America was frozen in early May after a commercial court in Amsterdam said ABN should have asked shareholders for approval for the deal, even if it was not required to do so under legal regulations. LaSalle's fate could tip the balance in a deal potentially worth nearly $100 billion, which would make it the biggest-ever banking merger. Among other possibilities, however, the Supreme Court could send the case back to the commercial court or propose a compromise between the parties, which would probably result in further legal wrangling and uncertainty over the fate of ABN. Most analysts say the Dutch Supreme Court will take the advice given two weeks ago by the Dutch Advocate General, who was tasked to give an opinion on the case and said ABN should be allowed to sell LaSalle without a shareholder vote. If the court tells ABN to go forward with the LaSalle sale, the consortium will revise its takeover offer for ABN AMRO and try to buy it without LaSalle, a source close to the consortium said on Thursday. "(The consortium) is not going to be stopped," the source said. After ABN and Bank of America appealed the commercial court's surprise decision, the Dutch Supreme Court agreed to expedite its deliberation on the case.
