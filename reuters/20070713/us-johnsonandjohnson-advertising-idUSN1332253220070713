 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), one of the world's top marketers, has split its $3 billion media buying account among the big advertising holding companies after a nearly four-month long review. 

 Interpublic Group's ( IPG.N ) Universal McCann, which previously worked on the health care company's media account in the United States and Canada, retained that part of the account, Johnson & Johnson said on Friday. That should be a relief inside IPG, with some analysts having voiced concern that the world's third-largest advertising holding company could lose a large chunk of the account, which would have marked a severe setback to its long recovery from accounting problems. Universal McCann also won duties in Japan, but lost its work in Australia and Latin America to Omnicom Group's ( OMC.N ) OMD, which will also continue to handle the job for Johnson & Johnson in China. In Europe, Johnson & Johnson said it awarded media buying duties to Carat, a unit of Aegis Group AGS.L. Johnson & Johnson, which sells products ranging from sugar substitute Splenda to prescription arthritis drug Remicade, is among the largest U.S. marketers, spending an estimated third of its advertising budget there. The account review by Johnson & Johnson came after its acquisition of Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, which gave it brands such as Listerine mouthwash and the Sudafed allergy drug and prompted a reevaluation of its agency lineup. As part of its award, Johnson & Johnson also created a new function called communications planning, a strategic type of planning that looks at overall branding plans and a variety of different media, including newer digital media. That work will be divided between units of IPG and WPP Group Plc ( WPP.L ), as well as independent firm Naked Communications. "Our goal was to get agencies and brands working together in a new way," Kimberly Kadlec, chief media officer of Johnson & Johnson, said in a statement. "The agencies that pitched for this business did an amazing job of presenting new and innovative approaches, and I'm pleased to say that together we will meet the challenges of engaging with today's consumers," she added. For IPG, a loss of the account would have been a severe setback to its efforts to recover from past client defections, account losses and management turnover. The holding company's agencies have recently posted some high-profile wins, including work for big advertisers Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and Kmart.
