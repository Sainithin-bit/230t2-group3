 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rating companies began a new wave of rating cuts Thursday as they reassessed the fallout from deteriorating subprime loans, drawing increased scrutiny from investors who are questioning why the agencies failed to act earlier. 

 Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's are ratcheting down ratings or revising downward prior forecasts on billions of dollars of debt due to their lowered outlooks on the U.S. housing market. S&P on Thursday cut ratings on $5.7 billion of subprime-related securities it put on watch earlier this week. Both S&P and Moody's now project cumulative losses for subprime loans originated in 2006 to reach as high as 14 percent, more than double projections at the start of the year. "That's a huge change in their projections and has huge implications for the market," said Inna Koren, an analyst at Barclays Capital in New York. Fitch Ratings also on Thursday said it may cut ratings on 19 collateralized debt obligations -- debt structures that are backed by risky home loans -- and has revised its CDO rating methodology, identifying 170 U.S. subprime transactions as requiring further analysis. Of those, the total amount of bonds rated in the "BBB" category and below -- the most likely to face rating actions -- is $7.1 billion. For details, see <ID:nN12252357>. CDOs are debt structures that bundle other types of debt, including junk bonds or securities backed by pools of risky home loans. CONFERENCE CALLS Moody's on its conference call on Thursday said it is also raising its expectations for losses on several types of subprime mortgages, which could lead it to cut more ratings. The agency is increasing its loss expectations for newly originated loans by 10 percent, and for other loans to as high as 25 percent, according to Nicolas Weill, Moody's team managing director and chief credit officer. Moody's and its rivals S&P and Fitch are increasingly being criticized for not lowering ratings earlier as delinquencies on loans granted to less creditworthy home buyers have risen. "Why now?" Steven Eisman, a portfolio manager at Frontpoint Partners in New York, said on an S&P conference call on Tuesday. "The delinquencies have been a disaster for many, many months." Moody's on Tuesday also cut ratings of 399 mortgage-backed securities and may cut ratings of another 32, affecting a total of $5.2 billion in debt. For details, see <ID:nN10336254>. The credit agency also placed 184 tranches of CDOs backed by residential mortgage-backed securities under review for possible downgrade on Wednesday, affecting $5 billion in debt. S&P CORRECTION S&P spokesman Adam Tempkin said on Thursday that the rating agency miscalculated by nearly $5 billion the amount of debt that may be affected in its review for potential ratings cuts. S&P corrected the volume of residential mortgage-backed securities it placed under review for downgrade to $7.35 billion from its $12.1 billion estimate on Tuesday. "It was an error and we corrected it," Tempkin said. "It was human error. It is what it is." Standard & Poor's late on Thursday said it downgraded 498 out of 612 residential mortgage securities it placed on watch for a rating cut on Tuesday. The initial announcement on Tuesday spooked investors, driving them away from financial stocks and other riskier investments and into the safety of U.S. government bonds. A benchmark subprime index fell to a record low. "That doesn't sound as if they were in charge of the credit judgments of the Western world, does it?" asked James Grant, editor of the highly regarded Grant's Interest Rate Observer, on S&P's $5 billion error. Other investors said the error was less important than the rating companies' failure to act sooner. "I don't think it makes a difference," said Andrew Harding, chief investment officer of fixed-income at Allegiant Asset Management in Cleveland. "There are still some issues with the asset class and there is still some lax underwriting standards and lack of appreciation that home prices don't go up every year."
