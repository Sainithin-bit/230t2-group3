 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former chief operating officer at a Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc.( MMC.N ) unit has sued the world's largest insurance broker by market value, alleging he was not properly compensated after being fired in the aftermath of a 2004 bid-rigging scandal. 

 Roger Egan, 56, now the chief executive of insurance broker Integro Ltd., said Marsh & McLennan refused to make payments owed to him despite saying that he was not responsible for issues raised in the scandal, according to a lawsuit filed on Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court. A spokesman for Marsh & McLennan, Mike Kachel, declined to comment on the lawsuit. The New York Attorney General's office opened an investigation into Marsh & McLennan's business practices in 2004 and later sued the company, alleging it had unlawfully collected large "contingent compensation" fees from insurers to steer business their way and had engaged in price fixing. In 2005, Marsh & McLennan agreed to pay $850 million to settle the case. Egan, who was president and chief operating officer of Marsh Inc., Marsh & McLennan's risk and insurance adviser, was one of three employees asked to step down. He left the company in December 2004 after being there for more than 30 years, according to the complaint. Egan said in the lawsuit that he is entitled to a severance package, including equity awards and pension payments, and is seeking unspecified damages. (Additional reporting by Ed Leefeldt)
