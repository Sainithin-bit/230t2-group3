 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge in Tennessee has granted class-action status to a 2006 case against heavy construction vehicle maker Caterpillar Inc. regarding insurance benefits, the lead attorney representing more than 4,000 retirees and surviving spouses said on Friday. 

 The plaintiffs filed suit against the company on March 28, 2006, accusing Caterpillar of denying them retiree medical benefits that were offered for years under their union contracts, according to law firm Meites, Mulder, Mollica & Glink. Judge Trauger of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee granted the case class certification on July 12, the law firm said. The suit was filed on behalf of all retirees and surviving spouses of retirees who were represented by the union and who retired on or after January 1, 1992 and before March 16, 1998. "We're very pleased with the ruling because it puts over 4,000 retirees closer to the no-cost healthcare benefits that they were promised by Caterpillar," Michael Mulder, an attorney at Meites, Mulder, Mollica & Glink, said in a statement. Joseph Torres, an attorney from the law firm of Winston & Strawn, which is representing Caterpillar in the case, declined to comment. A representative from Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar could not be reached for comment. Shares of Caterpillar reached a year high of $85.90 on Friday before sliding back to $85.32, up $1.23 or 1.5 percent in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas )
