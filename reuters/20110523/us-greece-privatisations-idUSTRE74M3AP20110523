 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece will launch the first wave of its 50 billion euros privatization program with sales of Hellenic Postbank and the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki, a government official said. 

 "Privatizations are a top priority," the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters after a cabinet meeting to discuss new measures to exit a debt crisis. A second phase will include stakes in Public Power Corp. (PPC), OTE Telecom and Athens Water utility, the official said. (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas)
