 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony said it expects its operating profit in the financial year ending in March 2012 will be approximately the same as in the year just ended, which it has estimated at 200 billion yen ($2.4 billion). 

 The Japanese consumer electronics company also said it sees sales rising in 2011/12 and expects to post a net profit, despite the impact of the earthquake in March. For the year just ended, Sony cut its earnings estimate to a net loss of 260 billion yen from a profit of 70 billion.
