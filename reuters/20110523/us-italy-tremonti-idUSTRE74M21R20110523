 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy has kept and will continue to keep its public accounts in order, Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti said on Monday after Standard & Poor's on Saturday cut its rating outlook on Italy to negative from stable. 

 "We've kept things in order and the basis are all there for us to continue to do so," Tremonti told reporters in Rome. (Reporting by  Stefano Bernabei )
