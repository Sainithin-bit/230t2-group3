 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Most of the euro zone has put the economic crisis behind it and the European Central Bank has to reassess its policy stance, ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday. 

 "We have to see that in general we see, fortunately, for the euro zone in total a rather positive economic development," Nowotny, who also heads Austria's central bank, told Reuters Insider Television. "We see that we are out of the crisis situation for most of the euro countries. That means we have to have a certain reexamination of policy that we started when we were deeply in crisis mode. We are not any longer in crisis mode." The ECB raised interest rates by 25 basis points to 1.25 percent last month, becoming the first major central bank to raise rates after the financial and economic crisis intensified. He also said that Greece has to stick to its EU/IMF rescue program, and that as long as the program is on track, there is no need to discuss the ECB's collateral framework.
