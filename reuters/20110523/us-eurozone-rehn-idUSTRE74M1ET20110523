 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Greece must seriously reinforce its budget consolidation steps and pursue privatizations soon, the EU's top economic official said on Monday. 

 "These are a matter of urgency," Olli Rehn, the economic and monetary affairs commissioner in the European Union's executive Commission, said in a speech to a conference on European integration in Vienna. Euro zone policy makers had not eradicated the risk of financial meltdown, Rehn said: "We have contained but not banned that risk yet." Turning to the euro zone economy's performance, Rehn said: "The economic recovery in Europe is retaining its momentum despite some external turbulence and uncertainties in financial markets."
