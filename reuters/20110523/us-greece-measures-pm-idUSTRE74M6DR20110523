 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece will not be able to honor its obligations if it does not get the next tranche of a bailout loan and the IMF has made clear it cannot disburse the money if Greece's 2012 EU funding is not assured, the country's finance minister said on Monday. 

 "The IMF has made absolutely clear that it cannot disburse (the tranche) if it does not have any guarantee that next year, if necessary, Greece will have (funding) support from the Europeans," Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou told Skai TV's New Files show. When asked what would happen if Greece does not get the next bailout tranche, the minister said: "The country will halt payments ... Wages, pensions -- all the state's expenses will not be paid."
