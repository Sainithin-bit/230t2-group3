 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece on Monday said it would take new fiscal measures worth 6 billion euros ($8.44 billion) and immediately sell stakes in some state firms to reduce its debt but details will be announced next week. 

 "The cabinet today reaffirmed its determination to continue with the fiscal consolidation program by taking additional measures of over 6 billion euros ... in order to achieve the 7.5 percent deficit target for 2011," the finance ministry said in a statement. Details of the extra measures will be announced next week, government spokesman George Petalotis said. (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas)
