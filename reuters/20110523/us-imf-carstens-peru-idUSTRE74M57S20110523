 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - Peru's government has not yet decided whether to back Mexico's candidate to head the International Monetary Fund, Peruvian Finance Minister Ismael Benavides told Reuters on Monday. 

 During a visit to Chile, Benavides said Peru's government thinks Latin America should unite behind a single candidate from the region. Brazil on Monday shied away from throwing its weight behind Mexican central bank chief Agustin Carstens to lead the IMF, saying nationality did not matter. (Reporting by Moises Avila)
