 VIENNA  (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Ewald Nowotny said on Monday he did not see how the euro area's inflation rate could be affected by problems in some of the currency zone's member countries. "The inflation rate of the euro area is the lowest among all the economic currencies. I don't see how that would be affected by the problems in some of the countries," Nowotny told a conference on European integration in Vienna.
