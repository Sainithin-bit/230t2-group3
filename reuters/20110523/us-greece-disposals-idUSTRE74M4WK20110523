 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece announced a timetable of planned asset sales on Monday, as part of a drive to raise 50 billion euros ($70 billion) by 2015. 

 Privatizations are the linchpin of Greek efforts to cope with its debt burden without a restructuring that could shake the euro. The government expects to raise 3.5-5.5 billion euros in 2011 and 4-6 billion euros next year. Last week, Greece announced privatization advisers for several projects. Here is a list of the main companies to be sold, according to the finance ministry: OTE Greece will sell its 16 percent in southeast Europe's biggest telecom company in the second quarter of 2011. It already has a put option to sell a 10 percent stake to German operator Deutsche Telekom, which holds a 30 percent stake in OTE. OTE's market value is 3.2 billion euros. POST SAVINGS BANK Greece will sell its entire 34 percent stake in the lender by the end of the year. The company's market value is about 800 million euros. PIRAEUS PORT, THESSALONIKI PORT Greece will sell the 75 percent stake it holds in each of the country's two biggest port operators by the end of this year. The two companies' total market value is 512 million euros. THESSALONIKI WATER Greece will sell up to 40 percent of the company by the end of this year. It currently holds 75 percent. The company's market value is 174 million euros. DEPA Greece plans to reduce its 65 percent stake in the former natural gas company to 33 percent in the last quarter of 2011. The unlisted company has a book value of about 1 billion euros. OPAP Greece will sell its 34 percent stake in Europe's biggest gambling company in the first quarter of 2012. OPAP's market value is 4.1 billion euros. ATHENS WATER Greece plans to reduce its 61 percent stake in Greece's biggest water utility to 34 percent in the third quarter of 2012. Athens Water's market value is 550 million euros. PUBLIC POWER COPR Greece plans to reduce its 51 percent stake to 34 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012. The company has a market value of 2.44 billion euros. ATEBANK The government plans to sell up to 25 percent of the lender, reducing its stake to 51 percent by the end of 2013.
