 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The following are comments by European Union leaders gathering for a two-day summit at which they were discussing how to help debt-stricken Greece. 

 EU PRESIDENT HERMAN VAN ROMPUY On differences among Greece, Spain, Portugal: "The situations are not comparable at all and the markets will be aware of that." On aid mechanism for Greece: "We don't view this as a miracle cure, it is an important part of the cure, no more." "We have made a contribution to international monetary stability." "All members of the euro zone said they would be willing to participate in that mechanism." PORTUGUESE PRIME MINISTER JOSE SOCRATES "There's an agreement. We've given the signal that had to be given." "It's a show of solidarity." "It's not obligatory but everyone will participate ... Portugal like all the other members of the euro zone will participate if necessary." "This decision is part of the struggle against those who speculate in the market." "We hope it will not be necessary, because speculation is based on doubt and this accord gives some certainty to the market." "It is not about paying Greece's debt but giving a signal that we are there to support them if necessary." "Interest rates will be reasonable, not speculative." HUNGARIAN PRIME MINISTER GORDON BAJNAI On Greece: "The situation in many aspects is very similar to Hungary's and that's very good news because Hungary for example shows it is doable, if someone has the determination, and the prime minister of Greece has this determination. What is needed now is a breathing space for Greece so they have time to do their homework. This breathing space can be provided through some form of European solidarity and the job of us tonight is to achieve that solution." "The countries of the euro zone have to take the lead on finding such a solution, but if there is no such solution then I would not exclude the IMF at all. Thirty percent of the quotas is put together by European countries, the IMF has strong credibility ... the European Central Bank would be needed because the euro zone rules have to be maintained throughout the process." AUSTRIAN CHANCELLOR WERNER FAYMANN On help for Greece: "I have never ruled out the IMF. I could imagine that there would be a technical cooperation model built between European influence and the possibilities with the IMF. But it is too soon to say now. I can imagine that when you establish the technical possibility where the fundamental control or direction stays in Europe -- we should not forget that we are the biggest payers to the IMF and that should also mean something -- then the two could be combined well together. It is a question of the conditions and the measures attached. I do not expect that we will establish concrete financial decisions today." GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU "Let me state that Greece has taken very serious measures to put our own house in order. Greece is on the right track." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER: Speaking to Reuters after leaving a meeting of the European People's Party: "My impression was that we would find an agreement today and now I do believe it really." JERZY BUZEK, EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT PRESIDENT, AFTER MEETING OF EUROPEAN PEOPLE'S PARTY: "I think things are going in the right direction regarding Greece." Asked if there would be a Eurogroup meeting: "I am convinced there will be a meeting today or tomorrow." LATVIAN PRIME MINISTER VALDIS DOMBROVSKIS On help for Greece: "Certainly I would expect a decision and it seems that the ideas are going toward having a package of bilateral loans and IMF loans. Bilateral loans as an instrument do not contradict the (EU) treaty so it is also sound from a legal point of view." How soon could it be? "It has to be relatively quick. It is a matter of weeks, I would say." IRISH PRIME MINISTER BRIAN COWEN "The important part of the Stability and Growth Pact is for national governments to demonstrate their capacity and willingness and the ability to do whatever is possible." "I think obviously our duty is to ensure that we try and protect the euro zone and protect the euro currency." "We all have responsibilities in that regard." "I think in respect of the specific Greek situation, we all subscribe to the principle that whatever emerges, that certainly if there are loans to be available, whatever the costs of the lending states are covered." "We have to make sure that the outcome that arises is one that enables us to go forward together and that every member state steps up to its own responsibility as well." "It's a question of how we ensure that the responsible policies and domestic framework and solidarity can be shown by the Eurogroup or by the EU itself and all the members of the euro zone in this particular case." "I think what the German government is emphasizing ... is the need to ensure that there is full responsibility taken by member state governments themselves in respect of what they can do themselves to deal with their own situation of trying to stabilize their public finances before there would be any EU involvement." "It's in our huge common interest and collective responsibility to ensure that we have financial stability ... in trying to sort out problems and deal with issues that are arising is the overriding factor of providing financial stability in the euro zone and in Europe generally."
