 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Preston Prue, a retired police sergeant in New York, is a case study in the challenges that Toyota Motor Corp faces in trying to win back trust. 

 Prue, 60, says he was driving near his home in North Syracuse in December 2009 when he stepped on the accelerator in his 2009 Toyota Camry. Immediately, he knew something was wrong. Now, he wants to know why he and other Toyota drivers weren't warned of the risk that loose floormats could jam open an accelerator earlier. "It took off like a jet. I immediately went for the brake and simultaneously put the car in neutral and the RPMs raced up," said Prue, who in 35 years on the Syracuse Police Department led many traffic investigations. Prue says he managed to steer the surging Camry to the far right of three freeway lanes. Its speed slowed after a few frantic seconds. Then came a terrifying reminder of how the episode could have ended: his wife, Daryll, riding in the passenger seat, told him that he had almost hit a school bus. "I didn't see the school bus or anything else," said Prue. "I was trying to get the car under control." Prue quickly went from shaken to dismayed by the automaker's response to his complaint. First, a Toyota representative declined to pay to have the Camry towed to the dealership. ("I'll just put in the report that you refused to allow us to see the car," he remembers being told.) Then the investigator told him a loose floormat had almost certainly trapped the accelerator. The representative told him: "The last six investigations I did all ended up being floormats." Two weeks earlier, Toyota had detailed how it would use a recall to fix eight models, including the Camry, for the floormat problem. Prue, like other consumers, had not received his recall notice. But he was angry to learn that a full year before he bought his Camry, Toyota had sent a notice to dealerships warning of the risk from loose floormats. "There was no warning about floormats," said Prue of his April 2009 experience buying his Camry. "They didn't say diddly squat. This was known by them then." Toyota says it is confident that ongoing fixes to address the problem of loose floormats and sticky accelerator pedals address the only acceleration-related risks in its vehicles that have been identified. It has recalled some 8.5 million vehicles worldwide in recent months. FROM EVANGELIST TO DOUBTER While Toyota attracted word-of-mouth evangelists during its fast growth in the 1990s, the frustration of dealing with some of its more recent quality problems has created a band of Toyota owners who feel they were treated badly or shunned as plaintiffs in waiting. For example, many Toyota owners who complained that oil sludge had destroyed their engines say they were told that the problem was with their maintenance of the vehicle. Others own vehicles such as the RAV4 that were not covered by a class-action settlement to that problem in 2007. "I'd have to think really hard before I would buy another one," said Randy Pick, who was hit by a sludge problem last year in his 2002 RAV4 that a Toyota dealer told him would cost $5,000 to fix. "I don't think they did the stand-up thing." Pick, who runs a company making wooden doors in Metairie, Louisiana, has been teased that the four silver Toyotas in his driveway look like he is running a used car lot for the brand. He was offended by the suggestion that the sludge problem was his fault for not changing the oil, something he said his wife was "neurotic" about getting done on schedule. "It's like they are saying, 'You can't read and follow a maintenance manual, and that's the reason you are in this pickle right now," Pick said. That was how it felt to Larry Sefren, a retired U.S. army lieutenant colonel, who came back from a tour of duty in Kabul and rewarded himself with a 2007 Toyota Camry. "I came back from Afghanistan and said: 'We're going to buy the best car on the market,'" Sefren said. Last year, he noticed the Camry leaking oil from a faulty oil line now covered by a Toyota service campaign. Sefren, who lives in southern Illinois, says he skirmished with Toyota for seven months trying to get the automaker to pay for his repair costs. One representative at the company's Customer Experience department told him the company could not be sure he had not caused the damage. "He said, 'How do we know you didn't pour Kool-Aid into your engine?'" Sefren said. "I said 'Excuse me? Say that one more time because I'm going to write it down.'" He doubts he would buy another Toyota. "When I needed help, they wouldn't throw me a bone." (Additional reporting by  David Bailey  and  Kevin Krolicki , editing by David Lewis and  Claudia Parsons )
