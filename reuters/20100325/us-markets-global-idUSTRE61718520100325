 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The euro sank to a 10-month low on Thursday and benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yields hit a nine-month high, stung by renewed debt fears in Europe and in the United States. 

 The European Central Bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, jarred already anxious investors as he criticized a French-German pact to aid Greece that relies partially on the International Monetary Fund. U.S. equities slid on Trichet's remarks, reversing a rally that had driven up the three major indexes by more than 1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq fell into negative territory, while the Dow industrials barely clung to gains. U.S. Treasuries prices were also hit by a poor sale of seven-year notes, which underscored investors' concern about an enormous supply of debt in the United States. "We are losing our stock gains because of the threat of rising U.S. yields and the weakening of the euro," said Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of the Omnivest Group in Princeton, New Jersey. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 5.06 points, or 0.05 percent, to 10,841.21, while the S&P 500 index  .SPX  fell 1.99 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,165.73. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dipped 1.35 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,397.41. Wall Street had notched up strong gains for most of the session after wireless chip maker Qualcomm and electronics retailer Best Buy boosted their profit outlooks, increasing bets that consumer spending will help the economic recovery. Shares of Best Buy ( BBY.N ) ended 3.6 percent higher while Qualcomm's stock ( QCOM.O ) rose 5.0 percent. The market had also been supported by data showing the number of U.S. workers filing new applications for unemployment insurance fell sharply last week. The number of those continuing to receive benefits after an initial week of aid fell to the lowest point since December 2008. TRICHET POURS COLD WATER News that France and Germany agreed on the terms of a financial aid plan for Greece just before Thursday's European Union summit initially boosted markets, sending European shares to a 18-month closing high and driving the euro higher. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares ended 1.01 percent higher at 1,083.34 points, the highest close since early October 2008, before Trichet's comments. The euro tumbled, however, after ECB chief Trichet said the IMF participation on the aid plan for Greece is "very, very bad" because it means European countries are shying away from their responsibilities. The European single currency weakened 0.20 percent to $1.3286 after EU sources said the IMF would provide one-third of the money to a possible package for Greece. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.53 percent at 92.70. The sudden rise in the dollar also hit oil prices, with May crude futures erasing early gains to close down 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, at $80.53 a barrel. TREASURIES FALL AGAIN Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell for the third consecutive session after an auction of $32 billion in seven-year notes attracted poor investor demand, following the same pattern seen in the previous two auctions this week. "The auction went terribly," said Thomas Simons, money market economist at Jefferies & Co. "The seven-year note auction was very sloppy, similar to how the five-year went yesterday. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note lost 9/32 in price, sending the yield to 3.8835 percent. In intraday trading, 10-year yields reached a nine month high of 3.93 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was down 19/32, with the yield at 4.7647 percent. The huge wave of new government debt supply is affecting the price of Treasuries, while a more-or-less steady stream of positive data on the U.S. economy adds to expectations of higher inflation and interest rate increases.
