 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany will urge European Union leaders to agree International Monetary Fund and bilateral European aid could be used as "last resort" for Greece if it reached the brink of insolvency, Chancellor Angela Merkel said. 

 Speaking ahead of a summit of EU leaders in Brussels later on Thursday, who have been split over what help to give Greece to resolve its debt crisis, Merkel said Germany was prepared to sanction a mix of the two measures to bail out a country if it could no longer fund itself on capital markets. "At the summit today and tomorrow, the German government will push its view that any emergency support should come from a  combination of the IMF and joint bilateral help from the euro zone. But again I say, this can only be a last resort," Merkel said. "I will argue strongly that this decision -- that of IMF plus bilateral aid -- must be made. And we will again work very closely with France on this," she said in a government declaration to the lower house of parliament. Germany had staunchly resisted calls from other states to promise help for heavily-indebted Greece, and Merkel said she was not doing so now. "I repeat again, this is not about concrete aid, it's about specifying and carrying over the decision made on February 11," she said, referring to a pledge made last month by EU leaders to take coordinated action to uphold stability if necessary. Greece was not insolvent and had pledged to carry out an "ambitious program" of spending cuts, Merkel said. "A good European is not necessarily one who offers help quickly. A good European is one that respects the European treaties and national rights so that the stability of the euro zone is not damaged," Merkel said. Merkel added that the instruments available to safeguard monetary union were not sufficient at present, and that steps would have to be taken to correct this. "We must put an end to using tricks," she said. If countries did not play by the rules, a mechanism needed to be put in place to restore order without destabilizing the currency bloc, Merkel said. "That is why I will also urge that the necessary changes to the (EU) treaty are made so that unwanted developments can be tackled with suitable sanctions, quicker and earlier." Merkel said EU budgetary rules were not cut out for "a deliberate undermining of (their) criteria, as we were forced to undergo with Greece." "If a member of the currency union were to become insolvent in the current situation, it would mean grave risks for all in Europe," Merkel said.
