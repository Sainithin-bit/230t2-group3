 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp has recalled more than 8.5 million vehicles worldwide, two-thirds of which were to address the risk that floormats may entrap accelerator pedals and cause unintended acceleration. 

 Before launching a full-blown recall in November 2009 to fix the pedal, Toyota had warned dealers in 2007 -- and again in 2008 -- of the risk floormats could jam accelerators open and cause accidents on a broad range of its Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Following are several notices Toyota had issued to its U.S. dealers concerning the issue more than two years before the safety problem became widely publicized, and a series of other events in the run-up to Toyota's recall crisis. * March 29, 2007: The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opens preliminary investigation into pedal entrapment by floormats in 2007 model-year Lexus ES350 sedans after receiving consumer complaints. * April 11, 2007: Toyota issues a "technical service bulletin" (TSB) to tell dealers that floormats could interfere with accelerator pedals in Lexus ES350 sedans. * Late April to mid-May: Toyota sends letters to 2007 Lexus ES350 owners to warn them against stacking two floormats on the driver's side. * August 2007: NHTSA upgrades Lexus investigation into an "engineering analysis" after additional complaints are filed. * August 28, 2007: NHTSA tells Toyota's Washington staff at a meeting that it is considering expanding the scope of the Lexus investigation to include other models. NHTSA also proposes a larger meeting that would involve Toyota quality officials from Japan to discuss "an expanded owner notification, next steps and actions toward a solution." * September 13, 2007: Officials from Toyota's Customer Quality Engineering division in Japan and its U.S. regulatory staff meet with NHTSA officials in Washington to discuss issue. * September 21, 2007: Toyota warns dealers of pedal entrapment risk in all 2008 model-year Toyota and Lexus vehicles and tells them not to install optional floormat before sale. An excerpt from the notice: "NEVER install more than one floormat at a time in the driver's seating position... If applicable, any secondary set of floormats MUST be placed in the trunk with all the packaging material intact. DO NOT install the secondary mat on top of the primary floormat already in the driver's seating position." * September 26, 2007: Toyota tells NHTSA it will issue a recall of 55,000 all-weather floormats in Lexus ES350 and Toyota Camry sedans. Toyota says, however, that no defect exists with the mat or the vehicles themselves. Toyota's Washington staff says in a July 2009 internal memo that limiting the recall saved Toyota more than $100 million. * October 2007: NHTSA ends probe without examining floormat risk on other Toyota vehicles. * December 31, 2007: Toyota accounts for 23 percent of all unintended acceleration complaints filed with NHTSA in 2007. * April 21, 2008: Toyota issues technical service bulletin to dealers reminding them of pedal entrapment risk for all 2009 model-year Toyota and Lexus vehicles. The notice, again, warns dealers not to install the optional floormat on the driver seat, but in the trunk only. * April 2008: NHTSA opens investigation of unwanted acceleration due to a trim panel interference on the 2004 model-year Sienna minivan. In January 2009, Toyota recalls 26,501 Sienna minivans to replace floor carpet. * August 2009: A 2009 model-year Lexus ES350 driven by Mark Saylor, an off-duty California Highway Patrol trooper, speeds out of control and crashes in Santee, California, killing Saylor and three members of his family. Investigators find pedal entrapment by a floormat may have contributed to the crash. * September 2009: NHTSA tells Toyota it expects a recall to address possible defects in pedal design -- in addition to floormats. Toyota tells agency it will recall the pedals. * November 26, 2009: Toyota recalls 4.2 million vehicles in the United States to fix the pedal to prevent any chance of entrapment by the floormat. The recall is expanded in January 2010 to more than 5.3 million vehicles. * January 16, 2010: Toyota informs NHTSA that accelerator pedals made by supplier CTS Corp may have a dangerous "sticking" defect. * January 19: At a meeting in Washington, NHTSA asks Toyota to take prompt action. Hours later Toyota tells NHTSA it will issue a recall. * January 21: Toyota announces recall of about 2.3 million Toyota models to fix sticky pedals. This prompts a massive sell-off in Toyota shares and leads to the automaker's biggest public safety crisis. * January 25: NHTSA tells Toyota it must stop selling vehicles that have acknowledged defects even if it does not have a remedy. * January 26: Toyota halts U.S. sales of eight models, including its best-selling Camry and Corolla sedans, and says it will halt production for the first week of February. * January 28: Toyota meets with NHTSA to review its pedal fix. NHTSA says it has no objections to the fix. * February 2: Toyota reports a 16 percent drop in January U.S. sales compared with a year earlier. Monthly U.S. sales drop below 100,000 for the first time in more than a decade and Toyota's U.S. market share falls to its lowest level since January 2006. * February 2: NHTSA renews investigation into Toyota's electronic throttle control system. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood says, "While Toyota is taking responsible action now, it unfortunately took an enormous effort to get to this point." Toyota says it will cooperate with the probe. * February 3: LaHood warns owners of recalled Toyotas to stop driving, then withdraws his remark, saying it was a misstatement. Toyota says it is examining braking complaints about its 2010 model Prius hybrid. * February 4: NHTSA opens investigation into at least 124 consumer complaints about brakes on Toyota Prius hybrids. * February 5: After keeping a low profile for nearly two weeks, President Akio Toyoda appears at a news conference to apologize for safety problems. * February 9: Toyota announces recall of nearly 500,000 new Prius and Lexus-brand hybrid cars globally for braking problems. * February 22: Toyota says it received a federal grand jury subpoena from the Southern District of New York for documents related to unintended acceleration in some of its vehicles and the Prius braking system. * February 24: Akio Toyoda apologizes for accidents and injuries involving Toyota vehicles and pledges new safety measures as U.S. lawmakers grill him over Toyota's handling of safety issues in a congressional hearing in Washington. * March 1: Toyota tells dealers to replace an oil hose in some 933,800 vehicles in the United States due to the risk of a potential leak that could damage the engine. Toyota says the "limited service campaign" is not a safety issue and the vehicles are not being recalled. * March 2: Toyota announces unprecedented discounts, including zero-percent financing for five years and two-year free maintenance, after posting a 9 percent drop in February U.S. sales. * March 3: NHTSA reviews consumer complaints that fixes made to recalled Toyota vehicles did not resolve unintended acceleration. * March 8: Toyota says it had found no flaw with its throttle controls, dismissing an external study critical of its electronic safety systems. * March 9: U.S. safety regulators and Toyota dispatch teams to inspect a Prius hybrid that sped out of control on a California freeway. * March 9: Toyota tells dealers to fix 2000-2003 model-year Tundra pickups sold in 30 U.S. states to address a risk that part of the truck's frame could corrode, causing spare tires or even the gas tank to drop to the road. The "special service campaign" expands a 2009 recall of Tundras sold in 20 cold-weather states only. * March 12: Southern California prosecutors file the first U.S. consumer protection lawsuit against Toyota, claiming it had engaged in "fraud" by hiding evidence of dangerous vehicle defects. * March 15: Toyota says it has found no evidence to support driver's account of the widely publicized runaway Prius in California. * March 17: Toyota tells NHTSA it is considering how to fix nearly 1.2 million Corolla and Matrix models that risk stalling because of flaws in an electronic system. Toyota says the alleged defect does not create an "unreasonable" safety risk. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim , editing by Matthew Lewis)
