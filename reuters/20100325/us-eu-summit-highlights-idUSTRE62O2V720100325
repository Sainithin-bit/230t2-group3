 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The following are comments by European Union leaders as they gathered for a two-day summit at which they will discuss how to help debt-stricken Greece. 

 GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU "We have done what is necessary in Greece. We have taken difficult measures. We are on the right path. There is a challenge for us all in this time of economic turmoil." On a proposal from the Party of European Socialists for a euro-zone-backed borrowing agent to support Greece: "Proposals that have been put by the PES group ... they are simple proposals which do not cost." "Countries that would be using such facilities can be paying an additional fee to remunerate those who are putting up the guarantees. This is a clear solution and a simple one. It shows that if there is a will, there is a way. Hopefully this solution may be decided even today." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER (Speaking at meeting of European People's Party) "Initially I was of the idea that a unique role for the IMF would be a very bad idea. I do still consider that it would be a bad idea. We will probably have a mixture of the IMF and bilateral loans." "We have come to Brussels to make a decision, we did not come to Brussels to expose to the entire world our disagreement. This has to stop." Is there a chance for an agreement on Greece? "Yes, I do think so." Would he accept any changes to the EU treaty? "That depends on the amendments that people would want to make to the treaty. I don't think this is a short-term question. I could envisage amendments to the treaty when establishing the European monetary fund. I don't think that in the case of Greece, amendments to the treaty are necessary ... we have to separate this Greek case and the treaty changes related to the establishment of the European monetary fund." On German Chancellor Angela Merkel: "She was explaining to parliament this morning that she is in favor of the IMF and bilateral loans. My opinion is that we have to work out details concerning the instrument which would be put in place to support Greece although I think we will not have to use this instrument, but not all the details can be put on a piece of paper tonight." Do you see an agreement within the euro zone that the IMF should be brought in? "I have reasons to believe that this will be the deal, yes." DUTCH PRIME MINISTER JAN PETER BALKENENDE On Greek crisis: "It is important to find a solution. If a solution can be found, it is really essential that the IMF is involved because of the expertise and the conditionality." "If there is a meeting (of Eurogroup leaders), there must be a guarantee that it will be successful. Otherwise it has no use." "There are a lot of informal meetings now, so we have to wait and see." "There can be a combination of a role of the IMF and a role of European countries. It is important to talk about sanctions, we also need to talk about competences of Eurostat. You can have sanctions, talking about cohesion funds, and maybe in the future about structural funds." SWEDISH PRIME MINISTER FREDRIK REINFELDT "There are now discussions to have some kind of loan facility. The main discussion is should it be just bilateral action from some euro zone countries or should it be also an IMF-supported action, which I believe it should." Asked if going to the IMF would be humiliating to the euro zone: "I don't think so. They are there to solve those problems." Asked about German Chancellor Angela Merkel's tough position on Greek aid: "I understand Chancellor Merkel. She indicates she is able to help but she wants to have a thorough process, a thorough solution." Asked what he expects from the summit: "There may be discussions of euro zone countries. Sweden is not part of that. The expectation is they will give some kind of signal. Whatever is said at this meeting, we have to remember that the Greeks need to do the job themselves." Asked if EU treaty should be changed: "I don't believe in changing the treaty. I remember when we agreed on the Lisbon Treaty, in the morning we promised one another no more treaty changes in the next 10 years." EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO On the euro: "I want to highlight the fact that social partners, both the business side and the trade union side, highlight how important is the stability of the euro for Europe for business but also for the workers, for our economy in general. That is an important message considering the current debate." SPANISH PRIME MINISTER JOSE LUIS RODRIGUEZ ZAPATERO On help for Greece: "I am convinced that we will be able to find a solution ... I think that together the 27 member states will come up with a solution. Of course we do need the support of the euro zone and the Eurogroup." "We do need fundamentally a European solution. The way of finding that solution is by loans at reasonable rates. There is no reason why we shouldn't bring in the IMF." "It is not a question of giving Greece money, it is a case of lending Greece money that they then have to pay back with interest." On possible contributions for Greece: "Spain will pay on the basis of its GDP and inhabitants." On the euro: "Both sides of industry, the employers and the trade unions, have made it very clear that it is essential to keep a strong euro. We need confidence in the single European currency." "The euro is an extremely important currency. It's important to have a strong single currency." EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO On ECB collateral change: "As you know, according to the treaties, the ECB has full independence. So it was a decision taken by the ECB. It has my full support and the full support of the Commission." On help for Greece: "We have, of course, to involve all others. But at this stage I will not comment on any specific solution or the format of that solution." GREEK PRIME MINISTER GEORGE PAPANDREOU "Greece is determined to deal with its own problems, put its own house in order. We have already made very important and courageous decisions, embarked on a journey of major radical reform. Our country is on a journey of becoming a viable, prosperous, more transparent and more just economy." "We already are seeing tangible results ... we are on the right track. We will move ahead. Whatever the decision taken today, Greece will move ahead in a positive manner and in the right direction." "Of course today, the challenge is a European one ... for making sure we fortify the euro zone, we strengthen the euro currency and we stabilize the euro currency and the European Union." POUL NYRUP RASMUSSEN, PRESIDENT OF THE PARTY OF EUROPEAN SOCIALISTS: "I would say that (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel has been hesitating for too long. Tonight we need a concrete decision to help Greece and a decision to create a European mechanism for any member state."
