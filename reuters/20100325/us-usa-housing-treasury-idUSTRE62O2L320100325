 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A top Obama administration official on Thursday defended a $75 billion Treasury effort to help struggling homeowners avert foreclosure even as some lawmakers called it a failure. 

 Herbert Allison, assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, said the government's mortgage modification program had already put more than 1 million borrowers temporarily into lower payments. Critics point to the number of active permanent modifications, which is only 168,708 as of February, a fraction of the 3 million to 4 million homeowners the Treasury said it would help when the program was launched last year. "If you talk to those million homeowners, they would tell you this program has been a success for them," Allison said under questioning from lawmakers. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier said the program should be shelved in favor of a new plan that would allow homeowners to stay in their home as renters under a rent-to-own scheme. "I think of this program as death by a thousand cuts. It has failed. It has failed miserably," Speier told Allison, adding that the program does not consider non-mortgage debts as a factor in the modified payment. "We are setting ourselves up for failure," Speier said. Allison repeatedly acknowledged the program's shortcomings but said the Treasury Department is constantly making changes to the program to make it better. One such change involves principal reductions, which outside analysts have called key to any successful foreclosure prevention program. Allison said the administration is nearing the final stages of a principal reduction plan that would also help jobless workers avert foreclosure. "We have come up with some interesting ideas ... to enable some additional people to participate in this program, who may be unemployed or who need principal reductions and we look forward to speaking with you very, very soon about these ideas," Allison told the panel. Asked for details after the hearing, Allison told reporters it would not mean all underwater mortgages would suddenly be eligible for the program. "Anything we would do would have, I would say, moderate positive impact. We want to have more people eligible for this program," Allison said. The former Fannie Mae chief executive also said the Treasury Department had recently issued new guidance that would prevent banks from taking actions toward foreclosure if borrowers are in the government's program. Lawmakers were not the only ones criticizing the administration's efforts. The special inspector general for the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program this week said in a report that Treasury oversold the program and it is likely to be a failure by the time it wraps up in 2012. The Obama administration's definition of success is "essentially meaningless" because offers of modifications are far different than actual permanent modifications, the inspector general, Neil Barofsky, wrote.
