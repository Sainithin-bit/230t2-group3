 (Reuters) - Dubai's government said on Thursday it would support the restructuring of debt-laden state-owned firms Dubai World and Nakheel by providing $9.5 billion in new funding. 

 Dubai's request for debt payment delays in November shook global markets and raised wider concerns among international investors about transparency and disclosure standards in the region. Following are analysts' comments on the statement. ************************************************** ROBERT MCKINNON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, ASAS CAPITAL "This is probably the best outcome that could have come out, but some of the details are vague -- it says Nakheel will renegotiate at commercial rates, but without a guarantee from Dubai World or the government, these commercial rates would be pretty high. "Paying trade creditors is key, because that will hopefully have a ripple effect on the rest of the economy -- previously trade creditors hadn't been paid and so they didn't pay their subcontractors and so on. This move should help stabilize Dubai's economy." MOHAMMED YASIN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, SHUAA SECURITIES "It is a positive outcome, has exceeded the market expectations as the structure has addressed all concerns and strengthened the position of Dubai World and Nakheel. "By recapitalizing the companies through equity, it shows strong government support." HAISSAM ARABI, CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FUND MANAGER, GULFMENA ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS "We could see profit-taking in the market going forward, but this statement removes a major nightmare from the equation so people can therefore price in more normality and actually look at company numbers in terms of the macroeconomic story. "Valuations are very attractive -- Q1 results are coming up and so people will want to take positions. The bull trend should continue through April. "The government says contractors will get paid and that's why the likes of Arabtec ARTC.DU is going up, because it is has a lot of receivables." TIM CONDON, HEAD OF ASIAN RESEARCH, ING BANK (SINGAPORE) "This drives away the uncertainty and uncertainty is not good for the financial markets. It reduces volatility and promotes risk appetite but as far as being a long-term driver for the markets it is a bit difficult to say." "The financial markets have a lot of experience with restructuring and as far as the Dubai news is concerned it probably had its moment in the sun when the first time the news came about." MEGAT HIZAINI HASSAN, HEAD OF ISLAMIC BANKING AND FINANCE TRANSACTIONS PRACTICE, ZAID IBRAHIM & CO, KUALA LUMPUR "If there is some sort of settlement to ensure the sukuk holders of the return that would help a lot. It should provide some measure of certainty. Like it or not if there's default, in some way it would reflect on Islamic finance because of the size."
