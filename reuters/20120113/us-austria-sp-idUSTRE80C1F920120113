 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ratings agency Standard & Poor's will downgrade top-rated Austria by one notch, a euro zone official told Reuters on Friday. 
 "It is AA-plus and outlook negative," the source said. "I know that France is affected as well, and Slovakia," the source added. S&P had put 15 of the 17 euro zone countries under review for potential downgrades. (Reporting by European bureaux; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
