 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Slovakia is among several euro zone countries that will be downgraded by ratings agency Standard & Poor's on Friday, a senior euro zone source said. 
 S&P said in early December it was reviewing the ratings of 15 of the 17 euro zone member states, with the possibility of downgrading their creditworthiness in the face of a deepening debt crisis. Euro zone sources have told Reuters that Germany and the Netherlands are not among those that will have their ratings lowered, while Slovakia will be affected. A spokesman for S&P declined to comment. (Writing by  Luke Baker ; reporting by Martin Santa)
