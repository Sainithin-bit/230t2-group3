 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ratings agency Standard & Poor's will not downgrade Ireland's credit rating in a euro zone-wide move expected later on Friday, two senior Irish officials told Reuters. 
 A senior government source said he had been informed of a planned downgrade to several euro zone states, but was not expecting a cut to Ireland's rating. A second informed source said Ireland would escape a downgrade. "The government will be broadly satisfied with this outcome against the background of a significant number of countries being downgraded," the government source said.
