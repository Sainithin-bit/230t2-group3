 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ratings agency Standard & Poor's will not downgrade top-rated Finland in an euro zone-wide move expected later on Friday, a senior euro zone official told Reuters. 
 "Finland is not among the countries, it will not be downgraded," the source said. S&P had put 15 of the 17 euro zone countries under review for potential downgrades. (Reporting by European bureaux; Editing by Ruth Pitchford, Ron Askew)
