 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) could be among companies that beat estimates when they report next week, Thomson Reuters StarMine forecasts show. 
 Bank of America's forecast by StarMine, which weights forecasts based on analyst accuracy and how recent the estimates are, is 18.4 percent above the consensus estimate, or the average of analysts' forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters. A forecast of at least 2 percent above consensus suggests the company is likely to post results above it, according to StarMine. Goldman Sachs' forecast by StarMine is 2.8 percent above consensus, while Citigroup's forecast is 2.1 percent above, the data showed. The companies are among 46 Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  components expected to report earnings next week. On Friday, JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) reported earnings in line with Street estimates. But its stock fell 2.5 percent to $35.92. Among companies StarMine data has identified as likely to disappoint next week are Freeport-McMoRan ( FCX.N ), with a StarMine forecast 3.2 percent below consensus, and Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB.O ), with a StarMine forecast 4.1 percent below consensus. The picks are based on comments by analysts who StarMine says have a strong history of being correct with their forecasts. (Reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch ; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
