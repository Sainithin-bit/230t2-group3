 ST.JOHN'S, Antigua (Reuters) - Step out of Antigua's V.C Bird International Airport, and within minutes you will be face to face with Texas billionaire Allen Stanford's presence on this sleepy Caribbean island. 

 On one side of a perfectly manicured avenue lined with palm trees, in marked contrast with the island's mostly scruffy and potholed roads, stands the imposing Stanford International Bank, now under investigation by U.S. financial regulators. Directly opposite is Stanford's playground -- the Stanford Cricket Ground where just three months ago the Texan handed over $20 million in prize money for a single game of the Caribbean's favorite sport. That event, featuring the England national side playing a 'Stanford Superstars' team of West Indians, brought the 58-year-old financier to the attention of the sports world. His previous involvement in golf and polo were much more low-key. At the game in November, sponsors and guests were treated to lavish hospitality with lobster, imported steaks and fine champagne. The game ended with his own team becoming instant millionaires -- the reward from their benefactor for beating England, the old colonial ruler. Now the brashly confident Texan, who has dual U.S. and Antiguan-Barbudan citizenship and was knighted in 2006 by Antiguan authorities, is making headlines for other reasons. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) are looking into his banking business. They are probing the ability of the bank to pay high yields on certificates of deposit even though it says it invests CD money largely in stocks, real estate, hedge funds and precious metals, many of which have lost value in recent months. Stanford attributes the review to complaints by disgruntled former employees and describes the inspection as "routine". He says the company is rigorously managed and fully compliant with all U.S. regulations and that he "will fight with every breath to continue to uphold our good name." ADMIRED BY LOCALS Stanford's headquarters in the capital has little corporate signage and more resembles a mansion than a bank. Guests are taken into a waiting room with a plush leather sofa and a business magazine featuring Stanford on the front cover is arranged on a table. A smiling employee politely declined to answer questions, which she said should be addressed to the company's main spokesman. Just five minutes down the road toward the capital St.John's, there are few signs of wealth. A shack sells roast chicken and small shops advertise themselves with cheap hand painted signs. Stanford, a tall, mustachioed Texan, has been described as "haughty, arrogant and obnoxious" by Antiguan Prime Minister Baldwin Spencer, yet many locals admire him. "For me he is a good man because he creates a lot of work," said construction worker Colin Fredrick. "I don't see anything wrong with him. I'd have him as Prime Minister." In a country that depends to a large extent on tourism to bring in revenue, Stanford's financial business, investment in cricket and related construction work, as well as other interests such as the local newspaper the Antigua Sun, have had a knock-on effect on the island's economy, locals say. "He is the best investor to come into the Caribbean, not only Antigua, but the region," said islander Julian Exeter. "He puts food in the mouth of everyone in Antigua and money in their pocket," he said. "He is a great man. I don't care about investigations; it has nothing to do with me, as long as there is food on my table." Antigua's pride suffered a blow on Friday, though, when an international cricket match between England and the West Indies was abandoned due to the poor standard of the field. Meanwhile, up the road, staff were tending the lush green turf of Stanford's cricket pitch, which has been unused since November. (Editing by  Pascal Fletcher  and  Ted Kerr )
