 LONDON  (Reuters) - Massive losses revealed on Friday at the HBOS unit of Lloyds Banking Group plc ( LLOY.L ) were not a surprise to the Financial Services Authority (FSA), the regulator's chairman said on Sunday. 

 Adair Turner said the numbers were in line with a worse-case "stress test" conducted by the FSA during the time of the government's 37 billion pound bailout of the banking sector to see how much state support would be needed. He added that his regulatory review of the sector would be published on March 18, and would include "major changes" on capital requirements and liquidity along with proposals on pay and credit agencies. Part-nationalized Lloyds said on Friday its HBOS unit made a pretax loss of 8.5 billion pounds ($12.3 billion) last year due to a bigger-than-expected rise in bad loans, wiping a third off its value and raising fears more state help would be needed. "The losses revealed this week are not huge surprises to the FSA. What we did last October was run stress tests which were considerably worse than what was in the public domain, in order to work out how big the capital subscription had to be," Turner told BBC television. "The figures that are coming out are not order-of-magnitude different from what we thought was going to occur back in October." The losses forced British finance minister Alistair Darling to quell speculation he was thinking about a full nationalization of the group. Asked on Friday whether the government was getting ready to step in Darling said: "I have made it very clear banks are best run in the commercial sector, privately owned." The Treasury said there were no meetings planned between Darling and senior bankers this weekend. In his BBC interview, Turner also admitted that regulators had failed to deal with systemic risk in the banking sector. "With hindsight, the FSA - like other authorities throughout the world - was focused too much on individual institutions and the processes and procedures within them and not adequately focused on the totality of the systemic risks across the whole system and whether there were entire business models, entire ways of operating, that were risky," he said. "We didn't focus enough on that - the FSA, the Bank of England, the Treasury, the Fed and OCC (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency) in the U.S. didn't focus enough on these issues and we have got to get that right in the future."
