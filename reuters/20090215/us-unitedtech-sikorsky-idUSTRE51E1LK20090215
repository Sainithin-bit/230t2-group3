 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Union workers at United Technologies Corp's ( UTX.N ) Sikorsky helicopter unit approved a new five-year contract on Sunday, the company said in a statement. 

 The vote to ratify the new contract averts a repeat of the six-week strike that brought production to a halt in 2006. The Teamsters union represents about 5,100 Sikorsky manufacturing workers in Connecticut and Florida. East Hartford, Connecticut-based Sikorsky makes Black Hawk military helicopters, as well as the current "Marine One" helicopter used to transport the U.S. president, though the next generation of that aircraft, due to go into use in 2010, will be made by rival Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ). Other Sikorsky rivals include Textron Inc's ( TXT.N ) Bell unit and the Eurocopter unit of European aerospace company EADS ( EAD.PA ).
