 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - High-end handbag and accessory maker Coach Inc ( COH.N ) warned on Tuesday of weak traffic in its U.S. stores and forecast earnings below Wall Street estimates, pushing its shares down 12 percent. 

 "We are taking a cautious approach because of the very recent trends in traffic," Chief Executive Lew Frankfort told Reuters in an interview. "We think it is prudent considering the overall retail landscape," he said, referring to tight consumer spending, exacerbated by housing market worries and high energy costs. The warning came even as the company reported higher profit for the fiscal first quarter ended September 29. Coach said it expects to earn 68 cents per share on sales of about $970 million in the current quarter. The forecast fell short of the average Wall Street estimate of 70 cents a share on sales of $983.6 million. The company also said it expects sales at U.S. retail stores open at least a year to rise at a low-single-digit percentage rate for the current quarter. For the second half of its fiscal year, it forecast an increase in the mid-single-digit range. The New York-based company stood by its fiscal 2008 profit forecast of at least $2.06 per share. It expects sales of $3.17 billion, up slightly from its July forecast of $3.16 billion. Analysts expect $2.08 per share on sales of $3.19 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The weak traffic at Coach stores was not due to product issues but to weak apparel sales during an unusually warm September, Needham & Co analyst Christine Chen said. "If you are not buying a new fall outfit, then you probably will not buy a bag or shoes to match it," she said. BOOSTING SALES First-quarter net income rose to $154.8 million, or 41 cents per share, from $125.6 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 40 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales increased 28 percent to $677 million, boosted by strong sales of fall products like the Ergo and Bleecker handbags, and a 17 percent increase in sales in Japan. Sales were strong across various price points, like accessories below $100, as well as handbags over $400, the latter being its fastest growing category, Coach said. "Those who are shopping are buying more, which is good," said Chen, who has a "buy" rating on Coach shares. The company reiterated its plans to add about 40 retail stores annually in North America in the next several years, in line with its view that the region can support about 500 stores, including up to 20 in Canada. As of September 29, it had 272 retail stores and 96 factory stores in North America. Coach also said it would open 30 net new stores in China, Southeast Asia and the Middle East in fiscal 2008 through distributors. Coach shares were down $5.09 to $36.38 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $36.26 earlier.
