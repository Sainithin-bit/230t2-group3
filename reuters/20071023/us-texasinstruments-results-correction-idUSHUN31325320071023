 Corrects Kevin March's title in 12th paragraph to Chief Financial Officer, not Chief Executive 

 By  Sinead Carew NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N posted a 10 percent rise in quarterly profit on Monday, but gave a disappointing revenue forecast due to the loss of some business at customer Ericsson, sending its shares down as much as 4 percent. TI, which makes everything from calculators to chips for cell phones and televisions, said fourth-quarter wireless revenue would remain at third-quarter levels despite growth in other parts of its business, such as analog chips. TI forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $3.4 billion to $3.68 billion, compared with the average analyst view of $3.7 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Charter Equity Research analyst John Dryden said TI is losing market share faster than expected to STMicroelectronics NV ( STM.PA ), which in December signed a new contract with Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) to make chips for advanced cell phones. "People didn't think it was going to be that significant," said Dryden. Ericsson supplies chips to phone makers such as Sony Ericsson, its venture with Sony Corp ( 6758.T ), the world's fourth biggest mobile phone maker. Dryden estimated that Ericsson had asked STMicro to make as much as 20 percent of its chips for advanced cell phones. The news comes as TI is already bracing for its biggest wireless customer Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE ) to start selling phones with chips from other suppliers next year. TI said the addition of new competition at Ericsson would put pressure on its revenue until the second half of next year when it starts selling application chips for advanced phones to Ericsson under a recently announced contract. OUTLOOK DISAPPOINTS The company's third-quarter profit from continuing operations rose to $758 million, or 52 cents per share, from $686 million, or 45 cents a share. But revenue fell to $3.66 billion from $3.76 billion in the year-ago period, when the result was boosted by excess ordering by customers that had overestimated demand. The excess ordering sparked an inventory glut that TI cleared this year. Analysts were looking for third-quarter earnings of 50 cents a share on revenue of $3.66 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. TI Chief Financial Officer Kevin March said in an interview that besides wireless, which represents about 40 percent of revenue, the rest of TI's "product portfolios are doing what we'd expected them to do." He said wireless would be hurt by clients reducing chip inventory in the fourth quarter. TI forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 48 cents to 54 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 50 cents per share, before unusual items. Its shares fell were down 2.8 percent at $33.30 in after-hours trading. The stock ended Monday at $34.27, up 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. TI shares had fallen about 4 percent since September on investor disappointment over the company's revenue outlook.
