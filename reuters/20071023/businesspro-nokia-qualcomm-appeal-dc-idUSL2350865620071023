 OULU, Finland  (Reuters) - The world's top cellphone maker, 
Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), said it would consider appealing against a 
German court's on Tuesday decision to dismiss Nokia's case 
against U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ). 

  "Nokia is confident that its substantive claim is 
well-founded and is considering if it will appeal the court's 
decision," Nokia spokeswoman Anne Eckert said.  "The issue of exhaustion of patent rights in the 
telecommunications industry is an increasingly important 
issue."  Nokia wanted authorities to rule that Qualcomm's patents 
are exhausted, meaning Nokia would not have to pay Qualcomm for 
patents already paid for by its chipset supplier Texas 
Instruments TXN.N.  Nokia and Qualcomm are in numerous legal disputes over a 
key cross-licensing agreement over technology patents.
