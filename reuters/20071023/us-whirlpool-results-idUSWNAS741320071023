 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ), the world's largest appliance maker, reported a 50 percent rise in third-quarter profit on Tuesday as international demand and lower taxes helped offset a drop in U.S. sales. 

 The maker of Maytag, Amana and KitchenAid appliances backed its prior full-year profit outlook but cut its forecast for industry shipments in North America, its biggest market. "The U.S. business is weaker than we would have anticipated," said Laura Champine, an analyst with Morgan Keegan. "The good news is that the company was able to maintain its guidance for earnings and cash flow." Earnings rose to $175 million, or $2.20 a share, from $117 million, or $1.47 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected $2.13 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales were about flat at $4.84 billion, below analysts' estimates of $5.08 billion. Revenue in North America fell 8 percent to $2.9 billion, hurt by weaker demand amid the softer U.S. housing market. Whirlpool also said its original equipment manufacturing business was down, reflecting weakness in products made for Sears Holdings Corp's ( SHLD.O ) Kenmore brand. Industrywide shipments of washers and other major appliances fell 5 percent in North America during the quarter but shipment trends were likely to improve during the fourth quarter after five straight quarters of declines, Whirlpool added. Still, the company said it expects U.S. industry shipments to show a drop of about 4 percent this year, steeper than the 2 percent to 3 percent decline it projected in July. Operating profit in North America fell 24 percent, pressured by higher oil and metals costs and the lower sales. Revenue rose 12 percent in Europe, 23 percent in Latin America and 18 percent in Asia. Whirlpool, which acquired smaller rival Maytag in 2006, said it still expects full-year earnings of $8 to $8.50 a share. Analysts expect $8.28, according to Reuters Estimates. Whirlpool's stock, which rose 2 percent in Monday trading to $87,99, is up 6 percent so far this year. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs )
