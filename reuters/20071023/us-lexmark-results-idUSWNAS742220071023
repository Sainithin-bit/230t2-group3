 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lexmark International Inc ( LXK.N ) reported a 47 percent decline in quarterly profit on Tuesday due to weak printer sales, sending its stock down 4 percent. 

 The printer maker, which has been cutting costs and trimming prices as it competes with Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) and Canon Inc ( 7751.T ), also announced plans to close some operations in Mexico and move about 1,600 jobs to lower-cost countries. Net income fell to $45.2 million, or 48 cents a share, in the third quarter from $85.6 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, profit was 60 cents a share, far above analysts' average forecast of 13 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 3 percent to $1.195 billion. Business segment revenue grew 5 percent to $728 million, but consumer segment revenue fell 13 percent. "Although our business market segment continues to meet our expectations and our third-quarter earnings per share were better than expected, (earnings) were significantly below a year ago, reflecting the continuation of a very challenging situation in our consumer market segment," Chief Executive Paul Curlander said in a statement. Lexmark sold fewer printers than it expected in the quarter, including a 7 percent decline in shipments of laser printers. In recent quarters the company has suffered from weakness in inkjet cartridge sales and lower per-printer revenue due to aggressive pricing. It has also been hit by higher costs for developing new models. Lexmark said it would undergo a restructuring that would cost about $90 million by the end of 2008, as it shifts its consumer market segment focus to customers who print more pages and therefore use more ink and toner, which is more profitable for Lexmark than sales of printers. In an effort to cut costs, the company will close one of its inkjet supplies manufacturing facilities in Mexico and make economies at other inkjet facilities in the country. These and other moves are expected to affect about 1,650 jobs by the end of 2008, with most of the positions being moved to lower-cost countries, it said. Lexmark anticipates total savings from the restructuring of $40 million in 2008 and about $60 million annually once they are completed. It said it expects fourth-quarter revenue to fall in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range. It forecast net earnings of 32 cents to 42 cents a share, or 50 cents to 60 cents excluding restructuring costs. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts' average forecast for the fourth quarter is 40 cents a share on revenue of $1.337 billion. Lexmark shares were down $1.70 to $42.04 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul )
