 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp BNI.N posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as strong pricing offset lower freight volumes, sending its shares up 4 percent. 

 But the railroad warned that in the short term it is concerned about the impact on the economy of the housing slowdown, high fuel prices and slack consumer spending. "The economy could get worse in 2008," Chief Executive Matt Rose told Reuters. "Home foreclosures haven't played out yet and we should see that happen in the first quarter of next year." But unless there is a sustained and pronounced slowdown of the U.S. economy, BNSF will be able to maintain its prices, Rose added. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company reported third-quarter net income of $530 million, or $1.48 a share, compared with $489 million, or $1.33 a share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of $1.37 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "That's a great quarter. They're doing a good job in the face of a bit of a slowdown," said Don Hodges of Dallas-based Hodges Fund, which manages assets of $1 billion and holds BNSF shares. "As long as the economy doesn't get too much out of hand they should be fine because of their strong pricing." Like most major railroads, BNSF has managed to offset lower freight volumes this year with strong pricing. The company reported revenue for the quarter of $4.07 billion, compared with $3.94 billion a year earlier. It said the increase was due primarily to volume growth in its agricultural products business. Revenue at BNSF's consumer products business fell 3 percent to $1.46 billion from $1.49 billion, due to economic softness and as well as reduced trans-Pacific service of a large international customer. "We are seeing the effects (of the housing slowdown) on the consumer side, too," Rose told Reuters. Despite the bearish outlook, analysts were impressed by BNSF's continued pricing power and improved efficiency. "Burlington Northern became the latest (major railroad) to report very respectable third-quarter earnings," Lehman Brothers analyst Vincent Foley wrote in a research note. "In fact, Burlington Northern's results were among the best we have witnessed to date." BNSF said fourth-quarter freight revenue should grow in the mid-single digits. The company said pricing should remain firm during the quarter, but freight volumes will be down slightly. Earnings per share for the quarter should be flat on the year despite a fuel "headwind" of 17 cents a share, it said. BNSF shares were up $3.70, or 4.5 percent, at $86.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's shares hit a 52-week high of $95.47 on April 20 and 52-week low of $71.51 on Jan 8.
