 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) said on Tuesday it would add two new brands as the retailer tries to improve sales in its home business. 

 Wal-Mart said it would launch the Canopy line of home decor goods in stores nationwide in February. It also said it has a deal with Meredith Corp ( MDP.N ) to launch a line of Better Homes and Gardens home products, like bedding and decorative pillows, in its stores this fall. Financial terms were not disclosed, and Meredith said the deal would not impact its financial results until fiscal 2009. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri )
