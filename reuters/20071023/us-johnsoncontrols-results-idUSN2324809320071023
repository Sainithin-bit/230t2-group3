 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Johnson Controls Inc ( JCI.N ) said on Tuesday that quarterly earnings rose 29.4 percent, supported by growth in its building controls, battery and auto-parts businesses. 

 Net income rose to $466 million, or 77 cents per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, ended September 30, from $360 million, or 61 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10.6 percent to $9.01 billion. Earnings from continuing operations were 78 cents per share, Johnson Controls said, matching the average analyst forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts expected revenue of $8.9 billion. Johnson Controls, one of the biggest car-parts suppliers, produces seating and interiors for several automakers, setting it apart from U.S. companies that rely on Detroit-based car makers that have been losing market share in North America. Auto-parts sales rose 2.7 percent to $4.16 billion, with 2 percent growth in North America and 5 percent growth in Europe about in line with industry production, Johnson Controls said. The Milwaukee-based company has been restructuring its auto business in North America and attributed a 23.6 percent jump in worldwide segment income to substantial improvement in the region and strength in Europe. Lower volumes in Japan cut sales by 3 percent in the Asia/Pacific region, while unconsolidated sales in China rose 48 percent. Building controls sales rose 15.4 percent to $3.61 billion, reflecting strong commercial buildings markets globally and increased demand for services that provide ways to cut non-residential energy costs, it said. Segment income rose 23 percent. The fiscal year-end backlog of uncompleted commercial systems and services contracts was $4.2 billion, up 14 percent from a year earlier, Johnson Controls said. Battery unit sales rose 27.4 percent to $1.25 billion and segment income rose 7.3 percent. Earlier in October, Johnson Controls said it expects double-digit sales and earnings increases in fiscal 2008, which started October 1, and aims for rapid growth over the next several years with a focus on its international operations. The company expects fiscal 2008 earnings per share of $2.45 to $2.50 from continuing operations and sales growth of 10 percent to about $38 billion. Johnson Controls expects fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of 35 cents to 37 cents. Analysts expect Johnson Controls to report earnings of 38 cents per share in the fiscal first quarter and $2.52 per share for fiscal 2008. Johnson Controls shares closed at $40.07 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Monday, the stock was up nearly 40 percent in 2007, while the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP was up nearly 11 percent.
