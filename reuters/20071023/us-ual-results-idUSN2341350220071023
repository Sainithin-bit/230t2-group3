 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp, parent of United Airlines, and low-cost rival JetBlue Airways Corp both posted better-than-expected results on Tuesday as each flew fuller planes and collected higher fares. 

 The profits added to those reported last week by other carriers and reflected the improving condition of the U.S. airline industry, which has been battered in recent years by low-fare competition and expensive fuel. Efforts by carriers to limit the seats for sale and charge more for them have ignited a recovery despite signs of U.S. economic weakness and skyrocketing energy prices. "(There) has been a lot of discussion recently about a weakening economy and its potential effect on travel demand," UAL Chief Revenue Officer John Tague said on a conference call with analysts and reporters. "From our perspective, we are not seeing any evidence of a slowdown in demand. Looking close at the fourth quarter, we expect strong and balanced unit revenue growth both internationally and domestically," he said. UAL REVENUE MANAGEMENT The profit for United, the No. 2 U.S. carrier, was "driven by our continued discipline in managing capacity, aggressively controlling inventory to improve revenue results," Chief Executive Glenn Tilton said in a message to employees. UAL said its third-quarter profit rose to $334 million, or $2.21 per share, from $190 million, or $1.30 per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, largely related to the carrier's 2006 bankruptcy exit, UAL said it earned $1.96 per share. On that basis, Wall Street analysts had expected UAL to earn $1.88 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said pretax income, excluding special items, was $498 million, a gain of $279 million from the year-ago quarter. UAL said passenger revenue, excluding special items, it collected on the flights it owns and operates increased by 9.7 as it cut capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- by 1.5 percent and increased average fares by 8.2 percent. The company said revenue rose 6.8 percent in the third quarter to $5.53 billion. UAL paid 3.2 percent less for fuel. UAL said, however, that it expects its full-year costs per available seat mile to increase by 2.5 percent. The carrier said it expects to trim its capacity by up to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter, with cuts centered on domestic routes, while boosting capacity by as much as 5.5 percent in international routes where it faces less competition. UAL plans to continue that strategy into 2008. Calyon Securities airline analyst Ray Neidl called UAL's results "impressive," saying the carrier owes its success to the shift of capacity to international routes. "It can continue, possibly not to the same degree but these guys are doing a great discipline job in reducing capacity and getting away from the traditional way that airlines think," Neidl said. "In addition, they have an international advantage of a large Pacific and China route authority where demand is strong and seats scarce, enabling price increases and limited discounting," he said. Shares of UAL, which rose almost 15 percent in the third quarter, climbed $2.32, or 4.8 percent, to $50.45 on Nasdaq at mid-afternoon. JETBLUE, TOO JetBlue, meanwhile, returned to third-quarter profitability on stronger revenue, nearly doubling Wall Street forecasts. The airline posted net income of $23 million, or 12 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $500,000, or nil per share, in the comparable year-ago period. The profit, nearly double the Wall Street forecast of 7 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, lifted JetBlue shares 62 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $9.70 on Nasdaq. The carrier saw its fares rise 7 percent on average, which helped drive a 21.9 percent increase in operating revenue in the quarter. JetBlue filled 82 percent of its seats compared with 80.4 percent a year earlier. JetBlue Chief Executive Dave Barger said on a conference call that bookings for Thanksgiving are strong and the carrier expects similar demand for the December holidays. Unit revenue growth -- a key measure of revenue performance -- is forecast at between 2 percent and 4 percent for the fourth quarter, and 5 percent and 7 percent for the full year. JetBlue expects an operating margin in the fourth quarter of 3 percent to 5 percent. Barger also said the launch of Virgin America in September on transcontinental routes out of San Francisco and Los Angeles cut into JetBlue's West Coast business. He did not provide specifics but said the impact did not exceed expectations. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson in Chicago and  John Crawley  in Washington D.C.)
