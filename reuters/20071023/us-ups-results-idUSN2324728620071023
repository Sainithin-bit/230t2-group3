 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ) on Tuesday posted a higher profit citing growth in its global business, supply chain and freight units, plus modest growth in its U.S package business despite a "sluggish" economy. 

 The world's largest package-delivery company reported third-quarter net income of $1.08 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $1.04 billion, or 96 cents a share a year earlier. Excluding a $46 million restructuring charge and related expenses for a supply-chain business in France, earnings per share for the quarter amounted to $1.05. Analysts on average had expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.02, according to Reuters Estimates. "UPS turned in a solid performance in the face of a slower U.S. economy," UPS Chief Executive Mike Eskew said in a statement. Like its main rival FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ), UPS is seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic health based on the premise that in a more vibrant economy, package volumes rise or fall when growth slows. The company's results have been eagerly anticipated by many analysts for signals on the U.S. economy. The Atlanta-based company reported third-quarter revenue of $12.21 billion, up from $11.66 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue for the quarter of $12.24 billion. UPS said for the full-year it now expects earnings per share in a range of $4.13 to $4.19. Analysts had predicted EPS for the full year of $4.15. In premarket trading UPS shares were up 67 cents at $75.76 from Monday's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange of $75.09.
