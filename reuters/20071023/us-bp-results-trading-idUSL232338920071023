 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil giant BP Plc saw its third-quarter profits reduced by energy trading losses after its dealers got on the wrong side of volatile markets. 

 The world's third-largest, non government-controlled oil company by market value swung to a $57 million loss in its gas and power division, the unit within which crude oil and other energy derivative trading results are reported. In the same period last year, BP made a $152 million profit in the division and a Reuters poll of 10 analysts had predicted a profit of $222 million this time around. "That's down to some trading activity that was not quite as successful as we would have liked but the trading profits tend to fluctuate from quarter to quarter ... it's difficult to win every time," a spokesman said. The spokesman added the results were unrelated to turbulence in global credit markets. In recent years, BP has operated one of the most successful crude, gas and energy derivative trading teams, with annual profits exceeding $2 billion.
