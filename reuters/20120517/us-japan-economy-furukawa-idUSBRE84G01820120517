 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Economics Minister Motohisa Furukawa said on Thursday that the economy continued its uptrend in January-March and that it was expected to see moderate growth in the second quarter. 
 Furukawa said in a statement that reconstruction demand and government subsidies for low emission cars contributed to first quarter growth, along with a pickup in exports from the Thai floods and the U.S. economic recovery. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto ; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
