 (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd's ( 7267.T ) Acura brand is recalling 56,881 TL sedans from model years 2007 and 2008 in North America to replace a power steering hose that could leak over time and potentially cause a fire. 
 The recall affects 52,615 TL sedans in the U.S. and another 4,266 in Canada, the Japanese automaker said. Acura said the hose may deteriorate and leak over time. Leaking fluid could lead to a loss of power steering assistance or could cause smoke and fire, the Japanese automaker said. Acura said no crashes, injuries or fires have been reported related to the issue. The company said owners will be notified of the recall by mail, beginning in mid-June.
