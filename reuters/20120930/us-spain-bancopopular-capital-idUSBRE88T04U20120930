 MADRID  (Reuters) - The board of Spain's Banco Popular ( POP.MC ) has approved a capital increase of up to 2.5 billion euros ($3.2 billion), a source close to the process said on Sunday. 
 The bank's directors also agreed that Popular would remain independent rather than searching for a partner, the source said. Popular declined to comment. ($1 = 0.7773 euros) (Reporting and editing By Jesus Aguado, Writing by Paul Day)
