 RIYADH  (Reuters) - Etihad Etisalat 7020.SE (Mobily), Saudi Arabia's second mobile phone firm, said on Saturday it would spend at least 4 billion riyals ($1.07 billion) in the next two years building broadband and wireless networks. 

 Mobily, which lost a bid this year to run one of Saudi Arabia's fixed-line networks, has invested 5.2 billion riyals building its mobile phone network in the world's biggest oil exporter, since 2005, Chief Executive Khaled al-Kaf said. "We will aggressively invest in fixed-line substitution," Kaf told Reuters by telephone. Mobily would invest "at least 2 billion riyals a year" in 2008 and 2009 in mobile and broadband infrastructure, Kaf said. Mobily bought Bayanat al-Oula, one of two firms licensed to deploy WiMax wireless Internet access network in the kingdom, earlier this year. "We will have a very good level of expansion broadband and WiMax thanks to the purchase of Bayanat," Kaf said. The company, whose third-quarter profit missed forecasts of five analysts, now commands a 40 percent market share and expects this percentage to grow next year despite the launch of a third mobile phone operator, Kaf added. Mobily and incumbent Saudi Telecom Co 7010.SE will face new competition when Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Co ( ZAIN.KW ) (Zain) starts a third mobile phone firm next year with other investors. "Expansion in data services and in rural areas will provide important growth potential," he said. (Reporting by  Souhail Karam ; Editing by Daliah Merzaban)
