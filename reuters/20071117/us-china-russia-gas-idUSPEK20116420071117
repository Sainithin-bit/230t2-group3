 BEIJING  (Reuters) - CNPC and Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ) have agreed a gas pricing deal that should unlock a major pipeline plan, but it may come at a higher cost than Beijing wanted, the Xinhua agency cited a Russian executive saying on Saturday. 

 Alexander Medvedev, Gazprom's deputy chairman, said the two sides had reached consensus on the pricing mechanism for fuel piped from Russia to China after months of wrangling that had held up the start of work. However he added that negotiations "would not be influenced by China's low natural gas import prices," Xinhua said. Beijing holds state-set gas prices below international market levels, while Gazprom had demanded the gas export price for China should be at least comparable with supplies to Europe, after taking transportation costs into account. Gazprom has declined to disclose the prices under discussion. Russian media have reported that China was refusing to pay more than $100 per 1,000 cubic meters, similar to current Russian domestic prices and far below the European price of around $250 per 1,000 cubic meters. Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ), which has a monopoly on export of the fuel, was waiting for a deal to be reached to start construction. Eventually, under a deal signed last year, two pipelines could deliver up to 80 billion cubic meters of gas a year -- almost double the amount the company sells to Germany, its top customer in Europe. Medvedev said earlier this month that Gazprom could start delivering 68 bcm of gas to China four years after an agreement was reached, as it needed the time to build gas transportation infrastructure.
