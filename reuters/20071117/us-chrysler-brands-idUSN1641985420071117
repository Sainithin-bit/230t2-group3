 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC is considering massive branding changes that would further simplify its product portfolio, while helping cut as many as 1,000 dealers, The Wall Street Journal Online reported on Friday. 

 A plan calls for Chrysler dealers to sell passenger cars under the Chrysler name, while Dodge dealers would exclusively offer pickup and commercial trucks, and Jeep dealers would sell Jeep and sport-utility vehicles, the Journal said. The report cited dealers familiar with the discussions. Chrysler could not immediately be reached for comment. Chrysler executives have also decided to kill the entire PT Cruiser line after the 2009 model year, according to the report. Daimler AG sold a roughly 80 percent stake in Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management earlier this year. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; editing by  Andre Grenon )
