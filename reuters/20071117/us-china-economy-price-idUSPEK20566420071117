 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China will continue to move towards liberalizing the price of resources and utilities as it pushes for greater efficiency, despite mounting inflationary pressures, a planning official said on Saturday. 

 "We will continue to deepen reform in key areas like fiscal and financial sectors and pricing of resources and energy," Zhang Mao, vice director of China's National Development and Reform Commission, said at a forum in Beijing. Zhang's comment was in line with what the central bank has been saying, but neither set a timeline for reforms which are moving forward very slowly. China unexpectedly raised domestic gasoline and diesel prices by a tenth on November 1 in the face of severe fuel shortages across much of the nation, but it was the first increase in 17 months and still not enough to bring refiners back into profit. Rationing and dry pumps are still a problem in many areas as processors curb sales, because they have little incentive to sell fuel at a loss. The People's Bank of China said in its third quarter monetary policy report that pricing reform of energy and resources should not be delayed despite inflationary pressures. But China's Premier Wen Jiabao also said in late October that price reform for energy, transport and utilities should be stopped "in principal" in the fourth quarter to curb inflation. The consumer price index rebounded to a decade high of 6.5 percent in October, the same as in August, from September's 6.2 percent. Zhang said the government would try to keep a lid on inflation, as avoiding economic overheating is still a priority for Beijing. (Reporting by Zhou Xin; Editing by  Michael Urquhart )
