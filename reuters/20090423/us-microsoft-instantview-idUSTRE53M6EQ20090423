 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp reported a lower quarterly profit that met Wall Street forecasts, as cost cuts helped to partly offset a sharper-than-expected decline in revenue. 

 The world's largest software maker also said it was on track to release the next version of its operating system, Windows 7, during its 2010 fiscal year. Shares of Microsoft rose 4 percent in after-hours trading. COMMENTARY: CURTIS SHAUGER, ANALYST, CARIS & CO Shauger said Microsoft's stock has been "pretty cheap" and investors were expecting lower margins. "So the fact that this is not negative and they saw some positive growth in one or two of their business lines (servers and Xbox) is providing a little bit of relief. Also, some of the cost cuts they have done is having positive impact. People were fearing far worse." SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN, SEATTLE "The numbers are lower than we were expecting ... they hit the earnings number but were ... lower on revenue than we expected." On share move: "One of the things they said was operating expense guidance is lower, which might imply they are doing more on cost savings." "They said: we expect the weakness to continue through the next quarter. We don't know whether it means it's going to get better after that." KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, PITTSBURGH "I'm kind of neutral. There's stuff to be happy with: they're controlling costs and getting that under control. The bad thing is demand and consumer preference seems to have affected their topline." "The last couple of days tech earnings have shown an increasing weakness in enterprise spending. And more of a shift toward netbooks than notebooks, that would ultimately impact Microsoft." "Some areas of weakness that I can really see is their online services business....Client looks a little on the light side, and we expect that to have been impact by netbooks." "Something that looks like it's holding up well is server and tools, and that's the more business-oriented software. We were probably expecting that to be stronger, but for Microsoft at least it's strong." "It's good to see that they are controlling their costs, because that's within their sphere of control. They can't really do a lot about demand." Caughey attributed the share rise to Microsoft's comments that Windows 7 will be released in fiscal year 2010: "They have a nice product refresh cycle coming up which should allow them to maintain their market share." "The best of all possible worlds would be that it's ready for back-to-school, which is the July-August time frame." "They really haven't had a scheduled release. We all thought it was sometime in calendar 2010." "Vista was very delayed so this is a positive sign. that Microsoft said Windows 7 will be out in 2010." BRIAN BARISH, PRESIDENT, CAMBIAR INVESTORS, DENVER, COLORADO "I think there's nothing really terribly surprising in them. What is moderately encouraging is a good deal more restraint on cost. Microsoft has not exactly been the tightest run ship on the cost side for a long time and they are actually doing something there and I think that's encouraging. "Quite honestly movement in the stock probably has more to do with what kind of short-term options various short-term oriented traders have than anything else. But it's nice to see pretty decent numbers coming out of them." TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "Microsoft had a good quarter. I don't think anyone was expecting them to have a blowout quarter... they had another decent quarter and I think everyone is looking forward to the release of Windows 7." On implications for the tech sector or economy: "I think everyone knew the first quarter was not good for the economy and the tech sector. Microsoft said they don't expect things to pick up quickly. It was a pretty ho hum quarter." (Reporting by  Gina Keating  in Los Angeles,  Ellis Mnyandu  in New York and  Alexei Oreskovic  in San Francisco, Compiled by Tiffany Wu)
