 (Reuters) - Italian carmaker Fiat ( FIA.MI ) has emerged as a suitor to buy a big stake in General Motors' ( GM.N ) Opel business, which GM hopes to offload. 

 The news sparked sharp reactions from labor organizations and politicians: UNION LEADER AND OPEL BOARD MEMBER ARMIN SCHILD "We reject Fiat taking a stake in Opel... Labor will not make any contributions should an agreement with Fiat be reached," Schild told Reuters. "Fiat itself has dramatic overcapacities and there is the threat that this problem will be solved by closing in particular the Opel plants in Bochum and Eisenach (in Germany) using guarantees funded by German taxpayers." "Opel cannot survive with two sick parents and a Fiat deal would lead to less autonomy for an Opel Europe rather than more." HESSEN STATE PREMIER ROLAND KOCH "It is getting clearer every day that...private investors are interested in Adam Opel. It is good for Opel's future that there is competition. Magna MGa.TO and Fiat are among the interested partners but it is also clear that no preliminary decisions have been taken yet." FEDERATION OF YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS HEAD DIRK MARTIN "It is shocking that (Opel labor leaders) can think of nothing better than to torpedo the possibility that Fiat takes a possible stake....It is irresponsible (with) regard to Opel staff and to German taxpayers." RHINELAND-PALATINATE STATE ECONOMY MINISTER HENDRIK HERING "We don't want any investor at any price...Magna is more potent and has a more clearly recognizable strategic interest."
