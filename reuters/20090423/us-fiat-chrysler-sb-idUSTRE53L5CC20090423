 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italy's Fiat SpA denied on Wednesday a reported comment by an Italian union official that it was close to a deal to form a partnership with U.S. car maker Chrysler LLC. 

 Even the official, Bruno Vitali of the Fim-Cisl metal workers union, later toned down his comments about the talks when he spoke to Reuters by phone, saying a deal had yet to be reached. Earlier in the day, Vitali was quoted by Italy's ANSA news agency as saying that a deal was close at hand. "The agreement between Fiat and Chrysler is ready and even this evening, at 90 percent, it could be finalized," he was quoted as saying. "Then the chief executive of (Fiat) Sergio Marchionne could present it tomorrow to Fiat's board." Fiat's board meets on Thursday ahead of the publication of the group's first-quarter results and it is expected to get an update on the Chrysler talks from Marchionne. Fiat and Chrysler are trying to get the support of the U.S. car maker's creditors and unions in order to close a deal by an April 30 deadline imposed by the U.S. government. If they fail, the government has threatened to let Chrysler go bankrupt. In a brief statement, Fiat said it was "surprised" by Vitali's comments to ANSA, saying no agreement had been concluded between Chrysler and the U.S. and Canadian unions. "The assertion that the overall agreement has been 90 percent defined is untrue," it said. "The talks remain completely open and it is not currently possible to predict the timing or the outcome." Vitali told Reuters the U.S. union was strongly motivated to reach a deal ahead of the deadline. "There is a strong push on the part of the American union to close this negotiation in a positive way," he said. "Keep in mind that we are in talks and that it could all fall apart." He was quoted by ANSA as saying that Ron Gettelfinger, head of the United Auto Workers (UAW), had told him that the Chrysler workers union in Canada was also willing to make a deal and the "(U.S.) federal government is determined to put pressure on Chrysler's creditor banks." Both the creditors and the Canadian union have been holding out for better terms in their talks with Chrysler and Fiat. (Reporting by Gilles Castonguay)
