 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose by a slightly more than forecast 27,000 last week, government data showed on Thursday, while continued claims posted a record high again as the recession bit. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 640,000 in the week ended April 18 from a revised 613,000 the prior week, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 635,000 new claims versus a previously reported count of 610,000 the week before. COMMENTS: ANNA PIRETTI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "I don't think it changes really our main view. The numbers are very close to consensus. It shows that both the initial claims and continuing claims continue to trend higher... "Obviously we had some distortion last week when claims fell to 613,000, but that was the Easter week, some businesses were closed... "Because the Easter week moves from March to April, depending on the year, it clearly disrupts the seasonal process, and therefore a lot of the numbers that you see around those weeks are probably biased and do not really capture the underlying developments. I would not read too much into that drop to 613,000. "Overall, I would say the trend is still on the upside. And clearly the continuing claims, which tend to be less volatile than initial claims, I think are showing that. They continue to show steady increases." LAWRENCE GLAZER, MANAGING PARTNER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS, BOSTON: "Most economists are very quick to discount the rising unemployment rate and (view) that as a lagging indicator. What they may be missing is that investors are going to be hesitant to allocate assets to the equity market because they are concerned about job losses." CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "This puts a bit of a damper on the whole green shoots idea for now." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "If you look at last three weeks together, they are lower than the week before that and lower than any week in February. It is clear that jobless claims are not pushing higher. "These are still a lot of job losses, but maybe in the next couple of months, we could see a 500,000-handle in non-farm payroll decline. This is a slower rate of deterioration, and that's what we want to see. It suggests the bottoming process is underway. I'm leaning toward a V-shape or W-shape recovery." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "In my opinion the number is still very large, so I think that we're still looking at consumer discretionary activity being soft. I think the stock markets are ahead of themselves and that over the next few days we'll see a pullback. MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: S&P 500 equity index futures pare gains after data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar little changed versus yen.
