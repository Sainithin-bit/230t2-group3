 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Wednesday that talks with Chrysler LLC and its proposed partner Fiat are ongoing and no agreement has been finalized. 

 "We are continuing to work toward an agreement that will be in the best interests of Chrysler workers, retirees, and the communities where the company does business," UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said in a statement. The comments came after an Italian union leader was quoted as saying that an agreement to form a partnership between Chrysler and Fiat was nearly complete. Fiat has denied the report. Chrysler has until April 30 to complete an alliance with Fiat and win sweeping concessions from lenders and unions or face a cut-off of government funding and potential bankruptcy. Chrysler has been operating on $4 billion of U.S. government loans since the start of the year. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
