 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home builder Beazer Homes USA Inc ( BZH.N ) said on Thursday it would restate financial results back to 2004 due to accounting errors uncovered by an internal investigation that also found violations of federal housing regulations. 

 The company also reported preliminary results that showed its business fell sharply in the quarter ended September 30. Beazer shares rose after release of the long-awaited report on the probe. Agency Trading Group senior analyst Alex Barron cited relief. "People are going to interpret this as a net positive simply because it quantifies how much we're talking about and gives a sense of what the issues were," Barron said. "In some ways, it kind of puts it behind them." UBS analyst David Goldberg said in a research note the probe results suggest the impact on Beazer "will likely be benign." Beazer shares closed up 20 cents, or 2 percent, at $10.13 on the New York Stock Exchange. The investigation by its Audit Committee found evidence that employees of Beazer's mortgage unit, Beazer Mortgage Corp, violated certain U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) regulations, Beazer said. The violations relate to HUD's Down Payment Assistance programs in certain Federal Housing Administration-insured loans (FHA) originated by Beazer Mortgage Corp, dating back to at least 2000. The company declined to elaborate. It said it could not estimate the impact of the violations, which could make it liable for losses sustained by HUD or the purchasers of the mortgages in question. Beazer said it may be liable for damages, costs and expenses related to potential civil litigation involving FHA-insured loans. But Beazer said it planned to negotiate a settlement with regulators and estimated this could cost $8 million to $15 million. Beazer said the restatements were needed because of accounting errors on reserves related to land development and home closing costs. Analysts said they were more concerned about Beazer's preliminary quarterly results, which showed that Beazer was affected more by the U.S. housing market decline than its peers. Beazer's sales fell 39 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, new orders declined 52 percent, and its order cancellation rate soared to 68 percent. "They've taken a dramatic turn downward compared to their earlier two quarters, and that was a shock," Barron said. The Audit Committee launched its investigation earlier this year after The Charlotte (North Carolina) Observer newspaper published stories about questionable loans arranged by Beazer Mortgage Corp for home buyers in one of Beazer's North Carolina developments. A federal prosecutor and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched their own investigations, which are ongoing. The Audit Committee also uncovered problems in recording reserves and other accrued liabilities, which incorrectly boosted 2006 income, Beazer said. As a result, Beazer will restate its financial results for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006, increasing pre-tax income by more than $25 million. But pretax income for fiscal 2006 will be reduced by $20 million. The restatements also will affect the interim periods of fiscal 2007, Beazer said. The Audit Committee also found accounting errors related to sale-leaseback transactions. Correcting this will reduce pretax net income in the first half of 2007 by $20 million, and increase it in future periods, Beazer said. Atlanta-based Beazer said the restatements would not prompt an adjustment to its current cash position. "Beazer somehow ended the quarter with more than $400 million in cash, though $108 million is frozen to guarantee its letters of credit backing lot options," Gimme Credit analyst Vicki Bryan wrote. Beazer said its Audit Committee was continuing its investigation, and that the interim report was given to the federal prosecutor and the SEC. (Additional reporting by  Ben Klayman  in Chicago)
