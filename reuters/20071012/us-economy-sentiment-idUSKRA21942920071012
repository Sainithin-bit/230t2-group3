 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment is estimated to have remained steady in early October, according to a Reuters poll of economists. 

 The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment index was forecast to read 84.0 for the first part of October, up a fraction from the final September reading of 83.4. Estimates culled from 58 economists ranged from 81.0 to 87.0. Economists also offered a median estimate for a reading of 75.5 on the preliminary October consumer expectations index, up slightly from 74.1 in September. The preliminary October reading of consumers' view of current conditions was forecast at 98.3, up slightly from 97.9 in September and barely changed from August. The Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment indexes are set for release at 10 a.m. The following is a selection of comments from economists: UBS: Forecast: 83.5 "The Michigan index was stable in September after dropping in August, suggesting only limited fallout from the recent turmoil in the credit markets. The pattern probably can be linked to the resilience in the equity market. In contrast, the Conference Board index, which tends to be more sensitive to the labor market than the Michigan index, fell in September as well as August. A significant weakening in the labor market would ultimately cause more weakening in the Michigan index, too. However, we expect the October report to show little change." NOMURA SECURITIES: Forecast: 83.4 "The preliminary October reading for the University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment will provide important insight into the mood of consumers ahead of the crucial holiday-laden fourth quarter." DEUTSCHE BANK: Forecast: 81.0 "We expect consumer confidence to edge down mainly because of the drumbeat of negative housing news ..."
