 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - It is too early to draw lessons from the summer's credit market squeeze, whose aftermath continues to demand vigilance, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said on Friday. 

 Financial markets across the world had a rollercoaster ride as mortgage defaults in the U.S. subprime sector froze dealings in complex financial products related to those problem loans. This prompted cash injections by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to get the financial wheels moving again. Markets have calmed since, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  hitting a new high in recent days. "This is an area that requires continued vigilance. The process of these circumstances working themselves through the market is continuing. It will take some time," Kimmitt told reporters. There should be no blaming at this point and any regulatory response should be on an international basis, Kimmitt said. Credit rating agencies were singled out by top politicians such as German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy as too slow to warn investors. Top agencies include Standard & Poor's, a unit of McGraw Hill Cos Inc MHP.N, Moody's ( MCO.N ) and Fitch, part of Fimalac ( LBCP.PA ). They abide by a voluntary code of conduct. Kimmitt echoed several top EU officials, such as European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet and EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy, in signaling that lessons needed to be learned before making any changes. "I don't think it's a question of blame. I think at this point it's a question of analysis, to try to take a look at exactly the factors at play, what lessons can be learned from the situation that commenced this summer and is continuing now," Kimmitt said. The Group of Seven's Financial Stability Forum, which has set up a group to study the recent crisis, was the right international body to do that, he said. "We would rather await the results of our look and the look of the Financial Stability Forum before reaching any conclusions, certainly anything that would lead to a joint EU-U.S. announcement or anything out of the G7 framework," Kimmitt said. The Financial Stability Forum will look at four issues related to the subprime crisis: -- financial institutions and treatment of complex credit products and conduits -- how complex financial products are valued and accounted for -- supervisory oversight -- the role of credit rating agencies in evaluating structured finance products. There will be initial discussions next week in Washington and another look next spring, Kimmitt said. "There is a sense that we would like to address these issues as promptly as possible," he added. EU finance ministers this week agreed a timetable -- also involving the G7 and culminating in spring next year -- for reviewing regulations in light of the credit squeeze.
