 WASHINGTON  Oct 10 (Reuters) - Rising energy prices will likely lead to an increase in September U.S. wholesale prices after an August decline, while the closely watched core inflation measure may rise at the same pace as the previous month, a Reuters poll showed. 

 The producer price index -- a measure of prices before they reach the consumer -- will rise by 0.4 percent in September after dropping 1.4 percent the previous month, according to a median forecast of 69 economists. U.S. consumers faced rising gasoline prices during September, when pump costs normally decline at the end of busy summer driving season. Prices were higher because of expensive crude oil, which accounts for about half the cost of making gasoline, and motor fuel supplies that were below normal levels. After stripping out volatile food and energy costs, producer prices will climb a moderate 0.2 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in August, based on a median forecast of 62 economists. The PPI data and the monthly jobs report published on Oct. 5 are among a number of reports Federal Reserve policy-makers will look at as they weigh their next interest rate move on Oct. 30-31. Weakness in the economy could induce the Federal Open Market Committee to cut the federal funds rate further. The Fed cut the benchmark federal funds rate by a unexpectedly large half-percentage point to 4.75 percent on Sept. 18. The Labor Department will release estimates for September producer prices on Friday at 8:30 a.m. The following is a selection of comments from economists: ACTION ECONOMICS Forecast:           +0.8 percent ex-food and energy  +0.1 percent "The September overall-PPI is expected to rise 0.8 percent, while the core index rises 0.1 percent. Energy will post a big rebound this month. IDEAGlobal: Forecast:           +0.4 percent ex-food and energy  +0.2 percent "Core producer prices can be expected to be rather tame for the third consecutive month. The increase in headline inflation will undoubtedly be driven by rising oil prices and rebound in food prices after a -1.7 percent decline in August. With firms building up supplies in anticipation of increasing demand later in the year, we do think that there is a risk to the upside in the headline data." WACHOVIA Forecast:           +0.5 percent ex-food and energy  +0.2 percent "Higher gasoline prices in September should lead to an outsized gain in the headline PPI. Food prices, which surprisingly fell for the fourth consecutive month, should increase in September as the drought experienced in most regions of the country has lifted agricultural prices like corn and wheat. Wholesale prices further back in the pipeline are remaining contained and we expect that to continue in September."
