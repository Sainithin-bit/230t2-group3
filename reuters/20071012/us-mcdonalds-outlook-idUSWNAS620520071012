 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) on Friday forecast third-quarter earnings above Wall Street analysts' average estimate as September same-store sales rose 5.9 percent on strength in Asia. 

 The world's largest restaurant company forecast earnings of 83 cents a share before a gain from the sale of Boston Market. Analysts are expecting earnings of 77 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. McDonald's has outperformed many other restaurant chains and retailers this year, with breakfast items and new menu choices like chicken snack wraps doing well in the United States and extended restaurant hours helping in Asia and Australia. Sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 3.5 percent in the United States, 5.7 percent in Europe and 12 percent in the Asia Pacific/Middle East and Africa region. McDonald's shares traded at $56.85 on Friday in pre-market electronic trading, up from Thursday's New York Stock Exchange close of $56.25.
