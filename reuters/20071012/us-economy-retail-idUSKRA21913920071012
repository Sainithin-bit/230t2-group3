 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A worsening housing slump and tighter credit conditions probably prevented U.S. retail sales from eking out anything more than a modest gain in September, according to a Reuters poll of economists. 

 Consumer spending is a key component of the economy, and is of particular interest at the moment because analysts fear softening housing prices will make Americans feel poorer and prompt them to cut back on purchases. A survey of 72 economists points to a 0.2 percent increase in retail sales for last month, following a slightly larger gain the prior month. Excluding cars, sales were expected to pick up 0.3 percent following an August retrenchment. Chain store sales figures published weekly indicated spending was far from brisk, with one index hitting a 10-month low in the latest week. Following are comments from economists on the upcoming release: UBS ECONOMICS TEAM, STAMFORD, CONN.: (Forecast 0.2 percent; 0.3 percent ex-autos) "Retail sales probably finished Q3 relatively weakly. Unit light vehicle sales fell to an estimated 16.0 million unit annual rate in September from 16.2 million in August, implying some weakness in the auto component of retail sales too." NOMURA ECONOMICS TEAM, NEW YORK: (Forecast 0.2 percent; ex-autos 0.3 percent) "Unit vehicle sales of motor vehicles held steady after surging more than 6 percent in August, but the weekly surveys of retail stores point to lackluster sales at department and clothing stores. A small uptick in retail gas prices should magnify an otherwise small 0.3 percent gain in nonautomotive retail sales." STEVE WOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSIGHT ECONOMICS, DANVILLE, CALIFORNIA: (Forecast 0.1 percent; 0.4 percent ex-autos) "Retail Sales were anemic in September. Unit sales of motor vehicles slipped amid widespread price discounting. Core retail sales rebounded. However, sales building supply and home appliance stores stayed weak due to the ongoing housing market correction. Retail gasoline prices edged higher but not enough to give overall sales much of a boost. Core spending has increased by 3.9 percent over the past year but by 5.8 percent annualized over the past 6 months."
