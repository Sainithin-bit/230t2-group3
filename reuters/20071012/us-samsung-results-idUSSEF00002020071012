 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) posted a flat third quarter net profit as sluggish computer memory chip prices offset strong demand for flat screens, leaving the outlook for the world's top memory chip maker cloudy. 

 But shares in Samsung, South Korea's biggest stock worth about $89 billion, recouped an early fall to be up 1 percent at 560,000 won by 0207 GMT, beating the broader market's 0.7 percent loss, as operating profit beat forecasts. The outlook for coming quarters is hampered by expectations of further declines in prices of DRAM chips, widely used in personal computers, and NAND flash memory chips, used in digital cameras and portable music players such as Apple's ( AAPL.O ) iPod. "The result is better than market consensus, but future earnings of Samsung Electronics still have lots of uncertainties," said Choi Yong-kyu, fund manager at IBK-SG Asset management. "The outlook for the DRAM and NAND flash chip markets until early next year is bearish. Some analysts are bullish about the second half of 2008, but you never know what will happen." Samsung said it expected NAND prices to fall by mid-teens percent in the fourth quarter. While the short-term chip picture is bleak, Samsung, also the world's top maker of large-size LCD screens, should continue to reap hefty profits from its flat screen division on tight supplies and surging demand for sleek computer monitors and TVs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, the most valuable technology company outside the United States, earned a net profit of 2.19 trillion won ($2.39 billion) in the third quarter ended September, the same as a year earlier but up on the 1.42 trillion won in the April-June period. The result was fractionally above the 2.13 trillion won net profit forecast from 10 analysts surveyed by Reuters. Although the number represents a remarkable improvement from the previous quarter, it is much lower than earlier expectations. Operating profit came in 2.07 trillion won, up 12 percent from a year ago and a forecast of 1.76 trillion won, while sales rose 10 percent to 16.68 trillion won from a year earlier. Samsung is expected to post an 8.29 trillion won net profit in 2008, up from an estimated 7.11 trillion won in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates, helped by an expected recovery in DRAM prices later next year as production capacity growth slows.

Prices did bounce back briefly, but tumbled again in September. Samsung said margins in its semiconductor division rose to 18 percent in the third quarter, up from 8 percent in the second quarter but down sharply from 26 percent a year ago. Samsung's DRAM rivals, including Hynix Semiconductor ( 000660.KS ) and Taiwan's Powerchip Semiconductor Corp 5346.TWO are also poised to report mediocre third-quarter results. Not all market watchers were bearish on Samsung's chip unit. "I expect Samsung's overall performance to improve next year as the DRAM sector will likely enjoy growing demand from the scheduled launch next year of the corporate version of the Vista operating system," said Park Hyun, analyst at Prudential Investment & Securities. Samsung raised its forecast 2007 capital investment 13 percent to 9.17 trillion won. STELLAR SCREENS Samsung's display unit performed better, thanks to surging consumer appetite for flat screens, with profit margins almost doubling to 17 percent. The 2008 Beijing Olympics is expected to give another boost to the liquid crystal display (LCD) industry. Samsung, the world's second-largest maker of mobile phones in the second quarter after Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and ahead of Motorola MOT.N, sold a record 42.6 million mobile phones in the third quarter, compared with 37.4 million in the second. Operating margin in the telecommunications division rose to 12 percent from 8 percent in the second quarter as it strengthened its product line in the high-end segment. Reflecting the poor performance in its bread-and-butter chip division, Samsung shares rose a mere 1.6 percent in the third quarter, lagging the broader market's  .KS11  11.6 percent rise.
