 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is slowing but its fundamentals are strong, Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said on Friday. 

 Kimmitt, speaking to reporters, also reiterated the U.S. Treasury's position that foreign exchange rates should be set by the market, based on economic fundamentals. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told Reuters he backed a strong dollar and that currency rates should be set by markets.
