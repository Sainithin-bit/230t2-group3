 DALLAS  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Janet Yellen said on Friday that any monetary policy rule should be open to uncertainty. 

 Yellen spoke at a Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas conference on the contributions of renowned Stanford University professor John Taylor's work to monetary theory and policy. Taylor was a proponent of incorporating uncertainty into models for monetary policy rules. "As a policy-maker who relies on models and forecasts myself, I recognize the great degree of uncertainty about all aspects of our models and our limited ability to predict the future," Yellen said. A text of her remarks was made available in advance. Yellen did not directly address the current economy or interest rate outlook in her remarks. Noting that one of Taylor's earliest papers focused on the behavior of the economy while people learned, Yellen said the biggest challenges for policy-makers in creating more realistic models would be how to incorporate forms of deviations. "The asset price movements over the past decade amply illustrate that the economy does not always behave the way our standard models predict," she said. "More generally, small deviations from full rationality in consumer or firm behavior can have large consequences on the behavior of the macroeconomy." Taylor gained renown as the author of the "Taylor rule," which offers a relatively simple guideline for how central banks should set interest rates based on a target rate of inflation and the interest rate that would represent "neutral" monetary policy, that is, a level of interest rates that is not skewed to lowering inflation or boosting economic growth. Policy-makers would raise or lower interest rates depending on how actual inflation deviates from the inflation target and the difference between the economy's actual growth rate and the economy's maximum noninflationary speed limit. In practice, policy-makers regard the Taylor rule as a useful guidepost rather than a strict road map.
