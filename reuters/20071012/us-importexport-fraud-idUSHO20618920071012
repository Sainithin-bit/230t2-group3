 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eight people have been charged in connection with an $80 million scheme to defraud the Export-Import Bank of the United States, federal prosecutors said on Thursday. 

 Five of the eight defendants pleaded guilty in the scheme involving $80 million worth of fraudulent loan transactions between companies in the Philippines and U.S. lending banks, in which the Export-Import Bank of the United States (Ex-Im Bank) acted as guarantor or insurer. The charges were announced in Washington by Assistant Attorney General Alice Fisher of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Jeffrey Taylor of the District of Columbia. "With the help of the Justice Department, we will continue to pursue anyone attempting to rip off the taxpayer," Ex-Im Bank Chairman and President James Lambright said. As part of the scheme, a loan broker in the Philippines assisted borrowers in executing loan agreements with lending banks and in obtaining loan guarantees or insurance policies from the Ex-Im Bank as part of the loan agreements, the prosecutors said. The loan broker then recruited U.S. exporters for the purpose of purchasing U.S. goods and shipping the goods to the Philippine borrowers. The broker instructed the exporters to prepare false shipping documents and submit them to the lending banks to make it appear they had purchased and shipped goods. In reality, the exporters did not purchase the goods called for in the loan agreements, and instead misappropriated a majority of the loan proceeds, the prosecutors said. In a separate release, the Export-Import Bank said of the five who pleaded guilty, four are exporters, and one is a freight-forwarder. The five, who are all U.S. citizens, have agreed to serve time in prison, with maximum sentences of up to 40 years and agreed to cash or property forfeiture, the bank said.
