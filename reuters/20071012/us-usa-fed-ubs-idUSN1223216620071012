 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UBS revised on Friday its forecast for when the U.S. Federal Reserve would trim interest rates after this week's stronger-than-expected data on U.S. retail sales and trade balance. 

 UBS's view change followed J.P. Morgan, another U.S. primary dealer, whose economists said late on Thursday they no longer forecast a Fed rate cut later this month. UBS's economists now expect Fed policy-makers to hold the key federal funds rate steady at 4.75 percent following their Oct 30-31 meeting. This week's data, combined with evidence of stability in the credit market, "suggest reduced pressure on Fed officials to follow up their September 18 ease with another on October 31," UBS economists said in a research note. In a Reuters poll earlier this month, UBS economists had predicted the Fed would cut rates by a quarter point at the end of the two-day meeting, followed by another quarter point cut at their Dec, 11 meeting. Instead, they now expect the Fed to hold off from further cuts until its December and January meetings. In the interest rate futures market, traders scaled back their expectations of an October rate cut this week. The November federal funds contract implied a 30 percent chance such a move, down from 40 percent on Thursday and 48 percent a week earlier.
