 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Friday, driven by a takeover bid in the software sector, data showing strength in consumer spending and a brighter outlook from McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) 

 The Nasdaq Composite Index advanced more than 1 percent and reversed the previous session's late-day slide, boosted by shares of BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O after Oracle Corp ORCL.O made a $6.7 billion offer for the business software maker.  Retail sales rose more than expected last month, the Commerce Department said, despite worries the housing slump would cause consumers to keep a tight grip on their wallets. Investors "were encouraged by the increase in retail sales," said Todd Clark, managing director of stock trading at Nollenberger Capital Partners, in San Francisco. "The market has been paying a lot of attention to the consumer." McDonald's forecast third-quarter earnings above the average Wall Street estimate on strength in Asia. Shares of McDonald's, a Dow component and the world's largest restaurant company, rose 1.4 percent to $57.02. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 77.96 points, or 0.56 percent, to end at 14,093.08. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 7.39 points, or 0.48 percent, to 1,561.80. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  climbed 33.48 points, or 1.21 percent, to 2,805.68. For the week, the Dow gained 0.2 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 0.9 percent. Energy companies' stocks rose as oil prices hit a record above $84 a barrel, fueled in part by tensions between Turkey and northern Iraq. U.S. crude CLc1 added 61 cents to settle at $83.69 after hitting $84.05 earlier. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) gained 0.9 percent to $93.48. "Crude keeps on going higher. That's not a good data point for the market, but it's been able to ignore it today," Clark said. Tech's rally followed a sell-off on Thursday that ended four days of steady gains by the Nasdaq to its best level in 6-1/2 years. Thursday's slide followed a downbeat brokerage comment on Chinese Internet company Baidu.com Inc.( BIDU.O ). Shares of BEA Systems, which has been under pressure from activist investor Carl Icahn to put itself up for sale, jumped 38.2 percent on Friday to close at $18.82 on the Nasdaq. Oracle's offer was for $17 a share; its stock ended nearly flat at $22.44. Also in the technology sector, Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) gained 3.1 percent to $167.25 after the iPod maker's price target was raised by Morgan Stanley. In other economic data, a Labor Department report showed the core Producer Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose just 0.1 percent in September -- or only half the gain forecast by economists polled by Reuters, easing some inflation worries. A Reuters/University of Michigan survey showed a drop in consumer sentiment in the preliminary reading for October, but the news had little impact on stocks.        Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) rose 1.1 percent to $57.80 after UBS raised its price targets on the soft-drink maker and several other consumer products companies, including McDonald's. On the downside, shares of diversified manufacturer General Electric Co ( GE.N ) dropped 1.4 percent to $41.03 on the New York Stock Exchange after the company posted quarterly results in line with expectations. Trading was lighter than normal on the NYSE, with about 1.10 billion shares changing hands versus last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 1.96 billion shares traded, slightly below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of 5 to 3 on the NYSE and about 3 to 2 on the Nasdaq.
