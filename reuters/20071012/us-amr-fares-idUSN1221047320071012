 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, said on Friday it raised domestic round-trip fares by $10 to offset soaring fuel prices. 

 A spokesman for the world's largest airline said the fare increase, initiated on Thursday night, applies to routes in the contiguous 48 states. Fares were raised by $5 one way and $10 round trip. "With oil over $80 a barrel, it's no secret why we would raise fares," said AMR spokesman Tim Wagner. NYMEX crude oil futures -- directly related to the price of yet fuel -- traded above $83 a barrel on Friday. Airlines this year have generally struggled to make increases stick, often rescinding them as competitors balked at matching them. Published fares are typically changed at scheduled updates. Shares of AMR were up 25 cents at $24.16 on the New York Stock Exchange.
