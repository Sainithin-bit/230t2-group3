 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) rose more than 6 percent on Friday after analysts said the automaker's new labor deal with the United Auto workers union would save it more money than originally expected. 

 "We feel increasingly confident that GM may announce better-than-expected savings," JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note on Friday. Patel said he expects the contract to save GM $3.9 billion in cash, or $3.41 a share. Under the terms of the contract, nearly 17,000 union-represented jobs -- more than a quarter of GM's total factory work force -- could be filled with new hires at roughly half the cost of current workers. "Through natural attrition and the aggressive use of buyouts ... GM may very well be able to almost entirely replace within 2-4 years its expensive UAW work force," Patel said, adding that the swap would slash GM's annual active labor bill to $6.3 billion from $8.5 billion. GM shares closed at $42.64, up $2.65, or 6.6 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The shares climbed more than 7 percent earlier in the day -- their biggest gain since September 26, when the automaker reached a tentative contract with the union. The stock has risen almost 50 percent since September 10, as investors anticipated a contract that would cut costs for the struggling automaker. GM, which lost more than $12 billion in the past two years, is in the middle of a restructuring that includes cutting more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants. Under the new contract, GM would shift a retiree health-care obligation, estimated at over $50 billion, to a new trust in exchange for initial payments of $30 billion. Under that health-care deal, GM will establish a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, that will take over responsibility for paying out health-care benefits for retirees in 2010. "We believe that many investors have not focused on the "little money down" funding of the VEBA," Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said in a note. According to the contract, GM will transfer $24.1 billion to the fund in January and has pledged "backstop" funding valued at another $1.6 billion if the fund runs short of money to pay out benefits. "As opposed to the headline $24.1 billion cash contribution number, we think GM can use existing VEBA assets for $17.8 billion of funding and defer $5.6 billion for 12 years," Johnson said. The automaker will disclose details of the contract terms in a conference call on Monday.
