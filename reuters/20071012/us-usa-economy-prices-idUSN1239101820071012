 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices advanced by a larger-than-expected 1.1 percent in September on rebounding energy prices, Labor Department data on Friday showed, but a key measure of core inflation at the producer level rose by a slight 0.1 percent. 

 It was the largest gain in producer prices since February, when they were up 1.2 percent, and handily outstripped economists' forecasts of prices paid at the farm and factory gate to rise 0.4 percent last month after a 1.4 percent drop in August. Economists had also anticipated a rebound in energy prices after the previous month's steep 6.6 percent fall. Energy prices in fact rose 4.1 percent, notching the largest increase since November 2006, when they were up 5.4 percent. Core producer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, had been forecast to increase by 0.2 percent, following a 0.2 percent rise in August.
