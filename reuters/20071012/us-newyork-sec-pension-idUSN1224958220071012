 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an informal inquiry into whether investment firms paid friends and relatives of former state comptroller Alan Hevesi to win state pension fund business, the New York Times reported on Friday. 

 The SEC staff is reviewing transactions between investment firms, the $154 billion pension fund and placement agents that helped facilitate the deals, according to the New York Times. SEC Spokesman John Nester declined to comment. A spokesman for Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, who replaced Hevesi, had no immediate comment. Both the former and current comptrollers are Democrats. Bradley Simon, the lawyer who represents Hevesi, said: "When all the facts are out, it will be very clear that Alan Hevesi acted properly in all respects with the oversight of the pension fund." SEC staff recommend to the commission whether to launch a formal investigation that would give investigators subpoena power. The staffers are looking into potential civil violations of federal securities laws, the paper said. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo and Albany County District Attorney David Soares have launched their own investigations into the pension fund's oversight under Hevesi. The issue is whether Hevesi's friends and relatives received improper financial benefits because they were close to Hevesi, who was the pension fund's sole trustee, the paper explained. Investment firms want access to the $154 billion fund, which is the second largest pension fund in the U.S., because they can reap lucrative fees by managing some of its assets. Many other states hand control of their funds to boards of directors instead of giving it to just one official. Hevesi resigned in December after pleading guilty to an unrelated felony charge that he had state workers drive his ailing wife. According to the New York Times, Hevesi's former top political adviser, Hank Morris, ran or worked for six placement agents during Hevesi's tenure from 2003 to 2006. A lawyer for Morris was not immediately available. The companies tied to Morris received at least $25 million in fees from deals, the New York Times said, citing people with knowledge of the investigation. One of the investment companies that won business from New York's pension was the Carlyle Group, which manages $1.3 billion of the fund's investments, according to its spokesman, Chris Ullman. The Carlyle Group paid $12 million of fees over four years to a company called Searle & Company that employed Morris, Ullman said, adding all these payments were disclosed as required. Ullman said the Carlyle Group was not the subject of the investigation. A firm run by Hevesi's son, Daniel Hevesi, has been subpoenaed by investigators from the attorney general's office, the newspaper said. Laura Brevetti, the lawyer representing Daniel Hevesi, said: "We cannot confirm or deny that the SEC's involved," adding her client never was paid by or did business for the state common retirement fund. "He has never placed any common money and never received any fees for placing common money and has no investment with it," Brevetti said. Daniel Hevesi has a broker-dealer, called Praetorian Securities, and he also works for a hedge fund, Third Point. Before he joined Third Point, it invested some New York pension money in one of its funds that pools investors' money together, his lawyer added. "He gets no commission...or fee from that...it all precedes his entrance there. He had nothing to do with that," Brevetti said. Hevesi's former chief of staff Jack Chartier arranged for an investment firm that managed pension fund money to make loans to a friend, The New York Times said. His lawyer did not comment on the matter to the paper. Some of the documents detailing the fees paid to placement agents disappeared from the comptroller's office shortly after the fund's chief investment officer, David Loglisci, resigned earlier this year, according to the current comptroller. The SEC has only civil jurisdiction but can mete out enforcement actions. The federal regulator has direct oversight over any placement agents that are broker-dealers.
