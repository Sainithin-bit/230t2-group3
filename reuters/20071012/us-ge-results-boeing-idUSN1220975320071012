 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ), which produces aircraft engines, said on Friday that it does not expect much of an impact from launch delays that Boeing Co ( BA.N ) announced for its 787 airliner earlier this week. 

 "We are going to continue our development program on the original schedule," GE Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin said in a conference call with analysts. "We don't anticipate that that is going to have a big impact on us." GE said the early engines produced for the program would not produce high margins and noted that Boeing had not yet issued a new production schedule by customer. Chicago-based Boeing said on Wednesday that it would push back the first deliveries of the 787, which will be built with large amounts of lightweight carbon composites, by at least six months to late November 2008 to December 2008. Earlier on Friday, GE reported a third-quarter profit in line with analysts' expectations, driven by strong demand for heavy equipment and strength at its financial units.
