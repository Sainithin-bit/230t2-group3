 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O said on Friday that business software maker BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O canceled a meeting scheduled today and declined attempts to reschedule. 

 Oracle, which has a made a $6.7 billion offer to buy BEA, also said that it remained "committed to its proposed price of $17 per share." BEA earlier on Friday rejected Oracle's bid, saying it seriously undervalued it. Oracle also said it was prepared to go ahead immediately with a process that would lead to a friendly transaction. Officials at BEA were not immediately available to comment. (Reporting by  Duncan Martell )
