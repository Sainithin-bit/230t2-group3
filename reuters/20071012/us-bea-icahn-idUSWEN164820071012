 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Activist shareholder Carl Icahn said on Friday that he is glad that Oracle Corp <ORCL.O made a $6.7 billion bid for BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O, and sees Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ) and International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) as other potential bidders. 

 "I was a bit surprised, but this will be coming more and more," Icahn said in a telephone interview on CNBC. "I do think there will be other synergistic bidders. I was very surprised, I really was, that there was going to be a bear hug in this one." (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan )
