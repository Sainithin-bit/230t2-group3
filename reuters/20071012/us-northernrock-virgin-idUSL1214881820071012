 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Virgin Group VA.UL, controlled by entrepreneur Richard Branson, is in talks to take over troubled bank Northern Rock NRK.L, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 The planes, trains and mobile phones group could lead a consortium including Middle East and U.S. investors that would inject cash in exchange for a controlling stake and stabilize funding at the troubled bank, rather than make a formal takeover offer, the source said. The group could make a proposal as early as today, but the timing was uncertain, he added. Under the plan the Northern Rock business would be kept largely intact, with products probably rebranded Virgin Money. Virgin and Northern Rock both declined to comment. Northern Rock shares jumped as much as 6 percent before falling back. Virgin joined several other companies circling the lender, which was offered emergency funding by the Bank of England a month ago after facing a funding crisis, a move that sparked the first run on a major UK bank for more than 140 years. By 5:50 A.M. EDT, the shares were up 0.8 percent at 260 pence, valuing the bank at just over 1.1 billion pounds ($2.24 billion). The stock has rallied more than 60 percent this week as optimism has grown that the bank would receive a bid, but is still down two-thirds in the last month. Branson, one of the world's highest-profile businessmen and estimated to be Britain's 11th richest person with a 3.1 billion pound fortune, pushed Virgin into financial services in 1995. Virgin Money now offers credit cards, insurance, savings and pensions, and also products in Australia and South Africa. But it no longer directly provides mortgages, after selling out of its Virgin One joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) in 2001. Virgin One was launched in 1998 as a mortgage that offset current accounts, and had built up a 3 percent share of the UK mortgage market within three years. Jayne-Anne Gadhia, who helped set up Virgin One and moved to RBS, returned to Virgin in March, sparking speculation she would rebuild a mortgage offering. Virgin Money's website hints at its plans: "When we can offer you a great value Virgin Money mortgage we'll let you know," it says. Branson is the face of all of the Virgin business empire, becoming a household name because of his maverick approach and headline-grabbing stunts. But one of his boldest moves -- the creation of Virgin Media VMED.O by merging his mobile phone group with cable TV firm NTL in February -- has struggled due to an ongoing row with satellite firm and rival BSkyB ( BSY.L ). BIDDERS CIRCLE Newcastle-based Northern Rock is estimated to have borrowed almost 13 billion pounds from the Bank of England in the last four weeks at a punitive interest rate. Britain's government threw it a fresh lifeline on Tuesday, offering to guarantee new retail deposits and extend funding arrangements, but analysts widely expect it to be taken over. Northern Rock, advised by Citigroup ( C.N ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N, has said talks with suitors continue. U.S. buyout firms Cerberus CBS.UL and JC Flowers are considering moves on the bank, according to other sources familiar with the matter. British and U.S. newspapers have also named Blackstone ( BX.N ), Lone Star and Apollo as possible suitors. (additional reporting by Miyoung Kim)
