 (Corrects word at end of first paragraph to Britain instead of Japan) 

 By  Masayuki Kitano TOKYO  (Reuters) - The dollar slid to a record low against the euro on worries about U.S. subprime mortgages and hit a 26-year trough versus sterling on Wednesday after British data bolstered expectations for higher interest rates in Britain. The euro rose as high as $1.3823 on electronic trading platform EBS and sterling hit a 26-year peak as the dollar was pressured by news about the ongoing woes of two Bear Stearns hedge funds that bet heavily on subprime loans. Worries that troubles in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector could cast a pall over the broader U.S. economy also helped drag the dollar lower against the yen. The dollar fell about 0.25 percent to 121.86 yen with the yen gaining support as investors unwound some of their bets against the low-yielding Japanese currency. "There is some dollar-selling taking place, and in addition, a fall in the Nikkei share average is prompting investors to pare back risk positions and to buy back the yen," said Masafumi Yamamoto, currency strategist for Nikko Citigroup. The dollar suffered as Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. said in a letter to investors on Tuesday that two of its hedge funds that bet heavily on risky subprime loans now have "very little value".  Sterling rose as high as $2.0504 as of 0255 GMT, up from around $2.0470 in late New York on Tuesday. The euro pared some of its gains and stood at $1.3816 but was still up from around $1.3780 in late U.S. trading on Tuesday. The dollar fell broadly, with the Australian dollar hitting an 18-year peak of $0.8762 earlier this session. In the stock market, the benchmark Nikkei share average fell 1.14 percent U.S. HOUSING DATA Sterling gained a boost after data on Tuesday showed that the annual core consumer price index in Britain rose to a decade-high 2.0 percent in June. The data bolstered expectations that interest rates in Britain -- already the highest among Group of Seven industrialized nations at 5.75 percent -- could eventually climb beyond 6 percent. "It might be more or less factored in, but it looks like interest rates are headed higher in Europe," said a trader for a major Japanese trading house. The dollar looks vulnerable given such expectations for higher interest rates in Europe, and the persistent worries about the U.S. subprime mortgage sector, market players said. Given this market sentiment, U.S. housing data could prove more crucial for the dollar later this session than consumer price data or Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual testimony before Congress, said Nikko Citigroup's Yamamoto. The dollar could come under more selling pressure if U.S. housing data due on Wednesday such as June building permits and housing starts come in weak, Yamamoto said.
