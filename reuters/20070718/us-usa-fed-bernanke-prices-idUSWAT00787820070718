 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve prefers to focus on the core rate of inflation, excluding food and energy, because it helps forecast future price trends, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday. 

 Speaking to the House Financial Services Committee after presenting his twice-yearly testimony on the U.S. economy, Bernanke said it takes one to two years for monetary policy to take effect. By stripping out volatile food and energy prices, the Fed can better track future inflation trends, he said.
