 AMSTERDAM/LONDON  (Reuters) - ABN AMRO AAH.AS said on Wednesday it would discuss with Barclays ( BARC.L ) the implications of a bid proposal this week by the consortium seeking to dislodge Barclays as ABN's preferred merger partner. 

 The consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Fortis FOR.BR sweetened its 71.1 billion euro ($98 billion) bid for ABN on Monday, offering 93 percent cash instead of the previous 79 percent. ABN said it had received the proposal from the RBS-led group and would discuss it with representatives of the consortium as well as discuss its implications with Barclays. Barclays, which has the backing of ABN's management, is offering shares worth 65 billion euros to acquire ABN. The consortium is likely to win the takeover battle, because Barclays will struggle to win over its own shareholders and those of ABN, according to a survey released by stockbroking firm Execution. "There exists no bid level by which Barclays can win over its own shareholders and convince ABN shareholders to accept their offer over that of the consortium," Execution said in a research note. The note said the survey was based on responses from "a credible 55 institutional shareholders" of ABN, Barclays and  RBS. Based on current offers, 95 percent of ABN shareholders in its survey would favor the consortium, Execution said. They would rate the Barclays offer more favorably if the cash level were raised to over 75 percent of the offer, but Execution said this was not a viable option for Barclays. Barclays Chief Executive John Varley said sweetening its offer was possible in interviews with several European newspapers. Varley added, however, he had no plans to take on partners to bid for ABN. ABN's brief statement on Wednesday repeated that it will act in the best interests of all stakeholders, which includes staff and clients as well as shareholders. NEW COURT HEARING Barclays and the consortium have until July 23 to launch their proposed offers. ABN's statement came a day before the Dutch commercial court is due to hear a request from Dutch investor group VEB for the court to nominate three supervisory board members to make decisions on the takeover. VEB says ABN's boards have been prejudiced towards Barclays. The Dutch central bank will also be heard as an interested party before the court, as it has to approve appointments at big banks, a spokesman for the central bank said. The consortium's latest offer is conditional on ABN retaining its remaining major assets, which span from Asia to South America, and ABN said on Wednesday "it has no intention of making any major asset disposals at the current time". The commercial court will hear VEB's request on Thursday at 1100 GMT, with the ruling expected early next week.
