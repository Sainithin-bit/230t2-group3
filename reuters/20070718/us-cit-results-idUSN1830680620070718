 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc. said on Wednesday it was exiting the mortgage business and posted a surprise second-quarter loss, as the commercial and consumer lender became the latest to bail out of the struggling home loan sector. 

 CIT also lowered its expected earnings for the year, and said costs outside its mortgage business crept higher relative to revenue. The company's shares fell about 9 percent in early trading, making it the third-biggest decliner on the New York Stock Exchange. CIT Chief Executive Jeff Peek has been working since 2004 to sell weaker operations and add hundreds of staffers in more profitable businesses. In a statement, he cited poor returns in mortgages as a reason for shedding the business. But the new staffers do not seem to be boosting the bottom line enough yet, an analyst said. "CIT may have bitten off more than it could chew," said David Chiaverini, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York, adding that he expects the new employees to contribute more to profits in coming quarters. CIT posted a second-quarter net loss of $134.5 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $236 million, or $1.16 per share. The company said it incurred a loss of $2.58 per share after taxes on the exit from its home lending and construction business, after lowering the fair-market value of a mortgage portfolio worth more than $11 billion. Excluding that $2.58 per share charge and other items, CIT's results were $1.28 for the quarter, or 7 cents below average analyst estimates, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said it was reducing its earnings outlook for the second half of 2007 by 25 cents per share, to a range of $2.60 to $2.70 per share, due to the weakness in home lending operations. Analysts had on average expected CIT to earn $1.41 per share in the third quarter and $1.43 per share in the fourth quarter. LOWER RETURNS Returns in CIT's consumer and small business lending group, which includes home lending, student lending, and other operations, have been lagging other CIT units. Return on risk-adjusted capital was 2.4 percent excluding a $765 million pre-tax charge on mortgages, and was 5.7 percent in the first quarter, compared with the company's overall target return on equity of about 15 percent. Net charge-offs as a percentage of average finance receivables were up from a year earlier due to the weakness in home lending and lower commercial recoveries. The company wrote down $38.4 million of home loans, or about 1.4 percent of average finance receivables, compared with $18.8 million a year earlier. The company said there were higher home lending delinquencies, reflecting the wider subprime meltdown. Higher origination volume and acquisitions helped CIT increase managed assets by 19 percent from a year earlier. WOULD THE LAST ONE OUT TURN OFF THE LIGHTS? CIT is one of many companies to exit the mortgage business recently. It is likely to sell the assets and plow the proceeds back into its business, BMO's Chiaverini said. General Electric Co. said last week that it was selling its WMC Mortgage subprime mortgage business. H&R Block Inc. agreed in April to sell its struggling Option One subprime lender to Cerberus Capital. Not everyone is getting out of the sector, though. Private equity firms have shown an interest in buying subprime assets in anticipation of the sector turning around. And Countrywide Financial Corp., the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said on Monday that it had added nearly 5,800 jobs. CIT shares fell $5.00 to $50.43, reaching their lowest level since November.
