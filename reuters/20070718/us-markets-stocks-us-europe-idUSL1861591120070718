 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street looked set for a weaker start on Wednesday as concerns about the U.S. subprime mortgage market resurfaced ahead of U.S. housing and key inflation data and a slew of corporate earnings. 

 Following the Dow's record close on Tuesday, September Dow Jones futures were down 0.3 percent, S&P futures fell 0.5 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 0.6 percent. The tech sector will be in focus after a disappointing update from Intel ( INTC.O ) overnight. Its stock was down 5 percent in Germany. The market awaits Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual testimony to Congress for his view on inflation and any comment he makes about the impact of subprime mortgage defaults on the broader housing market. Bernanke's speech starts at 1400 GMT. Concern about the state of the U.S. subprime mortgage market resurfaced after Bear Stearns BSC.N said on Tuesday its two troubled hedge funds that had bet heavily on risky subprime loans now had "very little value". "This is the only issue that sticks out in the earnings cavalcade. It remains a point that makes markets vulnerable," said David Pieper from German regional bank LBBW. U.S. housing data and the June reading of the consumer price index are scheduled for 1230 GMT. On the corporate side, earning updates are due from Altria Group ( MO.N ), eBay ( EBAY.O ), IBM ( IBM.N ), J.P. Morgan Chase ( JPM.N ), Pfizer ( PFE.N ), United Technologies ( UTX.N ) and Washington Mutual ( WM.N ). "Company results are clearly in focus today," Pieper said. "Intel and Yahoo may be weaker, but apart from that, we are quite optimistic about second-quarter results so far." INTEL WEIGHS Technology shares declined after Intel ( INTC.O ), the largest maker of computer processors, posted a rise in second-quarter earnings but missed its profit margin target. The stock fell nearly 5 percent after the closing bell in the United States. Shares of Internet media company Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) fell about 2 percent after the closing bell after it reported a dip in quarterly profit in line with previously lowered expectations and a weaker-than-expected forecast for the rest of 2007. The Dow Jones industrial average on Tuesday gained 0.15 percent to end at 13,971.55 after breaking through the 14,000 mark earlier in the session. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index inched down 0.01 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 0.55 percent, to close at 2,712.29 after climbing intraday to 2,719.94, its highest in six and a half years. Media stocks may be in focus after the board of Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N endorsed on Tuesday a $5 billion buyout offer from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N, sending the deal to the controlling Bancroft family for final approval. Elsewhere, Warner Music Group Corp. WMG.N has declined to bid against a British private investor for the EMI Group Plc EMI.L.
