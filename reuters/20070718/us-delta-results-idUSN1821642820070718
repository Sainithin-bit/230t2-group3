 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc. ( DAL.N ), which emerged from bankruptcy at the end of April, said on Wednesday that quarterly earnings surged on a one-time reorganization gain. 

 The No. 3 U.S. carrier by passenger traffic said second-quarter net profit jumped to $1.77 billion, or $4.49 per share, compared with a loss of $2.2 billion a year before. Excluding a $1.5 billion gain related to settling claims and revaluing assets, the company posted earnings of 70 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimates of 57 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "They've got momentum going coming out of bankruptcy. They hit the ground running hard," said Ray Neidl, an analyst with Calyon Securities. "It looks like their cost structure is a little bit lower than we thought." Unit costs, excluding expenses for fuel, profit sharing, and bankruptcy costs, dipped 0.6 percent in the second quarter. "Our turnaround continues to take hold, but is not complete -- we must remain vigilant in driving revenue and cost improvements, especially in light of increasing fuel prices," Chief Financial Officer Edward Bastian said in a statement. Operating revenue rose 5.5 percent to $5.0 billion on higher fares and fuller planes, with transatlantic and Latin American routes especially strong. Delta was upbeat about demand heading into the third quarter, predicting strong passenger traffic and fuller planes in July and August. "We expect the remaining summer traffic to be strong and load factors to be higher than last year," Chief Operating Officer Jim Whitehurst said on a conference call. Load factor -- the percentage of seats filled with paying passengers -- is a key measure for airlines. Fuller planes typically give airlines' more leeway to raise fares. NEW CEO Delta will likely name a new chief executive by the end of the summer, current CEO Gerald Grinstein said on a conference call, resolving uncertainty in upper management. Grinstein, 74, has long said that he planned to retire after Delta exited Chapter 11 and once a successor was named. Analysts see CFO Bastian and COO Whitehurst as the front-runners for the job. After a 19-month, $3 billion restructuring in Chapter 11, Delta listed its new, post-bankruptcy shares on the New York Stock Exchange on May 3, opening at $21.75. The shares were up 17 cents to $21.36 in afternoon trading.
