 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of the world's largest carrier American Airlines, posted a second-quarter profit on Wednesday that fell short of Wall Street expectations, weakened by severe weather disruptions. 

 AMR, whose shares fell 2.7 percent, said its profit amounted to $317 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with $291 million, or $1.14 per share, a year earlier. The average Wall Street estimate was $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue slipped 1.6 percent to $5.88 billion. Weather disruptions reduced revenue by $50 million and lowered profit by 12 cents per share. AMR Chief Executive Gerard Arpey said in a statement that weather was an "enormous obstacle." The carrier said bad weather, particularly at its Dallas hub, forced it to cancel 1.8 percent of its scheduled departures between April 1 and June 20. Another 1,00O weather-related cancellations in the last 10 days of June increased the total to 2.1 percent for the quarter. The airline industry has been battered in recent years by low-fare competition that makes it difficult for carriers to raise fares high enough to cover costs. Airlines mounted a recovery in 2006 as they pulled excess capacity from their systems, flew fuller planes and boosted fares. AMR said it reduced its capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- by 4.4 percent in the second quarter, while its load factor -- the percentage of seats filled --was a record 83.6 percent. The carrier said its average fares increased 2.3 percent year over year. AMR said it expects its mainline capacity to decrease by 2.1 percent in 2007 compared to 2006, with a 2.6 percent reduction in domestic capacity and a 1.3 percent decrease in international capacity. In a letter to employees, Arpey cautioned that competitive pressures from new entrants like Virgin America and Skybus would pose new challenges in the second half of 2007. "While this quarter's results were positive, as we look ahead the specter of high fuel prices and intense competition from several new airlines will likely make the second half of the year much more challenging," Arpey said. Capacity reductions help facilitate fare increases. But fare hikes have been less frequent in 2007, and some experts have warned of a possible decline in domestic revenue. Morningstar analyst Brian Nelson said domestic capacity cuts boosted AMR's unit revenue by 3.6 percent from a year earlier. JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker was also mostly upbeat on AMR's earnings. He said in a research note that there was no change to his earnings outlook for the company. "However, in light of continued domestic demand improvement, we envision potential upside to our demand forecasts," Baker said. Jet fuel was AMR's second largest expense after labor, totaling $1.64 billion. Prices remained historically high, but AMR paid 3.7 percent less for fuel than it did in the second quarter of 2006. The company, which says it plans for an average price of $2.24 per gallon in the third quarter and $2.11 per gallon for all of 2007, has 35 percent of its anticipated third-quarter fuel consumption capped at an average price of $1.94 per gallon. For the full year, AMR has 31 percent of its anticipated full-year fuel consumption capped at $1.96 per gallon. AMR ended the quarter with $6.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, including a restricted balance of $470 million Shares of AMR were down 75 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $27.18 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, near their lows of $27.16.
