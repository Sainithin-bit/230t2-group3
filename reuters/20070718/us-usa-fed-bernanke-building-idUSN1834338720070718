 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told lawmakers on Wednesday that a shift of construction workers from residential building to non-residential construction and other specialty areas has helped offset losses in the home building sector. 

 "Many of the construction workers are finding work, but not in residential," Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee in answer to questions after giving his twice-a-year testimony on the health of the economy. Bernanke also told the panel that first-quarter growth in gross domestic product was held down by temporary factors and that second-quarter growth would be closer to a 3 percent rate. The Fed chief separately said, when asked about the value of the dollar, that he does not anticipate a crisis like that seen in 1979-80. "The Federal Reserve is committed to maintaining low and stable inflation and I am very confident we will be able to do that," Bernanke said.
