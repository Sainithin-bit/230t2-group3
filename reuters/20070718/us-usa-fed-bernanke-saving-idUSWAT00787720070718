 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Wednesday that many homeowners should save more now home prices have halted their rapid rise and have stabilized. 

 Homeowners "will have to save more out of their current income and that may lead to some increase in the household savings rate," he said. "Over the medium-time horizon, we do want to see more saving. People saved less in the past decade or so precisely because home values (were rising). They did not feel that they had to put aside part of their income." Bernanke also told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee that it was important to improve the efficiency of the U.S. health care system.
