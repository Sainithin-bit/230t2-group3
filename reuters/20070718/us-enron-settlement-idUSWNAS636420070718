 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Enron Corp. creditors will receive $149 million to settle lawsuits related to commercial paper issued shortly before the energy trader's 2001 bankruptcy filing. 

 Enron Creditors Recovery Corp., the legal successor to Enron, on Wednesday said the settlement resolves claims against some defendants, including affiliates of Allstate Corp ( ALL.N ), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Northern Trust Co ( NTRS.O ) and Prudential Financial Inc ( PRU.N ). The lawsuit requires approval by the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan. Enron said it originally filed suit in November 2003 to recover commercial paper payments from about 180 defendants, and that the lawsuit against other defendants will continue.
