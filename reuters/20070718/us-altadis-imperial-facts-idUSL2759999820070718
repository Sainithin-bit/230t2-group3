 (Reuters) - Imperial Tobacco ( IMT.L ) on Wednesday agreed to buy Franco-Spanish group Altadis ALT.MC ALDS.PA, strengthening its world number-four cigarette making position and lifting it in Europe to number-two status.  

 Here are some key facts about the two companies: ALTADIS Altadis, the world's fifth-largest tobacco firm, sold 118.6 billion cigarettes last year with 2006 revenue from cigarettes of 1.69 billion euros. It is the second-largest cigarette group in France and in Spain, number four in Germany and number one in Morocco. It was formed in 1999 through the merger of France's Seita and Spain's Tabacalera, and is headquartered in Madrid. It is the world's largest producer of cigars selling 3,281 million cigars in 2006, producing annual cigar revenues of 888 million euros. It offers a range of Cuban brands thanks to its 50 percent interest in Corporacion Habanos. Its logistics unit had 2006 sales of 1.19 billion euros. Altadis cigarette brands include Gauloises, Gauloises Blondes, Gitanes, Fortuna, Nobel and Ducados, while its cigar division produces Cohiba, Flor de Copan, Hoyo de Monterrey and Montecristo.

In 2006, sales fell 3.4 percent to 3.97 billion euros ($5.3 billion) and net profit fell 21.5 percent to 453 million euros mainly due to a price war and new taxes in its biggest market, Spain.
