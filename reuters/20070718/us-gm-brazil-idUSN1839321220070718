 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Wednesday it would invest $500 million in its operations in Argentina and Brazil for developing small vehicles for Latin America and other emerging markets. 

 GM will put $400 million of that into developing compact cars that would be built at GM's plant in Sao Caetano in greater Sao Paulo, Brazil, and in Rosario, Argentina. The automaker expects the cars to be on the market by around 2011, but it did not say if the cars would run on ethanol. Brazil leads the world in production of ethanol, a fuel that produces less pollutants than gasoline, burns cleaner and is made from renewable sources such as sugar cane or corn. Another $100 million will be invested in GM's technology center in Sao Caetano and Indaiatuba, also in Sao Paulo, Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said after the announcement in Sao Paulo. Wagoner was president and managing director of GM Brazil in 1991 and 1992. "We have been growing our engineering resources in key emerging markets like Brazil, China and India, not only for development of vehicles for their own markets, but for other emerging markets as well," Wagoner said. "This investment will enable us to take full advantage of the expertise we have in Brazil and support our planned local and global sales growth." GM is growing overseas and expects sales outside the United States to continue to surpass domestic sales. Foreign sales accounted for 55 percent of GM's sales last year. Sales in Brazil rose 18 percent in the first two quarters of 2007 and sales in Argentina rose 16 percent, while U.S. sales fell 8 percent in the same period. GM, which lost more than $10 billion in the past two years, is trying to return to profitability through a restructuring that includes cutting more than 34,000 jobs and closing 12 plants in North America.
