 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Chrysler Group is abandoning a 
plan to build a new luxury sedan, citing fuel regulations 
currently on the table in Washington that could push U.S. 
automakers to increase vehicle fuel mileage, the New York Times 
reported on Wednesday. 

  Chrysler is the first carmaker to announce a change in 
production plans related to the push in Congress to require 
that vehicles sold in the U.S. consume less gasoline, the Times 
report said.  A Chrysler spokesperson told the Times the environment was 
no longer favorable for a luxury Imperial model.  "We decided in an era of $3 gas and more regulations headed 
this way that it didn't amount to a good business case -- a 
profitable business case," Ed Saenz was quoted as saying, 
adding that the decision was reached by the automaker three 
weeks ago and was not related to the group's impending sale to 
Cerberus Capital Management.  A spokesperson for Chrysler could not immediately be 
reached for comment.
