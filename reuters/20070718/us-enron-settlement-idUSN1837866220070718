 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Enron Corp. creditors will receive $149.2 million to settle lawsuits related to commercial paper that the energy trader bought back shortly before its December 2001 bankruptcy filing. 

 The settlement with Enron Creditors Recovery Corp., which legally changed its name from Enron Corp. on March 1, resolves claims against roughly 80 defendants, court papers show. Enron accused the defendants of receiving preferential treatment and fraudulent transfers at the expense of other creditors. Among the settling defendants are affiliates of Allstate Corp ( ALL.N ), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N, Northern Trust Co ( NTRS.O ) and Prudential Financial Inc ( PRU.N ), court papers show. Enron had sought $510.2 million plus interest from the settling defendants, the papers show. Chairman John Ray called the settlement another "significant milestone" for creditors. Commercial paper is debt issued by companies, usually with high credit ratings, to finance short-term credit needs. According to court papers, Enron paid more than $1 billion between October 26 and November 6, 2001 to buy back commercial paper that hadn't matured. This happened while the company was being shut out of the commercial paper market, despite having investment-grade credit ratings, as losses, accounting problems and evidence of fraud mounted. Enron sought bankruptcy protection on December 2, 2001. Prudential spokesman Bob DeFillippo said his company was pleased to settle, and doesn't consider its payout to be material financially. Lehman spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment. Allstate, Merrill and Northern Trust did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. exists to sell assets, pay debts and conduct litigation. The Houston-based company has said it has distributed some $11.5 billion to creditors. The settlement requires approval by the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan. A July 27 hearing is scheduled. Enron said the case originally involved 180 defendants, and that it plans to continue its lawsuit against the remaining defendants.
