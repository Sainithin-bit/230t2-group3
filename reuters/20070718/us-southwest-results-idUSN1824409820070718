 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ), the leading U.S. discount carrier, posted a 16.5 percent drop in second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, but the decline was less than expected as demand rebounded in June. 

 Nevertheless, higher fuel costs and sluggish demand throughout most of the quarter took a toll on profit. The company, which has never laid off staff or cut pay, said on Wednesday it had offered buyout packages to more than a quarter of its work force, seeking to lower labor costs. Southwest, which has trimmed its expansion plans to adjust to the tougher market, said second-quarter net profit fell to $278 million, or 36 cents per share, from $333 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding costs and proceeds from the company's fuel hedging program, earnings were 25 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of 22 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. In the quarter, Southwest booked gains of $173 million from its fuel hedging program, which is gradually unwinding, reducing its fuel cost advantage over other carriers. In the same quarter last year, the company had a fuel-hedging gain of $225 million. Second-quarter operating revenue rose 5.5 percent to $2.58 billion, boosted by more flights and higher fares. But a 10 percent rise in operating expenses, led by a 17 percent jump in fuel costs, more than offset the higher revenue. "Although softer revenue trends were consistent throughout the second quarter, demand strengthened somewhat in June," said Chief Executive Gary Kelly, adding he was optimistic going into the third quarter. "Traffic trends and bookings thus far in July are strong," Kelly said. He said the improved demand trends suggested third-quarter revenue per available seat mile would be better than in the second quarter, when it fell 3.4 percent. SLOWED GROWTH Southwest, one of the few U.S. airlines to consistently post profits, is adjusting its strategy in the face of tougher competition and higher fuel and labor costs. The airline agreed with Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) to defer delivery of 21 aircraft to the period 2013 to 2014, from 2009 to 2011. The delay will cut planned capacity growth to between 5 percent and 6 percent, from a previous range of 7 percent to 8 percent, Southwest said. Last month, the largest U.S. airline by market value said it would reduce capacity growth to 6 percent from 8 percent in the fourth quarter and 2008 because of softening travel demand. Besides the slowed expansion, Southwest has said it hopes new business initiatives, which may include premium seating and selling hotel rooms through its Web site, will add more than $1 billion to annual revenue by 2010. Southwest expects these initiatives to put its earnings, which the company says will likely miss its 15 percent growth target in 2007, back on track. "Our 2008 earnings goal will be a minimum of 15 percent earnings per share growth," CEO Kelly said. SWAPPING LABOR The company's buyout offer, which ends August 10, is available to about 8,700 of its 33,000 employees. It consists of a cash payment of $25,000 and continued medical, dental and free travel benefits for limited period of time, Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin said. Southwest said it plans to replace the departing senior employees with cheaper ones. "It's an opportunity to swap out of very high labor rates to entry-level labor rates," Kelly said. Southwest shares, little changed from where they were a year ago, rose 4 cents to $15.63 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Chris Reiter)
