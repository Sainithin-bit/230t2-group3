 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Fashion chain Hennes & Mauritz ( HMb.ST ) saw brisk business during the first two weeks of May, its top executive told a newspaper on Monday. 

 The Swedish company last month posted a fall in sales in April, the first time it had unveiled a monthly decline in overall sales since it began reporting turnover on a monthly basis, but in comments published by Dagens Industri Chief Executive Rolf Eriksen was upbeat about the start of May. "The first two weeks of May have been very satisfactory," Eriksen was quoted as saying by the Swedish business daily. "The analysts like to look at our monthly figures, but one has to look at the whole season," he added. (Reporting by  Niklas Pollard )
