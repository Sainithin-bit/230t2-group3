 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investment firm KSL Capital Partners is one of half a dozen suitors to have submitted initial offers for British fitness club chain Esporta last week, the Sunday Times reported. 

 Esporta is estimated to be worth about 200 million pounds ($394 million), with property valued at a further 250 million, the paper said. Esporta's parent companies went into administration in August as rising interest rates lifted the cost of their 330 million pounds of debt. One source familiar with the situation said in December Duke Street Capital, which sold Esporta to property tycoon Simon Halabi in 2006 for 500 million pounds, was considering buying back the chain. David Lloyd Leisure Group and LA Fitness are also seen as possible buyers, the paper said. (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques ; Editing by  David Holmes )
