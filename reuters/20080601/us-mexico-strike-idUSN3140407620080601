 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Flight attendants at airline Aeromexico agreed on Sunday to a pay and benefits package that avoided a strike at Mexico's largest carrier which could have grounded around 300 aircraft, union sources said. 

 Union members agreed to a 4.5 percent raise, up from the company's offer of 4.25 percent, and also a $20 million savings plan that will cut benefits like parking and dry cleaning payments and subsidized uniforms. Union leaders negotiated into the early hours of Sunday morning to cut a deal, beyond the original 12:01 a.m local time (0501 GMT) strike deadline. Aeromexico, owned by investors headed by Citigroup's local bank Banamex, flies to a dozen cities in the United States and a handful in Europe, Asia and South America. In Mexico, it has more than 20 domestic routes. The nearly 1,500 flight attendants of Aeromexico, which was privatized last year, originally demanded a 5 percent wage increase. At the outset of contract talks, the company wanted to make cost cuts of around $25 million. (Reporting by  Miguel Angel Gutierrez ; Writing by Chris Aspin; Editing by  Eric Beech )
