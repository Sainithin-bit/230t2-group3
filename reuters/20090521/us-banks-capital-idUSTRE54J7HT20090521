 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Regions Financial Corp ( RF.N ) priced a stock offering and Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB.O ) announced plans to follow suit on Wednesday, the eighth and ninth of the 10 large U.S. banks ordered by federal regulators to bolster their finances to announce capital-raising plans. 

 Regions, a Birmingham, Alabama lender operating mainly in the southeast, said it sold $1.85 billion of common stock and preferred shares convertible into common stock. It also said it will exchange 112 million common shares for other preferred securities, less than it previously expected. Fifth Third, a Cincinnati lender operating in the midwest and southeast, said it plans to sell $750 million of common stock and proposed to exchange common stock and cash for existing convertible preferred shares. The banks were among the 19 to undergo government "stress tests" to gauge their ability to weather a deep recession. Ten were told to raise a combined $74.6 billion. Regulators ordered Regions to raise $2.5 billion and Fifth Third $1.1 billion. Fifth Third said it may raise more and may use some proceeds to start repaying $3.4 billion it took from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. Regions took $3.5 billion of TARP money. Among the 10 companies ordered to raise capital, only auto and mortgage finance company GMAC LLC ( GM.N ) has yet to announce a capital raising plan. The Treasury Department is preparing to inject more than $7 billion into GMAC, which could leave the government with a majority stake, the Detroit News and Wall Street Journal said on Wednesday. Treasury declined to comment. GMAC was unavailable for comment. Other lenders that have announced steps to bolster capital in light of the stress tests are Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), PNC Financial Services Group Inc ( PNC.N ), SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ). Regions shares closed down 35 cents at $4.89 in New York, while Fifth Third closed down 10 cents at $7.71 on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Andre Grenon & Ian Geoghegan)
