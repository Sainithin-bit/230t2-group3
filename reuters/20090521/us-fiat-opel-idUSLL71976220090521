 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian industrial group Fiat SpA has more than a 50 percent chance of succeeding with its plan to tie up with Opel, La Stampa said on Thursday, citing Fiat chief executive Sergio Marchionne. 

 "With Opel we have a chance of over 50 percent of doing it," the paper cited him as saying. On Wednesday Fiat submitted an offer for General Motors units Opel and Vauxhall. (Reporting by  Stephen Jewkes ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
