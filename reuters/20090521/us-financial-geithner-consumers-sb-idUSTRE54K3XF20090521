 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration is mulling establishing a new agency to toughen protection for consumers from practices like those that led to the current financial crisis, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Thursday. 

 Testifying before a U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations subcommittee, Geithner said a broad set of proposals should be ready to unveil in a few weeks that will lead to a less risky financial system that is less vulnerable to meltdown, and a consumer agency could be part of that. "We are examining the merits of setting up a new independent commission or agency to help provide stronger rules to protect consumers and better enforcement of those rules," he said in response to a question. "We are not at the point yet ... where we've made a judgment on what precise structure (or) form this should take, how broad its authority should be, how it relates to existing authorities that exist across the agencies now," Geithner said.
