 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The rating of the United States remains AAA and stable, a spokesman for Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday. 

 U.S. stock and bond markets sold off on Thursday on concerns about the risk of the United States losing its top rating after Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook on Britain to negative from stable, indicating the risk of a downgrade. "We put out a credit opinion on May 6 and it (the United States' rating) remains triple-A and stable," Moody's spokesman John Cline said. Moody's said on May 6 that although the U.S. government's financial strength was weakening as a result of interventions to support the financial system and the economy, other factors supporting the rating remain intact.
