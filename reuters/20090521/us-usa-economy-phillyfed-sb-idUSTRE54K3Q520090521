 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic area contracted in May for the eighth consecutive month, a regional Federal Reserve survey released on Thursday showed, but the rate of deterioration slowed slightly. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index came in at minus 22.6 in May versus minus 24.4 in April. Though that was an improvement, it was still weaker than economists' expectations of minus 18.0 and might call into question how quickly the economy is stabilizing from the worst recession in decades. "The issue is, yes, we're moving higher, but we're still far short of what would classify as growth," said Dan Greenhaus, analyst at Miller Tabak & Co, New York. "Only time will tell when stabilization turns into growth, but there are a lot of headwinds facing the sector that are going to prevent that growth from emerging." Stocks remained lower after the data. Government bonds, which benefit from signs of economic weakness, held onto the day's earlier gains. Those headwinds were evident in the new orders index, which declined to minus 25.9 from minus 24.3. However, the deterioration in employment slowed sharply, even though it remained decidedly negative. The employment index came in at minus 26.8 from minus 44.9 in April. The survey covers factories in a region encompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware and is looked at closely as one of the first indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector. A reading below zero indicates contraction in the region's manufacturing sector. (Additional Reporting by Ryan Vlastelica, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
