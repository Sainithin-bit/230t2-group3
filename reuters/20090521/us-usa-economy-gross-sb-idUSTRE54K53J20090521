 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bill Gross, the co-chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said market fears that the U.S. is at risk of losing its AAA credit rating is sending the U.S. dollar, stocks and bonds under severe selling pressure on Thursday. 

 Asked what is driving the market declines, Gross told Reuters via email that investors fear the U.S. is "going the way of the U.K. -- losing AAA rating which affects all financial assets and the dollar." (Reporting by  Jennifer Ablan ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
