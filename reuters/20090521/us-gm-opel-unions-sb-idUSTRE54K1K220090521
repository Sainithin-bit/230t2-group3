 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Labor unions representing workers at German carmaker Opel have prepared an emergency rescue plan in case none of the three bidders for Opel comes up with a winning concept, a German newspaper reported. 

 Buying Opel from troubled U.S. carmaker General Motors (GM) is at the moment a three-way race between Italy's Fiat, Canadian-Austrian car parts group Magna and investment firm RHJ International. "In case the bids for Opel from Fiat, Magna and RHJ would not be sustainable, Opel's employee representatives have prepared an emergency solution," the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) said on its internet website, citing Opel Labor leader Klaus Franz. Franz said the union plan envisages cooperation with Opel dealers, who have voiced their readiness to invest half a billion euros in the carmaker, which employs 50,000 people around Europe. The workers' contribution would be a 1.0 billion euro ($1.38 billion) wage sacrifice, the FAZ said. GM, which is facing a June 1 U.S. government deadline to complete restructuring talks with stakeholders, will decide which investor gets Opel. The German government will also play a role because it would likely provide billions of euros in financing to help any buyer. ($1=.7254 Euro) (Reporting by  Peter Starck ; Editing by Hans Peters)
