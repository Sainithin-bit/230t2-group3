 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, the fourth-largest U.S. bank, on Friday said third-quarter profit fell, hurt by write-downs related to difficult credit market conditions. 

 Net income for the Charlotte, North Carolina-based company fell to $1.69 billion, or 89 cents per share, from $1.88 billion, or $1.17, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs, profit was $1.71 billion, or 90 cents per share. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
