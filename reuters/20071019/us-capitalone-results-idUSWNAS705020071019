 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ), a credit card issuer and banking company, posted a third quarter net loss after taking more than $800 million of charges from shuttering its GreenPoint Mortgage business. 

 Delinquencies on U.S. credit card loans jumped, and the company's shares declined in thin after-hours trading. The company is writing off more loans, particularly in its U.S. credit card business, but that is mainly because write-offs had previously been unusually low, CEO Richard Fairbank said on a conference call. Losses are normalizing rather than indicating serious underlying credit trouble, he added. "What is worsening versus normalization? It's a little bit of an art form," Fairbank said. But he added that Capital One's credit card assets are performing in line with the company's forecasts. Capital One reiterated its full year 2007 earnings forecast. Capital One is seeing little direct impact to its borrowers from the mortgage crisis, the company's chief executive said on a conference call. Investors are closely watching bank results for signs that the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis is spreading to other forms of consumer debt. McLean, Virginia-based Capital One said its third quarter net loss was $81.6 million, or 21 cents a share, compared with a profit of $587.8 million, or $1.89 a share a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a third quarter loss of 25 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The better-than-expected results were driven in part by pricing increases and higher fee income, analysts at Lehman Brothers wrote in a note to investors. The company wrote off a total of $1.03 billion of loans on and off its balance sheet, for a managed loan charge-off rate of 2.86 percent, down from 2.92 percent the same quarter last year. Fairbank said Capital One would likely write down $1.2 billion of loans in the fourth quarter. Total managed loan write-offs in 2008 are expected to be about $4.9 billion, he said. The delinquency rate in its U.S. credit card loans jumped to 4.46 percent on a managed basis, from 3.53 percent in the third quarter of 2006. Higher delinquencies typically imply higher write-offs in the future. The company said that it expects to write off U.S. credit card loans at an annualized 5.25 percent rate in the fourth quarter, compared with a 4.13 percent rate in the third quarter and a 3.39 percent rate in the third quarter of last year. CHARGES Total revenue was $3.774 billion for the quarter, compared with $3.056 billion in the same quarter last year. Capital One said in August it was shutting down its GreenPoint Mortgage wholesale home lending business amid the U.S. housing downturn. Capital One said it recorded a loss of $898 million after tax for discontinued operations related to the GreenPoint shutdown. The company took $883 million of third quarter charges, compared with its prior estimates of $860 million. The company reiterated its full year 2007 earnings forecast of $5.00 a share. Capital One's shares have fallen 14.08 percent this year on credit concerns, while the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index has fallen 12.47 percent. Capital One's shares closed at $66.00 on Thursday, but fell below that in thin post-market trading after the company's earnings were released. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
