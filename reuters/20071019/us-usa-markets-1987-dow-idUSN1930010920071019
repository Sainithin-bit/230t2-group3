 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow Jones industrial average's make up has changed several times since Black Monday on October 19, 1987, when the blue-chip benchmark fell 508 points. 

 Several companies that were constituents in 1987 no longer exist because they have gone out of business, such as Bethlehem Steel, or have been transformed or swallowed up in two decades of restructurings and mergers and acquisition activity, such as Woolworth, Westinghouse Electric, Texaco, Primerica, Union Carbide, Sears Roebuck, and USX. A few others, such as Goodyear Tire, Navistar, International Paper and Eastman Kodak, still exist but have been replaced by the Dow's managers in periodic reshufflings to reflect the changing dynamics of the U.S. economy. Here is how 22 of Dow components that still trade today fared that day (companies no longer in the Dow are denoted with a @): * American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) - down 30.9 percent *@ Goodyear Tire GT.N - down 29.4 percent *@ Eastman Kodak Co. EK.N - down 29.1 percent * Honeywell (then Allied Signal) ( HON.N ) - down 28.4 percent * Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ) - down 28.2 percent * 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) - down 27.9 percent *@ International Paper ( IP.N ) - down 25.1 percent *@ Navistar NAVZ.PK - down 25 percent * Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) - down 24.5 percent * Alcoa Inc.
