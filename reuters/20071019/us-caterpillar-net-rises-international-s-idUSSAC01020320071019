 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), the world's top maker of earth-moving equipment, diesel engines and gas turbines, said on Friday quarterly earnings rose 21 percent as strong sales overseas offset a slump in the U.S. residential construction market. 

 The company reported a third-quarter net profit of $927 million, or $1.40 a share, compared with $769 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent to $11.44 billion. Analysts, on average, expected the Peoria, Illinois-based company to report a profit of $1.43 a share on sales of $10.33 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  James B. Kelleher )
