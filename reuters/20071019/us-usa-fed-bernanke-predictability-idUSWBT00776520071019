 ST LOUIS  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday that being predictable was the cornerstone of running a successful central bank policy. 

 "Predictability is critical in building credibility, it is critical in reducing uncertainty," he told a policy conference in St Louis by satellite link, adding that it was also crucial in making long-term interest rates respond to Fed actions. "My idea of being predictable is to ... provide information to the public ... what our forecast is, how we see the risks ... and how we are going to respond," Bernanke said. Bernanke was speaking from Washington before a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations in which he is to take part. The panel discussion in St Louis was with St Louis Fed President William Poole and former Under Secretary of Treasury for International Affairs John Taylor. The conference was in Poole's honor, before he retires in March.
