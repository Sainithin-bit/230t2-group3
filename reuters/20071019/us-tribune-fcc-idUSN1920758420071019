 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The $8.2 billion deal to take media company Tribune Co. TRB.N private has become entangled in a newly inflamed debate over media ownership rules at the Federal Communications Commission, the Los Angeles Times reported on Friday. 

 Commission Chairman Kevin Martin, a Republican, this week said he wants to resolve by December whether to ease restrictions on how many media properties a company can own in a single market. A decision to approve fewer restrictions would be a win for real estate mogul Sam Zell, whose bid to buy Tribune Co. hinges on gaining approval for Tribune to continue to own both television stations and newspapers in various metropolitan areas. Tribune currently operates both broadcast and newspaper properties under a waiver from existing FCC rules. But FCC Commissioner Michael Copps, a Democrat, on Thursday said Chairman Martin "has indicated he won't grant any waivers pending a vote on major revisions of the commission's media ownership rules," the paper said. ""To say we have to change the media ownership rules so we can get the Tribune deal done does not strike me as ... a good way to make public policy," the paper quoted Copps as saying. Martin is expected to propose an elimination of the ban on owning a newspaper and television station in the same market, the newspaper said. A representative of the FCC could not be reached for comment.
