 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Turbulence in world credit markets illustrates the dangers of globally-linked financial sectors and the need for the International Monetary Fund to sharpen its role as overseer of the world's financial system, IMF Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said on Thursday. 

 With its universal membership, the fund could convene major economic powers for discussions on issues such as how to limit the damage from adjustments in the world's credit markets, Rato said. These are issues that will be in the spotlight at the annual meetings of the fund and World Bank this weekend, he said. The IMF is grappling with tough questions about its position in the world as fewer developing countries turn to the fund for financial rescue. The United States and Europe have pushed for the IMF to sharpen the focus of its surveillance of the global economy, monitoring currency moves and economic imbalances. "I don't think the IMF needs a new role but the IMF has to change to be able to do its role in a changing world," said Rato, who is leaving his IMF post later this month. "Countries both developed and developing are facing new opportunities but also new challenges. Right now in the world we are seeing the challenges of the developed countries and opportunities of emerging economies. It used to be the other way round," he added. That reversal of fortune has complicated the already politically thorny issue of how to divide IMF voting rights among the world's economic superpowers and increasingly influential developing markets such as China and India. Rato said there was growing consensus among IMF member countries on how to reallocate voting shares, though he did not provide any specifics. "Reform is not a sprint, but a long distance run," he said. IMF officials said there would be no agreement at the weekend meetings on how to divide up the current voting structure to reflect the shift in power of emerging economies, with countries haggling over a formula. Instead, there would be further discussions on how to rebalance the voting power. The United States, the fund's biggest and most influential shareholder, has said "fundamental reform" is needed and pledged to forego any increases in its votes. Pressure to boost the influence of developing economies in the IMF has increased with China and India more than ever before leading the global expansion, and industrial countries' growth slowing. Britain said on Thursday it would push at the weekend for a tripling of so-called basic votes for poor countries to ensure their voting power is not diluted by any changes. SLOW GROWTH The IMF expects the current financial turmoil, which began with rising foreclosures in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, will drag on for some time and slow global growth in 2008. In its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook, the IMF ratcheted down its 2008 growth forecast for the United States because of the housing downturn and financial market unrest, and said the global expansion was now firmly led by China, where the economy is expected to grow 10 percent next year. With the strength in emerging markets has come increased scrutiny of how they spend their new-found riches. Rato said the IMF was examining the increasing wealth and power of state-owned investment funds, and stressed the importance of oversight of the notoriously secretive investment vehicles. "I think it is quite legitimate for countries with excess reserves to seek (higher) returns through sovereign wealth funds," Rato said. "Transparency issues are key. Societies have a right to know what is happening with their sovereign wealth funds, (and so does) the rest of the world." Rato said the recent spike in oil prices posed a risk, but the global economy had so far seen few ill effects from four years of rising energy costs. Oil hit a record high above $89 a barrel on Thursday. "Oil prices have been on the rise since 2003, but so far we have seen a limited impact on global activity," he said. Rato said the price increase was largely driven by demand as fast-growing economies clamor for already tight supplies. He also noted that many oil-consuming countries are less energy-intensive than they were during the oil crises of the 1970s, which eases the pain.
