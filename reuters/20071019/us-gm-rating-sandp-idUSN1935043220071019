 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Friday said General Motors Corp's ( GM.N ) ratings are no longer on review for an upgrade, citing serious challenges the automaker will face over the next two years. 

 S&P affirmed GM's rating at "B," five steps below investment grade, with a stable outlook, indicating a rating change is not expected over the next six months to two years. While a new contract with the United Auto Workers union is a substantial positive, the greatest portion of cash benefits will not be seen until 2010, and health care cost savings are subject to court approval, S&P said in a statement. "Until then, GM could continue to use substantial cash in its automotive operations," S&P said. The potential for a recession could cause GM to burn cash, and even without a recession, the outlook for U.S. light-vehicle sales next year is weak, S&P said. Moody's Investors Service earlier this week changed GM's outlook to positive from negative on Tuesday, signaling the chance of an upgrade within 12 to 18 months. Moody's cited the substantial long-term cost benefits of the new union contract for the positive outlook. It rates GM "B3," six steps below investment grade. GM'S 8.375 percent notes due in 2033 fell to 89.5 cents on the dollar on Friday, down from 91 cents on Thursday, according to MarketAxess.
