 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Total ( TOTF.PA ) may be forced at times to temporarily shut down units at its Port Arthur, Texas, refinery to handle containment issues following damage to a product transfer pipeline, the company said in a filing with Texas environmental regulators. 

 "The filing is correct, but the refinery is running," a Total spokeswoman said, adding the company did not comment on operating rates. The product transfer pipeline was damaged on Thursday when a nearby ethylene pipeline belonging to Dow Chemical ( DOW.N ) exploded, the company said it its filing.
