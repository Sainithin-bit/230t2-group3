 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Friday he declared his desire for a strong U.S. dollar to his Group of Seven counterparts, and they reached a "real affirmation" that currency values should be determined in open markets. 

 "I was very clear -- and it didn't surprise anyone because I've always been clear on this with my colleagues -- that I believe a strong dollar is in our nation's interest and believe that currency values should be determined based upon underlying economic fundamentals in a competitive marketplace," Paulson told a news conference. He said there was a "clear consensus" regarding currencies reflected in the G7 communique, which urged China to allow the value of its yuan to rise more quickly.
