 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ), the world's biggest supplier of office printers, copiers and related services, on Friday posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings, boosted by solid gains in equipment sales. 

 Third-quarter net income was trimmed in half to $254 million, or 27 cents a share, from $536 million, or 54 cents a share a year earlier when the company benefited from a tax gain. Analysts had expected a profit of 26 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Xerox, which has bet on introducing color printers along with lucrative long-term supply and service deals, said revenue rose 12 percent to $4.30 billion, beating analysts view of $4.24 billion. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company said its equipment sales in the period were up 14 percent over the prior year, including a 2 point benefit from the weaker dollar.
