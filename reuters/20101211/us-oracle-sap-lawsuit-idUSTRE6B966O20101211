 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp is seeking another $211 million from SAP AG on top of the $1.3 billion jury verdict it won last month after a widely watched copyright infringement trial. 

 Oracle wants an additional $211,662,935 in "prejudgment interest" due to the company, according to a court document it filed on Friday. Both parties have already agreed that SAP will pay Oracle $120 million in attorney's fees, the filing added. But the two sides could not agree on whether the final judgment in the case should provide for prejudgment interest, and if so, in what amount, according to the filing. "We don't believe that Oracle is entitled to any additional compensation beyond the final judgment in this case," SAP said in a statement on Friday. Prejudgment interest is intended to compensate for the loss of the use of funds and account for the effects of inflation after a party suffers economic damages, (Reporting by Dan Levine)
