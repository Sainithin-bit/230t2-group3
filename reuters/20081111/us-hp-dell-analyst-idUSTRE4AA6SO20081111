 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The shares of major PC and chipmakers traded lower Tuesday as a number of analysts, concerned about the weakening global economy and slack demand, lowered their earnings estimates. 

 Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) and Dell Inc DELL.O shares dipped after Barclays Capital analyst Ben Reitzes cut his forecasts for the rival computer makers. Analysts also reduced their expectations for chipmakers Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ). Reitzes said in a note that HP is better positioned than Dell and will benefit from PC and server share gains from its chief competitor. Reitzes lowered HP's fiscal 2009 earnings estimate to $3.80 a share from $4.08 and its 2010 estimate to $4.25 a share from $4.65. The average analyst estimate for 2009 is $4.05 and for 2010 is $4.58, according to Reuters Estimates. He expects HP to be hurt by slackening PC and server demand, as well as a shift toward netbooks that the company was slow to recognize, but benefit from cost savings from its acquisition of EDS. Reitzes took Dell's fiscal 2009 estimate to $1.30 a share from $1.37 and slashed his 2010 forecast to $1.18 a share from $1.38. The average analyst estimate is $1.41 for 2009 and $1.56 for 2010, according to Reuters Estimates. "We continue to have concerns about Dell's business model in a weak economy. Checks point toward significant share losses, negative mix and financing risks," Reitzes said. Dell is slated to release fiscal third-quarter results a week from Thursday and HP will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on November 20. The technology industry is feeling the brunt of the economic slowdown. With consumers and business around the world tightening their belts, IT budgets are contracting and new technology purchases are being canceled. FBR Capital Markets cut earnings estimates on Intel, the world's largest chipmaker and rival AMD, citing weak PC demand. Analysts from Barclays and Piper Jaffray also lowered expectations for Intel. Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel's shares were trading down 67 cents, or 4.6 percent, at $13.69, while Sunnyvale, Calif.- based AMD's shares lost 14 cents, or 4.3 percent, to $2.90. The shares of Round Rock, Texas-based Dell fell 79 cents, or 6.7 percent, to $11.07 and the shares of Palo Alto, Calif.-based HP dropped $1.39, or 4 percent, to $32.78 in afternoon trading.
