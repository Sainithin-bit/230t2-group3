 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) fell nearly 4 percent to $68.50 before the bell on Tuesday after Fox-Pitt joined a growing list of brokerages forecasting a fourth-quarter loss for the U.S. bank. 

 Fox-Pitt also slashed its price target on the stock to $120 from $165. Seperately, Sanford C Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz said Goldman Sachs could face $300 million to $700 million of litigation costs tied to CDOs, securities backed by a pool of bonds, loans and other assets.
