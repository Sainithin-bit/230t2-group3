 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) warned that fiscal-year profit would be well below Wall Street forecasts because of the economic downturn and the impact of the stronger U.S. dollar, sending the industrial conglomerate's shares down 14.6 percent. 

 The outlook on Tuesday came as Tyco reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on strong pricing in its electrical and metal products segment and increased demand for its valves and temperature controls. The company said commercial markets were slowing in its ADT security business, the stronger U.S. dollar would hurt its flow control division, and tighter government budgets would affect spending on its safety products. While Tyco said results were hard to predict, it forecast earnings of $2.20 to $2.50 per share from continuing operations for the year, which began on September 27. Analysts, who had recently cut their profit outlooks, were expecting $3.02, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales from existing businesses will be flat to down 4 percent for the year, Tyco said. Morgan Stanley analyst Scott Davis said nearly all of Tyco's businesses face macroeconomic challenges, and ADT may start losing commercial customers at a faster pace. "Tyco is one of only five out of 30 industrial names that we continue to rate overweight but as today's trading shows, there is pretty much nowhere to hide," Davis said in a note to clients. "However, Tyco is one of the first names in the space to set realistic guidance and it remains one of the few stocks in our coverage universe that can buy back stock." The company added that restructuring benefits, a lower tax rate and fewer shares outstanding would support 2009 earnings as operating units focus on controlling costs and maintaining pricing. It said that it would continue to look for acquisitions, but would be more cautious about share buybacks until credit markets stabilize. EARNINGS TOP FORECASTS Earlier on Tuesday, the company reported net earnings more than doubled to $434 million, or 91 cents per share, in the fourth quarter that ended September 26, from $181 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding restructuring costs and other special items, were 81 cents per share. On that basis, analysts expected 73 cents. Revenue rose 7 percent to $5.28 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts of $5.31 billion. Tyco's flow control segment reported a 24 percent jump in quarterly profit, led by demand for valves and thermal controls. Profit almost doubled in the electrical and metal, or E&M, business, whose products include tubes, pipes and wiring components, amid strong pricing. Profit was down at ADT, Tyco's biggest business, in part because of weak demand from retailers in the United States and Europe. The company's shares were down $3.70, or 14.6 percent, at $21.64 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading, and helped drag down other industrial stocks. The Standard & Poor's industrials index .GSPI was down 4 percent at 204.47. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Matthew Lewis )
