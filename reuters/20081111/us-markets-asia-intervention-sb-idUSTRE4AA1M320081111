 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Asian authorities spent billions of dollars to defend their currencies during October's market rout, with some success in avoiding a crisis, but they are now likely to rein in such heavy handed intervention as the global financial storm shifts course. 

 Asian policy makers are likely to favor some currency depreciation to try to keep their exports moving as worldwide demand deteriorates and governments and central banks focus on ways to support economic growth. But equally, a fall in worldwide demand will undermine the currencies anyway, especially of those countries that rely heavily on exports for economic growth, analysts say. "They have to be aware that the external market is slowing down -- they probably want to have a little bit of external competitiveness," said Dwyfor Evans, currency strategist at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong. "There may be some scope for central banks to try at least to smooth out the volatility, but I think they know that they are fighting against a losing trend," Evans said. "There is no point in throwing good money after bad." The IMF has forecast that developed economies, including the United States, the euro zone, Japan and Britain, will shrink in 2009 for the first time in half a century, which would threaten the exports that provide the mainstay for most Asian economies. Currencies of economies most heavily reliant on trade are likely to slide the most in the months ahead, including the Singapore dollar, Taiwan dollar, Malaysian ringgit and Thai baht, said Callum Henderson, a currency strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore. Standard Chartered expects these currencies to fall 4 percent against the dollar by the end of June 2009. So far this year the Singapore dollar has already fallen 4 percent, the Taiwan dollar just over 1 percent, the ringgit 7.6 percent and the baht 3.5 percent. For the South Korean won and the India rupee, which were Asia's hardest-hit currencies in October when investors sold off emerging markets, the worst may be over for this year, analysts said. Still, Asian currencies will remain vulnerable. "Volatility may fall, but I don't necessarily think these currencies are out of the wood yet," Evans said. BIG SPENDERS Foreign exchange reserves in Asia, excluding China, shrank by $119 billion, or 5 percent, in October, five times the amount that they fell in September, central bank data shows. Analysts say the fall illustrated the extent of the intervention to prevent the sell off in regional currencies from turning into a fully fledged rout of the sort seen in the Asian financial crisis a decade ago. Despite the big spending, currencies fell heavily. The Korean won, for example, dropped 5.4 percent during the month when the country's reserves dropped $27.4 billion, or 11.4 percent. The currency's volatility was much greater, however, with a 21 percent swing between it's high and low during the month. The Indian rupee fell 5 percent as the reserves plunged $38.9 billion, or 13.3 percent. Investors globally sold off emerging markets in October to repatriate cash and limit their exposure to riskier assets. Asian central banks excluding China are armed with about $2.34 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. Add in China and the pot increases to more than $4 trillion, almost the same size as the annual economic output of Japan, the world's second-biggest economy. The huge reserves were built up in response to the 1997/98 Asian crisis, when capital flight brought several economies to their knees. The policy had until early last year been criticized by the West for fuelling global economic imbalances and inflation. "But it is now evident that for almost all the region's economies those handy reserves have allowed countries to avoid a potential balance-of-payments meltdown, especially as the flow of capital has reversed so sharply in the past few months," Standard & Poor's Asia-Pacific chief economist Subir Gokarn said in a report last week. WAY TO GO Economic growth for developing Asia could fall by 1.5 percentage points this year from last year's record 9 percent pace and a further 0.5-1.0 percentage point in 2009, Haruhiko Kuroda, president of Asian Development Bank, said last week. As the dark clouds gather, Asian central banks, including those in China, India, South Korean and Taiwan, have joined a global drive to ease monetary policy to spur growth. "As inflation comes down, it makes sense that Asian central banks will focus more on supporting growth overall - including exports," said Henderson. "That means that Asian currencies still have quite some way to go," he said. Normally, a rate cut would be expected to undermine a currency because it reduces returns on deposits. But some currencies, such as the Taiwan dollar and South Korean won, rose following a series of rate cuts by their central banks in expectation that lower borrowing costs could help support growth. But such gains will be limited in the face of the expected global downturn in coming years. "As long as the market continues to doubt growth prospects into 2009-10, the rate cuts are probably not going to raise confidence significantly," said Han Sia Yeo, a currency strategist at Bank of America in Singapore.
