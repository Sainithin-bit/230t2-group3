 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc ( TJX.N ) reported lower quarterly profit and trimmed its outlook as even bargain hunters at its off-price stores cut back amid a weak economy and global financial meltdown, sending the company's shares down 5 percent. 

 TJX, whose retail chains include T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright, said on Tuesday net profit fell to $235.8 million in the third quarter ended October 25, from $249.5 million a year earlier, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding one-time items, primarily the impact of foreign exchange, profit from continuing operations was 54 cents per share, meeting analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 2 percent to $4.8 billion. Consolidated comparable-store sales, a key retail metric, fell 1 percent, but were up 1 percent excluding the impact of foreign exchange. "We are extremely focused on buying right and running with leaner-than-usual inventory levels, which has led to faster inventory turns and strong merchandise margins," Chief Executive Carol Meyrowitz said. TJX is "seeing extremely advantageous real estate deals coming our way" as weaker retail competitors such as Mervyns and Boscov's close stores or go out of business, he added. For the year, TJX said it expects adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.11 to $2.15, including an expected benefit of 9 cents per share from an extra week in the fiscal year compared with the previous year. It expects same-store sales to rise 1 percent. In August, the company forecast $2.26 to $2.31 per share. For the fourth quarter, TJX forecast adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 68 cents to 72 cents per share, including the benefit of the extra week. Analysts' average forecast is 72 cents. It forecast same-store sales would be flat to down 2 percent, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. TJX, which buys excess merchandise at below-wholesale prices and sells it at prices that can be up to 60 percent less than department stores and specialty retailers, has benefited as consumers seek discounts amid higher food costs and uncertain job security. Amid the global financial crisis, even discount retailers have felt pinched as consumers worry about falling housing values and the credit crunch cuts spending. TJX shares were down $1.19 to $22.51 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Sarah Coffey , editing by Maureen Bavdek and John Wallace)
