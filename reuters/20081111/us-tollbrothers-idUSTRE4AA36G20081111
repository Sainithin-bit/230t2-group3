 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ), the largest U.S. luxury home builder, said on Tuesday it expected to report a 41 percent drop in fourth-quarter home-building revenue, sending its shares down as much as 6 percent. 

 The chief executive of the company also called for the government to focus its attention on the housing market, calling it the root of the current financial crisis, for the sake of the entire economy. "I hope that the government realizes the scale and urgency of the problem," Robert Toll said during the company's conference call. "We certainly need new tunnels and bridges, but they will be bridges to nowhere if they lead to places where there are empty homes." Toll Brothers said preliminary results for the quarter ended October 31 showed total consolidated home-building revenue of about $691.0 million, down from $1.17 billion a year earlier. "Unfortunately, the preliminary signs of stability we had discussed in early September during our third-quarter earnings call were upended by the past month's financial crisis," Toll said. "Results of this crisis include accelerating fears of job loss, a large decline in consumer spending, a significant capital crunch, increased credit market disruption, and plummeting stock market values," Toll added. Fourth-quarter net contracts are expected to fall 27 percent to $266.7 million, while fourth-quarter cancellations totaled 233, the company said. "At this stage there is little doubt that a weakening economy represents a significant threat to homebuilding demand, even at the historically low levels that it has already reached," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Nishu Sood in a note to clients. The builder said it will release fourth-quarter results on December 4. Toll's shares closed down about 0.1 percent at $18.93 on the New York Stock Exchange.
