 (Reuters) - Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone forecast a fourth-quarter loss at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and said he expected the bank's principal investment portfolio to experience an unusually large markdown to reflect the dramatic slide in global equity values. 

 In the past one week, analysts across the board, from brokerages like Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan Securities and Barclays Capital have said they expect Goldman Sachs to post a fourth-quarter loss. Fox-Pitt's Trone forecast a fourth-quarter loss of $1.55 per share for Goldman. He earlier expected a profit of $2.59 per share. He also cut his 2009 EPS estimate to $9.08 from $12.15, "reflecting the lingering of the crisis of confidence within global capital markets." Trone said he expects the principal investment portfolio to be marked down by $2.7 billion and credit-asset gross write-downs of about $2 billion. "We do not expect Goldman to take material writedowns for AIG ( AIG.N ), as management said AIG posted collateral and where there were disputes, Goldman hedged the difference," Trone said in a note to clients. Should the company weather the near-term storm, it may fare better than what many expect in the long-run, the analyst added. Shares of Goldman Sachs fell 2.4 percent to $69.44 before the bell Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Arup Roychoudhury  in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)
