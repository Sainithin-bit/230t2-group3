 LONDON  (Reuters) - After a number of false dawns which betrayed investors over the past year, equity and other risky asset markets may finally be shaping up to convince long-term money managers of unprecedented buying opportunities. 

 Having lost a third of their value, world stocks have rallied in the past few weeks thanks to an aggressive round of official interest rate cuts and government measures to calm markets. The MSCI world equity index rose 23 percent last week from October's five-year troughs, oddly qualifying for a bull market -- a rise of 20 percent from a cycle low. While the common feeling is far from bullish and the global economy will no doubt endure a sharp slowdown from here, signs emerging in various corners suggest markets for risky assets will price in a recovery months before the economy starts to trend higher. Morgan Stanley's market indicators -- valuation, capitulation, risk and fundamentals -- now give a "full house" buy signal for European stocks for the first time since 2002. Valuations on the S&P 500 index, based on price to earnings ratio, are below lows reached after Black Monday in 1987 while U.S. dividend yields are approaching U.S. Treasury yields. Interbank lending rates in most major currencies are starting to ease at last, reflecting glimmers of confidence returning to the banking system. "This is the start of a recovery. Although we do assume a late December/January setback, we probably will not have a reversal which will take us back to mid-October lows," said Bob Parker, vice chairman of Credit Suisse's asset management arm. "Every time we have a period of weakness, we should use it as a buying opportunity." Credit Suisse has bought large-cap defensive and underleveraged stocks in G3 countries and closed short positions to go flat on commodities. "We think developed equity markets from here will go up 5-10 percent ... For long-term investors, the intelligent answer is to average into markets over the next 6 months," Parker said. Credit Suisse says the P/E ratio on trend earnings, at 12.6, is some 10 percent below the December 1987 and October 1990 troughs. Barclays calculates that equity markets tend to trough after government interventions in financial crises, rising 54 percent on average in the subsequent year, and underperforming crisis sectors become outperforming recovery sectors. The adjustment of dividend yields and the U.S. Treasury yield also illustrates how attractive stocks have become. BNP Paribas says the S&P 500 dividend yield -- a measure of how much cash flow an investor gets from investing in stocks -- has risen close to 3.5 percent, approaching the 3.7 percent yield offered by 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds. It says the difference between dividend yields and bond yields have adjusted at a pace not seen since 1982 and 1932 and in both cases equity markets rallied significantly. However, some caution against using dividend yields as a sole signal given doubts over firms' ability to pay dividends. LOW MORALE = STRONG RALLY History shows the highest equity returns have tended to come in the aftermath of episodes when confidence was very low. Looking at the Institute for Supply Management index, the subsequent 12-month return for the S&P 500 index when the ISM was below 40 was 26 percent, compared with minus 13 percent when the ISM was above 65, according to Goldman Sach's analysis. The ISM's manufacturing index hit 38.9 in October. "The turning point in the equity market will be earlier than the turning point in the economy (and the difference is) normally 6 months," said Klaus Wiener, head of research at Generali Investments in Cologne. He added several signposts investors should monitor for signs of a recovery included house prices, corporate spreads, emerging market performance and interbank money market rates. THAW IN MONEY, CREDIT MARKETS When the credit crisis first erupted in August 2007, world stocks ignored tensions in the money market and went on to hit record highs a few months later. Stocks eventually turned their focus to money markets among other worries. Now there is a renewed disconnect as money markets are unfreezing steadily. Interbank lending rates for three-month dollar loans fell to a four-year low of 2.175 percent on Tuesday and rates for other currencies also eased, thanks to interest rate cuts and measures to help funding circulate through the markets. The closely-watched gap between dollar market interest rates and expected central bank interest rates hit 170 basis points, its narrowest since late September. This gap widened as far as 365 bps in October, compared with levels around 10 bps before the crisis. The risky credit sector is also showing tentative signs of recovery. In the first 6 calendar days of November, Barclays' data show agency debt produced 23 bps of extra return over U.S. Treasuries with the same duration profile. Asset-backed securities gave 28 bps of excess return. Mortgage-backed securities gave 83 bps and investment grade corporates 80 bps. However, high-yield debt and commercial MBS had excess losses over Treasuries of 43 bps and 161 bps respectively, showing the recovery is hardly universal. Barclays overweighted U.S. municipal debt in October and has reversed a 4-1/2 month short in investment grade credit by moving to a 10 percent overweight. It is also considering halving an underweight position on high yield and emerging debt to 25 percent. "This time, something positive's happening. Slowly, very slowly, the worst of the market gales are subsiding," the bank said in a note to clients. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
