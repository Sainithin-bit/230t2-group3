 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reckson Associates Realty Corp. RA.N, a New York area office landlord, on Friday again asked a group formed by billionaire Carl Icahn and real estate magnate Harry Macklowe for additional information concerning their proposed plan to buy Reckson. 

 Reckson said in a statement that it has not received any documentation about the debt financing the group, Rome Acquisition L.P., intends to use. The group recently added as a third partner Mack-Cali Realty Corp.( CLI.N ), a real estate investment trust that owns office buildings primarily in New Jersey and New York's Westchester County. The Rome group has offered to buy Reckson for $49 per share, or roughly $4.6 billion. Reckson's board has already approved a stock-and-cash takeover offer from New York office owner SL Green Realty Corp.( SLG.N ) worth $45.69 per share, or $3.98 billion based on SL Green's share price on Friday afternoon of $134.87. Reckson's shareholders are scheduled to vote on SL Green's offer on December 6. Mack-Cali intends to contribute $400 million in cash to the deal and finance that through a term loan from JP Morgan Chase Bank, good for up to $350 million, according to a filing on Friday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. So far, Mack-Cali has drawn $150 million from the term loan and $250 million from its existing revolving credit for its contribution, it said in the filing. Reckson has scheduled a board meeting for Friday night to review any debt information that Rome can provide, and will meet again on Sunday to review the whole package. Rome has said it would submit a definitive bid by Monday. (Additional reporting by  Mark McSherry )
