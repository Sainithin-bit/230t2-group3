 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warner Music Group Corp WMG.N on Friday posted disappointing operating results and said it saw substantial pressure on operating income in the current quarter, and shares slid as much as 3 percent. 

 Warner Music's first quarter coincides with the crucial holiday music sales season but the company suggested it is unlikely to replicate the year ago performance when it said outperformed expectations, when sales were driven by Madonna and Enya. "We will face even tougher comparisons in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 than the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006," Chief Financial Officer Michael Fleischer told analysts during a conference call. The company swung to a fourth-quarter profit of $12 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $30 million, a 21 cents. But excluding a $13 million gain from its litigation against online music service Kazaa, the company posted a loss of 1 cent per share compared with an average Wall Street analyst consensus of break-even. Strong sales of artists including Red Hot Chili Peppers, Gnarls Barkley and Panic At The Disco were not enough to prevent a 5.6 percent fall in fourth-quarter revenue to $854 million from a year ago when sales were driven by Green Day, Faith Hill and James Blunt. Warner Music, the world's fourth largest music company, said sales in the quarter were down compared with a year ago due to a relatively weaker album release schedule and broader weakness in the recorded music and music publishing businesses. The music industry has been struggling in recent years with falling sales of CDs due to what it calls the proliferation of online piracy and competition from other forms of entertainment such as video games and DVDs. Warner's digital music sales music nearly doubled to $104 million both in online downloads and mobile phone music sales and now accounts for 12.2 percent of total revenue. Warner Music chief executive Edgar Bronfman told analysts on Friday that the gains in digital recorded music revenue overshadowed falling sales of CDs and reiterated his company's plans to roll out a new format called DVD Albums at the start of the year. DVD Albums will include more additional features, such as ringtones, photos and video clips, than existing formats. Both Bronfman and Fleischer said the company will see tougher comparisons on both revenue and operating income before depreciation and amortization in the first quarter of fiscal year 2007 compared with a year ago. "We expect to see substantial pressure on our OIBDA line in the first quarter of fiscal 07," said Fleischer. Warner Music shares fell 2.9 percent in mid morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange to $24.70. Warner Music has been the subject of merger talks and speculation for the last year culminating in counter-bids with No.3 music company EMI Group EMI.L. But those talks were put on hold after European regulators decided to revisit the Sony Music and BMG Entertainment 2004. Bishop Sheen analyst at Wachovia said he didn't see any major merger and acquisition activity in the near-term but would benefit from the positive digital growth. "Now Edgar's tasked with growing the company the hard way -- with small but meaningful acquisitions."
