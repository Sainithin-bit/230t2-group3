 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Clothing maker Kellwood Co. KWD.N said on Friday that quarterly profit fell by 50 percent, hurt by restructuring charges. 

 Excluding the charges and other unusual items, the results beat Wall Street expectations, and the stock edged up nearly 4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Net earnings fell to $8.1 million, or 31 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter ended October 28, from $16.2 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. The results in the latest period include restructuring and other charges totaling $12.1 million, or 47 cents per share. Excluding one-time items and results from discontinued operations, earnings were $17.6 million, or 68 cents per share, up from $15.3 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. On that basis, the results were above the company's lowered forecast of 64 cents per share, which it gave on November 8. Analysts, on average, expected 63 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales slipped to $516.4 million from $520 million. Kellwood, which makes clothing under names including Calvin Klein, Sag Harbor and Baby Phat, has been trying to add more upscale, high-profile brands while selling off other labels. In recent months, it has announced plans to sell its unit that makes Polo and Ralph Lauren belts, buy women's sportswear brand Vince, and extend a license for Calvin Klein sportswear. "As we begin the holiday 2006 retail season, we are encouraged," Robert Skinner, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. For the fourth quarter, Kellwood said it expects net earnings from ongoing operations of $11 million, or 43 cents per share, up from $6.2 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales are expected to rise slightly to about $450 million. Analysts, on average, expected 43 cents. The stock, which is up more than 30 percent in the year-to-date, rose $1.21 to $32.46 in afternoon NYSE trade.
