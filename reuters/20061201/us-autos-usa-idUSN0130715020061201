 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) dropped from second to fourth in U.S. auto sales in November as they slid a steeper-than-expected 10 percent, while Toyota Motor Corp.'s ( 7203.T ) sales surged 16 percent to put it in the No. 2 spot. 

 Ford sold fewer cars and light trucks in November than DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, according to data released on Friday, and it also slashed its planned production. Larger rival General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) reported 6 percent sales growth, while Chrysler Group posted a 3 percent rise, breaking a nine-month losing streak. Nissan Motor Co.'s ( 7201.T ) sales fell almost 2 percent, Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd.'s ( 005380.KS ) sales were down almost 15 percent, while Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s ( 7267.T ) sales were up almost 1 percent. Toyota, the world's No. 2 automaker by output, outsold Ford by more than 14,000 units in November to take the No. 2 U.S. spot based on monthly sales for the second time this year. Many analysts expect Toyota to keep that ranking on a more permanent basis in 2007 as Ford's market share slips further. "We're focused on returning our business to profitability in North America, full stop," Ford Chief Internal Sales analyst George Pipas said, when asked about its drop in the rankings. "I wouldn't want to comment on sales rankings ... It's just not that important right now." November marked the first time since 2002 that Ford slipped to No. 4 in sales, mostly because of lower sales incentives, said Alex Rosten, industry analyst with Edmunds.com. "They didn't launch their incentive program until mid-month," Rosten added. "GM and Dodge were definitely more aggressive in incentive spending on trucks and SUVs." Ford said its car sales were down 3 percent, mostly due to lower demand from fleet customers, while truck sales were off 13 percent. Showroom sales fell 7 percent, which Pipas called "disappointing." "We had our sights set higher," he said. Ford cut planned fourth-quarter production further by 15,000 units to 620,000 vehicles, down 22 percent from a year ago. It expects first-quarter 2007 production to be down 14 percent to 750,000. Ford had said earlier production in the first half of 2007 would be 8 percent to 12 percent lower. GM SAYS LARGE SUVS, TRUCKS STABLE GM set its first-quarter production target 9 percent lower than a year ago at 1.4 million vehicles. Despite weaker industry-wide auto sales in recent months, GM's chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew, said the automaker still expected 2007 sales to hold flat from this year's total with sales of trucks and large SUVs holding steady. GM reduced sales to corporate fleet customers, including car rental companies, by 7 percent. But November retail sales were up 11 percent, and Ballew said the automaker was on track to hit its 2006 showroom sales goal of 3 million units. GM, like other U.S. automakers, was hurt earlier this year when Americans stopped buying high-margin trucks and SUVs in the face of higher fuel prices. But Ballew said he expected sales of truck-based vehicles, including crossovers, would stabilize at about 53 percent of the overall tally, near where it was in November and up from about 50 percent earlier this year when gas prices spiked. GM and Ford have both launched year-end incentives to boost demand, but both cut incentive spending in November. Chrysler raised its discount offerings slightly in November to an industry-leading average of $4,224 per vehicle, according to an analysis by Edmunds.com, while Ford spent $3,326 in incentives per vehicle and GM spent $2,539 per vehicle.
