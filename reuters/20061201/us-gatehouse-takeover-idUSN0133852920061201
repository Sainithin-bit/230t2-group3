 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Newspaper publisher GateHouse Media Inc. GHS.N said on Friday it will buy seven newspapers in Massachusetts from Journal Register Co. JRC.N for $70 million. 

 The deal includes two daily and three weekly newspapers as well as two advertising "shoppers." The daily papers are The Herald News in Fall River and the Taunton Daily Gazette. The companies expect the deal, which includes about $70 million in cash and $2 million in estimated working capital, to close by the end of the year. Journal Register expects to record a pretax gain on the sale of about $46 million. It expects after-tax cash proceeds to be about $50 million, which it would use to pay down debt. The deal, if completed, would value the bundle of papers at 9.2 times the past 12 months' earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), Chief Executive Robert Jelenic told Reuters in an interview. The publisher, based in Yardley, Pennsylvania, continues to review the potential sale of other properties in Rhode Island. Jelenic said the company could strike a deal within weeks. He declined to provide other details on interested parties. He added that the publisher is keeping its options open on expanding into other clusters, but that "we're more likely to add to our existing clusters than start a new one." Journal Register publishes papers in compact geographical areas in the Philadelphia area, Michigan, Connecticut and other states. Its stock has fallen more than 45 percent since the beginning of the year as it and other newspaper publishers grapple with weak advertising trends and falling circulation brought on in part by a migration of readers to the Internet. The stock had fallen more than 63 percent when it hit its year-low in October, but rebounded after Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock on the company's news that key operations were showing improvement. GateHouse went public on the New York Stock Exchange in October after being held by private equity firms for several years. Its shares rose 20 percent on their first day of trading. The company produces 415 community publications in 18 U.S. states, including newspapers mostly located in smaller towns. A spokeswoman for GateHouse did not return a telephone call seeking comment. Journal Register shares rose 21 cents, or 2.7 percent, to close at $7.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. GateHouse shares fell 2 cents, or 1 percent, to $20.91 on the NYSE.
