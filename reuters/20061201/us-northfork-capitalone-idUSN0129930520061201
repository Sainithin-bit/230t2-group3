 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ) said on Friday it completed its $13.2 billion purchase of North Fork Bancorp Inc., becoming the 11th-largest U.S. banking company and third-largest retail bank by deposits in the New York metropolitan area. 

 The stock-and-cash purchase gives McLean, Virginia-based Capital One, the largest independent U.S. credit card issuer, an additional $58.9 billion of assets and $36.5 billion of deposits. It also adds more than 350 branches, giving it 693 in five U.S. states. Capital One paid $7.9 billion in stock and $5.2 billion in cash for North Fork, and swapped North Fork stock options for Capital One options valued at $100 million. North Fork, based in Melville, New York, was valued at $14.6 billion when the merger was announced in March. The value fell because Capital One shares have since declined 13 percent. The transaction remains the second-largest U.S. bank merger this year, after Wachovia Corp.'s WB.N $24.3 billion purchase of Golden West Financial Corp. Adding North Fork will help Capital One lower its dependence on credit cards, add low-cost deposits and offer more services. Richard Fairbank, Capital One's chief executive, began to move into retail banking last year when he agreed to pay about $5 billion for New Orleans-based Hibernia Corp., adding more than 300 branches in Louisiana and Texas. John Adam Kanas, who was North Fork's chairman and chief executive, will become president of Capital One's banking business, and join the company's board of directors. The North Fork name will disappear from bank branches. JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) have the biggest share of deposits in the New York area, FDIC data show. On Friday, Standard & Poor's raised Capital One's credit rating one notch to "BBB-plus," its third-lowest investment grade, from "BBB," citing an improving risk profile. Moody's Investors Service on Tuesday raised Capital One's senior debt rating one notch to "A3," its fourth-lowest investment grade, from "Baa1." Capital One stock fell 15 cents to $77.73 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
