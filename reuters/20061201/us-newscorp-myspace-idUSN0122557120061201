 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp.'s MySpace.com is in talks to bring the social-networking site to China with Boston technology trade publisher International Data Group's Chinese venture arm and former China Netcom Group Corp. Chief Executive Edward Tian, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Friday. 

 Citing people people close to the situation, the WSJ said that News Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch's wife, Wendi Deng, is likely to join the board of MySpace China. Although News Corp. has publicly announced its intention to expand MySpace into China, people close to the matter say no deal has been completed yet, the paper said. But MySpace, a Web site that lets users post their own videos, pictures and blogs online, could face stiff competition and regulatory hurdles in China, the paper said, as other big U.S. Internet players have struggled to topple local rivals in China.
