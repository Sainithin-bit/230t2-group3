 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Costume jewelry retailer Claire's 
Stores Inc.CLE.N is seeking a private-equity buyer and has 
hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise the company, according 
to a report by Bloomberg news agency on Thursday. 

  The report, based on three anonymous sources, said that the 
mall-based retailer is in the early stages of a search and may 
yet decide against a sale.  Pembroke Pines, Florida-based Claire's did not return a 
telephone call seeking comment.  Analysts have said that the company has strong free cash 
flow but is facing soft sales in Europe and a shift to 
lower-priced accessories.  In a research note published on Monday, Brean Murray, 
Carret analyst Eric Beder said he believed that a recent share 
rise -- shares have risen 14 percent since November 1 -- was 
due to "unsubstantiated" rumors of a buyout.
