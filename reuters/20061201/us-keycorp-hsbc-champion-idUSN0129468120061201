 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), a large Midwest U.S. bank, on Friday said it agreed to sell its Champion Mortgage subprime lending unit to Britain's HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) HBC.N and investment firm Fortress Investment Group LLC, so it can focus on consumer and business banking. 

 Terms were not disclosed. A unit of HSBC Finance Corp. acquired Champion's $2.5 billion loan portfolio, which contains mortgages of about 30,000 customers, while Fortress will buy Champion's origination platform. "Champion's loan portfolio is a very good fit for HSBC's consumer lending business," said Tom Detelich, president of HSBC Finance's consumer lending unit. The unit has 1,350 branches in 46 U.S. states, and operates under the HFC and Beneficial names. Many U.S. companies are selling subprime units, which lend to less credit-worthy borrowers, as a housing slowdown, intense competition and rising defaults make it tougher to profit. Analyst Gary Townsend at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. estimated the purchase price for Champion at $130 million, below the $200 million to $250 million he had expected. Cleveland-based KeyCorp expects to take a fourth-quarter charge of $164 million, or 40 cents per share, because it is writing off $170 million of goodwill. It expects another $25 million to $30 million of pretax charges in 2007. KeyCorp paid about $200 million for Champion in 1997. "Key accomplished what it was trying to do," said Kevin Timmons, an analyst at C.L. King & Associates. "I'm sure people would have rather seen Key record a profit, but this reflects market conditions. Mortgage originations are soft, and there is a perception that subprime loans are getting riskier." KeyCorp said it sold the loan portfolio on November 29, and expects to complete the sale of the origination platform in the first quarter of 2007. Parsippany, New Jersey-based Champion provides mortgage and home equity loans in 26 U.S. states. It generated a little more than 2 percent of KeyCorp's profit and revenue from January to September. "Many banks feel they lack the scale to compete within subprime lending," said Scott Siefers, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP. Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ), Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ), Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and others have this year bought lenders and servicers, in part to add loans they can package into securities. H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ) may sell its Option One subprime unit. KeyCorp has $96.2 billion of assets and about 949 branches. Siefers rates it "hold," and Timmons rates it "neutral." Founded in 1981, Champion is known for a long-running advertising campaign featuring founder Joseph Goryeb and the tagline, "When your bank says 'no,' Champion says 'yes.'" KeyCorp shares fell 3 cents to $36.07 in afternoon trading in New York. HSBC shares fell 1.0 percent to 932 pence in London.
