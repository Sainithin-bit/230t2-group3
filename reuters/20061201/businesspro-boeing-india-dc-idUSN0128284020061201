 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said it may bid for 
$15 billion of Indian military orders in the next decade, as it 
seeks to benefit from closer ties between the U.S. and India, a 
Bloomberg report said on Friday. 

  Boeing plans to cooperate with local companies on the 
potential bids in accordance with Indian defense purchase 
guidelines, the report said. Boeing did not immediately return 
a call seeking to confirm the report.  In June, Boeing said it planned to bid for a contract to 
supply India with 126 warplanes, a project that analysts have 
valued at $10 billion.  The increased interest in the Indian defense market follows 
a landmark civilian nuclear cooperation pact that has opened 
the door to sales of high-tech arms.  U.S. companies bidding for Indian defense business will 
likely face competition from European and other rivals.
