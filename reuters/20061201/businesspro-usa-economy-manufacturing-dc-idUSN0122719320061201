 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity shrank in 
November for the first time in 3-1/2 years as new orders, 
production and employment fell and prices paid rose, according 
to a survey published on Friday. 

  The data were seen as further evidence of slowing growth in 
the U.S. economy, which could force the Federal Reserve to cut 
interest rates in the first quarter of 2007.  The Institute for Supply Management said its index of 
national factory activity dropped to 49.5 from 51.2 in October, 
below economists' median forecast for a slight rise to 51.5.  This was the first time that the index had fallen below 50 
since April 2003, when a reading of 46.5 was recorded. A 
reading below 50 indicates shrinkage in the factory sector.  "I think this number will definitely continue to fan fears 
of a hard landing for the U.S. economy. Overall, this is 
consistent with the view that the U.S. economy is moderating 
and could prompt a Fed rate cut in 2007," said Omer Esiner, a 
senior analyst at Ruesch International in Washington, D.C.  Government bonds rallied on the data, with the yield on the 
benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR falling to a fresh 10-month 
low of 4.41 percent. Yields move inversely to prices.  Federal funds interest rate futures indicated that markets 
are pricing in a 64 percent chance of a Fed rate cut in the 
first quarter, up from 52 percent factored in before the data.  The dollar extended losses on the data, with the euro 
 EUR=  rising to a session high well above $1.33.  The U.S. central bank has kept the benchmark overnight fed 
funds rate steady at 5.25 percent since August, having raised 
it a quarter percentage point 17 times in the two years to 
June.  The ISM's prices paid index, which measures inflationary 
pressures in the factory sector, climbed to 53.5 in November, 
from 47.0 in October. New orders, a gauge of future growth, 
fell to 48.7 -- falling below 50 for the first time since April 
2003 -- from 52.1 in October. The employment index slipped to 
49.2 in November from 50.8 in October.
