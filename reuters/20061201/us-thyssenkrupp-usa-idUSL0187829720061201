 ESSEN, Germany  (Reuters) - Germany's largest steelmaker, ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ), will go through with the 2.3 billion euro ($3.04 billion) construction of a downstream steel mill in the United States irrespective of whether it can acquire Canada's Dofasco. 

 Chief Executive Ekkehard Schulz said on Friday at the company's annual press conference that he would certainly wait another couple of months to see whether ThyssenKrupp can force a sale of Dofasco, adding the contract with Lakshmi Mittal over Dofasco would end in April.
