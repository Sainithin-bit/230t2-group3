 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.'s ( F.N ) retail sales of cars and light trucks fell 7 percent in November from a year earlier, the automaker's sales manager said on Friday. 

 George Pipas, Ford's chief internal sales analyst, said the decline in showroom sales was "disappointing" and marked a weaker result than the automaker had expected. "We had our sights set higher," Pipas told reporters and analysts on a conference call to discuss November sales results.
