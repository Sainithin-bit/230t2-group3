 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co. on Friday said it 
would cut jobs in its animation unit as the media company 
sought to be flexible in timing of its films. 

  A company source said that about 20 percent of a work force 
of about 800 animators and other workers -- roughly 160 people 
in the Southern California unit -- would be affected.  Pixar, the computer animation unit acquired by Disney, was 
seen avoiding cuts as it had an "appropriate number of 
employees," the source said.  A union representative said Disney animators expected cuts 
to be focused on those who make the movies, as opposed to 
designers.  "Most of the cuts will come in the production end," said 
Animation Guild Business Representative Steve Hulett.  "After a careful review process, the management team at 
Walt Disney Animation has determined that each film will 
dictate its own appropriate production schedule. The result of 
this necessitated a reduction in staff," the Disney statement 
said.  Hulett said that Disney was lengthening the amount of time 
it takes to make movies to 18 months from 12 months.  Studio Chairman Dick Cook was not available for comment.
