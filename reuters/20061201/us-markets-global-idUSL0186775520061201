 LONDON  (Reuters) - European stocks and currencies rose on Friday as manufacturing data reinforced the view the region will outperform a slowing U.S. economy in 2007, while crude oil retreated after hitting a two-month high above $63. 

 The euro  EUR=  touched $1.3282, notching up a 20-month high against the battered dollar for an eighth straight session and hit a fresh record high against the yen EURJPY= at 153.95 yen. Sterling  GBP=  hit a new 14-year high against the greenback at $1.9748 and a 6-1/2 year peak on a trade weighted basis =GBP at 104.5. Data on Friday showed euro zone manufacturing growth slipped slightly last month, against expectations, but strength in exports and jobs signaled a healthy outlook heading into 2007. The RBS/NTC Eurozone Purchasing Managers' index fell to 56.6 in November, below October's 57.0 and expectations of 57.1, but comfortably above the 50 level which divides growth from contraction. Unemployment data showed the jobless rate slipped to 7.7 percent in October. "It's an indication that the euro zone is still expanding quite strongly. For this year we still see growth of about 2.6 or 2.7 percent and this is in line with our forecasts," said Monika Wohlmann at WestLB. "We expect another (European Central Bank) hike next week and another next year and this number is supportive of those hikes." The data contrasted with the U.S. Chicago PMI reading on Thursday showing the first slowdown in Midwest business activity in 3-1/2 years, which added fuel to speculation the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates next year. The U.S. national ISM manufacturing reading, due at 1500 GMT, and comments from Fed chair Ben Bernanke will be scoured for more indicators to the outlook for U.S. rates and the economy. STOCKS RISE Bond markets have increased the odds of the Fed cutting rates as early as the first quarter next year to revive the U.S. economy, but global equity markets have so far shrugged off the prospect of a recession in the world's largest economy. The MSCI All-Country World Index .MSCIWD hovered near a record peak on Friday, while Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  rose 0.3 percent to a three-week closing high of 16,321.8 points as tame consumer prices data dampened talk of rate rises there. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  was up 0.6 percent to 1,441 points, up 13 percent for the year. Morgan Stanley said it is expecting a similar sort of return next year. "Valuations are cheap, M&A will continue and the macro environment is benign," said Teun Draasima, head of European strategy at Morgan Stanley. While markets were now in the second phase of the bull market and would suffer more frequent corrections, margins would remain high and multiple expansion would follow after years of stocks de-rating, he added. Stocks on the move on Friday included French electricity giant EDF ( EDF.PA ), which jumped 6 percent after the country's highest court called into question energy sector price controls. OIL NEAR $63 Oil prices CLc1 dipped on profit-taking after climbing as high as $63.77 overnight. Venezuela said there was consensus within OPEC to reduce supply further when the group meets in two weeks. Gold climbed to $648.60 an ounce XAU=, its highest in more than 3 months as the weaker dollar and higher oil prices boosted sentiment. Euro zone government bonds dipped after failing to break a key technical resistance level and as markets awaited the U.S. manufacturing data. The December Bund future FGBLZ6 was down 13 ticks at 118.35, having failed a test of the important 118.60 level at the open.
