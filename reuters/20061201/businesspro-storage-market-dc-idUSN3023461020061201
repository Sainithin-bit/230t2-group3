 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EMC Corp. ( EMC.N ), the world's 
largest data storage maker, had the fastest revenue growth 
among industry majors in the third quarter while 
Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) decelerated, market researcher IDC 
said on Thursday. 

  EMC had 21.4 percent of the worldwide disk storage market 
in the quarter, up from 20 percent a year earlier as revenue 
surged 18 percent, IDC estimated in its quarterly industry 
survey. EMC's revenue growth had slowed to 3 percent in the 
second quarter.  Hewlett-Packard retained its No. 2 position in IDC's 
ranking but its market share fell to 17.6 percent from 19 
percent. Storage revenue at HP grew 1.8 percent, IDC said.  The data storage market as a whole grew 9.9 percent to $4.3 
billion in the third quarter, IDC said.  "There was a marked increase in average size and selling 
price for disk storage systems in the third quarter," 
particularly those selling for $50,000 to $300,000, said Brad 
Nisbet, program manager with IDC's storage systems program.  The period was the 14th consecutive quarter of growth in 
the storage market as companies seek to back up vast amounts of 
computer data. The surge has been partly driven by new 
regulations that require retention of e-mails, financial data 
and other corporate information.  International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ), the world's 
largest computer services company, remained in third place with 
13.7 percent of the market, compared with 13.1 percent a year 
earlier. Revenue grew 14.3 percent, IDC estimated.  EMC and IBM, which both make large, expensive storage 
systems, were the only two vendors to grow faster than the 
market average, IDC said.  Dell Inc. DELL.O, which resells EMC storage systems to 
corporate customers, was in fourth place with 8 percent of the 
market, down from 8.2 percent a year earlier. Its storage 
revenue grew 7.7 percent.  Hitachi Data Systems, a unit of Japan's Hitachi Ltd. 
( 6501.T ), tied with Dell, with 7.9 percent of the market, down 
from 8.2 percent.
