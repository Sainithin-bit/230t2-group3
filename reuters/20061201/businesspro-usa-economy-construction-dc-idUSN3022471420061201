 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending fell a 
sharper-than-expected 1 percent last month as home building 
posted a seventh straight drop, according to a government 
report on Friday that underscored the weakness in the U.S. 
housing market. 

  Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted a smaller, 0.3 
percent drop in overall construction spending in October. 
Compared to a year ago, total spending was up 0.5 percent, 
according to the Commerce Department.  Other reports on the housing sector have noted declining 
sales and rising inventories. October saw two reports that 
pointed to weakness in the new home sector: new home sales 
declined 3.2 percent while housing starts fell 14.6 percent.  The drop in construction reported Friday was driven by a 
1.5 percent drop in private construction and a 1.9 percent 
decline in private residential construction. October saw the 
sixth straight dip in private construction.  Public construction, namely government building projects, 
rose 0.8 percent to an all-time high of $273 billion. Federal 
construction saw an 11.6 percent boost in spending.  Private non-residential construction fell 0.7 percent in 
October but had recorded gains from May to August and so helped 
offset residential construction declines in those months.  Construction spending in September was revised to down 0.8 
percent from a previously reported drop of 0.3 percent.
