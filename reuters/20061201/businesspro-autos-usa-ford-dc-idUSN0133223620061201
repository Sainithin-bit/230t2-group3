 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Friday said 
U.S. November vehicle sales fell 10 percent from a year 
earlier, driven by a decline in truck sales as consumers moved 
to more fuel-efficient options. 

  The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 182,259 
vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 201,711 
vehicles a year earlier.  Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium- 
and heavy-duty trucks.  Looking ahead, the automaker said it plans to cut fourth- 
quarter production by 15,000 units to 620,000 vehicles. In the 
first quarter of 2007, Ford plans to produce 750,000 vehicles, 
down from 876,000 a year earlier.  Ford also said its U.S. inventory at the end of November 
for its Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands was 631,000 -- down 
122,000 from a year ago. The automaker estimates 85 percent of 
the inventory is new 2007 models.
