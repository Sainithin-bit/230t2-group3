 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said Alitalia AZPIa.MI would be sold to a group capable of folding the carrier into a global network, and promised regional protests would not sway his government's choice of buyer. 

 The comments were the latest boost to Air France-KLM's ( AIRF.PA ) bid for the loss-making national airline, whose board last week backed the French company's bid over one from tiny Italian domestic rival Air One. The centre-left government is divided on which bid to choose for the state's 49.9 percent stake in Alitalia and has been besieged by intense lobbying from unions and regional politicians who want it to remain in Italian hands. The government has the final word on who gets the Rome-based carrier, which is losing more than a million euros each day. Prodi reiterated his government would decide by mid-January on whether it too prefers Air France-KLM, and said the decision would be based on the "buyer's ability to integrate Alitalia into a global system". "Now we have only two options and we have to choose the best," Prodi told a year-end news conference. "I'm sorry, but I won't take note of protests, or pressure from groups or corporate lobbying." Alitalia's major unions and many Italian politicians, particularly in Italy's north, have stepped up lobbying against the Air France-KLM bid. They fear Alitalia will be reduced to a regional airline that follows orders from Paris and jobs will be lost at Alitalia's Milan Malpensa hub. Air France has said it wants to develop Alitalia's Rome hub, while scaling back in Milan. Three pilot and flight assistant unions on Thursday warned they were ready to "paralyze" Italy for days if the government did not disown the decision by Alitalia's board to back Air France-KLM. The governor of Italy's northern Lombardy region, Roberto Formigoni, said Prodi appeared "to be losing it a bit" and warned the wrong choice would make the country poorer. THE FINAL CHANCE The Italian government is expected to discuss the matter at a cabinet meeting on Friday. Prodi and his economy minister are said to back Air France while other influential ministers -- including Transport Minister Alessandro Bianchi -- are said to prefer the Italian option. Alitalia shares fell more than 3 percent on Thursday -- the first day of trading since the airline's board backed Air France -- and closed down 2.45 percent at 0.7397 euros. "Should the market consider the Air France offer of 35 cents per share as final, Alitalia's price will fall more than that," said one trader. Alitalia is valued at about 1.1 billion euros ($1.6 billion) on the market and holds a similar amount of debt. On track for yet another year in the red, the airline says it has enough cash to last a year if it begins selling off assets. Earlier this week it said it had sold three of its 13 pairs of slots at London's Heathrow airport for 92 million euros. It declined to identify the buyers. In an interview with an Italian daily, Alitalia Chairman Maurizio Prato refused to speculate on whether the government would back his board's choice but warned that the carrier's precarious financial condition meant it was running out of time. "I hope that the decision, whatever it might be, would be taken quickly," Prato told Il Sole 24 Ore. "We are in a phase of vital importance for Alitalia and, in my opinion, it is the final chance. There won't be time for other attempts." (Additional reporting by  Gilles Castonguay  and Claudia Cristoferi; Editing by David Cowell)
