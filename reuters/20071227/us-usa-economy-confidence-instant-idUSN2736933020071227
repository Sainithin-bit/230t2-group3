 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Conference Board said on Thursday its index of consumer sentiment rose to 88.6 in December from an upwardly revised 87.8 in November. The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters was for a reading of 86.5.   

  KEY POINTS: * The present situation Index fell to 108.3 in December, its lowest since October 2005, from a revised 115.7 in November. * The expectations index rose to 75.5 in December from a revised 69.1.  COMMENTS:  CARY LEAHEY, SENIOR MANAGING DIRECTOR, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The report is not that bad, most people were looking for a two or three point decline. Not surprisingly you had a big drop in the present situation, however expectations went up which is a mild positive. "The jobs hard to get, which is closely watched, jumped two points. I wouldn't necessary say that is out of the recent range, but that certainly bears watching. "What is troublesome is that both the Michigan and the Conference Board surveys have made a 15-point move over three months, which is generally indicative of something bad happening to the U.S. consumer. "The fact that they seem to be stabilizing at an okay level suggests that the something bad may not mean an overall U.S. recession but a situation for retailers that is very difficult because it probably implies that for the first time in 15 years that consumer spending on goods will actually decline in 2008 relative to 2007."  JIM FEHRENBACH, HEAD OF NASDAQ TRADING, PIPER JAFFRAY, MINNEAPOLIS: "Today's consumer confidence is better than people thought. People have prepared themselves for the worst, but it's not as bad as the pundits are saying. I don't think the numbers show we are careening toward the wall of recession and about to crash into it."  BRIAN TAYLOR, SENIOR CURRENCY TRADER, M&T BANK, BUFFALO, NEW YORK: "The number was a little better than expected and a small higher revision for November, but all in all the market has an eye what is going on in Pakistan with the murder of the opposition leader and in addition an oil inventory coming out at 10.30 a.m. So the economic numbers are probably being put on the back burner."  MARKET REACTION: - BONDS: U.S. Treasuries steady at higher levels. - CURRENCIES: After the confidence data, the euro was trading 0.5 percent higher at $1.4564. The dollar was little changed against the yen at 114.20. - US STOCKS: Stocks slightly pared losses after the confidence data.
