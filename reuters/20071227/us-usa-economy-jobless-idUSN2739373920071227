 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits unexpectedly rose by 1,000 last week, while the number of longer-term unemployed rose to its highest in more than two years, the government said on Thursday. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose to 349,000 in the week ended December 22 from an upwardly revised 348,000 in the prior week, the Labor Department said. Wall Street economists forecast claims would fall to 342,000 from the originally reported 346,000 claims for the week ended December 15. The four-week moving average of new claims, which irons out week-to-week fluctuations, fell to 342,500 from 343,500 the prior week. In a sign that finding a job has become more difficult, the number of people remaining on the unemployment rolls after drawing an initial week of benefits rose to its highest since mid-November 2005. The number of continued claims rose for the third straight week, jumping by 75,000 to 2.71 million in the week ended December 15, the latest period for which these statistics were available. Wall Street economists had forecast claims at 2.65 million. The four-week moving average of continued claims, having risen for nine straight weeks, was the highest since December 2005. In the week ended December 15, the moving average rose 13,500 to 2.64 million. (Reporting by  Nancy Waitz ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
