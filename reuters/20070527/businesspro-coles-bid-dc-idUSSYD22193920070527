 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global private equity group CVC CVC.UL 
has pulled out of a consortium eyeing a bid for Australia's 
Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX after going through the retailers' 
books, the buyout group said Monday. 

  The consortium, which includes Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
KKR.UL, said it could not rule out further changes to the 
group interested in buying all or parts of the retailer which 
put itself up for sale in February.  "I can confirm that CVC is no longer part of the 
consortium," a spokesman for the buyout group said, confirming 
a report in The Australian newspaper.  "One can presume they have some concerns about the state of 
the business."  The bid group had finished a two-week stint examining 
Coles' books on Friday. This included access to detailed 
financials, lease arrangements and supply contracts.  The KKR group also includes Bain, Blackstone Group BG.UL, 
Carlyle Group CYL.UL and TPG TPG.UL.  Rival bidder Wesfarmers WES.AX has already offered A$19.7 
billion ($16.2 billion) for Coles, and started due diligence on 
May 25.  The Australian conglomerate has teamed up with Macquarie 
Bank MBL.AX and private equity groups Permira and Pacific 
Equity Partners.  British retailer Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) also hired an 
investment bank to look at a possible approach but later pulled 
out of the race.
