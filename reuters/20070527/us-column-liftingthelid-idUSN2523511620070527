 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc.'s annual meeting this week was a pretty staid affair after a public relations disaster last year. 

 While that satisfied some critics, governance experts are watching the home improvement chain leader closely as it looks to fill a number of soon-to-be-vacant board seats. In particular, they say, Home Depot has a chance to become a strong model for corporate governance in the next year, when four of its 11 board members are due to step aside because of age limits. "The model on how to run a great business, how to run a great board is there," said Paul Lapides, director of the Corporate Governance Center at Georgia's Kennesaw State University. He said Home Depot set a high standard for good governance in its early years. At Thursday's annual meeting, Chief Executive Frank Blake apologized from the outset for the previous year's gathering, when shareholders were angered that no directors, except for then-CEO Robert Nardelli, attended. Nardelli, who resigned in January amid an uproar over his pay package, also gave no business review and did not allow separate time for shareholder questions. "It was a mistake, and it won't happen again," Blake told the audience of more than 300 shareholders in Atlanta. This year, all shareholders with questions were given time to speak, and all directors were present except for one who had a schedule conflict. Co-founders Bernie Marcus and Arthur Blank were introduced to applause. "It was a well-conducted meeting," said Richard Metcalf, corporate affairs director for Laborers International Union of North America, who presented a proposal to require investor approval of extraordinary retirement benefits. The plan was defeated but garnered 44 percent of votes in favor. POLICY CHANGES Since Nardelli left, Home Depot has made other changes. It adopted a policy of recouping pay from senior executives who commit fraud, expanded its political contribution disclosures, and boosted the number of directors who must approve CEO pay. Blake, who joined Home Depot in 2002, has a compensation package valued at $8.9 million this year, with 89 percent of it tied to company performance. By contrast, Nardelli collected at least $119 million in salary and bonus during his six years with Home Depot, and left with $210 million in severance. "The albatross was Nardelli," said Shirley Westcott, managing director of policy at Proxy Governance, an independent advisory and voting firm in Vienna, Virginia. "Changes made since his departure demonstrate that Home Depot is on the mend." With a third of the board due to retire in the next year, Home Depot "has an extraordinary opportunity to lock in an excellent board," said Susan Shultz, global practice leader of OakBridge Inc. SSA Executive Search, a firm that recruits directors. Among the directors due to step down is co-founder Kenneth Langone, a target of shareholder activists since he was sued by the New York attorney general's office over the pay package of former New York Stock Exchange chairman Richard Grasso. While experts in retailing, mergers and other business disciplines can serve Home Depot well, the retailer would benefit if new directors possessed more intangible qualities, Schultz and Metcalf said. "The culture of the new directors is absolutely critical," Shultz said. "It needs to be someone who will be responsive to shareholders."
