 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - "It's still the same old Exxon." 

 That's the sentiment being expressed by environmentalists and shareholder activists gearing up for Exxon Mobil Corp.'s ( XOM.N ) annual meeting this week in Dallas. That was not always their hope. When Rex Tillerson, a genial Texan, took the helm at the world's largest company at the beginning of 2006, replacing combative long-time Chief Executive Lee Raymond, some felt change was inevitable. But, as both the company and activists would attest, Exxon has stayed true to the course set by Raymond. Under Tillerson, Exxon's "tone is not as harsh," Connecticut State Treasurer Denise Nappier said at a press conference last week. "There's not a lot of rhetoric, but when you get beyond that the policies are very much the same as they were under the old leadership," she said. Shareholder activists claim that the company is insular and resistant to change. Moreover, despite a campaign to improve its environmentally unfriendly image, critics allege Exxon is still funding groups that mislead the public about the causes of climate change. Exxon Mobil faces 15 shareholder proposals at its annual meeting on topics including executive compensations, corporate governance and environmental issues, as well as an effort to unseat board member Michael Proskin, a Stanford University economist and chair of the company's public issues committee. "The problem is the same with Exxon," said governance activist Robert Monks, who has submitted a proposal that the company split its chairman and chief executive positions. "It is a company that listens only to itself," he said. STUBBORN OR STEADY? Exxon disagrees with many of the charges leveled against the company and says it has been more active in communicating its positions on key issues externally over the last year. Spokesman Gantt Walton said the company's policies are constantly reviewed by the board. "They are not taken lightly by any stretch," he said. He said the philosophy and the principles of the company have not changed due to the transition from Raymond to Tillerson. "If you are saying that they have been consistent, we would probably agree with that," Walton said. Ironically, the fact that Exxon has not changed may be attracting investors. "They were operating very well under Raymond, and they continue to do so," said John S. Herold analyst Lysle Brinker, noting that Exxon Mobil has stayed closer to its long-term strategy than any of its competitors. During the roughly 12-1/2 years that Raymond led the company, Exxon acquired Mobil Corp. and its shares rose to nearly 3.5 times their value when he started -- well ahead of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. After Tillerson took over the company, Exxon Mobil pulled in a whopping $39.5 billion in 2006 -- the largest corporate profit in history. The company's stock has also continued its rise, climbing nearly 50 percent in the last 16 months. "If you are one of the most profitable oil companies you're going to attract more shareholders," Brinker said. Still, the company can expect pressure to change from its shareholders in the meeting, scheduled for May 30, and from environmental protesters outside. Ken Sylvester, assistant comptroller for pension policy in the New York City comptroller's office, is backing a proposal for the ninth straight year asking the company to explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation. Exxon has long maintained that its existing global policies prohibit any discrimination, including sexual orientation. Sylvester said the comptroller's office has not seen any softening on the issue from Exxon. "The company still remains opposed to the resolution. There's been no change at all," he said.
