 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Telecommunications equipment maker Avaya Inc. ( AV.N ) said it postponed an investor conference originally scheduled for May 31, although it did not specify why or whether it was related to buyout speculation. 

 Avaya's Web site, as of Sunday, did not provide a new date for the conference. Bloomberg News reported the postponement on Saturday. Avaya specializes in equipment for Web-based telephone calls and has long been the subject of merger speculation, due to a consolidating communications industry and its rivalry with much bigger Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ).
