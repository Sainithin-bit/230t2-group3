 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in auto insurer Progressive Corp. ( PGR.N ) are modestly valued and could offer long-term rewards, financial newspaper Barron's said in its May 28 edition. 

 Progressive shares now traded at 12 times forecast 2007 earnings, near the low end of its historical range and modest for a company that has offered return on equity of around 20 percent, Barron's said. The report also said Progressive was becoming more aggressive on pricing and premium growth. "The Street is focused on the genuine near-term challenges. But over a multi-year horizon, Progressive's strong industry position and disciplined management should reward investors nicely," Barron's said.
