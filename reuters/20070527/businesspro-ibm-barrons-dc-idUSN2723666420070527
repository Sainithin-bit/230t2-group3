 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ) shares could easily rise 
above $120, financial newspaper Barron's said in its May 28 
edition, citing the company's forecast for higher earnings per 
share due to software sales, stock buybacks, and growth in 
emerging markets. 

  IBM shares closed on Friday at $105.18.  The company plans to bolster profits through higher-margin 
software sales, Barron's said. It also noted that IBM bought 
back $27 billion of stock between 2003 and 2006, and was 
authorized to buy another $16.4 billion.  The report also quoted an analyst as saying third world 
markets would become a growth engine for IBM in the future.  It said analysts' share price targets of around $120 to 
$125 "may ultimately look tame, given that IBM is expecting 
earnings gains to rise to 16 percent a year."
