 LAGOS  (Reuters) - Nigeria's Access Bank ( ACCESS.LG ) said on Sunday it had completed the acquisition of its 75 percent majority interest in rescued lender Intercontinental Bank INTERCO.LG. 
 Intercontinental was one of nine banks rescued in a $4 billion 2009 bailout. All rescued lenders have now agreed recapitalization deals, bringing to a close a reform program set-up two years ago to end the country's banking crisis. (Reporting by Oludare Mayowa; Writing by  Joe Brock )
