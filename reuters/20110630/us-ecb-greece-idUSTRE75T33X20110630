 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet reserved judgment on a French proposal to resolve Greece's debt crisis but another ECB policymaker called the plan "a very interesting step." 

 The French plan has emerged as a possible blueprint that could pave the way for private investors' involvement in a rollover of Greek debt without triggering a default or payout in credit insurance -- scenarios the ECB says must be avoided. The ECB's stance is crucial because it has threatened to refuse to continue accepting Greek bonds as collateral in its funding operations in the event of either credit insurance being triggered, forced private sector involvement, or a rating cut into default territory. "At this stage, we have not yet (got) a position," Trichet told the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee when asked about the French proposal. "We are very alert but I cannot give you a precise judgment on what is going on." Trichet's response matched the line taken by another heavyweight ECB policymaker, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, who told French newspaper Les Echos the French proposal needed checking: "It's an interesting proposal, but we really need to make sure that it fits the specified framework: no credit event." However, a third ECB policymaker, Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny, told Austrian radio the French proposal was "a very interesting step" that was important for winning political approval in countries such as Germany. "What is important is that there is a common European solution because it brings little if only an individual country does it. That is exactly where talks are now taking place," Nowotny said in comments broadcast on Thursday. Politicians and bankers are confident the French proposal can be adopted without triggering a default or a payout in credit insurance, lifting a key hurdle to a rollover of Greek debt, sources said on Wednesday. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble met German finance industry representatives on Thursday to discuss private sector involvement in aid for Greece. Greece approved the first of two austerity measures on Wednesday despite worsening street violence, in a vote vital to winning fresh international aid so it can pay its debts on time and stave off bankruptcy. Trichet urged all Greeks to get behind the austerity plan. "What we hope is that the full body of Greece -- the private sector, the public sector -- would understand that if they would themselves play the winning game they would change totally the picture," he said. LIQUIDITY TAPS ON Trichet scotched speculation that the ECB may delay interest rate rises because of Greece's plight and the contagion threat it poses, saying the bank was in "strong vigilance" mode. "The current monetary policy is accommodative and ... as I said we are in a state of strong vigilance," he said, deploying a phrase that has consistently signaled a rate hike at its next monthly meeting. The ECB holds a policy meeting next week. Trichet also signaled the ECB would keep offering banks ample funds. The ECB has been careful not to withdraw support to the economy and banking system so fast as to stall the recovery or endanger banks' ability to cope with limited liquidity. "We will continue to separate standard measures and non-standard measures," he said, underlining the distinction the ECB draws between interest rates and its non-standard measures, such as liquidity operations and bond purchases. Bini Smaghi said the ECB's work on a plan to deal with Greek, Portuguese and Irish banks dependent on its funding drip included achieving a reduction in their financial leverage. "This must be both sufficiently gradual, to avoid a credit contraction, and include firm maturities to reduce the dependence on refinancing with the Euro system," he said.
