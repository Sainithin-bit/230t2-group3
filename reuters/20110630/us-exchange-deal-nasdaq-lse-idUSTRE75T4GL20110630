 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ) is assessing a possible approach to London Stock Exchange Group Plc ( LSE.L ), the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, a day after LSE abandoned its plan to acquire Canada's TMX Group Inc ( X.TO ). 

 The media report, citing a source familiar with the matter, said U.S.-based Nasdaq was in the "preliminary stages" of studying a move, adding that the company still finds LSE's large stock listings business attractive. No deal approach had been made so far, the online report said. The Nasdaq Stock Market parent made two unsolicited bids for the British bourse in 2006 before abandoning the effort in 2007. Last month, Nasdaq dropped a counteroffer for rival NYSE Euronext NYX.N -- which has merger plans with Germany's Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ) -- in the face of U.S. regulatory resistance. A Nasdaq spokesman declined to comment. LSE was not immediately available. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
