 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek lawmakers vote on Thursday on the second of two austerity bills that are key to receiving aid from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, after endorsing an initial law on Wednesday. 

 The bill is expected to pass in full but the vote is a complicated process in which each lawmaker can pick and choose which articles he wants to back or not. Here is how the debate and vote are expected to take place: * WHEN? The vote will take place on Thursday afternoon after 2 p.m. local time (1100 GMT). The exact time will depend on how long the preliminary debate takes. The debate began on Wednesday evening and resumed on Thursday morning. * HOW? According to parliament officials, a single roll-call vote will be held at the end of the session. Lawmakers will, one after the other, verbally cast their vote to approve or reject the entire law and can then cherry-pick through the text and say they reject individual articles. * HOW WILL IT GO? After expelling one rebel deputy on Wednesday, the Socialist government of Prime Minister George Papandreou has a majority of 154 seats in the 300-strong assembly, three more than the 151 votes it needs for the law to be approved. After lawmakers approved the first legislation, which sets up austerity and privatization targets, by 155 votes to 138, the implementation law is also expected to be approved. But the vote could be tight on individual articles, especially on taxes. The conservative opposition New Democracy party supports some privatizations and has said it would support some part of the implementation law, but it strongly opposes the government's tax plans. * WHAT IS THE LAW ABOUT? - Art. 1-9: Setting up a privatization agency. - Art. 10-26: Regulations regarding state-owned real estate in preparation for possible privatization. - Art. 27-36: Tax measures. - Art. 37, 38: Public sector hiring curbs. - Art. 39-49: Labor market/social security regulations.
