 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Timing is crucial for Timothy Geithner as he mulls whether to quit the Obama administration early or hang in for a possible bruising ride in next year's presidential election campaign. 

 The 49-year-old Geithner doesn't want to leave before agreement is reached on a deal to ratchet down budget deficits and lift the government's borrowing ceiling. If he stays past fall he is nearly duty-bound to stand by President Barack Obama through his 2012 presidential reelection bid. A source familiar with Geithner's thinking said he realizes he would have a slim window if he wanted to depart. If a budget and debt deal can be crafted from contentious talks now taking place between Obama administration officials and lawmakers on Capitol Hill, Geithner could leave by late summer or fall and allow time for a replacement to take over. While diplomatic, that would still take one of the last of the administration's economic heavy hitters out of play. Lawrence Summers, who headed Obama's National Economic Council, has gone already. White House economist Austan Goolsbee intends to leave soon to return to teaching. Finding someone to take over such a key post as Treasury chief is never simple, but at least it would not take place in the midst of an active financial crisis as was the case when Geithner stepped into the job in early 2009. Among names mentioned as potential successors are General Electric chief Jeffrey Immelt, who now heads an outside jobs advisory council to the White House, banking regulator Sheila Bair and even New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Wall Street is not currently in vogue in Washington, but another possible substitute could be JPMorgan Chase & Co Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. He has been a frequent visitor to the capital and is widely recognized as a competent manager and a capable politician in his own right. Whoever it is will face a daunting challenge: getting a slow-growing economy to produce more growth and jobs in the run-up to November 2012 presidential voting. There is even the possibility the person will have to pick up the cudgels that Geithner would lay down on deficit reduction, if the current negotiations produce only a short-term pact but give Geithner cover to leave his post. Nor is there any scarcity of global trouble-spots and touchy relationships that a new Treasury chief would be expected to address and to handle with tact. Europe's debt crisis continues bubbling, with hope but no guarantee Greece's woes can be contained. China must be dealt with as both a key emerging-market power and America's top creditor. Geithner is an expert in both areas. Any deficit-reduction pact would contemplate bringing America's debts down only over a period of years. The Treasury will need to ensure the United States remains sound and attractive enough to draw investment from around the world. (Reporting by Glenn Somerville, editing by Andrew Hay)
