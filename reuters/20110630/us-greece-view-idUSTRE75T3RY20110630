 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's parliament passed a second austerity bill on Thursday to enable the country to avert bankruptcy by securing a 12 billion euro ($17 billion) loan tranche from the EU and IMF. 

 Following are analysts' comments on the development. MICHAEL HEWSON, MARKET ANALYST, CMC MARKETS "The Greek situation has been kicked down the road for a couple of weeks and the immediate prospect of a default is off the agenda for now. They have bought more time to get the problem that is Greece solved, so the market has had a green light to buy risky assets. "Getting this vote through is one thing, but all it is doing is delaying the inevitable. Eventually this will lead to talks on restructuring Greek debt because the bailout money is being used to service debt, it is not making inroads into the money owed. Given what is going on  the streets of Athens, you have to question whether Greece can implement these measures." GAVIN FRIEND, CURRENCY ANALYST AT nabCAPITAL "This avoids a default by Greece and buys some more time before we have to go through this again. Greece has to secure funding up to 2014 and unless political parties there come to an agreement we don't expect the troika to release more funds." PHILIP LAWLOR, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SMITH & WILLIAMSON, LONDON "The bailout is a liquidity solution. The problem for Greece is not liquidity so much as solvency or insolvency. Obviously, the austerity measures exacerbate the solvency squeeze." "This is necessary to avoid the chaotic default but Greece ultimately has to default in the sense that it cannot service the debt that has been layered on top of it." "The next hurdle for the markets is clearly the attitude of the ratings agencies to any of these debt restructurings being thrown up." JUSTIN HARRIS, HEAD OF TRADING, GUARDIAN STOCKBROKERS, LONDON "A lot of people were thinking this vote would be a formality. We had a very strong number, the Chicago PMI at quarter to three. The movement in the market could be a bit of both." (editing by Mike Peacock)
