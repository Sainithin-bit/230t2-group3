 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday it hoped for a "positive resolution" in talks with European countries to ensure the Greek economic program is fully funded. 

 IMF spokeswoman Caroline Atkinson said in a statement after Greece's parliament approved a five-year economic adjustment plan to secure IMF/EU financing, the move would "bolster Greece's efforts to implement its economic reform program." "This is a welcome and important step and will contribute to restoring fiscal sustainability, safeguarding financial sector stability, and boosting competitiveness to create the conditions for sustained growth and employment," she said.
