 (Reuters) - Israel's Teva has won the battle for German generic drugmaker Ratiopharm, agreeing to pay more than 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) including debt, sources close to the situation told Reuters. 

 Here are the main events on the way to the sale: November 17, 2008 - German billionaire Adolf Merckle books 400 million euros in losses due to an unprecedented surge in Volkswagen shares, fuelling speculation that the industrialist could sell Ratiopharm or part of his stake in HeidelbergCement. January 7, 2009 - Adolf Merckle's VEM Asset Management investment vehicle gets a bridging loan from creditor banks in a deal that will force it to sell Ratiopharm. September 17 - VEM launches the sale of Ratiopharm. November 11 - Attracts at least 10 first-round bids in the range 2 billion to 2.5 billion euros. -- Bidders include Teva, U.S. companies Mylan, Watson Pharmaceuticals and Pfizer, Sanofi-Aventis of France, China's Sinopharm and Actavis of Iceland, private equity firms TPG, Permira, KKR, EQT, and Advent in collaboration with Goldman Sachs. December 9 - Private equity firms KKR, TPG, Permira and Goldman Sachs in collaboration with Advent drop out of the bidding race. January 19, 2010 - Teva, Pfizer and Actavis, backed by Swedish buyout firm EQT, are invited to make final bids in early February. February 6 - Teva and Actavis place bids. The deal is expected to be in the range of 3 billion euros, which would make it the biggest generics drugmaker takeover since Teva's $7.5 billion purchase of U.S. rival Barr. February 17 - Actavis, which offered 3 billion euros -- the highest bid -- calls off its plan to collaborate with EQT and relies entirely on its biggest creditor, Deutsche Bank, to funding the takeover. March 7 - Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler and other top-rank managers arrive in the southern German town of Ulm, where Ratiopharm is based, for a closed-door presentation on their vision for Ratiopharm. March 8 - Actavis plays IPO card saying in a presentation to Ratiopharm's top management that an initial public offering could be carried out in 5-8 years. March 18 - Teva wins the battle for Ratiopharm, agreeing to pay more than 3.5 billion euros including debt, several sources close to the situation tell Reuters. (Editing by Will Waterman)
