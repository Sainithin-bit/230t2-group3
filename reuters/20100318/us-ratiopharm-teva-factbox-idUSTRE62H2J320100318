 (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.O ( TEVA.TA ) said on Thursday it would acquire Germany's Ratiopharm for 3.625 billion euros ($4.95 billion) including debt. 

 Below are major acquisitions by Teva, Israel's largest company and the world's biggest maker of generic drugs: * In December 2008, Teva bought Barr Pharmaceuticals in the U.S. and its European subsidiary Pliva for $7.5 billion, the largest acquisition in Teva's history. The deal significantly enhanced Teva's leadership position in the U.S. generic drugs market and strengthened its position in key European markets. * Teva acquired U.S.-based IVAX Corp in 2006 for $7.4 billion, bringing it a strong presence in Latin America and Central and Eastern Europe and complementary operations in North America and Europe. IVAX also had a significant respiratory business and a pipeline of generic and proprietary products in the areas of respiratory ailments and oncology. * Sicor became a wholly owned subsidiary of Teva in January 2004. Teva paid $3.4 billion for Sicor, which had a leading generic injectable business as well as biogeneric capabilities. * In 2000, Teva bought privately held Novopharm, Canada's second-largest generic company, making Teva the largest generic drug company in North America. Novopharm's primary business is development of generic drugs, including sterile products, vitamins and over-the-counter products. The Dan Family, which owned Novopharm, received 4.2 million shares in Teva, representing a 6 percent stake at the time. * In August 1999, Teva bought Massachusetts-based Copley Pharmaceutical Inc, a maker of generic and branded drugs, for $220 million.
