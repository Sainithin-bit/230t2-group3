 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuela offered to resolve its 
nationalization dispute with U.S. energy giant Exxon Mobil by 
withdrawing from its stake in the Chalmette refinery, a top 
energy official told local media in comments reported on 
Sunday. 

  Exxon has acquired court orders freezing up to $12 billion 
in Venezuelan assets, after leftist President Hugo Chavez took 
over the Cerro Negro heavy oil project last year as part of a 
wave of energy-sector takeovers.  Deputy Oil Minister Bernard Mommer said pulling out of 
Chalmette, a joint venture with Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) in 
Louisiana, had been on the table when the government took over 
Cerro Negro.  "With Exxon the solution was obvious from the beginning: if 
we position ourselves in the area of production, we withdraw 
our position in refining and those two amounts are similar," 
Mommer told the El Universal daily newspaper.  He added that Venezuela's insistence that future contracts 
not contain international arbitration clauses sparked the 
initial discord with Exxon, which left the OPEC nation last 
year after failing to reach an agreement on the state takeover 
ordered by President Hugo Chavez.  Analysts have suggested that Venezuela could offer Exxon 
its 50 percent stake in Chalmette as a way of settling the 
escalating dispute.  Venezuela cut commercial ties with Exxon to protest the 
legal assault, but assured it would continue to supply 
Chalmette, which receives most of the crude it processes from 
Cerro Negro project.  Mommer last week said state oil company PDVSA would not be 
able to sell its stake in Chalmette without Exxon's permission.  (Reporting by Brian Ellsworth, editing by Frank Jack Daniel
