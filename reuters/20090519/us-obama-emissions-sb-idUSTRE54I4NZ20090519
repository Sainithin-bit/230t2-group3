 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama proposed on Tuesday the first U.S. regulation of auto emissions in a bid to reduce climate-warming greenhouse gasses and lower dependence on foreign oil. 

 The initiative is centered around the strictest plan ever for increasing fuel standards for passenger vehicles, sharply raising pressure on struggling automakers to make more efficient cars and trucks. Obama said at the White House the plan would give carmakers new certainty about federal regulatory policy and permit them to better plan for the future.
