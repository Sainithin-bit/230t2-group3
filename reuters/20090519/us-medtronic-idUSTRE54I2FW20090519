 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc ( MDT.N ) reported lower quarterly net income on charges for several recent acquisitions, and the medical device maker gave a disappointing fiscal-year outlook that sent its shares down 7 percent. 

 The company, which has been focused on reducing costs to offset sluggish sales in key markets, also announced plans to eliminate another 1,500 to 1,800 jobs, or up to 4.6 percent of its global workforce. The job cuts will span various business units and geographies. Medtronic projected fiscal 2010 revenue growth of 5 percent to 8 percent, excluding any foreign currency effects. It forecast earnings of $3.10 to $3.20 per share for the year, indicating it could miss Wall Street's average target of $3.20. Excluding special items, quarterly profit met the average forecast of Wall Street analysts. Analysts said market share appeared to be eroding in the world's largest stand-alone medical device maker's biggest divisions -- cardiac rhythm management and spinal products -- while the company's profit forecast suggests cost-cutting initiatives have not translated into the robust earnings improvement investors were hoping for. "Despite the company's insistence that it has a stable share in these businesses, the fact that their competitors are growing faster than they are doesn't really support this," said Thomas Weisel Partners analyst Raj Denhoy. For the fourth quarter ended on April 24, net earnings fell to $250 million, or 22 cents a share, from $812 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Medtronic took charges in the quarter for its acquisitions of Ventor Technologies, CoreValve and Ablation Frontiers. Excluding special items, Medtronic reported a profit of 82 cents a share, up 5 percent from a year earlier and matching Wall Street estimates. Medtronic Chief Executive Bill Hawkins said the company's fiscal 2010 forecast was in line with previously stated long-term goals. "We've been very consistent with what we've been saying," Hawkins said in an interview. Medtronic lost market share in implantable defibrillators after the 2007 recall of its Fidelis lead connecting the devices to the heart. On Monday, Medtronic notified doctors of a potential problem with the wire connecting some older-model pacemakers that could cause the battery to deplete. Although 1.7 million of the devices were implanted, the company is recommending only a small subset of patients consider changing out the device. "The risk to patients is very, very low here," Hawkins said. Medtronic said fourth-quarter revenue fell 1 percent to $3.83 billion. Revenue in the company's cardiac rhythm disease unit, which includes defibrillators and pacemakers, fell 5 percent to $1.3 billion. Sales rose 1 percent when adjusted for unfavorable foreign currency trends. New clinical data supporting the benefits of defibrillators could spur growth in the market, William Blair analyst Ben Andrew said in a research note. "We believe that the implantable defibrillator market is poised to generate solid growth in the coming quarters and as the market leader," Andrew said. "Medtronic should meaningfully benefit from these trends." Revenue in the cardiovascular unit, which includes stents for propping open arteries, was flat at $644 million, but increased 8 percent after adjusting for foreign currency trends. The spine products unit posted a 1 percent rise in revenue to $881 million and showed a 4 percent increase when adjusted for currency. The diabetes business grew 8 percent to $296 million, helped by its glucose monitoring systems, while revenue at the surgical technologies division rose 3 percent to $235 million. Medtronic said it would take a first-quarter charge for the restructuring on top of charges for workforce reductions already taken in the fourth quarter. Medtronic shares were down $2.38, or 7 percent, at $31.58 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.
