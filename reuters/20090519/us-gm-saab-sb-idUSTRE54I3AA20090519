 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Swedish carmaker Saab has selected three suitors for continued talks as it searches for a new owner, the loss-making General Motors Corp unit said in a court filing on Tuesday. 

 In a request for an extension of the period under which the carmaker is protected from creditors, the company said it had held presentations with 10 potential suitors. "Among these interested parties, three have been selected to continue negotiations on an acquisition of Saab," the company said in the document e-mailed from the local court in Vanersborg, southwest Sweden. "These negotiations will be carried out during the remainder of May in order to select the final candidate." Saab sought protection from creditors in February to buy time to find a new owner, after GM said it would cut ties with the brand by the turn of the year. The Swedish carmaker has said it needs $1 billion in financing to see it through the crisis and has asked creditors to write off 75 percent of the company's 10.6 billion crown ($1.4 billion) debt, most of which is owed to GM. A court official said a decision on whether to let the reorganization process be extended was expected late next week. (Reporting by  Niklas Pollard  and Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by  David Holmes )
