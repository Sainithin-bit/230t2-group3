 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday will announce the most aggressive proposal for increasing auto fuel economy standards ever and the first plan for regulating emissions, the White House said. 

 The proposal would require the U.S. passenger vehicle fleet to average 35.5 miles per gallon by 2016, saving 1.8 billion barrels of oil. It would also instruct the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate tailpipe emissions. (Reporting by White House staff, Editing by Sandra Maler)
