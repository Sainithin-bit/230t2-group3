 (Reuters) - The Obama administration summarized the impact of its plan to boost U.S. automobile fuel efficiency standards and limit greenhouse gas emissions as follows: 

 * Requires yearly 5 percent increases in fuel efficiency from 2012 through 2016, resulting in an average fuel economy standard of 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016. * Cuts oil consumption by an estimated 1.8 billion barrels over the life of the program. * Cuts greenhouse gas emissions by a projected 900 million metric tons. * Supported by 10 car companies and the United Auto Workers union. * Sets one clear, national policy for all automakers, instead of standards from the Transportation Department, Environmental Protection Agency, and a California standard that would apply to 13 other states. * Gives automakers clarity, predictability and certainty about the rules, as well as flexibility to meet the expected outcomes.
