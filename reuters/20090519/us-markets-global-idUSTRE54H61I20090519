 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors shrugged off record-low U.S. housing data on Tuesday and focused on a perceived recovery in global economies, driving up equity markets worldwide and lifting higher-risk currencies. 

 The dollar slid as improving business sentiment in Germany spurred renewed optimism about the global economy, reducing demand for safe-haven assets such as the U.S. currency. Prices for U.S. Treasury debt were mixed as investors warmed to riskier assets like stocks and as talk swirled that some U.S. banks were preparing to repay the government for bailout funds. Ten-year euro zone government bond prices fell to a one-week low while the yield on ultra-long-dated German Bunds moved to a six-month high, pressured by buoyant bourses and heavy government bond issuance. To be sure, gains in U.S. and European stock markets were limited by data that showed both groundbreaking for new U.S. homes and building permits fell in April to their lowest levels since records for the data were first collected almost 50 years ago. "The market is inclined to be more optimistic than pessimistic despite the fall in U.S. housing starts, and that's why we're seeing euro/dollar hold its gains," said Nick Bennenbroek, head of FX strategy at Wells Fargo in New York. "There are positive signs we're seeing in the economy although the housing starts are a reminder of the still difficult situation." At 1:30 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  added 28.51 points, or 0.34 percent, at 8,532.59. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 5.27 points, or 0.58 percent, at 914.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 12.05 points, or 0.70 percent, at 1,744.41. Shares of U.S. homebuilders initially fell, but as U.S. stocks rebounded after opening lower, the Dow Jones home construction index .DJUSHB also bounced back, moving up 0.50 percent, helped by Monday's data that showed rising sentiment for those shares. While the headline numbers for the U.S. housing data were negative, driven down by a plunge in multifamily units, some stabilization in single-family construction could be seen, said Anna Piretti, a senior economist at BNP Paribas in New York. "If you look at the breakdown, we're beginning to see some stabilization in the single-family starts," Piretti said. "We have probably reached a bottom and we should begin to see some signs of improvement in the second half of the year." Markets were also bolstered as the cost of borrowing dollars between banks plumbed lifetime lows and a key credit spread narrowed to its tightest in over a year, reflecting a return of confidence in money markets nurtured by central banks. "It's becoming much easier to borrow cash, thanks to many programs, quantitative easing, Fed programs," said David Keeble, head of interest rate strategy at Calyon in London. The record low Libor rates drove the two-year U.S. swap spread to 36 basis points, its narrowest since late February 2007, before the start of the global credit crisis. The tight spread suggests a gradual healing in credit markets. European shares rose to their highest close in more than four months, driven by optimism about a financial sector recovery. Also lifting regional shares was a closely watched ZEW survey showed German investor sentiment rose to its highest level in nearly three years, underscoring various surveys showing improvement in investor morale. "There is a very strong conviction now that recovery lies ahead and that earnings are going to come through and it is not going to budge until there is some real disappointing news flow," said Mike Lenhoff, strategist at Brewin Dolphin. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares rose 1.2 percent to close at 872.09 points, its highest close since January 7. Oil prices rose on buying inspired by gains on Wall Street and a flurry of U.S. refinery problems leading into peak summer driving season. Commodities markets have closely tracked the stock market in recent months as dealers seek signs of economic health. A fire broke out at part of Flint Hills Resources' 288,126 barrel a day Corpus Christi, Texas refinery, local police said. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 32 cents to $59.35 a barrel. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 1/32 in price to yield 3.24 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note rose 1/32 to yield 0.89 percent. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.40 percent at 82.209. Against the yen, the dollar was down 0.14 percent at 96.11. The euro rose 0.38 percent at $1.3606. Gold was firmer in Europe as an unexpected fall in U.S. housing starts to record lows in April sharpened risk aversion, supporting the metal's appeal as a safe store of value. Spot gold prices rose $8.15 to $925.35 an ounce. Asian shares climbed to their highest level in seven months on fresh hopes the global recession is easing. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 3 percent to its highest since October, while Japan's benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  closed up 2.8 percent.
