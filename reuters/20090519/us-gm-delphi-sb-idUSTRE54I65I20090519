 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp will likely take on some of the operations of its bankrupt supplier Delphi Corp to make sure it gets needed auto parts, and is negotiating terms with Delphi's estate, according to a source familiar with the company's plan. 

 GM, which is widely expected to file for bankruptcy in the next two weeks, is expected to sell its healthiest assets into a new company free of most liabilities, said the source, who was not authorized to speak publicly. (Reporting by  Chelsea Emery  and Tom Hals; editing by John Wallace)
