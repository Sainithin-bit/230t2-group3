 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Australian investment firm Babcock & Brown Ltd BNB.AX bought offshore wind power developer Bluewater, which is seeking to build a wind farm off the coast of Delaware expected to cost about $1.6 billion. 

 In a pair of releases Thursday, the companies said Bluewater would continue to negotiate a power purchase agreement with Pepco Holdings Inc's ( POM.N ) Delmarva Power subsidiary. Babcock & Brown and Bluewater did not disclose the terms of the acquisition, the Bluewater spokesman said. The proposed 150-turbine, 450-megawatt wind farm would provide enough energy for as many as 100,000 households in Delaware. The turbines would be located 11 miles offshore so they will be difficult to see, Bluewater said on its web site. In July 2005, Delaware adopted a Renewable Portfolio Standard requiring that 10 percent of the state's electricity come from renewable sources by the year 2018, according to the Bluewater web site. Delmarva issued a request for proposals in November 2006 to buy power from a plant located in Delaware as per state legislation. This year, several state agencies authorized Delmarva to start negotiating a power purchase agreement with Bluewater. If the negotiations with Delmarva are successful, Bluewater has said the wind farm could start generating some power as soon as the third quarter of 2011, pending state and federal regulatory approvals. Bluewater, of Hoboken, New Jersey, was part of Arcadia Windpower, of New York. Bluewater also has projects in various stages of development in Rhode Island, New York and New Jersey. Babcock & Brown, of Sydney, manages more than $50 billion in assets. It manages more than 1,200 MW of wind power directly or though its family of funds, including 18 wind farms in eight states.
