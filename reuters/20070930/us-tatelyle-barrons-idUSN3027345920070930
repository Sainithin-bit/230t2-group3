 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sugar and sweetener maker Tate & Lyle Plc ( TATE.L ) may be vulnerable to a takeover from a big food company such as Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ), according to a Barron's report. 

 The report in the October 1 edition followed a 30 percent drop in Tate & Lyle shares to a three-year low on Friday after it issued a profit warning arising from higher corn costs, a corn gluten export ban and a weaker dollar. To avoid a takeover it would need to diversify more quickly into higher-margin ingredients, according to the report, but "even then, it might still be an attractive bolt-on target for a food giant like Nestle with the financial clout to weather" commodity-price volatilities that have hurt Tate & Lyle. Shareholders of the London-based company may not want to give Chief Executive Iain Ferguson more time to turn the company around, the report said.
