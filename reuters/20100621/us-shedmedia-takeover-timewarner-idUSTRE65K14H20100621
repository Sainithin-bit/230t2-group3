 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - British television production company Shed Media SHDP.L on Monday confirmed it was in talks to sell itself to Warner Bros Entertainment Inc, a unit of Hollywood media group Time Warner ( TWX.N ). 

 The Sunday Times had reported that Time Warner planned to acquire Shed Media, the maker of shows such as Supernanny and Footballers' Wives, for about 75 million pounds. There was no certainty of an offer or its terms, Shed Media said in a statement. It declined to comment further on the deal. Last year, the company had received an indicative offer approach from a consortium formed by funds managed by Bowmark Capital LLP and Darwin Private Equity LLP, which was working with certain members of Shed's management. Shed Media, on June 8, said it had ended offer talks with the two private-equity funds, but continued to be in an offer period following a proposal from a potential suitor. On April 7, the company posted a 24 percent rise in full-year pretax profit, helped by lower finance costs, and said 2010 had begun well. Shed Media shares, which have gained about 12 percent in the past six months, were trading up 5.8 percent at 82.5 pence at 1215 GMT.
