 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil giant BP said on Monday the cost of its response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill had hit $2 billion and that it had paid out $105 million in damages to those affected by the disaster. 

 BP added in a statement that it rejected claims by its partner in the oil well, Anadarko Petroleum, that it had been negligent in the way it executed the well. BP agreed last week to place $20 billion in a fund to compensate victims of the oil spill. (Editing by Sharon Lindores)
