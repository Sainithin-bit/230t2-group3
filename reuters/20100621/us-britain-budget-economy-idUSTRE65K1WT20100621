 LONDON  (Reuters) - In its first budget on Tuesday, Britain's six-week-old coalition government faces the challenge of slashing a deficit of nearly 11 percent of GDP without snuffing out a fragile recovery. 

 The spending squeeze penciled in by the previous Labour government already looked painful, yet rating agencies have warned even bigger cuts may be needed for Britain to keep its 'AAA' credit rating. Finance minister George Osborne has committed to base his projections on macro-economic assumptions from a newly-created independent watchdog -- the Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR published its first set of forecasts last week based on the previous government's policy stance and will update them on Tuesday to take the budget measures into account. FISCAL MANDATE Finance minister George Osborne has pledged a "significantly accelerated" pace of fiscal tightening, and will spell out exactly what he means by this. He is likely to announce plans to eliminate the structural deficit by 2015, when the next election is due. Using the OBR's projections, the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank reckons this target will require fiscal tightening of 34 billion pounds a year by 2015 to be met comfortably, in additional to the 51 billion pounds already envisaged by former finance minister Alistair Darling. GROWTH PROJECTIONS The OBR's verdict was that Labour had been too optimistic on its growth forecasts. It revised down next year's projected growth to 2.6 percent from the previous mid-point forecast of 3.25 percent. The tightening measures contained in the budget are likely to prompt a further downward revision, bringing 2011's forecast more in line with the consensus forecast of 2.1 percent. For 2012 and 2013, the OBR expected the economy to expand by 2.8 percent -- again lower than the previous government's forecasts -- before slowing to 2.6 percent in 2014. There is a chance growth projections toward the end of the forecast horizon could be revised higher, underlining the government's argument that state cutbacks will unleash private sector potential and keep interest rates lower for longer. BORROWING The OBR, which calculates borrowing using the central growth forecast rather than a more cautious estimate used by the previous government, expects public borrowing to fall slightly faster than predicted in Labour's last budget. Thanks to lower unemployment and higher tax receipts than expected, the OBR reckons borrowing this year will come in at 155 billion pounds -- or 10.5 percent of GDP -- below the 163 billion envisaged in Labour's March budget. By 2014/15 it reckons public borrowing will have fallen to 3.9 percent of national income, just below the 4 percent predicted by Labour in March. But Osborne is aiming for an even faster pace of deficit reduction, and borrowing forecasts are likely to be revised even lower once the budget measures are taken into account. GILTS ISSUANCE The government's austerity drive and a recent improvement in tax receipts is likely to lead to a downward revision to the amount of gilt sales scheduled for this year. Analysts polled by Reuters expect gilt issuance in 2010/11 to be revised down to 165 billion pounds -- more than 20 billion pounds lower than forecast in March and some 60 billion pounds less than in fiscal 2009/10.
