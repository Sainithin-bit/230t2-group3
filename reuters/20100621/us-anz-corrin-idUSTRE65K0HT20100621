 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - ANZ ( ANZ.AX ) has hired John Corrin from GE Capital to spearhead its loans efforts in the Asia Pacific region, the latest in a series of high-profile strategic hires geared at grabbing market share. The bank has been expanding aggressively in Asia, both through strategic hires and a series of acquisitions, including the wealth management and commercial banking assets of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) in Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. Under CEO Mike Smith, ANZ has said it wants to earn a fifth of its profits in Asia by 2012, and increasingly competes in the region against rivals such as HSBC. According to sources at GE Capital, veteran syndicator Corrin, the bank's head of capital markets for Asia Pacific and the chairman of the region's loan markets association, resigned his post on June 18. According to sources at ANZ, Corrin will become the Australian bank's global head of loan syndications, with the task of building out its Asia Pacific loan business. He is expected to start his new role sometime in July. The bank's corporate communications spokesman confirmed the appointment, but declined to comment further. Corrin's hire follows the promotion of Siong Ooi, ANZ's former head of syndications Asia, who is now head of markets Northeast Asia. In his new role, he will report to Cathryn Carver, ANZ's Australia-based global head of capital markets. Corrin joined the then GE Commercial Finance (GECF) in 2007 as managing director and head of capital markets, to build out the institution's loan business in the region. Prior to joining GECF, Corrin was with Credit Lyonnais and then Calyon for a total of 10 years. Corrin came to Asia in 2001 as regional head of loan syndication for the then Credit Lyonnais, based in Hong Kong. He previously served as the French bank's head of distribution for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, based in London. (Additional reporting by Sharon Klyne; editing by  Valerie Lee )
