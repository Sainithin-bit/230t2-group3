 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton have won a key battle in their war against Australia's new mining tax, striking a side-deal with Canberra's political enemies in Western Australia state. 

 The deal with the conservative Western Australian government, unveiled on Monday, commits the world's second- and third-largest iron ore miners to pay higher royalties to the mining state in return for local approval of their $116 billion joint venture. It also: * Puts pressure on Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's center-left government to rethink the A$2 billion ($1.75 billion) that he promised Western Australia, the country's biggest mining state, from the proceeds of the proposed 40 percent mining-profits tax. Under the tax, opposed by both miners and Western Australia's government, the proceeds would be partly used to reimburse the sums paid by miners in royalties to state governments. By raising royalties, therefore, Western Australia could force the central government in Canberra to refund millions of dollars more in royalty rebates than originally envisaged. * Puts Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton, the world's second-largest and third-largest iron ore producers, a step closer to the proposed $116 billion combination of their west Australian iron ore operations. The two firms now have to negotiate competition and shareholder approvals. * Makes it harder for rival miners such as Fortescue Metals and Atlas Iron to push for access to rail lines run exclusively by BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto to haul ore to the coast, as they now pay the same level of royalties. Previously, the two giants had paid a discounted royalty in recognition of their role in pioneering the iron ore industry, leaving them open to claims that their assets were effectively subsidized and should therefore be shared with all comers. * Could ease concerns among competition regulators that the joint venture would give it too much clout over pricing, compared with other miners emerging in Western Australia's massive iron ore belt. This is because the higher royalty rates may weaken the argument that the two giants enjoy an unfair advantage. The average output from the Pilbara region is about 70 percent fines.
