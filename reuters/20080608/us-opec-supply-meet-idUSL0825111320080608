 DUBAI  (Reuters) - OPEC has no plans to meet to discuss oil's surge to a fresh record, and would need to see a real supply threat to gather before the next scheduled meeting in September, an OPEC source said on Sunday. 

 Oil jumped nearly 9 percent to a peak over $139 a barrel on Friday, making its biggest one-day gain on record in dollar terms. Mounting tensions between Israel and Iran and a weakening U.S. dollar pushed the price up. "I don't think ministers will meet before September unless there is a real threat to supply," the OPEC source told Reuters. "They won't meet just to talk about price increases." Israel's deputy prime minister said in remarks published last week that an attack on Iran's nuclear sites looked "unavoidable". A senior Israeli defense official said on Sunday the remarks did not reflect Israeli policy. The dispute between OPEC-member Iran, the world's fourth-largest oil exporter, and the West over Tehran's nuclear ambitions has long supported oil prices amid concern that any escalation could disrupt supplies. OPEC officials have repeatedly blamed factors beyond their control for high prices such as Iran's nuclear dispute, speculation and the weak U.S. dollar. Oil prices have doubled in a year on growing Asian demand and as investors rushed into commodities as a hedge against the dollar's fall and inflation. OPEC is next scheduled to meet to discuss output policy on September 9. (Reporting by  Simon Webb ; Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
