 KUWAIT  (Reuters) - Kuwait's Agility ( AGLT.KW ), the Gulf's biggest logistics provider by market value, is set to sign a $2.5 billion deal with the U.S. army in July, a newspaper reported on Sunday. 

 The deal would include supplying food and providing logistics services, Arabic-language daily al-Seyassah said, without providing a source. Kuwaiti food retailer Sultan Center Food Co ( SCFK.KW ), which is affiliated with Agility, would be the biggest beneficiary of the deal by providing food to the U.S. army, the paper said. Neither company could immediately reached to verify the report.
