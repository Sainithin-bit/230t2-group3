 DUBAI  (Reuters) - A Swiss investment company said on Sunday it had made an offer to buy and relaunch Britain's business class-only airline Silverjet which collapsed last month. 

 Ireland-registered Kingplace, which is managed by Swiss trust and management company Heritage, said it was making the offer on behalf of private clients. "Kingplace can confirm that it has made an offer to (administrator) Begbies Traynor and Lawrence Hunt, CEO Silverjet, with a view to purchasing Silverjet," Ian Ilsely, director of Kingplace and chairman of Heritage, said in a statement. "We are excited at the prospect of acquiring Silverjet and resuming operations as quickly as possible with the existing staff... We will be investing in the future development and success of the brand. We will make a further announcement in due course." Silverjet was set up in early 2007 and flew 88,000 passengers in just over a year, operating services from London to New York and Dubai. It became the third business class-only airline flying between London and New York to collapse after failing to get an emergency $5 million (2.5 million pound) loan from Abu Dhabi-based investors. Record fuel prices and worsening economic conditions in Britain and the United States had buffeted the airline. "I am delighted to confirm that Kingplace is in conversation with Begbies Traynor about Silverjet resuming operations in the near future," Hunt said in the statement. "We hope to make an announcement in the near future about when we will be able to resume operations." (Reporting by Lin Noueihed, Editing by David Cowell)
