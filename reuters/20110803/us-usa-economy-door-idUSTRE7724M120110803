 (Reuters) - A sharp slowdown in the economy has rekindled fears of a new recession and some analysts see the country perilously close to tipping into contraction. 

 At the same time, others urge a few deep breaths and say a lot more evidence is needed before saying a recession is imminent. Most economists expect growth to pick up in the third quarter as the economy shakes off a spike in gasoline prices and the factory disruptions created by Japan's March earthquake. Still, recession risks appear to be rising as annualized growth hangs around stall-speed levels -- 0.4 percent in the first quarter and 1.3 percent in the second. "Whenever you're flying at this low of an altitude it doesn't take much of a jolt to bring the economy down," said Mark Vitner, an economist with Wells Fargo in Charlotte, North Carolina. Following are some thresholds economists say would need to be met for them to begin sounding a stronger recession alarm: * Goldman Sachs has a very simple rule it says would have predicted most post-war recessions: A recession is due within six months if the three-month average of the jobless rate rises 0.35 of a percentage point from a trough. By this measure, America is dangerously close to a tipping point, with the jobless rate only needing to increase to 9.3 percent in July and stay there in August to trip the threshold. Goldman, however, is not predicting this will happen. The unemployment rate stood at 9.2 in June; the government releases the July figure on Friday. * Setting a higher bar, Toronto-based economist Paul Dales of Capital Economics would need to see two consecutive months of falling private payrolls together with the ISM factory reading dropping below 45 for a month or two to be convinced. * Thomas Lam, an economist with OSK-DMG in Singapore, urged people not to get carried away and wants to see evidence in much more than any single indicator before predicting a recession. He might not make the call before the majority of U.S. states stopped growing -- Lam reckons 80 percent were expanding around mid-year. He would also like to see many more inflation-adjusted GDP components slowing than those which are accelerating, stripping out inventories. This isn't happening, he says. Another index of Lam's combines seven financial and economic indicators, and would need to see consumer spending, manufacturing output and stock prices all dropping before he would call recession imminent. Lam puts the current recession odds at under 20 percent. * Wells Fargo's Vitner says two straight monthly declines in non-farm payrolls or two straight monthly declines in a core of retail sales that excludes gasoline, autos and building materials should point to a recession within a half year. * Finally, Diane Swonk, an economist with Mesirow Financial in Chicago, is also looking out for shocks to the economy like a surge in national gasoline prices above $3.85 a gallon for more than a month. A downgrade in U.S. debt by Standard and Poor's could also push the U.S. over the edge, she says. "We're clearly skating on thin ice," said Swonk. (Reporting by  Jason Lange ; Editing by Andrew Hay)
