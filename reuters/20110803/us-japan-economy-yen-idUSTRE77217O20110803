 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese policy-makers kept up their verbal warnings to markets on Wednesday against pushing the yen up too much, while the Bank of Japan governor signaled its readiness to ease monetary policy further as early as this week. 

 PRIME MINISTER NAOTO KAN, at meeting on economic risks: "We have talked about overseas risks posed by the U.S. debt ceiling, Europe's debt crisis and the worries that many have about currency and stock market moves ... "Japan's economy is in the process of recovering from disaster. We must closely watch currency moves. "I hope (the BOJ) continues to closely work with the government and supports the economy on the financial front." FINANCE MINISTER YOSHIHIKO NODA, in parliament: "I don't think currency markets are reflecting economic fundamentals at all. We will continue to watch market moves carefully. "Among the factors behind the yen's rise are various overseas developments. But even as those developments have shown signs of progress, the trend has not changed. The yen is valued excessively in a one-sided manner ... "Regardless of whether we intervene in the currency market or not, the government wants to do its utmost to prevent the yen from rising further and to avoid the hollowing out (of Japan's economy). "The government's basic stance is to prevent a hollowing out (of Japan's economy) and I think the BOJ shares this resolve. The BOJ is expected to guide its monetary policy in a way that is in line with the government' economic and fiscal policy. In this regard, we need to keep in close contact with each other ... "I decline to comment on whether we will intervene or not and on the timing. "The dollar's weakness is due to a delay in the U.S. economic recovery and severe U.S. fiscal conditions. The yen is proving to be the second strongest (currency), only behind the Swiss franc. I don't see enough reasons for pushing the yen this high. "We need to absolutely avoid sending the message to markets that Japan's fiscal discipline is languishing, which would pose the risk of yen selling. If we face 'Japan selling' in currency, stock and bond markets that would be a severe national crisis. We want to avoid such a situation. "Intervention aims to affect market sentiment. If we were to intervene, we would do our utmost to ensure the action had maximum effect (on markets)." BOJ GOVERNOR MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA, in parliament: "Yen rises have some benefits such as pushing down raw materials costs ... But when uncertainty over the overseas economic outlook is strong, yen rises can have a negative impact on the economy by hurting exports, corporate revenues and business sentiment. We need to be especially mindful of this. "The BOJ of course is mindful of current yen rises. But current market moves appear to be more a broad dollar weakness rather than the yen strengthening ... When markets see risks to the global economy as heightening, investors tend to avoid risk. "At our next rate review on Thursday and Friday we will make an appropriate decision on monetary policy by carefully examining how recent yen rises affect the outlook for Japan's economy and prices. "We pride ourselves for conducting monetary policy boldly and aggressively ... Under current conditions, sharp yen rises could have a negative impact on Japan's economy, so we are watching developments carefully." ECONOMICS MINISTER KAORU YOSANO, to reporters: "The BOJ is already guiding overnight interest rates toward zero. It is up to them to consider what to do next with monetary policy. "I share the view that the yen's gains are excessive and have separated from its economic fundamentals."
