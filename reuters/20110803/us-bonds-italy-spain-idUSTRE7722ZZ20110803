 LONDON  (Reuters) - A surge in Italy's borrowing costs, which look set to overtake Spain's in coming weeks, shows markets are demanding profound changes to the way the euro zone works to resolve a crisis that is lapping at the gates of countries deemed to big to fail. 

 A European summit which agreed a second bailout for Greece last month failed to stem contagion, highlighted by a rise in Italian government bond yields to 14-year highs above 6 percent. "Italy is a critical phase, because if Italian yields continue to rise to 7 percent and they become totally unsustainable that really raises a question mark over the whole euro project," said Sanjay Joshi, head of fixed income at London and Capital. While analysts say Italy's economic fundamentals are not as bad as those of already bailed out states, as the third largest euro zone economy, it is too large to rescue with the bloc's existing mechanisms, posing stark choices for policymakers. "You've got to realize that this is a financial crisis, there not just about fundamentals. We are overshooting fundamentals by a large margin," Nomura strategist Laurent Bilke said. He cited an increase in the premium investors demand to hold triple-A rated French bonds rather than German benchmarks as a sign of heightened systemic risk. At 4.75 percent, Italy's two-year bond yields are already 12 basis points over Spain's and WestLB strategist Michael Leister said it could be just a matter of weeks before the 15 bps gap between 10-year yields is also erased and even reversed. "There is the risk that we have this self-fulfilling prophecy ... that we will reach this point of no return which in the case of Portugal or Ireland was between 6 and 7 percent for (10-year yields)." In fact, analysts say this point could be lower for Italy than, for example, Spain because Italy's debt burden is expected to reach about 120 percent of its economic output this year, while Spain's debt-to-GDP ratio is little over half of that, meaning Spain can afford higher funding costs for longer. The focus of market discontent with efforts to resolve the crisis had begun moving from previous target Spain to Italy even before the July 21 summit and has since shifted decisively. The summit pledged more cash for Greece and extended the reach of the European Financial Stability Facility rescue fund but did not increase its size beyond 440 billion euros -- deemed far too little for any bailout of Italy or Spain. "The endgame is whether Germany wants the euro to survive in this current format or do they want it to change? Do they want to retain all the members that it currently has or do they want some of them to disappear and constitute a new euro which is based on the heart of Europe?" Joshi at London and Capital, which has about $3.5 billion under management. Italy is being hit harder than Spain because of a massive shift in positioning, with investors who were overweight Italian debt -- and neutral or underweight Spain --trying to sell it in a market that is illiquid due to uncertainty over policymaking and the summer holidays. Italian debt, the second biggest in the euro zone, has a 23-24 percent weighting in European government bond indexes, compared with 9-10 percent for Spain, ING rate strategist Alessandro Giansanti said. "Spain had been already sold in the past, while Italy hadn't," he added. The last straw for markets was perceived hesitation over Italy's budget. CDS LAG The cost to insure Italy's debt against default is 50-60 basis points lower than Spain's across the curve, with Italian five-year credit default swaps at 368 basis points. That is not at all a sign that bonds are going the wrong way, analysts said, and liquidity is one of the factors slowing down the convergence of the CDS curves. Italy and Spain had been the most traded CDS spreads in the week ending July 22, according to data from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, with the gross notional amount traded at almost $10 billion and $9 billion, respectively. Meanwhile, data from Citigroup shows the spread between outright bond yields and yields implied by the country's CDS has narrowed to 38 bps in August, from about 55 bps at the start of the year, showing investors have been more interested in selling the bonds than buying protection for them. Also, those who try to sell the bonds find fewer buyers than those selling default protection. The 40 cents bid/ask spread for Italy's two-year bonds is four times higher than levels seen this year before July. "Investors had been overweight in Italian bonds, while this is not the case for CDS," said ING's Giansanti. But if the current hammering of Italy's bond markets continues, the default risk will rise along with borrowing costs, eventually sending Italy's CDS levels above Spain's.
