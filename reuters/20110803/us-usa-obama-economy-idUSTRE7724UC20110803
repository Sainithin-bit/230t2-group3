 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday it does not believe the U.S. economy is in danger of a double-dip recession. 

 But White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged at a news conference that growth has slowed as the economy grapples with the effects of high energy prices and other challenges, including the Japanese earthquake and the U.S. debt limit debate. "There have been a number of headwinds this year," he said. (Reporting by  Alister Bull  and  David Morgan ; Editing by  Doina Chiacu )
