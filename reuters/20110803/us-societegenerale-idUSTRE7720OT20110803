 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) showed the scars of its share of a Greek bailout in its second quarter results, helping to push its 2012 profit goal out of reach. 

 France's second-biggest bank said its aim of 6 billion euros ($8.55 billion) in net profit in 2012, reiterated as recently as May this year, would now be "difficult to achieve" because of a tougher economic and financial backdrop. SocGen's shares were down 7.6 percent at 30 euros by 0800 GMT, after tumbling to a two-year low of 29.52. It was the worst performer in a slightly weaker European bank index .SX7P after results undershot analysts' forecasts. The 6 billion euro ambition had long been doubted by analysts, who were forecasting a profit of 5.3 billion euros for that year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S Estimates. "The company finally admitted that it would not meet targets set out in its 2015 plan," a Paris-based trader said. "Analysts didn't believe they would meet the target, but the fact that they were flatly dropped without being revised or tweaked is clearly negative." The volte-face comes as economic concerns in the eurozone and the United States worsen, rattling global markets. Chief Executive Frederic Oudea defended the bank's performance as "solid," given the uncertain economic and financial environment, and said he remained "confident regarding the continuing growth of our results." Revenues and profits fell short of analysts' expectations due to a weak performance in asset management and a tougher quarter than expected in some of its core investment banking activities, including equities trading. The bank took a 395 million euro pretax hit on its exposure to Greece because of its contribution to a bailout plan, causing loan loss provisions to grow by 17.3 percent from a year ago to 1.185 billion euros. Private sector investors have agreed to take a 21 percent loss on their Greek sovereign bonds, and French rival BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) on Tuesday took a 534 million euro charge related to Greece, but its net income still held flat from a year ago. The provision proved harder for Societe Generale to absorb, and its second-quarter net income fell 31 percent from a year ago to 747 million euros, well below the 1.15 billion euro average forecast from analysts. "The results are below consensus, even without the Greek provision," said Alex Koagne, financial analyst at Natixis. In addition to its sovereign bond holdings, Societe Generale is also exposed to Greece via its Geniki ( GHBr.AT ) bank unit. Rival Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) last week warned its Greek unit, Emporiki CBGr.AT, would make a loss and said it would take an 850 million euro hit from Greece in the second quarter. CAPITAL CONCERN SocGen's weak revenues from fixed income and equities overshadowed a more resilient performance in other parts of the investment bank, analysts said. Fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) revenue fell 27 percent from the first quarter, broadly in line with the weak performance across the industry as bond trading slumped due to the euro zone crisis. Equities revenues fell 30 percent from the first quarter. The private banking and investment management division also weighed on the results, with revenues tumbling 7.6 percent from a year ago. Retail banking held up relatively well, with revenues in France and abroad growing, though group revenues were down 2.6 percent from a year ago. There remains the threat the bank could have to raise capital, especially as tougher Basel III capital rules are introduced, analysts said. SocGen said its core Tier 1 ratio improved to 9.3 percent at the end of June. "This appears robust, but on a like-for-like basis with peer banks, then SocGen has a Basel III ratio more like 7.2 percent by our analysis," said Joseph Dickerson, analyst at Espirito Santo. That would leave it short of its expected minimum level of 9 percent under new global rules, and could leave an equity deficit of nearly 8 billion euros, he said. Return on equity, a key measure of profitability, fell to 6.9 percent after tax, down from 10.9 percent a year ago. ($1=.7017 Euro)
