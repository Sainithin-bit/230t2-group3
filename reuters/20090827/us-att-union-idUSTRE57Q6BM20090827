 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and the Communications Workers of America union have reached a tentative agreement covering some 7,000 to 8,000 of telecommunications company's the U.S. core wireline employees. 

 Details of the deal are to be revealed on Friday, they said in separate statements on Thursday. A ratification vote is expected in coming days, the company said. Contracts covering another 65,000 CWA-represented employees in the east, southeast, and southwest U.S. districts are still being negotiated, the union said. The company said about 57,500 employees now have tentative or ratified agreements. The company announced two tentative, and one ratified, agreements with unions earlier this month. About 120,000 employees are covered under the various contracts, it said. AT&T shares were unchanged after the close of markets, when the deal was announced.
