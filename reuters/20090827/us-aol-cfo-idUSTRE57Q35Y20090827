 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc's ( TWX.N ) AOL division named a former Time Warner Cable Inc ( TWC.N ) executive as its chief financial officer ahead of the expected spinoff of the Internet unit later this year. 

 AOL said new CFO Arthur Minson, who was previously deputy CFO at Time Warner Cable, had the advantage of working on the earlier spinoff of TWC earlier this year. Before that he had been an AOL executive handling corporate finance. AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong said in an interview that while Minson's spinoff experience with the cable unit was important it was not the main reason for the appointment. "Artie has strong knowledge of the Internet, distribution, AOL and spinoffs but I was looking long term for operational leadership from our CFO," Armstrong said. Time Warner's spinoff of AOL, announced in May, is going through legal and regulatory process. AOL and Time Warner both expect the process to be completed by the end of the year.
