 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy shrank less than expected in the second quarter as smaller declines in consumer spending and exports offset record inventory cutbacks, data showed on Thursday, while corporate profits rose. 

 The Commerce Department said gross domestic product, which measures total goods and services output within U.S. borders, fell at a 1 percent annual rate, unchanged from last month's estimate. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast output shrinking at a 1.5 percent pace in the second quarter after collapsing 6.4 percent in the January-March quarter. U.S. stock index futures were flat after the data, while government bond prices were steady at lower prices. "The data shows that the economy isn't getting any worse, but that's already built into the market," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. With the second quarter contraction, real GDP has declined for four straight quarters for the first time since the government started keeping records in 1947. The Commerce Department's preliminary report also showed corporate profits after taxes rose 2.9 percent in the second quarter, likely a function of cost cutting measures by companies, after increasing 1.3 percent in the first three months of the year. That compared to analysts' forecasts for 3.1 percent growth. Businesses were more aggressive in reducing inventories in the second quarter than previously thought. Business inventories dropped a record $159.2 billion instead of the $141.1 billion estimated last month, lopping 1.39 percentage points from the overall GDP figure. Inventories fell by $113.9 billion in the first quarter. Excluding inventories, GDP rose 0.4 percent, the department said. However, the blow from the sharp decline in inventories was softened by a smaller-than-initially estimated drop in consumer spending. Consumer spending -- which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity - fell 1.0 percent in the second quarter rather than the 1.2 percent rate earlier estimated by the department. Also helping to minimize the decline in overall real GDP was the drop in exports which was not as steep as previously thought. Exports fell 5 percent rather than the 7 percent drop reported last month. Exports tumbled 29.9 percent in the first quarter. Residential fixed investment fell 22.8 percent in the second quarter, less steep than the 29.3 percent plunge estimated last month, the department said.
