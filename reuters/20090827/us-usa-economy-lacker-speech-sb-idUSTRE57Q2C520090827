 DANVILLE, Virginia  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy appears to have stabilized from a painful recession, and inflation seems more likely to rise than to fall, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Thursday. 

 "Conditions remain distressed in many industries and localities," Lacker said in remarks prepared for delivery to a business group. "Yet the economy appears to have leveled out and I believe we can look forward to better times ahead." As the economy steadies, Lacker said he believes the Federal Reserve must calibrate its purchases of long-term securities carefully to avoid providing too much stimulus.
