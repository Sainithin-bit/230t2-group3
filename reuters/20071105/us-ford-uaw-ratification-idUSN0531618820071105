 DEARBORN, Michigan  (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger said on Monday he hoped to wrap up the union's ratification vote on a proposed four-year deal with Ford Motor Co by next Monday. 

 Gettelfinger, speaking after union local officials unanimously endorsed the tentative deal, also said he did not expect Ford to announce any further job cuts in the wake of the contract. "We feel very comfortable with their commitment," Gettelfinger told Reuters as he was leaving the meeting with union officials. Gettelfinger said the union had "absolutely not" been aware of plans by Chrysler LLC to cut up to an additional 10,000 factory jobs. Chrysler announced those cuts last week, just days after workers approved a new contract with the automaker in a close-fought ratification vote.
