 LONDON  (Reuters) - British retailer J. Sainsbury's ( SBRY.L ) shares plunged 20 percent on Monday when it became one of the largest buyout casualties of the credit crisis. 

 Qatari fund Delta Two ditched plans for a 10.6 billion pound ($22 billion) bid for Britain's third largest supermarket group, blaming worsening credit markets and the cost of winning support from the firm's pension trustees for the failure of the deal. The shock outcome is the biggest collapse of a transaction involving a British company due to the global credit market gyrations triggered by the crisis related to poor quality U.S. mortgage loans. It follows confectioner Cadbury Plc CBRY.L reneging on the sale of its North American drinks unit, and pubs group Mitchells & Butlers ( MAB.L ) delaying a property spin-off. Odey Asset Management Chief Executive David Stewart told Reuters he had held a short position in Sainsbury's shares for some time believing the stock was overvalued. "We felt a lot of things had got overextended in terms of share prices on the back of takeovers that presumably won't take place," Stewart said. Delta Two still owns 25 percent of Sainsbury and was likely to keep the stake, because the credit market conditions would make it difficult to find a sole buyer, a person familiar with the matter said. The pullout marks the second failed bid for Sainsbury's in less than seven months. Private equity firm CVC Capital Partners CVC.UL abandoned a takeover attempt in April, following opposition from the Sainsbury family, which owns about 18 percent of the supermarket group. SHARES PLUNGE Sainsbury shares closed down 20.7 percent at 440 pence, its lowest level since February 2, the day the CVC-led consortium said it was considering making a bid for the retailer. It brought Delta Two's investment to a loss of more than 570 million pounds, the fund having bought most of its stake at around 575 pence a share. Prior to Delta Two's pullout, Sainsbury shares were nearly two times more expensive than the European retail industry average .SXRP, according to Reuters Estimates. Without the bid speculation investor focus returns to Sainsbury's restructuring under Chief Executive Justin King who is seeking to boost sales by 3.5 billion pounds as it expands into non-food including clothing. Seymour Pierce analyst Andrew Wade said although the Sainsbury management team had done an excellent job starting the recovery and driving sales growth, "there is much still left to do" and the share price was substantially overvalued. Cazenove analysts said they expected the stock to settle at around 480 pence per share. Sainsbury said in a separate statement it had a strong future as an independent company and first-half results on November 14 would show sales in line with expectations for the full year. A Sainsbury family spokesman said it remained strongly supportive of the board, management and strategy. Fallout from the buyout collapse was felt across the sector with Wm Morrison Supermarkets ( MRW.L ), Britain's fourth-largest supermarket group and subject of earlier bid speculation, closing down 3 percent. Both Sainsbury and Morrison have attracted speculation about possible bids in part because of their rich property assets.
