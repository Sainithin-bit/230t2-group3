 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Burger King Holdings Inc BKC.N reported higher-than-expected profit on Monday, but its stock fell 3 percent after the No. 2 hamburger chain said private equity firms that own more than half its shares plan to unload part of their stake. 

 Burger King said funds controlled by TPG Capital, Bain Capital Partners and Goldman Sachs plan to make a secondary offering of 23 million shares, reducing their holdings from about 58 percent of outstanding shares to about 41 percent. Burger King, the No. 2 chain behind McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ). said its quarterly results were helped by new chicken sandwiches on its menu, expanded store hours, and marketing promotions featuring the Simpsons and Transformers. It said net income rose 23 percent to $49 million, or 35 cents per share, in its fiscal first quarter that ended September 30, from $40 million, or 30 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts on average had been expecting 34 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total revenue for the quarter rose 10 percent to $602 million. Same-store sales, a key industry measure that tracks sales at restaurants open at least 12 months, rose 6.6 percent in the United States and Canada and 5.9 percent worldwide. Restaurant margins in the United States and Canada, which measure the profitability of individual outlets, rose 50 basis points, as higher same-store sales offset higher commodity costs. Miami-based Burger King said its tie-in with The Simpsons Movie drove sales of its Ultimate Double Whopper sandwich, while continued promotion of its BK Breakfast Value Menu helped drive sales in the morning, a time of day that has been dominated by McDonald's. It has also extended hours at some locations to drive sales late at night. In the last year, Burger King increased its net restaurant count by 146, bringing its total number of restaurants to 11,290 as of September 30. The company said for the first time in six years it expects net restaurant growth in fiscal 2008. Burger King shares were down 88 cents at $26.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.
