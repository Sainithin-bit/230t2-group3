 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A $20 increase in domestic round-trip air fares initiated last week by American Airlines AMR.N remained largely intact on Monday, according to a fare analyst who said the trend to higher fares may be near an end. 

 American, a unit of AMR Corp AMR.N, raised its fares to offset the soaring price of jet fuel, a top expense for all airlines. Rival airlines matched, although Continental Airlines CAL.N later rolled back about 40 percent of the increase in larger city pairs, said Rick Seaney, chief executive of fare tracker Farecompare.com, in a research note. Northwest Airlines NWA.N also matched but then withdrew 20 percent of the match. "I wouldn't be surprised to see one more attempted increase by the end of the year, especially if fuel prices surge," Seaney told Reuters. "I do believe with the recent media attention on increases that the airlines are close to the end of the rope with consumers on increases for this year." The price of jet fuel is directly related to the price of NYMEX crude oil, which notched an all-time high last week above $96 a barrel. Airlines have initiated several fare increases this year to pass on that expense to travelers. Fare hikes are successful only if matched by competitors. The airline industry is recovering from a years-long downturn that began in 2001 with the September 11 attacks. Low-fare competition and rising fuel prices have exacerbated airline woes. Last year, carriers began cutting capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- and raising fares. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson)
