 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sysco Corp ( SYY.N ) posted a 16 percent increase in quarterly profit on Monday as cost-cutting measures and a shift in timing for recording stock-based compensation helped offset soaring food prices. 

 The company, which distributes food and other supplies to restaurants, cafeterias and other food service outlets, said profit was $267 million, or 43 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter ended September 29, compared with $230.1 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast 42 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8.5 percent to $9.41 billion though 5.9 percentage points of the increase was due to rising food costs. Food manufacturers have been increasing prices in recent quarters due to soaring costs for ingredients like wheat and milk and rising oil prices. First-quarter profit included $16.3 million less in share-based compensation expense because of the move of the stock option grant date to the second quarter from the first quarter, Sysco said. The company did take a $9.4 million charge in the first quarter to account for a future pension contribution, Sysco said. Sysco spent $131.5 million on capital improvements like facility replacement and expansion, new trucks and a new distribution center. The company still plans capital expenditures of $625 million to $650 million for the entire year. Sysco shares closed Friday at $33.51 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 8.8 percent this year.
