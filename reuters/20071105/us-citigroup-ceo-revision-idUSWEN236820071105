 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said on Monday that it had revised lower its third-quarter earnings per share to 44 cents from a previously reported 47 cents. 

 Citi said the lowered third-quarter earnings reflected the correction on the valuation of $43 billion in exposure to collateralized debt obligations backed by asset-backed securities. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb  and  Jon Stempel )
