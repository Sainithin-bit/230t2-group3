 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Major Wall Street banks and brokerages, struggling under the weight of large subprime mortgage holdings whose value has plunged steeply, may take additional write-downs of between $30 billion and $40 billion in the fourth quarter, a top analyst predicted on Monday. 

 "Everybody will have write-downs in the fourth quarter," Charles Peabody, partner at New York-based research firm Portales Partners LLC, said at the Reuters Finance Summit in New York. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank by assets, has said it expects to write down between $8 billion and $11 billion for subprime mortgages, and cut its previously reported third-quarter profit due to worsening credit market problems. Citigroup's write-downs mostly relate to its $43 billion of collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, whose value is tied to subprime mortgages. Peabody said he expects more write-downs from Citigroup. He also said there may be write-downs at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), which posted a 79 percent increase in third-quarter profit in September. He said banks like Goldman and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N may not have hedged their mortgage exposure sufficiently to avoid write-downs. "When Lehman reported third quarter, we said it's a quarter not to be believed," Peabody said. "I really don't believe those two organizations have come clean." Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N was the only big Wall Street firm to post a third-quarter loss after writing down $8.4 billion on investments linked to subprime mortgages that turned sour. Goldman, Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Lehman have collectively written down $3.6 billion so far. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das , editing by Braden Reddall)
