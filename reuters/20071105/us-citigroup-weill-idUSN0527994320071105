 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sanford "Sandy" Weill, who built Citigroup Inc into the largest U.S. bank, is not interested in returning to run the company, but is willing to do what is needed to help, CNBC television said. 

 Weill's hand-picked successor, Charles Prince, resigned Sunday as chairman and chief executive, as Citigroup said it expected to write down as much as $11 billion this quarter for subprime mortgage losses. Weill stepped down as Citigroup's chief executive in 2003, and stepped down as chairman in 2006. He now spends much of his time on philanthropic pursuits.
