 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc ( CAH.N ) reported an 11 percent rise in quarterly earnings on Monday but said results at its biggest unit were disappointing and that the unit's head would leave. 

 The company's shares fell more than 6 percent in early trading. Net income rose to $301.8 million, or 82 cents per share, in the first quarter ended September 30 from $270.7 million, or 66 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings were 86 cents per share, matching the analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 5 percent to $22 billion. While the Dublin, Ohio-based company reiterated its overall earnings forecast for the full year of $3.95 to $4.15, it lowered its outlook for its Healthcare Supply Chain Services-Pharmaceutical segment, its biggest unit, which is responsible for distributing drugs and related health-care products to more than 33,000 pharmacies. The company's chief executive, Kerry Clark, said in a statement that he was disappointed with the performance of the unit and that its chief executive, Mark Parrish, is leaving the company immediately. Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Henderson will assume the additional role of interim CEO of the unit until a successor is named. "The news of weakness and management turnover in the drug distribution business is not comforting but if there is a silver lining it is that CEO Kerry Clark appears to be holding business unit heads accountable for results," David Veal, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, said in a research report. Profit in the pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution segment increased 6 percent to $305 million, with revenue rising 4 percent to $19.2 billion, a growth rate that was hurt by moderating sales of prescription drugs and fewer launches of generic medicines. The company lowered its outlook for profit growth in the unit to below 7 percent for the period from a prior forecast of 7 percent to 10 percent. Profit at the company's Healthcare Supply Chain Services-Medical unit, which is responsible for distributing products from more than 2,000 manufacturers to hospitals, surgery centers, laboratories and physician offices, fell 10 percent to $58 million, mainly due to a change in corporate cost allocation. Revenue rose 6 percent to $1.9 billion on improving demand. Even though profit was weak, as expected, "the good news is that the ongoing turnaround appears on track," Veal said. Profit at the Clinical Technologies and Services segment, which makes medical and surgical products such as instruments, gloves and masks, rose 91 percent to $98 million, with revenue rising 9 percent to $649 million. The company's shares were down $3.69, or 5.5 percent, to $63.22 in early trading on Nasdaq after dropping to $62.35. (Additional reporting by  Toni Clarke )
