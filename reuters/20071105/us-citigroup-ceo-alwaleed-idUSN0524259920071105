 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal favors bringing back Sanford "Sandy" Weill to lead Citigroup Inc on an interim basis, CNBC television said on Monday. 

 Citigroup late Sunday announced the resignation of Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Prince and said it may record an $11 billion write-down for subprime mortgages. Robert Rubin, who had chaired Citigroup's executive committee, was named chairman, while Sir Win Bischoff, who heads Citigroup Europe, was named acting chief executive. Alwaleed, Citigroup's largest individual investor, had long publicly supported Prince. He withdrew that support last Thursday once it became clear Citigroup would report a big write-down, CNBC said. Weill stepped down as Citigroup chief executive in 2003 and as chairman in 2006. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Edward Tobin)
