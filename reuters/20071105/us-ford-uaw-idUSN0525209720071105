 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) agreed to keep three U.S. plants open and pour significant new investment into its other manufacturing facilities as part of a tentative contract with the United Auto Workers, union officials briefed on the deal said on Monday. 

 Under the tentative deal, Ford would pull back from a plan to shutter six U.S. facilities that it had not yet identified, sparing three of those from closure, officials said. In exchange, Ford would be able to hire up to 20 percent of its work force under a lower-tier wage structure that promises to slash its hourly wage costs, one UAW official said. The facilities Ford pledged to keep running included two assembly plants dedicated to sport-utility vehicles -- one in Louisville, Kentucky, and one in Wayne, Michigan, a union official said. The Michigan plant makes the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator. Its Louisville plant makes the Ford Explorer. Taken together, the plants employ about 4,500 people. Representatives of UAW local bargaining units were meeting with the union's negotiating team near Ford's Dearborn, Michigan, headquarters on Monday to review details of the proposed contract. The tentative contract must be approved by a majority of Ford's 58,000 UAW-represented workers in ratification votes expected to start as soon as this week. UAW officials who discussed provisions of the proposed Ford contract asked not to be named. Ford, which is scheduled to report third-quarter financial results this week, has declined to comment on the details of the tentative agreement until it is reviewed by union workers. Earlier on Monday, a top Ford executive said the labor deal would help the automaker cut costs, particularly in retiree health care and by applying flexible work rules. "I can say with conviction it's fair for employees (and) retirees," said Mark Fields, president of Ford's Americas division. "And it allows us to increase our competitiveness." After a marathon bargaining session that ended Saturday, Ford and the UAW reached an agreement featuring lower wages for new hires and the establishment of a trust to take over the embattled automaker's retiree health care costs. It was not immediately clear how much Ford had agreed to pay into that trust, which follows the pattern set by contracts the union just completed with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Chrysler LLC. The Detroit News reported the UAW had agreed to allow Ford to set up its trust fund for retiree health care with proportionally less cash upfront than the union won from GM. JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said the union appeared to have agreed to give Ford additional concessions relative to its larger rival. "On balance, it seems that Ford may have received the additional concessions needed to compensate it for its younger existing work force relative to GM," he said in a note to clients. Ford, which lost a record $12.6 billion last year, has indicated it was looking for approval to cut between 8,000 and 10,000 factory jobs. That would be in addition to the 27,000 union jobs it had eliminated through voluntary buyouts and early-retirement offers as of June. Ford's obligation for retiree health care has been estimated near $22 billion. Last year, Ford pledged all its major assets, including its familiar blue oval logo, as collateral in a $23 billion borrowing program to fund its restructuring. Ford's U.S. sales have dropped almost 14 percent this year. The overall market for new car and truck sales has weakened since the spring, and Fields said indicators pointed to "more risk than opportunity" for the industry in 2008. (Editing by  Braden Reddall )
