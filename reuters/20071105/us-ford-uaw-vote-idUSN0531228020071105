 DEARBORN, Michigan  (Reuters) - Representatives from local bargaining units of the United Auto Workers union on Monday voted unanimously to endorse a tentative, four-year contract with Ford Motor Co, union officials leaving a closed-door meeting on the deal said on Monday. 

 The endorsement by UAW local officials sets the stage for a ratification vote by the roughly 58,000 UAW-represented workers at Ford. The contract must be ratified by a majority in order to take effect. The UAW and Ford reached the terms of the tentative contract early Saturday after a marathon bargaining session.
