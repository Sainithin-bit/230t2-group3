 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ) Chief Executive Barry Diller said on Monday he is open to discussions about options for the Internet conglomerate's business divisions before they are spun off. 

 "We're up for anybody talking to us about anything," Diller said during a conference call to discuss plans to spin off four of IAC's biggest divisions, including its HSN shopping network.
