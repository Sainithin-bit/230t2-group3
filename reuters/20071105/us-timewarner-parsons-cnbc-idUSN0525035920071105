 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc Chief Executive Richard Parsons will step down and be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Bewkes, CNBC reported on Monday. 

 Bewkes, identified as the heir apparent since 2005, will take over the CEO job on January 1, CNBC said. Parsons will remain as chairman, according to the report, which said the plans will be announced later in the day. The move comes at a time when investors are demanding Time Warner take drastic measures to boost its sluggish stock price, which has fallen back to approximately the same levels as when Parsons took over the company five years ago.
