 ZURICH  (Reuters) - First-quarter net profit at ABB ( ABBN.VX ) more than doubled to $537 million, the Swiss engineering group said, beating expectations by far as demand for its power generation and industrial tools thrives. 

 Sales were up 21 percent to $6.22 billion, the group -- which sells equipment to utility oil and gas firms -- also said on Thursday, while orders were 26 percent stronger, at $8.64 billion. The average forecast in a Reuters poll of 19 analysts was for net income to rise to $434 million from $204 million a year ago, while sales were penciled in 15 percent higher at $6.2 billion and orders at $8.0 billion.
