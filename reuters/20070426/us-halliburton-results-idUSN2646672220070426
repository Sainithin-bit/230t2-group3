 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Oil services company Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ) said on Thursday its first-quarter net profit rose 13 percent, helped by pricing gains and new contracts from customers in international markets. 

 Halliburton reported a 2007 first-quarter net profit of $552 million or 54 cents a share, compared with $488 million, or 46 cents a share in the same quarter a year earlier. The 2007 net profit includes the results of engineering and construction firm KBR Inc. ( KBR.N ), which Halliburton split off as a separate company earlier this month. Net income from continuing operations rose to 52 cents per share from 42 cents per share a year earlier, matching analysts' forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue in the quarter rose 17 percent to $3.4 billion from $2.9 billion a year before. The company attributed that increase to higher worldwide activity and its focus on investing in and expanding Eastern Hemisphere operations. The company in March said it will move its headquarters and Chief Executive Dave Lesar to Dubai to focus on growing its business in the Eastern Hemisphere. Even so, Mark Urness, an analyst with Calyon Securities, said Halliburton's revenue growth lagged that of its peers in the quarter, as others posted gains of 20 percent or more. "Baker Hughes (Inc. ( BHI.N )), Weatherford (International Ltd. ( WFT.N )) and Schlumberger (Ltd. ( SLB.N )) last week had good results, while Halliburton's are just ho-hum," Urness said. Halliburton said lower-than-expected drilling activity in Canada hurt some segments of its business. "This quarter marks the start of a new chapter in Halliburton's history as we completed the separation of KBR, Lesar said in a statement. "We are now completely focused on the global growth opportunities in our energy services business. KBR, which is the Pentagon's largest contractor in Iraq, had been a drag on Halliburton's earnings. KBR has drawn scrutiny from auditors, congressional Democrats and the U.S. Justice Department for the quality and pricing of its work for the U.S. Army. Halliburton's operating income in North America, the company's biggest market, was near unchanged at $494 million versus $493 a year before, although revenues there grew to $1.67 billion from $1.51 billion. By contrast, Europe, Africa and the former Soviet states saw nearly a 50 percent increase in operating income to $149 million from $100 million a year earlier, while revenues there rose to $783 million from $607 million. In the Middle East and Asia, the company reported revenue rose to $563 million, up 21 percent from a year earlier. Operating income in the region climbed to $127 million from $103 million in the same period a year earlier.
