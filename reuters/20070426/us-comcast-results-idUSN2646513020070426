 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), the leading U.S. cable operator, on Thursday said quarterly profit rose 80 percent, fueled by subscriber growth and a gain from dissolving a partnership with Time Warner Cable Inc. ( TWC.N ). 

 Comcast's first-quarter numbers were in line or slightly above Wall Street forecasts with strong growth in subscriber additions to its digital television and phone services. But Comcast shares, which have rallied about 8.3 percent this month, eased down 1.2 percent in premarket trading to  $27.75. Net profit rose to $837 million, or 26 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $466 million, or 15 cents per share a year earlier. The results were boosted by a $300 million gain from the dissolution of its Texas/Kansas cable system partnership with Time Warner Cable. Without the gain, Comcast's profit was $537 million, or 17 cents per share, in line with the average Wall Street analyst forecast of $526.8 million, or 17 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue in the first quarter rose 32 percent to $7.39 billion from $5.60 billion. Analysts had forecast $7.36 billion. But free cash flow for the quarter fell to $442 million from $807 million a year ago as Comcast ramped up spending to deliver more products to its subscriber base. "These were very strong numbers both on the customers and financials," said Thomas Eagan, an analyst at Oppenheimer. Comcast added 75,000 basic video subscribers during the quarter compared with 50,300 a year ago. It beat a forecast by Kaufman Bros analyst Todd Mitchell, who expected 50,000 additions. Comcast now has a subscriber base of 24.2 million. The total revenue-per-video customer for the quarter rose to $96.39 from $86.18. Digital TV subscribers rose 644,000, compared with an increase of 355,000 last year, while high speed Internet subscribers were up 563,000, compared with an increase of 511,500. Mitchell had forecast digital TV additions of 650,000, and high speed Internet additions of 450,000. Comcast added another net 478,000 phone subscribers, up from 163,000. Mitchell forecast net phone additions of 475,000. Comcast is leading the charge by cable operators to win subscribers from telephone companies by aggressively marketing bundled television, high-speed Internet and phone services.
