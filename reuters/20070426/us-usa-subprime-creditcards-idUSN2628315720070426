 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Delinquency rates for credit card payments have remained steady despite concerns they might rise due to U.S. consumer defaults on subprime mortgages, the head of the American Bankers Association told lawmakers on Thursday. 

 Theoretically, credit card delinquencies should rise in advance of mortgage defaults because consumers generally choose to be late on unsecured loans before a car or home loan, according to the group, which represents banks and major credit card issuers. "We have not seen this trend and fortunately do not see evidence of this in the most recent data," ABA President Edward Yingling said at a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing on credit card practices. Payments on non-mortgage consumer loans that were late 30 days or more were largely unchanged from the third quarter to the fourth quarter last year, Yingling said. Such late payments amounted to 4.56 percent in the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, compared with 4.57 percent in the third quarter, he said. The delinquency rate was actually higher at nearly 5 percent in July 2005, he said. Default rates for subprime mortgages -- loans to borrowers with poor credit history -- have jumped in recent months as the housing industry has slowed and prices have fallen. A government report last year found that American consumers hold more than 690 million credit cards. The bankers group said they represent more than $2.5 trillion in transactions a year. Congress has been looking at credit card company practices with an eye toward forcing changes to tiny-print disclosures, fees and interest rates. Some lawmakers and consumer groups say credit cards' over-the-limit and late fees are deceptive and predatory. "Despite borrowing money under one set of terms and conditions, a borrower can be asked to pay back that money under and entirely different set of conditions," Cindy Zeldin of the nonprofit group Demos told the House panel. The Federal Reserve has been reviewing credit card disclosure rules.
