 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ( HOT.N ), parent of chains that include St. Regis, Westin and Sheraton, said on Thursday that first-quarter profit rose, helped by higher room rates. 

 Net income increased to $122 million, or 56 cents per share, from $5 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier. The year-ago figure included a large one-time accounting-related charge. Excluding special items, the company said it earned 48 cents per share from continuing operations, compared with analysts' expectation of 39 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.
