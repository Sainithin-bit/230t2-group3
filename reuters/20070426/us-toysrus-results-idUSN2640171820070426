 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toys "R" Us Inc. on Thursday reported a 40 percent rise in quarterly earnings, helped by the closure of underperforming stores and lower markdowns. 

 The toy and baby products retailer said profit rose to $199 million in the fourth quarter ended on February 3 from $142 million a year earlier. The latest period included an extra week. The jump in earnings comes after Mattel Inc. MAT.N and Hasbro Inc. HAS.N, the two largest U.S. toy makers, reported surprisingly strong first-quarter results, raising expectations that 2007 would be a good year for an industry that has been rattled by shrinking sales and cut-throat price competition. Toys "R" Us, which was acquired in 2005 by a consortium that includes Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ), is revamping its business after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) have edged in on its territory in recent years. Operating under a new management team, Toys "R" Us has closed underperforming stores, tried to improve customer service and reduced clutter in its aisles. It is also trying to get a better supply of hot items, like Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii video game console, and avoid costly markdowns. The retailer has significantly increased its capital budget for the current fiscal year to support further store expansion and to continue merchandising improvements in its baby and juvenile business, Chief Executive Jerry Storch said in a statement. For the fourth quarter, net sales rose to $5.68 billion from $4.91 billion. Comparable-store sales rose 3.7 percent at the Toys "R" Us U.S. division and increased 2.7 percent at Babies "R" Us. Comparable-store sales were up 2.5 percent in the Toys "R" Us international division. Toys "R" Us' comparable-store sales measure sales at stores open at least 56 weeks. Toys "R" Us sells merchandise through more than 1,500 stores in the United States and abroad, while Babies "R" Us sells merchandise through 254 stores.
