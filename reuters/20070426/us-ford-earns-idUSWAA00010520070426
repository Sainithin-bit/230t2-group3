 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) posted a narrower-than-expected loss on Thursday, helped by cost-cutting and improved results from its European and luxury vehicle operations, sending its shares and bonds up sharply. 

 The results, which marked Ford's seventh consecutive unprofitable quarter, were far better than Wall Street expectations and brought the struggling automaker closer to its goal of returning to profitability by 2009. Ford also raised its second-quarter North American production forecast by 5 percent, to 810,000 vehicles. Analysts, however, questioned if the pace of financial improvement was sustainable at the No. 2 U.S. automaker amid a slack U.S. market for new vehicles. Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally acknowledged the automaker faced "many uncertainties going forward," including the weaker U.S. housing market, blamed by analysts for slowing demand for Ford's market-leading F-Series pickup trucks. The loss at Ford's core North American operations widened in the first quarter and the company said it still expected that more than half of its forecast $17 billion cash burn over its three-year restructuring effort would hit results this year. Ford also said its incentive spending -- discounts and rebates offered on slower-selling vehicles -- could rise in the current quarter. "First quarters are often characterized by low incentives, which help net pricing on wholesale basis, that can be reversed later in the year," Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said in a note to clients. JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said lower warranty costs had bolstered Ford's North American results, but questioned whether those gains could be sustained. "The underlying upside was still quite impressive," he said in a note for clients. Shares rose 34 cents, or 5 percent, to $8.23 in mid-day trading on the New York Stock Exchange after reaching the day's high of $8.38 earlier. General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) shares rose 2.16 percent, or 67 cents to $31.74. The gain in Ford shares was its largest single-day rally in percentage terms since October last year when the stock gained on optimism that Mulally could push the automaker's restructuring efforts faster than expected. Bonds also gained. Ford's benchmark 7.45-percent bonds due in 2031 on Thursday rose to 79.625 cents on the dollar, up from 78.75 cents a day earlier, according to MarketAxess. Ford, which is in the midst of closing 16 plants and cutting up to 45,000 jobs in North America, posted a net loss of $282 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier. Ford's loss from continuing operations, excluding one-time items, was 9 cents per share. The average Wall Street forecast had been for a loss of 60 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. First-quarter revenue totaled $43 billion, up from $40.8 billion a year earlier. Ford's automotive operations posted an operating loss of $225 million in the first quarter, while its financial services arm posted a profit of $294 million. EUROPE, LUXURY BRANDS SHINE Automotive cash, including some pension assets, rose to $35.2 billion from $33.9 billion a year ago. In North America, Ford lost $614 million during the quarter. Those losses were partly offset by cost savings of $500 million, including $400 million in North America. Ford's first-quarter U.S. sales fell 13 percent, and sales of its high-margin F-Series pickup slid 14 percent. Its U.S market share fell to 15.1 percent from 17.2 percent a year earlier. Ford said it had cut 18,000 jobs in North America, bringing cumulative cost savings under its turnaround plan to $1.9 billion. The automaker has set a goal of cutting $5 billion in recurring costs. Ford's European and luxury operations, dubbed the Premier Automotive Group, posted improved results in the first quarter on stronger volume and pricing. Ford of Europe had pretax profit of $219 million, while Premier posted record pretax profit of $402 million. During the quarter, Ford reached an agreement to sell its British sports car unit, Aston Martin. It also sold one of the units of its former parts subsidiary, Visteon Corp.( VC.N ), that it took back in a bailout deal, and clinched deals to sell two more of the struggling Visteon businesses.
