 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer products maker Newell Rubbermaid Inc. ( NWL.N ) reported lower first-quarter profit on Thursday due to higher costs and the effect of one-time tax items. 

 The maker of Rubbermaid containers and Goody hair care products had net income from continuing operations of $65.1 million or 23 cents a share, compared with $130.2 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier.
