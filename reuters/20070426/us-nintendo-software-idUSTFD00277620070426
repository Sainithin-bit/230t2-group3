 OSAKA, Japan  (Reuters) - Japanese video game maker Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS said on Thursday it aims to double its combined annual Wii and DS software sales to 300 million units, without giving a specific time frame. 

 "As a mid-term target it would be appropriate for us to establish a market in which we can sell about 300 million units of DS and Wii software," Nintendo President Satoru Iwata told a news conference in Osaka.
