 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.PA NYX.N said on Thursday that first-quarter profits at NYSE Group more than doubled, helped by higher revenue and lower fixed operating expenses. 

 NYSE Group's net income rose to $67.6 million, or 43 cents a share from $30.3 million, or 24 cents a share in the same period last year, on revenue up 54.3 percent at $701.97 million. NYSE Euronext said that because the merger between NYSE Group and European stock exchange operator Euronext NV was consummated on April 4, the first-quarter results include the full-quarter results from the operations of NYSE Group only. Fixed operating expenses on a non-GAAP basis decreased 20 percent to $229 million, it said. Excluding the effect of activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees, the pre-tax margin of NYSE Group on a non-GAAP basis was 24.3 percent of total revenues for the quarter, compared with 21.9 percent for the year-ago quarter. In the first quarter NYSE had 72 new listings, including six initial public offerings by U.S. companies, it said.
