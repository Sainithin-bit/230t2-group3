 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Wendy's International Inc. WEN.N on Thursday defended the hamburger chain's decision to consider putting itself up for sale, adding that it was the board's decision, not hers. 

 The company, which last year succumbed to pressure from billionaire investor Nelson Peltz to shed its secondary brands, said on Wednesday that its board of directors was reviewing strategic alternatives for its business. Investors cheered news of the review, sending Wendy's shares up as much as 18.4 percent on Thursday. CEO Kerrii Anderson told analysts on a Thursday conference call that the review was "a board-driven decision." When analyst Howard Penney of Prudential suggested that Anderson herself must have proposed the review to the board, she replied: "I wouldn't assume your assumptions are correct." Three of Wendy's board members were nominated by Peltz, but Wendy's said Thursday it would not identify the directors on the review committee except to say it was being led by Chairman James Pickett. All of the committee members are independent directors. Several analysts said they were surprised at the timing of Wendy's announcement, given that sales and profits were beginning to recover at the struggling chain. In response, Anderson said the board was responding to ideas it had received from shareholders and others about ways to boost shareholder value. On Wednesday, Wendy's said options under consideration included revising its strategy, changing to its capital structure, and a possible sale, merger or "other business combination." Meanwhile, Anderson said she and other members of Wendy's relatively new management team would keep pursuing the turnaround strategy put in place last year. At the same time, however, she warned that headwinds such as rising chicken and produce prices would pressure the company for the rest of the year. Wendy's expects chicken costs to rise between 3 percent and 5 percent for the rest of the year, while beef costs are forecast to be flat to down between 1 percent and 2 percent. Food costs will be higher than expected this year because demand for the fuel additive ethanol is driving up the price of corn, which affects feed and chicken prices, Wendy's said. Also on the call, Anderson said she was "concerned about the forecast for inflation increases and its effect on consumer spending." The stock rose as high as $38.70 before easing to $37.58, up $4.90, or 15 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange.
