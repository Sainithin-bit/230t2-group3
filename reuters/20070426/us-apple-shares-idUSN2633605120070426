 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Share of Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) rose nearly 5 percent on Thursday after the computer maker posted a better-than-expected 88 percent rise in earnings, spurring a handful of analysts to increase price targets on the stock. 

 Among those who raised their view of the company were Bear Stearns, which set a $143 target, Prudential, which set a $115 target, and WR Hambrecht, which set a $115 target. Apple's shares on the Nasdaq were up 4.9 percent at $99.99 after hitting $102.50 earlier in the session, the first time the stock has surpassed the $100 mark during regular trading hours. "Apple appears attractively priced in the context of its growth rate, returns and long-term potential to capitalize on the digital consumer opportunity," said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore, who raised his price target to $140. "We believe Apple's share price will be supported by continued strong customer uptake of iPods, iPhones and new Mac product roll-outs," he added in a note to clients. Even before the upbeat results, Apple shares had risen about 12 percent this year, after advancing 18 percent in 2006 and more than doubling in 2005. The bullishness from analysts and investors came in response to quarterly results reported after markets closed on Wednesday that showed big benefits from lower component costs and sales of MacBook laptops and iPod digital media players. Net income for the fiscal second quarter jumped to $770 million, or 87 cents per share, from $410 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. That beat by far Apple's own forecast, which tends to be cautious, of 54 cents to 56 cents. Second-quarter revenue rose 21 percent to $5.26 billion. "The key question is: Are we at the peak of EPS upside or is this sustainable?" wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. "We believe we are not at the peak of EPS upside, given we believe Apple is entering what will be the three strongest quarters in the company's history. ..." he added. Another analyst, Matthew Kather of WR Hambrecht, described the quarter as a "blowout" and said in a note that "new product offerings expected this year and beyond will continue to drive growth."
