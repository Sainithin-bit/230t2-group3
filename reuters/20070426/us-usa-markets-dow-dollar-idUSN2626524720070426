 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow's surge past the 13,000 mark for the first time this week unleashed a wave of superlative adulation among market cheerleaders and the financial media. 

 What's not to celebrate, after all. Nary six weeks after enduring the biggest one-day point loss since the September 11, 2001, attacks, the U.S. blue chip index was back on top of its game, setting a record high and crossing yet another psychological milestone. Too bad it only counts if you're a U.S. investor. Dating back to the birth of the current bull market in October 2002, if you had invested in the Dow from the euro zone, or, worse, say Brazil or New Zealand, your money's barely above water -- if that, in some cases -- let alone delivering a record return. Why's that? In a nutshell, the limp dollar. "The dollar is falling, and much of the stock market's rally is simply 'money illusion,'" says Richard Bernstein, chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch. In other words, he says, all we're seeing is that it takes a greater number of less-valuable dollars to buy the same asset. While a U.S.-based investor's money in the Dow nearly doubled over the past 4-1/2 years, those from overseas have not enjoyed anything close to that gain as the dollar shed value against many major currencies at nearly the same pace as U.S. share prices rose. A euro zone investor who got into the Dow in early October 2002 would have realized a gain of just over 30 percent, roughly a third of a U.S. investor's gain. That's because the euro has appreciated by more than 37 percent against the dollar over the same period, devaluing U.S. investments in the process. Here's more: In the past six months, as the Dow climbed the 1,000 points from the 12,000 level to 13,000, a European investor's money is virtually dead even. All thanks to the dollar's swoon. It's even more bleak if you're from New Zealand. A Kiwi investor in the Dow has a gain of less than 17 percent since October 2002, including a loss of 1.2 percent over the past six months. So has anyone from outside the United States fared well? Those countries with dollar-pegged currencies have enjoyed essentially the same return as a U.S. investor, as have those few whose currencies have weakened. A Japanese investor has kept pace with domestic U.S. investors over the Dow's bull run thanks to the equally wobbly yen. In fact, over the six months it has taken for the index to go from 12,000 to 13,000, a yen-based investor has a gain of about 10.5 percent, outperforming a dollar-based investor whose increase is 9.3 percent over that period. Still, the Japanese investor's story is the clear exception, not the rule. Take a look at the lot of a Brazilian. Thanks to the huge surge in the real, a Rio- or Sao Paolo-based Dow investor is still 6.5 percent in the red since October 2002. Says Bernstein: "In a global sense, the U.S. stock market's rally is not a growth story."
