 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - London-based music company EMI Group EMI.L appointed former Warner Music Group Chief Executive Roger Ames to lead its North American music division, a company spokeswoman said on Thursday. 

 Ames, who has been an adviser to the number three record company for about a year, will work out of offices in New York and Los Angeles. The spokeswoman said his appointment takes effect immediately. He will report to EMI Group Chief Executive Eric Nicoli. North America has been a weak spot in EMI's global operations in recent years where it has been losing market share to competitors. In January, the company that is home to Coldplay and Norah Jones cited "continued and accelerating deterioration in market conditions in North America" as a reason for cutting its music sales forecast. EMI's North American label heads, including Capitol Music Group's Jason Flom, will now report to Ames. EMI also confirmed the immediate departure of EMI North America Chief Operating Officer Ivan Gavin, according to the spokeswoman. EMI's North American operations were previously under David Munns, the former vice chairman of EMI Music ousted along with Alain Levy, chairman and chief executive of EMI Music, in January. Nicoli, who had been executive chairman, took on the role of group chief executive in January with direct responsibility for managing EMI Music. He is overseeing a restructuring of the business, which he hopes will help boost sales in North America and drive a strategy to grow digital music sales. Earlier this month EMI became the first major record company to drop copy protection software, known as digital rights management, which some critics argue has slowed down the take-up of digital music by consumers. Ames, a former long-time Warner Music executive, joins EMI while an offer by Warner Music Group WMG.N to buy EMI looms. EMI rejected Warner's last $4.1 billion bid in March, but the offer has not been formally withdrawn.
