 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - In a hot private equity market, a high-profile deal has put a chill on relations between JPMorgan and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., sources close to the matter say. 

 KKR's proposed $26 billion takeover of business services company First Data Corp. FDC.N sparked an unusual, behind-the-scenes dust up between the giant private equity fund and investment banking titan JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) The clash centers on the future of the Chase Paymentech Solutions LLC joint venture, of which JPMorgan owns 51 percent and First Data, 49 percent. Both KKR and JPMorgan want to keep their grip on the payment processor, which generates loads of cash. KKR KKR.UL reached out to JPMorgan before the buyout was announced on April 1 and assured the bank that it intended to keep the joint venture together, three sources involved with the deal say. JPMorgan pushed back, offering instead to buy out First Data's stake in the business, a proposal that sources say KKR flatly rejected. The dispute led to high-level talks between the two behemoths and has left each side with a bad taste in its mouth, sources say. In the end, KKR did the First Data deal without any advisory help or debt financing from JPMorgan. JPMorgan and KKR declined to comment. A decision has not been made on the future of Chase Paymentech, sources say. The First Data spat is the latest rift between JPMorgan and a major private equity client. The investment bank was shut out of Blackstone Group's pending $4 billion initial public offering, a curious omission given both the companies' long-time relationship and JPMorgan's underwriting strength. Private equity sources said one reason for JPMorgan's exclusion from the IPO was lingering ill will from the bidding war for Equity Office Properties Trust earlier this year. Blackstone did not look kindly on JPMorgan's backing of rival bidder, which lost the deal, but forced the buyout shop to raise its offer. Granted, Wall Street clashes happen all the time. Any JPMorgan tussle with a buyout client is unlikely to dent the bank's huge and highly profitable investment banking operation, not to mention its reputation as one of the top lenders in leveraged buyouts. Still, investment banks are loath to upset big private equity clients since they have been reaping billions of dollars a year from these "sponsors" in the buyout boom. "It's all about the fees," said Alston & Bird partner Mark Kelly, who heads the law firm's private equity practice. "The sponsors control so much of the business that investment banks have to pander to them." NO BLESSING Dallas-based Chase Paymentech is in an industry known for generating large and steady cash flows. The company says it processes more than $660 billion in annual bankcard and debit volume. Private equity firms seek strong cash flows because they need the money to pay down debt used to finance deals. So naturally, Chase Paymentech was a major attraction for KKR, and an asset the firm wishes to keep. That would explain why KKR reached out to JPMorgan ahead of time to smooth over any concerns. "Essentially KKR said: 'Do we have your blessing?' And the answer was no," said a source involved with the deal who did not want to be identified. That would also explain why KKR is not interested in getting bought out of the partnership, although JPMorgan does have the right to dissolve it, sources say. That would allow JPMorgan to operate the business on its own, but given First Data's expertise in the industry, there are ample reasons for wanting to keep the company on board. So in this case, JPMorgan is in a bit of a bind, not just with its decision on the fate of Chase Paymentech, but also with its relationship with one of the biggest private equity clients out there. The odds are that the bank will likely not do anything else for the moment to upset the mighty KKR.
