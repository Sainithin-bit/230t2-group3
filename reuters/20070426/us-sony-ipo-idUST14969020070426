 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. plans to raise about $2.5 billion by listing its financial unit, the Nikkei business daily said on Thursday, in what is expected to be Japan's largest initial public offering this year. 

 The paper said Sony would sell at least 30 percent of its stake in Sony Financial Holdings this autumn and use the roughly 300 billion yen in proceeds to bolster core electronics products including portable music players and flat TVs. Sony issued a statement saying there is no change to its previously announced plan to list the unit as early as the financial year that started this month, and that it could not comment further at this time. Shares in Sony closed the morning session up 0.9 percent at 6,460 yen, roughly in line with the broader market. "The IPO will have some positive impact for Sony, allowing it to procure capital," said Shigemi Nonaka, special adviser at Polestar Investment Management. "But I don't know if this is a long-term plus for the company. The key is whether or not they can expand their core business." The unit, a holding company that oversees the conglomerate's online banking and lucrative life insurance operations, will have a market value of at least 1 trillion yen ($8.43 billion), the paper said, putting it in the top 10 among Japanese banks. The IPO would be Japan's biggest since last year's $3.2 billion flotation of Aozora Bank Ltd., which was itself the largest in eight years, and likely rank as the top initial share offering in 2007. Sony has already made a tentative application to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the Nikkei said. A spokesman at the bourse declined to comment. The financial unit generated about 7 percent of the group's revenue of 6.2 trillion yen in the nine months to December 31, but accounted for nearly a third of Sony's operating profit. Sony plans to use the proceeds from the IPO for investment in new production equipment and development of key products including flat TVs, video cameras and electronics parts, the Nikkei said. Sony has invested aggressively in liquid crystal display (LCD) technology to compete with the likes of Matsushita Electric Industrial and Sharp Corp. in the flat TV market and is now the world's largest LCD TV player. It has also said it plans to start selling ultra-thin TVs using organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology this year. Selling down its stake in the financial unit would seem to fit with a plan unveiled by Sony CEO Howard Stringer in 2005 to sell off non-core assets and focus resources on electronics, which accounts for about 70 percent of overall sales. Credit Suisse analyst Koya Tabata reckons Sony may eventually sell its stake down to 51 percent, but would not relinquish majority control. He also believes Sony will plough the money from the IPO back into the financial business. "It is highly likely that Sony will use the IPO money to further nurture its financial business," he said. "Sony already has ample cash flow for the electronics business and it doesn't need more money at the movement."
