 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O, which plans to merge with rival Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ), reported a narrower quarterly loss on higher subscription revenue, sending its shares up nearly 8 percent on Thursday. 

 XM said it added a better-than-expected 285,000 in net new subscribers, while the rate of subscribers leaving the service held steady. But the cost of reeling in new subscribers rose, and the pace at which users converted free trials into full subscriptions fell short of XM's own expectations. Analysts stopped short of giving positive reviews, in some cases commending XM for not delivering bad news. "XM's first-quarter results held few surprises, but perhaps that in itself is a surprise," said Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett in a client note. "And it was ample for beating low going-in expectations." The company's first-quarter loss attributable to common stockholders narrowed to $122 million, or 40 cents a share, from a loss of $149 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a loss of 41 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Washington-based XM, whose program lineup includes Major League Baseball and Oprah Winfrey, ended the quarter on March 31 with 7.9 million subscribers and has since topped 8 million. First-quarter revenue rose 27 percent to $264 million for XM, which competes with Sirius with a nationwide radio service of music, talk and sports programs for about $13 a month. CONCERNS ABOUT CONVERSION The results come as the two companies try to convince U.S. regulators to approve Sirius's purchase of XM in a deal they say would provide consumers with more choice in radio programming and could lead to lower prices in some cases. Critics of the deal, which includes the main lobby group for the terrestrial radio industry, say it would create a monopoly of satellite providers. Several analysts this week voiced doubts that the deal will go though. After XM reported its earnings, Banc of America Securities analyst Jonathan Jacoby pegged the likelihood of a completed deal at 40 percent. XM said the average cost of adding each subscriber, a measure known as SAC, rose to $65 in the first quarter from $59 a year earlier. Cost per gross addition, which includes SAC as well as marketing costs, increased to $103 from $93. Its churn rate, a measure of subscribers that quit the service, held at 1.8 percent for the third consecutive quarter. XM executives tried to smooth analysts' concerns about a dip in its conversion rate of potential subscribers to 51.5 percent in the first quarter from 52.4 percent in the fourth quarter and 54.3 percent one year ago. "We are not happy with the number going down," said Nate Davis, XM's president and chief operating officer, on a call with analysts. "But remember we're not seeing a 10 point drop here, we're seeing a couple point fluctuation." XM shares were up 6.8 percent to $11.76 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq after earlier reaching $11.98. They are still down from the level on February 19, when Sirius announced its plan to purchase the company.
