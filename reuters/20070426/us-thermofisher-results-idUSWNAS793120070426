 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Laboratory equipment maker Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. ( TMO.N ) reported sharply higher net profit in the first full quarter since Thermo Electron acquired the larger Fisher Scientific International. 

 The combined entity posted net profit of $138.9 million, or 31 cents per share, compared with $46.9 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier for Thermo Electron. Excluding several items, such as costs and tax effects of restructuring and certain acquisition-related costs, earnings were 59 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 53 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. On a pro forma basis that assumes the companies were combined for all of 2006, adjusted operating income rose 34 percent and revenue increased 11.5 percent to $2.1 billion. Thermo closed its acquisition of Fisher on November 9.
