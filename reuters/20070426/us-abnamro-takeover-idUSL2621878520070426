 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch bank ABN AMRO said it will open its books to a Royal Bank of Scotland Plc led consortium, which has made a 72 billion-euro ($98.2 billion) offer for the bank, threatening a lower bid by Barclays. 

 ABN, which agreed earlier this week to a 65 billion-euro buyout deal with Barclays, said RBS, Belgian-Dutch group Fortis and Spain's Santander could look at its books, subject to confidentiality agreements. There was no immediate reaction from the three banks, although RBS Chief Executive Fred Goodwin told reporters on Wednesday that he did not expect to spend a lot of time on due diligence: "We are not proposing to conduct an audit or take a month poring over the books." A source familiar with the matter said the consortium expected to spend less than 10 days for due diligence. But by opening its books, ABN, increases the chance it and it's U.S. unit LaSalle will be at the centre of a bidding war. ABN agreed to sell LaSalle to Bank of America for $21 billion earlier this week in a related deal. ABN agreed to open its books after Chief Executive Rijkman Groenink spoke to the three banks last night to discuss their offer. He has not changed his view that the merger with Barclays is the "best option" for shareholders. Groenink invited rival bidders -- which at the moment is only the consortium -- to bid separately for LaSalle and ABN in order to take over the group. "Anyone can still bid for LaSalle and for the rest of the group ... It only has to be done with two bids instead of one," Groenink said in comments made available to Reuters. "We have a very strong offer on the table and others can top that bid, so that we are certain to receive the best bid in the interests of shareholders," Groenink said. The RBS-led consortium's offer is 39 euros per share, while Barclays' all-stock offer translates into 34.28 euros per share at current prices. At 0925 GMT on Thursday, ABN shares were up 0.8 percent at 36.49 euros. Barclays was trading at 723 pence, down slightly, while RBS was down 1 percent at 1,978 pence. Analysts said the consortium has a decent chance of winning ABN, although it may have to unravel the LaSalle deal, either by beating Bank of America's offer for LaSalle or possibly taking legal action. "The RBS/SAN/Fortis offer is superior to Barclays, in our view, but the analysis is more complicated in practice," ING analyst Sigrid Baas said in a note. "We think chances of success are reliant on a successful bid for LaSalle and/or sufficient shareholder or legal pressure." SHAREHOLDERS MEET Both Barclays and the consortium want to expand as the European market consolidates. ABN had the same ambitions, pushing into Italy two years ago to clinch Antonveneta, but its share price lagged and became a target after hedge fund The Children's Investment Fund (TCI) in February pressed the bank to break up or sell itself. ABN will face shareholders later on Thursday at its annual meeting, although they will not be voting on the Barclays bid since that deal is scheduled to be put to the vote at an extraordinary meeting in August. The LaSalle deal will not be put to a shareholder vote, Groenink said, a move criticized by TCI and Dutch investor group VEB. The VEB has threatened to sue if ABN does not allow shareholders to vote on the sale of LaSalle. But some proposals by TCI will be up for a vote. ABN shareholders could express their dissatisfaction with the bank's management by agreeing to proposals by TCI to break up the company, signaling that they would be willing to accept the consortium's bid. Separately, ABN said it will take a 365 million-euro provision for a continuing investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into its money transfer activities. That had been seen as a potential obstacle to a merger, but ABN said it was "currently in active discussions to resolve these matters." ABN had already released most of its first-quarter figures 10 days ago, excluding the provisions. Including the provisions, ABN said its net profit rose 3.2 percent to 1.035 billion euros, or 0.56 euros per share, in the first quarter from a year earlier.
