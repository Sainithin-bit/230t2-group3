 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexico's leading retailer Wal-Mart de Mexico, or Walmex, has launched a line of 150 cheap generic drugs, selling for no more than $3.50, in a new bid to boost its appeal as a one-stop shop for clients looking for low prices. 

 Walmex's ( WALMEXV.MX ) Medi-Mark generics line started selling last week at the retailer's supermarket chains. The low-priced drugs include everyday staples like pain and fever reliever paracetamol, as well as more complex medicines such as cafergot, used for migraine treatment. Some of the medicines, which are being manufactured by different laboratories, will cost 90 percent less than the leading over-the-counter brand, according to an industry source. The Medi-Mark brand will be permanent and is not a trial program, the source told Reuters. Some of the laboratories selling medicines to Walmex belong to Canifarma, which groups more than 150 drug manufacturers. Walmex and Canifarma were not available for comment. Walmex's parent, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), launched a similar plan in the United States last year, selling generic drugs for $4 per prescription. This week, U.S. Wal-Mart said its $4 prescriptions now account for more than 35 percent of all prescriptions filled at the company's stores. ($1=11 pesos)
