 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - 3M Co. ( MMM.N ), whose products range from Scotch tape to optical films for liquid crystal displays, posted a far better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, sending its shares up more than 4 percent. 

 But despite the strong results and demand across its many business lines, the company, which is considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy, did not raise its full-year outlook. "I still feel they have a little bit of a challenging environment in front of them, at least for the next several quarters as they continue to invest to increase the capacity and de-bottleneck some of their production facilities," said Longbow Securities analyst Dmitry Silversteyn. "I just don't think now that the bottom will be perhaps as deep as I had once feared," added Silversteyn, who has a "neutral" rating on the stock. Net income in the first quarter surged 52.2 percent to $1.37 billion, or $1.85 a share, from $899 million, or $1.17 a share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain of 57 cents a share from the sale of the company's branded drug business in Europe, 3M earned $1.28 a share. This easily topped the average Wall Street forecast of $1.12, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 6.1 percent from last year to $5.94 billion, above the $5.73 billion analysts were expecting. Excluding the impact of the sale of the drug business, sales rose almost 10 percent. Sales in local currencies increased 7.4 percent. CONSERVATIVE OUTLOOK JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa, who has an "overweight" rating on the stock, called the results "surprisingly strong." "Every segment beat profit expectations handily," he said in a research note. Just as surprising, 3M did not raise its outlook, Tusa said. "We attribute this to conservatism, as it is becoming increasingly obvious that visibility here is extremely limited," he said. In January, 3M, which also makes such products as Post-It notes and Thinsulate insulation, reported a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit and said global economic growth was slowing. It also forecast a 2007 profit below expectations. Investors have been worried about a slowdown in the U.S. economy and look to companies like 3M for clues to the future. 3M said it still expected full-year earnings in the range of $5.20 to $5.45 a share, including gains in the range of 60 to 70 cents a share. It previously said its expected full-year profit range before one-time items was $4.60 to $4.75 a share. Analysts were expecting $4.66 a share. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company also still sees full-year, local-currency sales growth, excluding the sale of the drug business, in the range of 6 percent to 10 percent. Including the sale, the expected growth rate remains between 2 percent and 6 percent. 3M's shares rose as high as $80.23, and were still up $3.03, or 3.9 percent, at $80.00 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
