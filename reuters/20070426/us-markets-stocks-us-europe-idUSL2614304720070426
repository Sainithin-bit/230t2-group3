 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. shares looked set for a firmer start on Thursday after the Dow hit an all-time high in the previous session and with earnings updates from U.S. heavyweights Mircosoft ( MSFT.O ) and Ford ( F.N ) on the agenda. 

 June Dow Jones futures DJM7 were up 0.06 percent, while S&P June futures SPM7 were up 0.05 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures NDM7 were up 0.37 percent. "I think that we can gain further and reach new highs today, because there is little on the macro agenda and a good deal of scheduled earnings," Lutz Roehmeyer, fund manager at LBB Invest, said. Companies to report on Thursday include Microsoft, Ford Motors, ExxonMobil ( XOM.N ), Bristol-Myers ( BMY.N ), Halliburton ( HAL.N ), the leading U.S. cable operator Comcast ( CMCSA.O ), the largest U.S mortgage lender Countrywide Financial CFC.N>, Dow Chemical ( DOW.N ), Aetna ( AET.N ) and Cardinal Health ( CAH.N ). A steady parade of strong profit reports and reassuring news on the economy had pushed the Dow to a close above 13,000 for the first time on Wednesday, while the broader market rose to its highest level in more than six years. "The positive surprises are on the increase. The risk is that after so many positive surprises there could also be a negative one. But at the moment, we can't see it," Roehmeyer said. "We still assume that companies will on average continue to beat forecasts. The environment remains positive," he added. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 1.05 percent to end at 13,089.89 on Wednesday. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 1.01 percent and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 0.92 percent, to finish at 2,547.89. "The environment has become more speculative and therefore more risky, but we also see that this is not the end of the upwards trend. It can definitely go on further," Roehmeyer said. The macro agenda includes initial jobless claims due at 1230 GMT and the April Kansas City Manufacturing Survey at 1500 GMT. After the bell on Wednesday, shares of Wendy's International WEN.N rose 10 percent to $35.96 after the restaurant company said it was exploring strategic options to boost shareholder value.
