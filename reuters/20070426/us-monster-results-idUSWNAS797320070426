 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ), parent of jobs Web site Monster.com, reported a lower quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by higher expenses and legal and other fees tied to its stock options investigation. 

 Net income fell 7 percent to $39.5 million, or 30 cents per share, from $42.3 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest results included a charge of 5 cents a share for the stock options investigation, Monster said. Analysts, on average, expected a profit of 33 cents per share before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 28 percent to $329 million, slightly ahead of forecasts. Monster's international careers business reported a 64-percent jump in quarterly sales. The company said it could not provide earnings-per-share guidance because of unknown legal or other fees. It estimated second-quarter revenue in a range of $333 million to $341 million, and full-year revenue of $1.36 billion to $1.40 billion. Analysts were looking for $341 million in second-quarter sales and $1.38 billion for the year.
