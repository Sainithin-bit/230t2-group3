 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - As global finance chiefs wrestled on Friday with how to redistribute voting power in the International Monetary Fund, emerging markets want to ensure that a promised increase in their say does not come at the expense of fellow developing nations. 

 European countries and the United States currently dominate the IMF in a reflection of the post World War Two order, which is now being challenged as developing countries such as China are demanding representation commensurate with their increasing economic clout. There is broad agreement among the IMF's 187 member countries that roughly 5 percent of voting power needs to shift to under-represented countries in the IMF. While China is likely to leapfrog old industrial powers such as France and Britain under plans being discussed to reform the IMF, smaller countries are concerned how the remaining share of votes will be distributed among the rest of the developing world. Quotas determine the contributions of each member country to the IMF and how much a country can borrow. They are based on a complex formula that weighs such factors as the size of a country's economy, foreign exchange reserves and trade. Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega told reporters on the sidelines of IMF and World Bank meetings that China had agreed to give up some of the increases voting power it stands to win so that other developing countries can also benefit. China "even agreed to give up part of the increase it would be entitled to," Mantega said. "The biggest resistance always comes from Europeans and other developed countries." Chinese officials were not immediately available to confirm Mantega's comments. Countries are in tough talks on the issue of how to reduce the dominance of the United States, and in particular, that of Europe in the IMF. Europeans don't want to lose seats on the IMF board and Americans don't want to give up their veto power. In an interview with Reuters, the chair of the IMF's policy steering committee, Youssef Boutros-Ghali, who is also the Egyptian finance minister, said the deadlock could only be broken if everyone was made to feel like a winner. Several European officials said progress had been made on Friday to narrow differences but no concrete proposal had emerged. "It is a work in progress, which should progress to a conclusion in the coming weeks," the European Union's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Olli Rehn, told Reuters. South African Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan said it was critical to fix the historical inequities between the "have's and have nots" that still exist in the IMF. "I think all of us are trying to find a balance, but it's important that the balance is not distorted considerations of self-interest only, but to ensure that we reach the larger objective at the end of the day," he said on the sidelines of the IMF meetings. South Africa was among several developing nations that accepted to have their IMF quotas cut in 2008 when China, India, Mexico, South Korea and Turkey won more clout in the IMF. Gordhan, who chairs the Group of 24 forum for developing countries, cautioned on Thursday that developing countries should not be the ones to make the sacrifices. "There is a trend which is of concern to us in the G24 that there is an expectation by some that the emerging and developing economies must make the greatest sacrifice so that other developing economies can benefit from the quota realignment," he told a news conference. Sierra Leone's finance minister, Samura Kamara, said it was essential to protect the voting power of poorer countries, adding: "Another round of even deeper losses in quota shares would be detrimental to the prospects of our countries accessing Fund resources that they depend on to meet their financing needs." Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said it was time for a political solution. "Short-term self interest must be put aside in favor of the long-term common global good of achieving an efficient, credible and legitimate IMF," Swan told the IMF meetings. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
