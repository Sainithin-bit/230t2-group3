 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - International bankers on Saturday warned that forcing financial institutions to meet new capital requirements too quickly could hurt economies worldwide. 

 They expressed concern that individual countries may require their banks to meet new capital and liquidity standards before the 2019 deadline agreed to last month by negotiators from 27 countries under what is known as the Basel III agreement. "There is a real concern on the part of the industry about acceleration of the phasing-in process being required by national governments," said Josef Ackermann, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank and chairman of the Institute of International Finance. The IIF is holding its annual meeting this weekend in Washington. The global economy is still fragile, Ackerman and other bankers at the event warned, and moving too quickly on capital standards could stifle the recoveries already under way. The new rules will force banks to hold top-quality capital equal to 7 percent of their risk-bearing assets, more than triple than current standards, so they can better withstand economic downturns and financial shocks. Banks will have until 2015 to meet the minimum core Tier 1 capital requirement, which consists of shares and retained earnings worth at least 4.5 percent of assets. An additional 2.5 percent "capital conservation buffer" will have to be in place by 2019. Leaders from the Group of 20 developed and emerging nations are set to endorse Basel III when they meet in Seoul in November. Implementation will be left to each country. Regulators at the event downplayed the idea that the timetable would be moved up, saying representatives from 27 countries agreed to the 2019 specifically to make sure economies across the globe would not be negatively impacted by the new requirements. "It's more generous than anyone expected it to be," said Mark Carney, Canada's top central banker. International regulators are also considering how to require large, systemically important banks to meet capital standards beyond what Basel negotiators agreed to last month. Regulators on a panel at the IIF meeting did not tip their hand on what form this requirement would take but said it should come as no surprise that large banks will face some sort of additional burden. "Basel III was not going to be it," said Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand. "Basel does not address the too-big-to-fail problem." Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan batted down a suggestion that the U.S. government may not enforce the Basel agreement. "I think the U.S. is fully committed," he said.
