 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's ( JPM.N ) aggressive push into commodities trading will fall short of revenue goals this year and the business will be re-evaluated if it lags again in 2011, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 The newspaper said that "barring a remarkable turnaround" the bank's commodities trading desk, the largest on Wall Street, would not meet targets including a $1.78 billion revenue goal because of a string of problems including a bad bet on European coal prices and employee defections. The Journal, citing a person familiar with the situation, said the third quarter improved, with a revenue gain of about $154 million through September 30. But it said commodities revenue was up only by about $189 million for the year. The paper said the unit still trails its two next biggest rivals, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), in market share despite spending $2 billion since 2008 to acquire other firms' trading businesses. It said the disappointing results have put pressure on the unit's head, 41-year-old Blythe Masters, and that Jes Staley, the head of investment banking at JPMorgan Chase, "intends to re-evaluate the business with Ms. Masters" if the unit's business dips below $1 billion in revenue next year. Asked to comment on the story, JPMorgan Chase spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau repeated comments attributed to Staley in the newspaper, saying that "Blythe has built this business from the bottom up in only four years and today we have the scale to serve all of our client needs." JPMorgan Chase will report third-quarter results on Wednesday. (Reporting by  James B. Kelleher ; Editing by  Ted Kerr )
