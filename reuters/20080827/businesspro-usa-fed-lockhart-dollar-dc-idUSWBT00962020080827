 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 
President Dennis Lockhart on Wednesday welcomed the recent rise 
in the dollar. 

  "Certainly, it's been helpful," Lockhart said during a 
question-and-answer session after delivering a speech to an 
economic conference hosted by Georgia State University.  Asked about policy differences between the Fed and European 
Central Bank, he acknowledged that these could impact foreign 
exchange markets.  "We have two different systems at work, that at certain 
times consequently creates pressure on a currency," because of 
interest rate differentials, he said.  (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
