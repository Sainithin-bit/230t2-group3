 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae FNM.N, the biggest U.S. mortgage finance company, on Wednesday announced a shake-up of top executives, including the exit of its chief financial officer, in an effort to better implement a plan to preserve capital and cut losses. 

 Fannie Mae announced management changes amid a storm of controversy over its ability to survive a wave of mortgage defaults that have caused four straight quarters of losses and recent speculation a government bail-out was near. But the board is "firmly committed" to Chief Executive Officer Daniel Mudd, Chairman Stephen Ashley said in a statement . Stephen Swad, who was CFO since early 2007 and helped Fannie return to timely filing of financial statements following a major accounting scandal, was replaced by Fannie Mae Controller David Hisey, the company said. Peter Niculescu, head of capital markets, will replace Robert Levin as chief business officer. Fannie Mae's chief risk officer, Enrico Dallavecchia, will also leave. The changes "signal they are trying to correct some problems," said David Dreman, chairman of Jersey City, New Jersey-based Dreman Value Management, LLC, a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shareholder. "When you change risk management people, it has to be viewed as recognizing problems, so it is mildly positive." Fannie Mae's announcement followed the third consecutive day of gains in its shares and those of rival Freddie Mac on Wednesday as investors grew more confident there would not be a government "nationalization" that would wipe out their shareholdings. Shares of Fannie Mae, which rose 15.3 percent to $6.48 in regular New York Stock Exchange trade, fell 2 percent in extended trade following the announcement. Shares of Freddie Mac climbed 19.65 percent to $4.75 on the NYSE. Fannie Mae on Wednesday passed another test of investor confidence with a successful sale of $2 billion in short-term debt. Merrill Lynch & Co. became the latest major Wall Street bank to cast doubt on speculation the Treasury would directly support Fannie Mae and rival Freddie Mac FRE.N, since both have adequate capital to offset losses for "several quarters." The Merrill note published Tuesday follows similar comments by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc. "Odds of Treasury stepping in and dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before the end of this year have been considerably diminished," said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer for Advisors Capital Management, LLC. Fresh calculations by analysts on revenue and losses suggest the companies, while seen losing more money, can survive on their own, avoiding a government takeover. Shareholders expect a nationalization to be a worst-case scenario as policy-makers don't want taxpayer money rewarding companies that took risks and pocketed billions of dollars in profit through the housing boom. A Reuters report on Friday that the Treasury believes the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) should remain shareholder-owned may have dispelled fears, analysts said. A Treasury spokeswoman at midday shot down a financial market rumor of a pending announcement on the GSEs. Analysts and policy-makers have conceded Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will likely be forced to increase the amount of capital they hold relative to their investments, making them less profitable. However, their portfolios have surged as their regulator eased a capital surplus requirement earlier this year, sending interest-income soaring. Freddie Mac nearly doubled net interest income to $1.5 billion last quarter as its spread between funding costs and mortgage assets widened. The margins are at their widest levels in about a decade, according to a Citigroup research. "It's a little of a race between the profits on the portfolios and the losses they are taking on defaults and mark-to-market write-downs," Lieberman said. But Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which own or guarantee nearly half of all U.S. mortgages, are adding to the slowdown by raising fees on loans they buy, analysts said. Federal Reserve policy-makers at their August 5 meeting suggested stress on the companies was potentially worsening the housing slump. Such fear fueled talk that a bailout was inevitable, but given price drops of 80 percent or more since May, shares are now "overly-discounting a possibly catastrophic event," Merrill Lynch analysts, led by Kenneth Bruce, said in a note. "Still, it will become increasingly difficult for policy-makers to ignore the GSE situation, as risks of further contraction in the mortgage market are as unpalatable as a high-profile bailout," said Merrill analysts, who kept their "underperform" rating and cut price targets on the shares. Fannie Mae's troubles have spread to the apartment industry, where it and Freddie Mac have expanded their role as the credit crunch sidelines other commercial funding programs. Mid-America Apartment Communities ( MAA.N ) late on Monday said its joint venture with Fannie Mae would cease making new acquisitions toward its goal of having $500 million in assets. Perhaps the most immediate issue facing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- their access to debt markets -- continued unabated as the former sold $2 billion in notes on Wednesday. The issues sold at interest rates higher compared with sales a week earlier, following widening in "agency" debt in the past few days, said William O'Donnell, a strategist at UBS.
