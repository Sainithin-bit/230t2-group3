 MILAN  (Reuters) - UniCredit Spa, Italy's biggest bank by assets, is considering a range of options to boost its financial strength in view of expected higher capital requirements, it said after a board meeting on Tuesday. 
 The bank is under market pressure to come up with capital boosting measures, with most analysts estimating it faces a shortfall of between 5 billion euros ($6.9 billion) to 7 billion to meet tougher financial requirements demanded by European leaders struggling to contain a spreading debt crisis. "UniCredit is working on its strategic plan and it is currently evaluating a range of options to best leverage the group's potential under the proposed new regulatory framework, current market conditions and the general macro-economic scenario," the bank said in a statement.
