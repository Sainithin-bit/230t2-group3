 IQALUIT, Canada  (Reuters) - Iqaluit locals spent the morning building two igloos outside the Nunavut legislature building in this Canadian Arctic town on Saturday while world financial leaders were gathering inside. 

 In a clumsy moment as he left the smaller of the two igloos, it took Canada's finance minister about two seconds to destroy the snow-brick entrance arch on one of them. "I'm deconstructing here," Jim Flaherty said sheepishly as he emerged from the snow structure. The sealskin-clad builders, including local resident Pitseolak Alainga, said they built the igloos to welcome delegates to the weekend meeting of finance chiefs from the Group of Seven industrialized nations. "I don't have anything against these G7 people or anything. We want to welcome them," he said. Iqaluit, capital of Canada's Arctic territory of Nunavut, is an unlikely venue for an international meeting of this kind. Located on the edge of an iced-over inlet of the Arctic Ocean, it is home to some 6,000 people. Every hotel room in town is full. (Writing by  Janet Guttsman , Editing by Peter Galloway)
