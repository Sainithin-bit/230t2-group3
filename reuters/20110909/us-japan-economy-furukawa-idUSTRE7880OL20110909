 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Economics Minister Motohisa Furukawa said on Friday that worries about a global slowdown and fluctuations in currency and equity markets have made Japan's economic situation more severe than before. 

 "The environment surrounding Japan's economy is increasingly severe. We need to pay full attention to downside risks," Furukawa said in a news conference. (Reporting by Rie Ishiguro; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
