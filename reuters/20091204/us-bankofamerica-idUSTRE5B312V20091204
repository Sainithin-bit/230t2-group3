 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's board is scheduled to meet next Tuesday and may discuss the appointment of a new chief executive, a bank spokesman said. 

 The meeting is a regularly scheduled session, spokesman Bob Stickler said, adding that he assumes the search for a successor to Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis will come up. Lewis in September said he would retire at year-end. The bank has been interviewing internal and external candidates to succeed him. The bank expects to name a successor in the near future, Stickler said. On Wednesday the bank announced a plan to repay $45 billion of taxpayer bailout funds. The repayment was seen as a move that could free the bank from pay curbs and make the search for a new CEO easier. The specter of government oversight has played a large role in the CEO search, with possible candidates wary of the role the government would play in everything from bank operations to executive pay.
