 (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc posted its offer document to Cadbury Plc shareholders, triggering a 60-day takeover battle for the British confectionery group under UK takeover rules. 

 Following are the key events in the bid: AUG 28 - Kraft Chairman and CEO Irene Rosenfeld meets Cadbury Chairman Roger Carr to outline a takeover deal in cash and shares which valued Cadbury's shares at 755 pence each. Carr dismisses the approach. SEPT 7 - Kraft goes public but Cadbury promptly rejects the bid saying it undervalues the group and its prospects. SEPT 12 - Carr writes to Rosenfeld saying it was an "unappealing prospect" being absorbed into a "low growth conglomerate business." SEPT 16 - Warren Buffett, who owns 10 percent of Kraft, warns the U.S. group not to overpay for Cadbury. SEPT 21 - Cadbury asks the UK Takeover Panel to send a "put up or shut up" request to Kraft. SEPT 30 - Takeover Panel rules Kraft has until 5 p.m. on November 9 to make a formal bid or walk away for six months. OCT 21 - Cadbury posts upbeat third-quarter trading and raises its 2009 target for sales and profit margin growth. OCT 22 - Nestle and Hershey report Q3 results but neither mention a speculated joint bid for Cadbury. NOV 3 - Kraft reports weaker-than-expected Q3 revenue and cuts its 2009 sales forecast. NOV 9 - Kraft formalizes its bid on the same terms as the original approach. NOV 18 - Italy's Ferrero and Hershey say separately they are reviewing possible bid for Cadbury. NOV 23 - Cadbury shares hit all-time high of 819-1/2 pence amid speculation of a takeover battle. DEC 4 - Kraft posts offer document to Cadbury shareholders starting a two-month fight for the British group. (Compiling by David Jones; Editing by  David Holmes ) ($1=.6030 Pound)
