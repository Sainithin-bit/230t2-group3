 DETROIT  (Reuters) - In a sharp move three days after replacing Chief Executive Fritz Henderson, General Motors Co Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ed Whitacre is expected to announce a management shake-up on Friday that includes reassigning Vice Chairman Bob Lutz, the Wall Street Journal reported. 

 A GM spokesman declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal report. An announcement to employees has been planned for Friday morning. Whitacre was named interim CEO of the restructuring automaker on Tuesday after Henderson resigned in a split with the board. Lutz, 77, put off retirement to serve as the head of marketing for GM with its emergence from a government-funded bankruptcy in July. He has held several senior GM positions. Lutz's next role is expected to be more closely aligned with vehicle design, the Journal reported. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
