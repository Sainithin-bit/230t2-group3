 SHANGHAI/MUMBAI  (Reuters) - General Motors and Chinese partner SAIC Motor Corp are to team up to make small cars and commercial vehicles in India, taking their successful Chinese partnership into one of the world's fastest growing auto markets. 

 The GM/SAIC partnership is one of the most successful between a foreign and local automaker in China. In India, the combination will compete with Tata Motors, utility and tractor maker Mahindra & Mahindra and newer players in the small car segment such as Ford and Toyota Following are analysts' views on the news. IAN FLETCHER, LONDON-BASED AUTO ANALYST AT IHS GLOBALINSIGHT: "I think GM will be looking to compete in the low-cost commercial vehicle segment, which is a fast-growth market in India. I believe the Tata's have a vehicle in that segment and GM will be going head to head with those vehicles." "It looks like GM is leveraging all its contacts across the globe to expand in fast-growing markets and for SAIC it gives them a ready market into the fourth-largest commercial vehicle market." MOHIT ARORA, SINGAPORE-BASED SENIOR DIRECTOR FOR JD POWER IN ASIA PACIFIC "For SAIC, this means getting a foothold in the vast, growing Indian car market as well as the relatively untapped light commercial vehicle market. SAIC is getting into a market with a lot of potential. "For GM this is a strategic move. They are a very small player in the Indian market and with this move they'll consolidate their position in not just passenger cars but light commercial vehicles." JOHNNY WONG, HONG KONG-BASED AUTO ANALYST AT YUANTA SECURITES: "India is a test case of SAIC's ambition for overseas expansion, and it may further expand into South East Asia when the time is right." But he said given India's geographical complexity, success of the joint venture rests on their distribution capability and it's still unclear whether GM and SAIC need to partner with an India company. YANG HUA CHAO, SHANGAI-BASED ANALYST AT CHINA EVERBRIGHT SECURITIES "India is another major auto market besides China, we believe the SIAC/GM 50-50 venture will launch smaller size vehicle there at the beginning, taking advantage of GM's strong distribution network."
