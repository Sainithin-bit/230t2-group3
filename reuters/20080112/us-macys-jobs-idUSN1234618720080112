 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Retailer Macy's Inc plans to cut 271 jobs in the Chicago, Detroit and Minneapolis areas, closing most of its in-store wine shops and several food operations, the Chicago Tribune reported Saturday. 

 The layoffs, which will take effect in March, include store-level and corporate posts in areas such as alterations, food, marketing, visual and finance, the newspaper said in a report on its Web site. A Macy's spokesperson could not be reached for comment. Last week, Macy's reported a worse-than-expected 7.9 percent December sales decline at stores open at least a year, citing cautious consumer spending for the holidays. In December, it closed nine underperforming stores, affecting 899 employees, in Indiana, Ohio, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas. (Reporting by Susan Kelly)
