 LONDON  (Reuters) - Further interest rate cuts may be in the offing and money market rates may be easing but news from the world's major banks on Friday gave no indication that the global credit crisis is abating. 

 Merrill Lynch is expected to suffer $15 billion in losses stemming from wrecked mortgage investments, almost twice its original estimate, the New York Times reported on Friday. As a result, Merrill is seeking more capital from an outside investor, the paper said, citing people who had been briefed on the company's plans. The bank reports its results next week. Bank of America Corp said it had agreed to buy struggling Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, a move that could help avert one of the biggest collapses in the U.S. housing crisis. Bank of America said the all-stock transaction was worth approximately $4 billion, a fraction of the roughly $26 billion Countrywide was worth last February, just as the risky end of the nation's housing market was about to implode. In Europe, Swiss bank UBS AG said that it could not predict the final impact of the subprime crisis but a new capital injection would strengthen its position as it called on shareholders to support its emergency capital hike. "During 2008, the environment for financial markets, especially in the U.S., is uncertain," the bank said in a letter to shareholders, dated January 10 and released to media on Friday. "We cannot, at this time, accurately predict the future development of U.S. residential mortgage markets and therefore the ultimate impact on our positions in subprime mortgage related securities," the letter said. The Swiss bank has been one of the biggest casualties of the collapse in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, which has resulted in billions in write-downs by top banks and stopped them lending to each other -- a crucial flow of money to keep the global economy's wheels oiled. The Wall Street Journal had reported on Thursday that both Merrill and Citigroup Inc. were in discussions to clinch more capital from investors, primarily foreign governments. Citigroup could get as much as $10 billion, likely from foreign governments, while Merrill was expected to get $3-4 billion, much of it from a Middle Eastern government investment fund, the report said. Banks, wrestling with huge losses stemming from mortgages lent to people ill-equipped to repay them, have been seeking cash from sovereign wealth funds. In December, Merrill Lynch raised as much as $7.5 billion after selling a stake to Singapore's government and an asset manager. Morgan Stanley has said it would receive $5 billion from China after recording $9.4 billion of write-downs. Citigroup in November agreed to sell up to a 4.9 percent stake to Abu Dhabi for $7.5 billion, while UBS accepted a $9.75 billion investment from another Singapore state fund. BERNANKE OFFERS HOPE Markets took some comfort from the prospect, dangled on Thursday by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, of significant further U.S. rate cuts. Bernanke said the U.S. economic outlook had worsened in the wake of a housing slump and subsequent credit market turmoil. "We stand ready to take substantive additional action as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks," he said. Money market rates have generally eased since the Fed and other major central banks launched coordinated action to offer short-term funds to free up jammed interbank lending. The interbank cost of borrowing euros and dollars fell again on Friday, but sterling rates bucked the broad downward trend to post their first increase in a month. The European Central Bank and Swiss National Bank said on Thursday they would keep up unprecedented U.S. dollar lending to banks for at least another month to help calm credit market tensions. The Fed is also poised to act again next week. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said that after talks with Bernanke he would repeat December's auctions of $20 billion in one-month funds for euro zone banks which had struggled to get dollar loans and pushed up U.S. market rates. The SNB will repeat a similar auction of $4 billion. But most experts say the threat of further losses at major banks from investments tied to U.S. subprime mortgages means the crisis is far from over, as crucial lending between commercial banks remains patchy at best. But investors fear that if the Fed is prepared to cut rates sharply, it must be worried. "Investors are truly nervous. The Fed is confirming in people's minds they truly see the outlook containing negative economic risks," said White Funds Management portfolio manager Angus Gluskie.
