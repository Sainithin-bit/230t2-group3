 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc's MER.N move to accelerate vesting on previously awarded stock-based pay to employees could add to the huge fourth-quarter loss already expected by analysts. 

 Merrill's financial statements show the company entered 2007 with $1.9 billion in unrecognized expenses related to stock-based pay that had not yet vested for employees. Last month, the company told employees they would get ownership of some stock-based compensation awarded in previous years earlier than planned, according to people who read the letter. The payout for some is expected at the end of the month. Merrill declined comment on the size of the accelerated payouts. For employees, they'll receive money sooner than expected after huge mortgage-related losses hammered the company in 2007. Analysts expect Merrill's fourth-quarter mortgage losses to top $10 billion. As a result, bonuses for 2007 performance have been disappointing, some employees told Reuters. Once the stock-based compensation vests, though, Merrill could have to take a one-time charge of several hundred million dollars to recognize the expense. But some of the impact of that expense could be blunted by tax benefits. Merrill's financial statements say it recognizes stock-based expenses as the awarded shares vest, or as employees get ownership. Previously, Merrill has taken large charges on the accelerated vesting of stock-based pay. For the first quarter of 2006, for example, the company took a one-time charge of $1.2 billion after taxes, which partly reflected the acceleration of compensation expenses on stock-based pay.
