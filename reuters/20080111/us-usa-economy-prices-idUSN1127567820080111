 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Import prices were flat in December, with petroleum costs decreasing for the first time in four months, while export prices rose by 0.4 percent, the Labor Department reported Friday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters had expected import prices to rise by 0.2 percent after a revised 3.3 percent leap in November that was previously reported as 2.7 percent. Export prices met expectations for last month and in November rose an unrevised 0.9 percent, the department said. Petroleum import prices, in their first decline since August, dropped 0.6 percent. The department said, however, those prices rose by 50.1 percent during the year, the largest annual increase since 56.9 percent in 2002. December's rise in export prices rested primarily on agricultural prices, which made the largest gain of 2.7 percent. Over the year, agricultural prices rose 23.5 percent, a record in the survey's 22-year history. (Reporting by  Lisa Lambert , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
