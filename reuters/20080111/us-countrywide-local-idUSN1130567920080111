 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Most mornings are sweet at the Marmalade Cafe, up the street from the Calabasas, California headquarters of Countrywide Financial Corp. But not this Friday. 

 "We open at 7:30, and we usually have a small crowd waiting outside," manager Shana Naulin said. A healthy portion of the cafe's lively breakfast and lunch trade comes from employees at Countrywide's nearby headquarters. But hours after news broke early on Friday morning that Bank of America Corp would buy the troubled mortgage lender for $4 billion, not a soul was waiting to be seated. "Our first customer was at 8:30," Naulin said. "I think people were sitting at home, watching the news to see how it would affect them." It's still too soon to see how much this small but affluent Los Angeles suburb will suffer from an expected restructuring at Countrywide once Bank of America takes over, but further job losses are sure to deal a new blow to a California economy already feeling the effects of the mortgage crisis, including lower tax revenue and slumping home prices. Things could have been worse for Calabasas, a city of 23,000 people about 13 miles from downtown Los Angeles where the median household income stands at $93,860, the average home price is $1.6 million and some Hollywood stars keep ranches. "There could have been much more severe outcomes with respect to staff reductions and capacity if they went into bankruptcy," said Stuart Gabriel, director of the Ziman Center for Real Estate at UCLA's Anderson School of Management. Countrywide has said it ended December with 50,600 employees, down from a peak of 61,586 at the end of July. Those cuts have been spread out across Countrywide's hundreds of branches and its corporate headquarters, limiting the impact on the Calabasas economy so far. "There has not been a real discernible local impact, although there may be one now because their corporate staff is located in Calabasas," Gabriel said. "To the extent that there is a restructuring that goes on there could be some impact in that market." Despite deep job cuts at Countrywide over the past year as the subprime mortgage crisis deepened, business at Marmalade Cafe has stayed pretty brisk, Naulin said. Sergio Zendejas, manager at nearby Italian restaurant Mi Piace Italian Kitchen, says Countrywide's woes have not dented his lunchtime business, but he has noticed that some of his regulars have disappeared. "We still get a few (Countrywide) customers. It's not like a big percentage," Zendejas said. (Reporting by Gina Keating and Nichola Groom in Los Angeles, editing by Richard Chang)
