 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - UAL Corp UAUA.O, parent of United 
Airlines, said on Friday it has increased its domestic fuel 
surcharge, bringing the total to $25 each way on all domestic 
routes. 

  The increase in the surcharge, which is in addition to the 
base air fare, varies depending on the market. In some markets 
where United faces low-cost competition the surcharge had been 
$5 or less. Elsewhere the surcharge had been $10.  The airline industry has been pressured by skyrocketing 
fuel costs as the price of oil hovers near $95 a barrel. 
Carriers have attempted to offset that expense with fare hikes 
and surcharges.  Last week, UAL initiated a fare increase that was broadly 
matched by competitors. But some analysts predict carriers will 
have trouble raising fares if economic weakness erodes travel 
demand.  "Every penny increase in a gallon of jet fuel costs our 
industry $195 million annually, and while we operate more 
efficiently, we must be able to pass commodity costs on to 
customers, as other industries do," said UAL spokeswoman Robin 
Urbanski.  Representatives from other airlines were not immediately 
available to say whether they would match the surcharge.  Shares of UAL were down 33 cents, or 1 percent, at $31.86 
in afternoon trade on Nasdaq.  (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; editing by  Mark Porter )
