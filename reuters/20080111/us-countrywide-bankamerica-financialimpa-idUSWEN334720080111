 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp said on Friday it expects to incur $1.2 billion in aftertax charges related to its $4 billion takeover of troubled mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. 

 Excluding the charges, the bank expects the takeover will have no impact on earnings per share this year, but will boost EPS by 3 percent next year, according to an investor presentation posted on its Web site. Part of the gains will come from $1 billion in pretax costs savings to be realized from the combination by 2011. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank also said it will need additional capital issuance and some asset reductions in order to maintain its regulatory capital ratios at current levels.
