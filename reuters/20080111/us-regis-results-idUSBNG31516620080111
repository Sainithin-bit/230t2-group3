 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hair salon operator Regis Corp ( RGS.N ) said on Friday same-store sales fell in the second quarter, which includes the key holiday period, and that it expects profit at the lower end of its prior view, sending its shares down 6.1 percent. 

 Regis, whose salon chains include Supercuts, Jean Louis David and Vidal Sassoon, said sales at its established stores fell 0.8 percent in its fiscal second quarter. "... We had a disappointing holiday shopping season and, as a result, our quarterly same-store sales came in below our expectations," Chief Executive Paul Finkelstein said in a statement. Total revenue for the quarter was also lower than expected. While the company reported sales of $682 million, analysts, on average, were looking for $690.1 million. "This quarter, Regis has the same reason for underperformance as its retail peers, namely the U.S. economy and consumer weakness," Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott wrote in a client note. He rates its shares "peer perform." For the quarter, the company said it expects earnings at the low end of its prior forecast of 51 cents to 57 cents a share. Profit would include a benefit of 5 cents per share in the period, thanks to its salon safety programs that paid off, Regis said. Analysts on average expect the company to earn 54 cents a share, excluding items. Regis shares were 6.1 percent lower at $24.49 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
