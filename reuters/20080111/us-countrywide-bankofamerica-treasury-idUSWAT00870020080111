 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department knew of Bank of America Corp.'s interest in buying Countrywide Financial Corp but did not push for the deal to go ahead, a Treasury spokeswoman said on Friday. 

 The Treasury was "aware of the discussions" between the two financial services companies but "was not actively involved in encouraging the discussions," said spokeswoman Jennifer Zuccarelli. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
