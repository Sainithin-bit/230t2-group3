 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton on Friday proposed a $70 billion emergency spending package to help victims of the U.S. housing crisis and stave off what she sees as a coming recession. 

 Here are the key aspects of the former first lady's stimulus plan: * Create a $30 billion Emergency Housing Crisis Fund for U.S. states to help families unable to make mortgage payments. * Reduce the number of home foreclosures by introducing a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures and an automatic rate freeze on subprime mortgages of at least five years. * Provide $25 billion in emergency funds to help people pay expensive heating bills. * Accelerating $5 billion in investments in energy efficiency and alternative energy programs. * Invest $10 billion in extending and broadening unemployment insurance for the jobless. * Have Congress prepare a $40 billion tax rebate package to be released if needed to low-income and middle class workers if economic conditions in the country deteriorate.
