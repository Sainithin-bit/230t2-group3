 (Reuters) - Leading candidates in the race for the November 2008 U.S. presidential election are seeking to become the first woman, first black, first Mormon or oldest first-term president to occupy the White House. 

 Following are brief profiles of the main contenders: DEMOCRATS: HILLARY CLINTON, 60, would be the first woman U.S. president. Is a senator from New York and was first lady when her husband, Bill, was president from 1993 to 2001. Has emphasized efforts to insure 47 million Americans without health coverage and criticized opponents for lack of experience. Has led most national opinion polls by double digits but finished third in Iowa and trails in New Hampshire. JOHN EDWARDS, 54, is a former one-term senator from North Carolina and was the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2004. Has made combating poverty a major campaign theme. Called his vote to authorize military action in Iraq a mistake and now urges withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq. His wife, Elizabeth, is being treated for a recurrence of cancer. BARACK OBAMA, 46, is a first-term U.S. senator representing Illinois and would be the first black president. Gave the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic convention before he was elected to the Senate. Has opposed the Iraq war from the beginning and has tried to cast himself as a Washington outsider. Won in Iowa and leads Clinton in New Hampshire polls, but trails nationally. REPUBLICANS: RUDY GIULIANI, 63, is a former New York mayor and has tried to boost his candidacy by speaking repeatedly about his leadership during the September 11 attacks. Widely shunned by many conservatives because of his support for abortion rights, gun control and gay rights, but received endorsement from Christian evangelist Pat Robertson. Has led most national polls but is behind in early primary voting states. MIKE HUCKABEE, 52, is a bass-playing former Arkansas governor and Baptist minister from Hope, Arkansas, the birthplace of Bill Clinton. Won the Iowa caucus thanks to strong support from fellow evangelicals, who admire his religious beliefs and conservative stances on issues like abortion and gay marriage. Known for his wit, but criticized for lack of knowledge on foreign policy. JOHN MCCAIN, 71, a senator from Arizona, attended the U.S. Naval Academy and was shot down in 1967 over Vietnam. Would be the oldest first-term president, at 72, if elected. Spent 5 1/2 years as a prisoner of war. Has been a pro-business conservative and abortion foe. Supports the Iraq war and argued for additional troops to quell the violence. Slowed by staff turnover and overspending in early days of his campaign but now leading in New Hampshire. MITT ROMNEY, 60, is a Harvard-educated former Massachusetts governor and business executive who co-founded the private equity firm Bain Capital. Has tried to cast himself as a more conservative alternative, opposing gay rights and abortion rights although he once supported both. Romney, whose father sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1968, would be the first Mormon president. Finished second in Iowa and now trails McCain in New Hampshire, though he topped polls in both states for much of 2007.
