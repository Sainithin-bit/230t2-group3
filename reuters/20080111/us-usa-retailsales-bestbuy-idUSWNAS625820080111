 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer electronics retailer Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) said on Friday that sales at stores open at least 14 months rose 1.5 percent in December and affirmed its fiscal 2008 earnings outlook. 

 But after adjusting for a shift in the calendar that removed the key shopping week after Thanksgiving from the December tally, the company said the same-store sales rise was 3 percent, as gift shoppers bought video games, flat-panel televisions, notebook computers and GPS devices. Total sales rose 11 percent to $7.3 billion in the five weeks ended January 5, the top U.S. consumer electronics chain said. The company expects to earn $3.10 to $3.20 a share on revenue of about $40 billion. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; editing by John Wallace and  Derek Caney )
