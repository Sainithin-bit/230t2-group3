 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - The dollar skidded to a 15-year low against the yen on Monday, hurt by stop-loss selling and expectations of further easing in U.S. monetary policy. 

 The dollar fell as far as 81.36, Thomson Reuters data showed. Stop-loss selling had accelerated after it fell below its previous low of 81.71. The rising yen is likely to feed speculation that Tokyo could intervene to curb the currency's strength. (Reporting by Koh Gui Qing; Editing by  Ed Davies )
