 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A more proactive supervisory policy forcing banks to cut dividend payouts in times of stress may help shield the economy from future credit shocks, Boston Federal Reserve Bank President Eric Rosengren said on Sunday. 

 Rosengren, speaking at an event on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund meetings, said banks were slow to cut payouts in the early stages of the 2007-2009 financial crisis as their management did not want to signal weakness, and regulators were slow to respond. Had they acted as soon as financial stress emerged, the 19 biggest U.S. banks could have retained nearly $80 billion in capital, he said. "Clearly a proactive approach to dividend retention could have substantially reduced the need for an emergency infusion of public funds," Rosengren said. "Regulatory policy should prompt supervisors to look forward and thus more proactively seek reductions in dividends in appropriate circumstances," he said. The dividends on common stock declared by the largest banking organizations increased in the fourth quarter of 2007, and were not cut dramatically until the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008. A "more aggressive policy may not only reduce potential taxpayer exposure to the banking sector, but also insulate the broader economy from the sorts of loan supply shocks that can provide significant headwinds to an economic recovery," he said. Rosengren did not address the economic or monetary policy outlook in his remarks. Rosengren said regulators should consider whether these lessons from the crisis have been learned, or if history is already repeating itself. "In some parts of the world today, sovereign risk exposure seems problematic and elevated credit default swaps and low stock market valuations have not prevented some banks from continuing to pay dividends," he said. Global regulators are aiming to prevent any repeat of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. They agreed in September to force banks to more than triple the amount of top-quality capital they must hold in reserve. (Reporting by Kristina Cooke; editing by Carol Bishopric)
