 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A combination of politics and profits could determine the success of the U.S. government's most ambitious attempt yet to cleanse the banking system of up to $1 trillion in risky securities. 

 After several U.S. banks were saved from the credit crisis by the government, some lenders may feel heat from Washington to make the new toxic asset plan work by selling their securities, even if prices are not as high as they want. Regulators could press banks reluctant to sell toxic assets -- and thus crystallize their losses -- by ordering them to book those securities at price levels established by a revival of the market, said Cornelius Hurley, a Boston University bank law professor and a former Federal Reserve lawyer. If regulators say, "'You might not like it, but we are going to require you to write these assets down to the mark that has been established,' that will be enough compulsion to get more banks to participate," Hurley told Reuters Financial Television. Securing the participation of banks will be key to the success of the Public Private Investment Fund that was announced on Monday as a centerpiece of the new U.S. attack on the credit crisis. "There will be banks selling into the program. Of course, whether that's of their own free will or whether there is some arm-twisting I can't say," said another former Fed official who asked not to be named. Strong-arming the banks may not be necessary. Banks may find it easy to sell billions of dollars' worth of securitized subprime and commercial mortgage loans whose value they have already written down to distressed levels, analysts said. The market price for "Alt-A" mortgage loans -- given to homeowners who didn't have to document income -- sits around 43 cents on the dollar, according to Glenn Boyd, a strategist at Barclays Capital. Potential prices on those bonds could be 70 cents on the dollar, or higher, under terms of the public-private plan since buyers have low-cost financing, he said. "If you have bonds that are marked to market you have substantial upside, and (banks) can use those write-ups to offset the write-downs from other bonds that are not marked to market," Boyd said on a conference call. "So we think there will be a significant fraction of bonds where banks will be able to sell into this." On the other hand, if a bank hasn't yet written down the value of its Alt-A portfolio, it could face losses of 25 cents on the dollar or more, he said. Meanwhile, the market for distressed securities will be supported by the attractive financing being offered investors by the government, which is giving an opportunity to hedge funds, private equity companies and other big investors that sense the chance for big profits. "There may be some really aggressive players that may pay up just for the leverage," said Ron D'Vari, chief executive officer at NewOak Capital in New York. Federal regulators also may be counting on the clarity provided by a revived market to identify the weaker banks, Hurley said. The regulators have already begun so-called stress tests to determine which banks are financially stretched. The tests are due to be completed at the end of April. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., a government regulator, will probably find itself putting more banks into receivership as a result of fresh write-downs, Hurley added. "This is not a game changer," Bridgewater Associates Inc., one of the world's biggest hedge-fund managers, wrote in a letter to clients on Tuesday. "It doesn't make entities that aren't now creditworthy creditworthy. It is more a financial engineering maneuver that should get the banks more money than they otherwise would have gotten for their bad assets." In addition, market prices for distressed assets could drop further amid uncertainty over the state of U.S. housing and the finances of homeowners, critics say. However, even if banks choose not to participate in the plan, they may benefit as investors boost bids on assets with their new leverage, said Bose George, an analyst at broker-dealer Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. More than $2 trillion in troubled assets are not held on bank balance sheets and are available to investors, he said. Most holders of residential and commercial mortgage securities have already marked their securities to market levels meaning they stand to gain from any rise, George said.
