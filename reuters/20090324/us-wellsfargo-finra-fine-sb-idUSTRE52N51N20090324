 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two units of the former Wachovia Corp were fined $1.1 million by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority for failing to provide more than 800,000 required notices to customers over five years ending in 2008. 

 Wachovia Securities LLC and First Securities LLC were also required to retain an independent consultant to review their supervisory systems and processes, as part of a settlement with the regulator. Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) bought Wachovia Corp on December 31. FINRA said the missing notifications stemmed from computer programing and operational problems that went undetected. These included notifications of more than 300,000 changes in investment objectives, more than 340,000 address changes, the existence of more than 54,000 clearing agreements, and more than 50,000 margin disclosure statements. Such notices "help protect against changes that are erroneous, unauthorized or, in the worst case, indicative of an effort to conceal misconduct involving a customer's account," FINRA enforcement chief Susan Merrill said in a statement. Wachovia and First Clearing did not admit wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, FINRA said. The regulator oversees close to 5,000 brokerages. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
