 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chairman of the Dow Jones Index oversight committee said on Tuesday a reverse stock split in Citigroup ( C.N ) shares may reduce calls for dropping it from the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI . 

 "A reverse split in Citigroup shares may reduce some of the calls for eliminating it," John Prestbo, who is also executive director of Dow Jones Indexes, told Reuters on the sidelines of an event in New York. Prestbo said splits are not a consideration in determining whether a company is a suitable representative of its industry in the Dow, but given the recent decline in the price of Citigroup's shares he has gotten calls and e-mails asking for changes in the index, including removing Citigroup. "I think it is a sign that people care very much and consider (the index) something that they have a stake in, so I listen to them very carefully." Citigroup hit a low of 97 cents on March 5, but the stock has since risen and now trades above $3. For the year, the shares are down more than 55 percent.
