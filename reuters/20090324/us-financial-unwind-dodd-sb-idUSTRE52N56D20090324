 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Key U.S. lawmakers clashed on Tuesday over a proposal by the Obama administration to assume powers to unwind distressed non-bank financial institutions that risk damaging the economy, like insurer AIG. 

 "I welcome it," Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd told reporters after a hearing on bank regulation. "You just can't keep on putting capital into these institutions. We've got to figure out a way to deal with this. The majority leader in the U.S. Senate, Democrat Harry Reid, praised the proposal as a "tremendous step forward" that would address gaps in financial regulation. But House of Representatives Republican Leader John Boehner called the new proposal "an unprecedented grab of power. "Before that occurs, there ought to be a real debate about whether we give that authority to the Treasury secretary." And the No. 2 Democrat in the House said he wanted to move forward with care. "I want to look at it more carefully," House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, in testimony before a congressional committee on Tuesday, said he needed authority to step in to shut down troubled institutions, citing insurer American International Group Inc. There is currently no mechanism to wind down a non-bank financial institution, Geithner said, noting how the collapse of AIG could endanger the whole financial system. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the same hearing the AIG episode "highlights the urgent need for new resolution procedures for systemically important nonbank financial firms." Dodd said the White House has asked that legislation along these lines, being developed now in Congress with administration input, be moved along more quickly than some other financial regulation reforms being studied. "We'll try to accommodate that because I think it's a very important element," Dodd said. Dodd needs to craft broadly supported legislation in his committee that is likely to be approved in a full Senate vote. Asked if authority to unwind an institution should reside with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which already has the power to seize and resolve troubled banks, Dodd said he was not sure where to put it or "whether you create a new agency." "The FDIC would make some sense because the expertise exists there," he said. "But I want to make sure that what we don't do is make that mistake where you have in the same place the regulator and the resolution operation." Where the authority resides could make a difference to congressional support. "We are talking about huge sums of money, huge consequences, for one individual," Hoyer told reporters. Dodd also called "intriguing" the idea of forming "a council made up of regulators with real professional staff" to monitor "systemic risk" in the financial system. The administration wants to move toward establishing some sort of systemic risk regulator. Some lawmakers have been favoring giving that job to the Federal Reserve, although Dodd and others have questioned that approach. "I want to explore ideas other than just the Fed," Dodd said. "I'm agnostic on the issue of who ought to be the systemic risk regulator." Republican Senator Susan Collins introduced a bill on Monday calling for establishment of a financial stability council of regulators headed by an independent chairman. "As part of that, it might be advisable to also strengthen the authority of the federal government to be involved in quote, 'unwinding' some of these large institutions," Collins told Reuters outside the Senate on Tuesday when asked about the new administration proposal. "But really, it's better that we set capital requirements for large, systemically important institutions that would prevent them from imposing this kind of risk to the entire financial system," she said.
