 HARTFORD, Connecticut  (Reuters) - Connecticut authorities have subpoenaed 14 current and former executives of American International Group in a deepening probe over compensation and bonus practices. 

 Connecticut's attorney general on Tuesday also disputed Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's assertion that blocking AIG's controversial bonus payments would violate state law. AIG has become a lightning rod for populist anger after giving out $220 million in bonuses, including $55 million paid in December, to some executives after receiving a $180 billion government bailout to prevent its collapse. A letter to AIG's lawyers from Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal and state lawmakers expressed "deep concern and frustration" over AIG's "lack of cooperation." Blumenthal also criticized Bernanke for testifying in Congress that Connecticut's wage law posed a barrier to any lawsuit seeking to block AIG's bonus payments. Bernanke told the House Financial Services Committee that he supported such a lawsuit but that his legal counsel advised him not to pursue one because of Connecticut's laws. "The Federal Reserve never contacted me or my office concerning the applicability of the Connecticut wage law to the AIG bonuses. If the Fed had called, we would have given the green light for litigation blocking these unconscionable bonuses," Blumenthal, a Democrat, said in a statement. In a telephone interview with Reuters, Blumenthal added that he would write to Bernanke urging him to go through with a lawsuit against AIG. "Clearly there is nothing in our wage protection statutes that prevents a lawsuit blocking bonuses," he said. At the heart of the controversy is AIG's Wilton, Connecticut-based financial products unit that sold more derivatives than AIG could back and nearly brought down a company that was once the world's largest insurer. 'REWARDING MONUMENTAL FAILURE' AIG officials say they are contractually obligated under state law to give the retention bonuses, which are designed to keep valued employees from quitting. They argue that the bonuses could be defined as wages in Connecticut and if withheld the company could face double damages under the Connecticut Wage Act. Blumenthal disputes that assessment. "They are not wages under our law," he said in a telephone interview. "AIG used this joke of a justification to squander $218 million of taxpayer money, rewarding monumental failure." Bob Duff, a Democratic state senator who is co-chair of the Legislature's General Assembly Banks Committee, also disputed Bernanke's assertion that state law would derail a lawsuit. "Mr Bernanke may be an economist but he is no lawyer," he said. "I will take the state attorney general's opinion that he could have sued to get the bonus money back." AIG has submitted details of the bonuses to Connecticut officials including Governor Jodi Rell and the Commissioner of Consumer Protection, Jerry Farrell, who is analyzing the funds to determine if AIG violated state law. The state is seeking testimony by current and former AIG executives at a 1 p.m. hearing on Thursday at its Legislative Office Building. AIG workers, including some who have received death threats, have expressed concern for their safety. To protect the executives from harm, interviews would be conducted in private with the AIG executives before "any possible public testimony," the letter to AIG said. The state also wants testimony from one or two AIG representatives who can explain compensation and bonuses, and who can discuss documents AIG has handed over to the state, according to the letter, dated Monday and addressed to AIG's lawyers. It was publicly released on Tuesday. Blumenthal has threatened court action if the executives fail to show up.
