 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from the testimony of U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley to the House Financial Services Committee on Tuesday about the AIG bailout. 

 GEITHNER ON WHY HIS STABILITY PLAN WILL WORK: REP J. GRESHAM BARRETT: "What's the backup plan? If everything fails, what do we do?" GEITHNER: "Congressman, this plan will work. This plan, because of the authority provided by the Congress -- not just the Treasury but the Fed, gives us broad ability to do what you need to do to get through a financial crisis. It just requires will. It's not about ability. And we just need to keep at it. And we'll need to work with Congress to make sure that we can do this on a scale that will make it work." BERNANKE ON PRIVATE MARKET PARTICIPATION IN TOXIC ASSET PLAN: "I do think we have to provide assurances to participants that their involvement will not be retroactively penalized in some way." BERNANKE ON AIG, BEAR STEARNS PAYING BACK LOANS: "Speaking for the Federal Reserve less than 5 percent of our lending is associated with the Bear Stearns and the AIG episodes. We believe we will be fully repaid for those loans but we concede they are riskier than the other loans we make. The other 95 percent of our balance sheet is extremely safe, mostly very short term. We've never lost a penny in any of those programs. So even though it's true that the Fed has, in one capacity or another, lent out a great deal of money we believe it's quite safe and that the taxpayer will in fact make money because the Federal Reserve through its profits sends to the Treasury every year tens of billions of dollars." GEITHNER ON STANDARDS FOR FINANCIAL PROTECTION: "We need to make sure we bring the world with us and the world as a whole, (and) all those other financial centers, London, Asia, continental Europe, also put in place higher standards for protection because without that there is a risk that capital will move and business will shift from the United States and we will end up with a weaker system overall. ... So the best defense for us is to make our system stronger, not to wait for the world, make our system stronger to try and encourage them to move with us to put in place higher standards. That's what the president is committed to do." GEITHNER ON TAKING RISKS: "I think that it's absolutely right that we're not going to get through this financial crisis unless the system is willing to take risks, unless banks and private investors are able and willing to take risks again. That does require some confidence and clarity about the rules of the game going forward. I think it's an important obligation we share with the Congress to try and make sure that we are providing that level of confidence and clarity. Also important though, is to make sure that we reassure the American people that the taxpayer's money is not going to reward failure, to encourage excessive risk taking in the future." GEITHNER ON BONUS CONTRACTS AT AIG: "The choices we faced were very constrained by the fact these were legal contracts and we're a nation of laws and we have to be very careful...about the government intervening with respect to a legally valid contract." "But we do have an obligation to go back and try to recoup those payments and we're going to do that carefully and explore legal avenues." "I do think it's appropriate for the country to put into place strong standards that govern compensation practice across the financial community as a whole because as we have seen those could have systemic consequences creating a more fragile and unstable system." GEITHNER ON MARK TO MARKET: "As you know I believe the SEC ... has put out for comment some important new clarifications to the fair value accounting regime." "My initial reaction is that they're a constructive set of changes. They provide a right balance between preserving confidence in the quality of public disclosure, which is very important to getting through this, but still address some of the complications of applying those provisions in a market like we're experiencing today."
