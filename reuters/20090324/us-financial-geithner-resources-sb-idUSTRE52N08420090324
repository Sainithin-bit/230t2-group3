 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Monday it may take more money eventually to handle the government's bailout of stressed banks but there is enough available for now to keep the process going. 

 Geithner, who has come under fire for his handling of the financial crisis and the use of government bailout funds to pay big executive bonuses, said he has not asked to resign. Geithner spoke Monday night after earlier in the day laying out details of Treasury's plan to set up public-private partnerships to help rid banks of soured assets, offering generous government financing for them to do so. "We put in the budget a reserve fund to recognize the reality that it may be that we need more resources to do this," he said a forum sponsored by The Wall Street Journal. "But we have significant resources authorized to us and we're going to move forward to use those now and we want to make sure we have the capacity, working with Congress over time, to make sure that we have sufficient resources to do this right," he added. In response to questions, Geithner said getting the banks back into a condition to resume normal lending was a critical part of restoring financial stability but wasn't enough by itself. He said stronger oversight of firms and markets that carry the greatest risks for the financial system was essential, and said if action to do so were delayed it would make it all the more difficult to rebuild consumer and business confidence. Financial markets responded enthusiastically on Monday to the plans for investment funds that Geithner presented, but a questioner reminded him that only last week a few lawmakers were suggesting he should resign after the bonuses paid out to executives of bailed-out insurer American International Group raised a storm of protest. President Barack Obama said on Sunday night, in an appearance on CBS' "60 Minutes," that he wouldn't accept Geithner's quitting if he asked to and Geithner said he hadn't done so. "I did not ask," Geithner said. " I feel a great sense of privilege working for this president at this time." (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville ; editing by Leslie Adler)
