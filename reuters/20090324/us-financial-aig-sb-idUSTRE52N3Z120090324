 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from the testimony of U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley to a House Financial Services subcommittee on Tuesday about the AIG bailout. 

 BERNANKE ON NEED FOR NEW REGULATORY AUTHORITY: "First, AIG highlights the urgent need for new resolution procedures for systemically important non-bank financial firms. If a federal agency had had such tools on September 16, they could have been used to put AIG into conservatorship or receivership, unwind it slowly, protect policyholders, and impose haircuts on creditors and counterparties as appropriate." DUDLEY ON AIG REPAYING FED: "The total package of assistance that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department have committed to AIG has established a more durable capital structure for the company that gives AIG greater time and flexibility to execute its asset disposition plan to repay government funds. Notably, we have recently agreed in principle to accept preferred interests in two of AIG's large foreign life insurance subsidiaries, AIA and ALICO, in order to make repayment of our loan less dependent on forced divestitures into a depressed acquisition market. Although it will take time, we still expect that the proceeds from asset sales should enable AIG to repay the New York Fed in full." GEITHNER ON NEED FOR NEW REGULATORY AUTHORITY: "The lack of an appropriate regulatory regime and resolution authority for large non-bank financial institutions contributed to this crisis and will continue to constrain our capacity to address future crises. ... The proposed legislation would fill a significant void in the current financial services regulatory structure with respect to non-bank financial institutions. Implementation would be modeled on the resolution authority that the FDIC has under current law with respect to banks."
