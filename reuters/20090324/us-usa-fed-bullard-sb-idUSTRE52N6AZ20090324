 LONDON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks have "considerable" scope to ease a global recession despite very low interest rates but need an inflation target to anchor policy, a top Fed official said on Tuesday. 

 St Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard said that committing to increase the money supply, or quantitative easing, could help prevent a Japan-style deflation, which he called a risk due to severity of the global economic shock. "A credible plan would also name an explicit inflation objective to help control the currently very diffuse expectations of medium-term inflation," Bullard said in prepared remarks to the Cass Business School in London. The U.S. central bank has cut interest rates to almost zero and last week said it would inject up to $1.15 trillion of more aid to the U.S. economy via purchases of U.S. Treasuries and agency mortgage debt to confront a deepening recession. Bullard, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, said some people feared inflation because the Fed was expanding its balance sheet massively with its measures to help financial markets, while others were more worried about deflation. "Given the severity of the global macroeconomic shock, the possibility of a deflationary trap cannot be dismissed. "Central banks therefore must adopt alternative policy approaches if they are to anchor inflation expectations, avoid sustained deflation, and maintain an active and effective stabilization policy," Bullard said. The Fed under Chairman Ben Bernanke has studied inflation targeting but opted not to go that far at this stage, despite Bernanke's own long-standing support for the move. It has, however, recently decided to publish the long-term inflation forecasts of its policy-makers as a step in that direction. Bullard said the United States could avoid Japan's fate, where deflation inflicted a decade of stagnation in the 1990s, by committing to an inflation target at the same time that it was engineering persistent growth in the U.S. monetary base. "An explicit inflation objective could assist the transition back to conventional policy as normal conditions return and help ensure that Fed policy does not inadvertently cause a new round of high and volatile inflation once the current crisis passes," he said in his remarks.
