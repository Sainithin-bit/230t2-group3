 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Legislation aimed at cleaning up the credit card business is expected to come up for a vote in a U.S. Congressional committee as soon as next week, testing political alignments going into a major push by Democrats for financial regulation reform. 

 Amid a severe global financial crisis and a deep recession, the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee is scheduled to consider the bill, likely on April 1. Among other goals, it aims to stop practices such as double-cycle billing in which card issuers reach into the previous monthly statement to calculate late fees. If approved in the House, it could be the first bill in a series aimed at reshaping a system of banking and market oversight that many Democrats blame for failing to protect consumers and investors in recent years, and doing too little to prevent the origins of today's global financial crisis. A similar broad reform effort is under way in the European Union, where policy-makers are addressing issues such as bank capital standards. But credit cards are not as central to everyday life in Europe as they are in the United States. Credit card reform has wide support in the House, where Democrats are firmly in control, and passage of a bill is likely. The closely divided Senate will be the true test. "That is where the big fight is going to be," said Travis Plunkett, legislative director at the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group. "It looks like a close vote," Plunkett said. "There is a reasonable chance that it will move through the committee." Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, a Democrat, reintroduced his own credit card bill last month after not moving one through his committee last year. "The ground is more fertile this year for card legislation given the current 'anti-business' environment," said Ken Clayton, a general counsel who handles credit card policy at the American Bankers Association. Banking committee spokeswoman Kate Szostak said Dodd could act quickly this time around, noting: "He plans to move the legislation in the coming weeks." EASY TARGET Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress see cracking down on unpopular credit card practices as politically safe -- constituents at all income levels dislike hidden card fees and surprise increases in card interest rates. The card industry, however, has said regulatory changes will be a monumental task requiring more employees, a change in software and working with vendors to print new disclosures that are not easy to read. Dodd has said eliminating abusive credit card practices will be part of a broad plan to overhaul the regulation of the banking, securities and insurance industries. "Dodd has the power to move this legislation if he wants to," said Linda Sherry, a spokeswoman for Consumer Action, a nonprofit consumer group. The Senate Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing on Tuesday to examine abusive credit card practices. "This hearing may provide insight into how hard Democrats will fight for this change," said Concept Capital analyst Jaret Seiberg. In the House, the credit card bill introduced by New York Democratic Rep. Carolyn Maloney is largely the same as one that passed the House last year. The current one would require implementation within 90 days of enactment, which would mean speedier changes than in a timetable already imposed by the Federal Reserve. The central bank has given the card industry until July 1, 2010, to implement rules approved by the central bank addressing what Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke has called unfair and deceptive practices. Many consumer groups and lawmakers have criticized the Fed for giving card issuers too much time on the new rules. But Maloney's timeframe has miffed banks sorely in need of revenue and those institutions won't be too thrilled if Democrats also try to make it easier for card holders to discharge their debt in the bankruptcy process.
