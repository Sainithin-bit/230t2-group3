 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Williams-Sonoma Inc ( WSM.N ) posted profit that was much better than Wall Street expected on Tuesday, helped by cost cuts and promotions, and its shares rose 7 percent. 

 The company, which operates the Williams-Sonoma, Pottery Barn and West Elm chains, said the latest quarter ended better than it expected, although the overall retail environment was "very weak." It said it did not expect to earn a profit again until the holiday shopping season. Williams-Sonoma said it plans to keep paying its quarterly dividend for the rest of the year, assuming there are no significant changes to its business. The whole retail industry is suffering as consumers pare spending. The home furnishings sector has been particularly hard-hit as the housing slump means even fewer purchases of furniture, rugs and other home goods. Net earnings tumbled 90 percent to $12.2 million, or 12 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended February 1 from $124.6 million, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier. Excluding an asset impairment charge and costs for closing stores and cutting jobs, profit was 31 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 16 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. A few analysts said the 16 cents should be compared with earnings of 23 cents a share, which exclude the impairment charge but include severance and lease termination costs, since some see those as part of doing business in a recession. In January, Williams-Sonoma announced a $75 million cost-savings plan that included cutting 18 percent of its full-time workers and closing a call center and a distribution facility. It is also trying to make its supply chain more efficient and reduce circulation of its catalogs to direct more investment to its online business, its most profitable unit. SALES TUMBLES SEEN CONTINUING Quarterly net revenue fell nearly 27 percent to $1.01 billion, as sales at stores open at least a year dropped 22.3 percent. Same-store sales fell 29 percent at Pottery Barn, 24.9 percent at Pottery Barn Kids, 16.8 percent at Williams-Sonoma and 16.7 percent at outlet stores. Assuming current sales trends continue, the company said it expects losses for the first three quarters of this fiscal year and a profit in the fourth quarter. As a result, it sees full-year results in a range from a loss of 15 cents per share to a profit of 5 cents, which is below analysts' average estimate for a profit of 6 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The company forecast full-year revenue of $2.8 billion to $2.95 billion, which would be 12 percent to 17 percent lower than last year and below analysts' estimate of $2.98 billion. "We are not intending to signal any type of insight into which direction the economy is headed -- but only that if our trends continue as they are today; this is how we would expect the year to unfold," Chief Executive Howard Lester said in a statement. For the current first quarter, the retailer forecast a loss of 20 cents to 23 cents per share, below the 6 cent loss analysts expected. Cowen & Co analyst Laura Champine said she was concerned about the company's dependence this year on the fourth quarter, when holiday gift-giving usually boosts sales. "They need to hit a home run in Q4 and that's obviously a ways out from here and a little scary," Champine said. The outlook also assumes that Williams-Sonoma delivers on plans such as offering more lower-priced items, improving its customer service, keeping inventories tight, reducing capital spending and renegotiating retail leases. The company plans to end the year with 628 stores, or one more than it ended last year with. Instead of closing many underperforming stores outright, Lester said on a conference call that the company is trying to reduce its rent. Despite the downturn, the company said it is not even discussing closing its struggling Williams-Sonoma Home chain, which sells custom-upholstered furniture and formal china dinnerware and is a drag on earnings. Williams-Sonoma shares were up 79 cents, or 7.1 percent, at $11.98 in late afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
