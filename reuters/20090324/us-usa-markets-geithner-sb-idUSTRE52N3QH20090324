 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday the September rescue of American International Group was warranted to avoid a potential 1930's style meltdown, but showed new rules were essential. 

 "AIG highlights the urgent need for new resolution procedures for systemically important nonbank financial firms," Bernanke said in prepared testimony to the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services. KEY POINTS: * "AIG highlights the urgent need for new resolution procedures for systemically important nonbank financial firms," Bernanke said in prepared testimony to the House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services. COMMENTS: ERIC KUBY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTH STAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORP, CHICAGO: "This is not something that is going to move the market. The policies that Bernanke outlined last Wednesday and Geithner outlined yesterday are the focus and this is more of a side show, trying to address the outcry. But I don't think that anything they say today is likely to move the market given what they've said over the last week. "What we've been waiting for for almost six months is to know the outline of the plan and some of the details. Its an enormous positive that these plans have been laid out. "We are into a new game and it that much better environment than we were in a week ago." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "I would have lots of questions for Geithner if I were able to talk to him, but not one of those questions will be asked by anyone in Congress. My questions would be about what happened yesterday, which is not the subject of today's hearing. I think yesterday's announcement has lots of promise, but there is just way too many unanswered questions. The focus (on AIG) is a waste of time. There are many issues that need to be addressed, and urgently so, especially given that Treasury is understaffed. I question whether or not it is even a valuable use of the time of the Treasury secretary when he is having to perform multiple jobs, to be standing before Congress testifying on something that is clearly not an urgent matter." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "Certainty everyone knows that AIG really was too big and too intertwined throughout the financial system and that the level of risk was extreme and a bit out of control. "Everybody knew the bonuses on Wall Street are so short term focused that they encourage risk taking and that they raise the level of risk for these institutions. "We haven't seen much in terms regulation yet. Regulation is always the last step in solving a crisis and that's still to come." LOU BRIEN, MARKET STRATEGIST, DRW TRADING, CHICAGO: "They are trying to put a spin on what happened. There are no surprises. They are using this as a venue to forward their programs." "Dudley is putting more meat on the bone that they were barred from overruling the AIG bonuses." "Things (outcries over AIG bonuses) should calm down with Congress which has taken a populist stand." DUSTIN REID, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBS GLOBAL BANKING & MARKETS, CHICAGO: "I don't see a whole lot new from Geithner. He said his piece yesterday and that has helped regain market confidence. The dollar is bid today but it's caught between two poles -- one that says quantitative easing will cause eventual erosion and one that has people buying dollars now that Geithner's plan has helped regain some market confidence. You're going to have a lot of choppy trading as things swing between those two schools of thought." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes open lower. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar hold gains.
