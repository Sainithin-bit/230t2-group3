 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The majority leader in the U.S. House of Representatives, Steny Hoyer, said on Tuesday he wanted to carefully examine Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's proposal to give the government authority to wind down failing non-banks. 

 "I'm not prejudging the issue, I'm just saying, at this point in time I want to look at it more carefully," Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, told reporters. Hoyer said he would want to talk to heads of the relevant House committees, including Democrat Barney Frank, "to determine whether or not they think that such delegation of authority is appropriate, or whether there needs to be some greater oversight. We are talking about huge sums of money, huge consequences, for one individual."
