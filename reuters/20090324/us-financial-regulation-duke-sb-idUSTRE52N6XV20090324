 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators should not artificially constrain lending by financial firms while still encouraging them to improve risk management, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke said in testimony for a hearing. 

 Duke also said the Fed is working with other regulators to monitor daily the liquidity positions of major banking organizations and is looking beyond the current crisis to conduct a broad examination of liquidity requirements. The head of the Office of Thrift Supervision said in separate testimony the banking agencies will release in the first half of this year guidance on what constitutes sufficient liquidity. Regarding the current crisis, Duke said banks that have experienced losses and hold less capital need to manage their risks properly to ensure their viability. "At the same time, it is important that supervisors remain balanced and not place unreasonable or artificial constraints on lenders that could hamper credit availability," Duke said in prepared remarks to be delivered before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. The hearing will examine complaints that banks are having trouble balancing regulators' demands that they maintain large capital cushions, while not pulling back on lending. Scott Polakoff, acting director of the OTS, said the problem of tight credit can only fully be solved when the economy rebounds. In the meantime, he said government should consider giving higher priority to "active lenders" when deciding who gets federal bailout funds. "Another way to improve the situation is to continue to explore ways of meeting liquidity needs of all banks and thrifts in these times when credit availability is key to their lending operations," Polakoff said. Regulators have said they hope recent bailout efforts -- including the bank capital injections and the toxic asset plan unveiled on Monday -- will revive bank balance sheets and put them in a better position to lend. POLICING RISK Duke said the current problems in the banking and financial system stem from lax monitoring of risk, even at firms under federal supervision. "Clearly, these lapses are unacceptable," she said. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp also said in the testimony that regulators shoulder some of the blame for not appropriately monitoring the risk financial institutions were taking on. Investment banks such as Bear Stearns had taken on leverage ratios that exceeded 30-to-1, meaning that for every dollar in equity, the firms had more than $30 in debt. "While the banking supervisors issued a number of warnings to the industry and provided guidance for enhancing risk management, in hindsight, the agencies should have been more vigilant about some institutions' outsized risk exposures and underwriting practices," FDIC Vice Chairman Martin Gruenberg said in testimony. Duke said the Fed is taking "vigorous steps" to improve risk management at regulated firms and is "aggressively downgrading supervisory ratings and using our enforcement tools" when firms are not making appropriate progress. Duke also said the agencies are looking at improving liquidity guidelines for financial institutions. The Fed said earlier this month the new guidelines will emphasize "meaningful" forecasts of funding needs in both normal and stressed conditions. Polakoff said the regulatory guidance will incorporate recent lessons learned and the liquidity guidance issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. He also said the regulators will focus on the need for diversified funding sources, stress testing and an unencumbered cushion of highly liquid assets that are readily available.
