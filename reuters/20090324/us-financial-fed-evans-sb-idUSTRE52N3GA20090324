 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - Following are highlights of comments made by Chicago Fed President Charles Evan on the sidelines of a conference in Prague on Tuesday. 

 Evans said growth should return to the U.S. by the end of this year but unemployment will continue to rise and may exceed the Fed's forecasts range. ON GROWTH AND UNEMPLOYMENT "I expect that before the year is out, we'll see positive growth rates for the GDP in the U.S. but it will not feel especially good because the unemployment rate is likely to going to keep going up and the labor market won't truly improve until the beginning of 2010. "Our own (unemployment) forecast has it in the territory of 8.5-9 pct. I'm little concerned that the more recent unemployment data had been a little negative for that forecast so the risks are that it's higher, it comes in higher than the 8.5 to 9 pct." ON INFLATION "Even though there's a tremendous amount of liquidity expansion... inflation expectations seem to be well maintained. In fact, there are disinflation forces that are a bit of more concern at the moment." It appears that the inflation risks are to the downside, that is, there are disinflationary forces at work. If for some reason, that were to change, that would have to be addressed as well. But that's not my forecast, I don't think that's a very large risk at the moment." ON FED BUYING TREASURIES "At the moment, we've announced $300 billion. I frankly think that's a very good amount of accommodation and I'm hopeful we have in place the right amount to deal with the current outlook. We will use all tools at our disposal depending on how the outlook and the economy develops." WHETHER MEASURES ARE WORKING "You don't see it in the real numbers of course because businesses are very quickly trying to get their cost under control and are grappling with severe contraction in aggregate demand. I think that indication that private investors are willing to participate in the expanded TALF and you know the other financial stability programs is very positive sign." "One thing that is challenging for central bankers in the current environment I think that the state of our outlook is such that a substantial amount of accommodation is necessary from the Federal Reserve and central banks." ON FED LENDING "The challenging aspect as a central bank is we need to make sure our lending is secured to our satisfaction. I have thought about this long and hard, on the one hand sometimes it appears there's risk but as I look at it more and more and talk to more and more business people, I'm convinced that our safeguards are quite adequate." "The legacy asset issues, we'll have to see how the pricing for that goes. But you know, a toxic asset is only a toxic asset depending on the price, if you get the pricing right. And I'm pretty confident it'll meet our standards for avoiding unnecessary credit risk." ON CHANCE OF PRICING BEING RIGHT FOR TOXIC ASSETS "Well, that's the nature of the program and that's going to depend a lot on investors being willing to come in and bid for those assets and it's also going to depend on what the marks are on the balance sheets of the financial institutions looking to sell so I think the program's been very well designed and I'm very hopeful the market conditions will be receptive."
