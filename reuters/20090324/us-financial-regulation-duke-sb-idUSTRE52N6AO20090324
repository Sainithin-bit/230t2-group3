 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. bank regulators should not artificially constrain financial firms' lending while still encouraging them to improve their risk management practices, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Elizabeth Duke said in testimony for a Wednesday hearing. 

 Duke also said the Fed is working with other regulators to monitor daily the liquidity positions of major banking organizations and is looking beyond the current crisis to conduct a broad examination of liquidity requirements. The head of the Office of Thrift Supervision said in separate testimony that the banking agencies will release in the first half of this year guidance on what constitutes sufficient liquidity. Regarding the current crisis, Duke said banks that have experienced losses and hold less capital need to properly manage their risks to ensure their viability. "At the same time, it is important that supervisors remain balanced and not place unreasonable or artificial constraints on lenders that could hamper credit availability," Duke said in prepared remarks to be delivered before the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday. The hearing will examine complaints that banks are having trouble balancing regulators' demands that they maintain large capital cushions while not pulling back on lending. Duke said the current problems in the banking and financial system stem from firms' lax monitoring of risk, even at firms under federal supervision. "Clearly, these lapses are unacceptable," she said. She said the Fed is taking "vigorous steps" to improve risk management at regulated firms and is "aggressively downgrading supervisory ratings and using our enforcement tools" when firms are not making appropriate progress.
