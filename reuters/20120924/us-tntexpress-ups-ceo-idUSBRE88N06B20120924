 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch delivery group TNT Express ( TNTE.AS ) said on Monday its chief executive would leave the company by the end of this month to pursue a different career but the takeover of TNT by U.S. rival UPS ( UPS.N ) would not be affected. 
 TNT Express repeated in a statement it expected the acquisition by UPS to be completed early next year. TNT Express' chief financial officer, Bernard Bot, will take over as interim CEO after Marie-Christine Lombard's departure, the company said.
