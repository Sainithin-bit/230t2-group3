 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Sunday that the ECB was paying close attention to rising oil and commodity prices because of the possible knock-on price effects. 

 "We have to be alert to avoid second-round effects" from increased commodity prices, Trichet said in an interview on Dutch television when asked about inflation concerns. When asked whether troubled countries in the euro zone might restructure their debts this year, he said he did not assume or expect that would happen.
