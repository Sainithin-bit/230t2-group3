 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Recent proposals by the European Union's Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso to increase the size of the European rescue fund are not helpful, Germany's Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle was quoted as saying. 

 "If the hypothesis ... is true that economics is half psychology, then such remarks are not helpful," Westerwelle was quoted as saying in the Handelsblatt on Sunday ahead of publication on Monday. Europe is discussing ways to beef up its EFSF rescue fund to show it has enough firepower to support states struggling with their debt, hoping this will ease the region's debt crisis. The fund has a headline value of 440 billion euros but an effective lending capacity estimated at just 225 billion euros because of the need to secure a triple-A credit rating. The challenge is to boost it without raising the headline sum, which would be difficult to sell politically to Germany's parliament and public in particular. In another pre-publication report, Westerwelle reiterated Germany's stance against the introduction of joint euro bonds but called for closer euro zone coordination of economic and fiscal policy. "A communalization of national debt would take the pressure off budget consolidation," he said. "Thus it is important to stick with the principle of national responsibility for debt." The lesson to learn from the sovereign debt crisis was to end running up debts as was policy in recent years, he added. Germany has sped away from euro zone peers still struggling under heavy burdens of debt. Europe's largest economy grew at 3.6 percent last year, the fastest rate since reunification. But on Sunday, the chairman of Germany's panel of economic advisers was quoted as saying the rebound should not lead to euphoria. "The trees will not grow sky-high this year," Handelsblatt quoted Wolfgang Franz as saying. "In important trade partners like Spain, Portugal and Britain there will be consolidation this year. That's not exactly going to increase their imports." (Reporting by  Annika Breidthardt ; Editing by Will Waterman)
