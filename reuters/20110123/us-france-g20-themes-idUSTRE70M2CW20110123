 PARIS  (Reuters) - President Nicolas Sarkozy will spell out on Monday the program for France's year-long stewardship of the Group of 20. 

 Below are the main themes of its presidency: REFORM OF THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY SYSTEM Sarkozy has called for a "new Bretton Woods" system for the 21st century which responds to the globalised nature of the world economy. He has said that the dollar's pre-eminence as a reserve currency is destabilizing and the monetary system must be reformed to better suit a "multi-polar" world. French officials say privately that Paris wants to avoid an appreciation of the euro in a rebalancing of the world economy, while China continues to anchor its yuan currency to the U.S. dollar. Paris is focusing its discussion of the international monetary system on three topics: coordination, protection, and diversification. Under the rubric of coordination, France is seeking to improve the dialogue on economic policies, including a discussion on 'indicative guidelines' for global imbalances that was begun under the Korean G20 presidency. These broad guidelines are expected to take into account specific factors -- such as a country's position as a commodities exporter or high savings rates due to demographics -- and should be concluded by the summer, with a first evaluation taking place before the end of the year. The issue of protection includes measures which would allow emerging Asian countries to unwind the trillions of dollars in reserves they have accumulated, mostly since the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. This could include stricter regulation of destabilizing international capital flows and the use of larger and more easily accessible IMF credit lines to act as safety nets. Finally, diversification means an attempt to shift away from a reliance on the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. A report submitted to Sarkozy on Friday by a group of eminent economists -- including ex-Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker and China's deputy central bank chief Hu Xiaolian -- backed French calls for a consideration of the longer-term use of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) as a reserve asset. Wider use of SDRs has received some support from Chinese officials and some emerging countries like Brazil and Russia, concerned that quantitive easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve could fuel an asset bubble in developing economies. However, some G20 partners have dubbed France's plans confusing and too far-reaching. U.S. President Barack Obama was publicly silent on the issue at a meeting with Sarkozy in Washington this month and the French leader said afterwards there was no immediate replacement for the dollar as a reserve currency. While French officials have played down hopes of a major breakthrough this year, they say France could target the establishment of a timeframe for China's yuan currency to enter the basket of currencies underpinning SDRs, perhaps in a quid pro quo for greater flexibility from Beijing. French officials say that Germany and Mexico, which takes up the G20 baton in November, have been asked to lead working groups on reform of the financial system. TACKLING VOLATLITY IN THE COMMODITIES MARKETS France supports the extension of G20 decisions on the regulation of financial derivatives into the commodities market, via something similar to the United States' Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) reforms. This could involve the registration of transactions in centralized databases, the standardization of contracts, the use of a clearing house to settle transactions and the imposition of maximum positions to prevent trading houses from cornering the market in commodities. Paris also hopes to improve the dialogue between commodities producing and consuming countries, particularly on cereals. On food security, France has suggested the international community could coordinate better in response to crises, possibly via regional stockpiles or more proactive responses from international organizations like the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). French sources cite skepticism from Saudi Arabia and China about improving the scope and frequency of data on energy reserves, for example. Saudi Arabia and Russia have been asked to preside over working groups on raw materials. REFORMING GLOBAL ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE Sarkozy has called for action to improve global economic governance, promote development and address a "democratic deficit" in some international organizations. The report submitted to Sarkozy on Friday by eminent economists said the IMF had failed to meet its mandate of guaranteeing exchange rate stability and the G20 had de facto stepped into that role. The efficacy of the G20, the report said, could be improved if it had a more formal institutional architecture and could speak for all countries of the world using a constituency system similar to the IMF and World Bank. However some countries, such as Japan, have expressed opposition to France's suggestion of creating an institutional structure for the G20 to smooth the transition between rotating presidencies -- saying there is no need for another layer of global governance.
