 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N, which is in the midst of a multiyear effort to overhaul its business and win back market share, on Wednesday said it named Bruce Besanko chief financial officer, effective July 30. 

 Besanko, 48, joins Circuit City from The Yankee Candle Co., where he was chief financial officer since April 2005. Besanko has also held jobs at Circuit City's chief rival Best Buy Co. ( BBY.N ) and Sears, Roebuck. Circuit City announced in February that then-finance chief Michael Foss was leaving to become chief financial officer at Petco Animal Supplies Inc.PETC.OQ Foss had worked at Circuit City for 3-1/2 years. This year, Circuit City has announced store closures, job cuts and a plan to replace 3,400 workers with lower-paid staff in a bid to turn around its business and win market share amid heavy competition from Best Buy and discounters such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) Last month, Circuit posted a $54.6 million first-quarter loss and withdrew its earnings forecast, saying it could not predict when the market would improve. "Clearly macro issues have impacted our results as well as all of the (internal) work going on," said David Mathews, Circuit City executive vice president of merchandising, services and marketing, at a CIBC World Markets conference on Wednesday. "We were busy right-sizing our cost structure over the last four or five months, which really took our eye off execution," Mathews said at the conference, which was Webcast over the Internet. "We're back to managing the business." Circuit City shares were off 14 cents, or 1 percent, to $14.50 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Best Buy was up 15 cents at $47.66. Circuit City's stock has fallen 24 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent decline in Best Buy shares.
