 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The subprime mortgage debt crisis will have little impact on the U.S. or Asian economies because that loan market is relatively small and would not create a ripple effect, Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday. 

 On Tuesday, ratings agencies Standard & Poor's and Moody's roiled financial markets with their negative views on the U.S. market for loans to borrowers with low credit standings. Moody's cut ratings on 399 mortgage-backed securities and said it may cut ratings on further 32, affecting $5.2 billion in debt. Standard & Poor's said it may cut ratings on $12 billion of subprime-related debt on forecasts of more delinquent and defaulted U.S. home loans. That sent ripples across markets for risky assets like stocks and emerging debt because of fears of a contagion-like effect. But Moody's said these concerns were unfounded. "At this point we don't think this will have anything but a marginal effect on the U.S. economy and so therefore even less on the Asian economies," Steven Hess, senior credit officer, told a news conference. "The dollar amount is not very big and a fairly small amount of the total U.S. financial market." And Asian financial institutions -- sitting on piles of cash as exports from the region boomed while their lending was not as brisk -- were quite conservative in their investments, Moody's analysts said. "Asian banks tend to invest in highly rated instruments -- AAA or AA instruments," said Deborah Schuler, regional credit officer dealing with Asian financial institutions. While some of them did invest in AA- or Baa-rated assets, they did not invest in non-investment grade securities, she said. "So it is highly unlikely they hold these in the first place and very unlikely they hold them in quantity ... its just a drop in the bucket," she added. Schuler drew a parallel with how the collapses of Worldcom and Enron did not significantly affect Asian banks because their exposure to these two failed corporations was minimal. The impact on the U.S. economy was also likely to be small. "Subprime mortgages are a small part of U.S. mortgages, which are a small part of the total debt in the U.S. This is not, in our analysis, a huge problem," Schuler said.
