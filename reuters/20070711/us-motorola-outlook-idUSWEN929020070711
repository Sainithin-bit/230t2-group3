 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc MOT.N on Wednesday forecast a second-quarter loss and lower revenue and said it no longer expects its mobile device business to be profitable for the full year 2007, blaming weak sales of cell phones in Asia and Europe. 

 Motorola said it expects a second-quarter net loss from continuing operations ranging from 2 cents per share to 4 cents per share on sales of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion. The company previously forecast that second-quarter sales would be essentially flat with first-quarter sales of $9.4 billion. Motorola also named Stu Reed, a supply chain executive, as president of its mobile devices unit.
