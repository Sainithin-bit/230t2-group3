 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Eye care products maker Advanced Medical Optics Inc EYE.N on Wednesday fired back at its third largest shareholder, ValueAct Capital, which opposes the company's takeover bid for Bausch & Lomb Inc BOL.N. 

 Advanced Medical Optics Chief Executive James Mazzo, responding to a critical letter from ValueAct, said he was "surprised and disappointed" by ValueAct's opposition to the $4.23 billion hostile bid for Bausch & Lomb. Mazzo said this was "especially hard to understand given (ValueAct's) expressed interest on June 12th in investing $700 million in equity in a Bausch & Lomb acquisition and your reaffirmation of a desire to participate in financing the transaction as recently as July 5." Mazzo reiterated his view the deal offers "a unique and compelling value-creating opportunity." The letter, filed with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, comes one day after rival suitor Warburg Pincus cleared regulatory hurdles to move ahead with its offer of $65 per share in cash, or $3.67 billion. Advanced Medical Optics offered $75 per share on July 5, of which $45 is cash and $30 is stock. He continued: "Your letter makes numerous inaccurate and misleading statements about the proposed transaction that we feel compelled to address." Among them was what Mazzo called a "blatant mischaracterization" of Advanced Medical Optics' conversations regarding potential commitments from private equity firms to finance the bid. "While we may use private equity financing in the future, we do not have commitments at the current time only because we have not sought them -- and not because of any perceived regulatory risk," Mazzo said, adding he has received positive feedback from many shareholders. Advanced Medical Optics' largest holders are Fidelity Management & Research and MFS Investments. He also responded to ValueAct's concerns about regulatory risks, asserting he was confident the issues could be addressed in a timely matter. Advanced Medical Optics, a maker of laser-vision correction equipment, contact-lens cleaning solutions and other products, would likely face tougher regulatory scrutiny since some of its businesses overlap with Bausch & Lomb's, according to Wall Street analysts. Officials from ValueAct, which had about 2 million shares, or about 12.2 percent of Advanced Medical Optics, were not immediately available to comment. Larry Biegelsen, an analyst with Wachovia, did not expect bidding for Bausch & Lomb to rise much higher. "Bausch's financial advisor considered Warburg's $65 offer fair from a financial point of view, and considering Warburg's disciplined investment philosophy, we do not expect Warburg to increase its offer substantially," Biegelsen wrote in a research note. Earlier today, Bausch & Lomb, which has been plagued by waves of product recalls over the past year-and-a-half, said its Greenville, South Carolina plant was found to be compliant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Bausch & Lomb shares were down $1.31 at $69.04 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading, while the shares of Advanced Medical rose 45 cents to $34.74.
