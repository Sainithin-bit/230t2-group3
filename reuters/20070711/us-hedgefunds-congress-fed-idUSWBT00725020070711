 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The rapid growth of hedge funds could pose risks to financial stability if market participants fail to strengthen risk management practices, Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh said on Wednesday. 

 Warsh, in prepared testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said the Fed shares the view that the most effective mechanism for limiting systemic risks is strengthening market discipline among large, global, commercial and investment banks. "The recent growth of hedge funds presents some formidable challenges to the achievement of public-policy objectives, including significant risk-management challenges to market participants," Warsh said. "If market participants prove unwilling or unable to meet these challenges, losses in the hedge fund sector could pose significant risks to financial stability."
