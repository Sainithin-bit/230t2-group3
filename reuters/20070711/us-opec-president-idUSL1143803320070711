 ABU DHABI  (Reuters) - OPEC sees no need to raise output at the moment but is ready to pump more oil when necessary, the producer group's president said on Wednesday. 

 "OPEC does not find any reason at the moment to increase its production of crude oil," OPEC President and United Arab Emirates Energy Minister Mohammed al-Hamli told reporters in Abu Dhabi. "The member countries of the organization are ready to pump additional amounts of crude oil into the market if the need arises."
