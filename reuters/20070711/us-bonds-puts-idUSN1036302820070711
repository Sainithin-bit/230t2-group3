 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - As U.S. Treasury bonds rallied on Tuesday, many investors sought options known as puts pegged to a fund often used as a bond market surrogate and, in this case, as a safety net, should bond prices reverse course and fall. 

 Investors often turn to equity puts, giving them the right to sell a stock at a preset price within a specified time period, to guard their holdings against downside risk. The iShares Lehman 20+ Year Treasury Index TLT.N, which tracks bonds with longer maturities in the Treasury market, rose 1.59 percent, or $1.33, to close at $85.04 on the New York Stock Exchange. The fund is also traded on the American Stock Exchange. "Bonds are making a big move higher amid concerns about the ongoing woes in the subprime market and after (Fed Chairman) Ben Bernanke failed to signal any meaningful shifts in his view on inflation," said Frederic Ruffy, analyst at Optionetics, an options education firm in Redwood City, California. U.S. government bond prices ended sharply higher on Tuesday as worries about subprime mortgage debt and the weakening housing market hurt stocks and drove investors into safer U.S. government bonds. PROTECTION MONEY The rise in the fund's stock price also fueled activity in its options, with players apparently buying cheap puts in the event of another downturn in prices in the bond market, Ruffy said. Stacey Briere Gilbert, chief options strategist at Susquehanna Financial Group, echoed that view. "Opening investors bought 10,000 January $78 puts in what is likely protection for long positions in the ETF today," she said in a research report detailing options activity. The Lehman exchange-traded fund, or ETF, tracks Treasury bond market trading. When the fund's stock price goes up, interest rates and yields are falling while government bond prices are rising. Conversely, the ETF's stock price drops when interest rates and yields rise while bond prices fall. In late trading, the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR jumped 25/32 in price, while its yield fell to 5.03 percent from 5.14 percent late on Monday. Bond yields and prices move inversely. "Therefore, if investors are buying January out-of-the- money $78 puts, they are obviously expecting a big rise in interest rates and bond prices to go down," said Michael Schwartz, chief options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co., in New York. Schwartz noted the strategy is profitable if the fund trades below $78, up to and including January expiration minus the premium, and "that would occur if interest rates go up." Ruffy also noticed that more than 4,000 August $86 calls and 4,000 August $86 puts traded, which appears to be the purchase of an options strategy called a straddle, or a bet that volatility in the bond market will continue. Options activity in the ETF, which attracts nontraditional bond investors such as smaller hedge funds, was brisk. In all, 17,720 puts traded in the fund, compared to 6,600 calls, according to market research firm Track Data.
