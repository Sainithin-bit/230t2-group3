 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Genentech Inc. DNA.N on Wednesday said second-quarter profit rose 41 percent, fueled by growth from key cancer drugs Avastin and Rituxan, and it boosted its full-year profit forecast. 

 The world's second-largest biotechnology company had net income of $747 million, or 70 cents per share, compared with year-earlier net income of $531 million, or 49 cents a share. Genentech had a profit of 78 cents per share for the quarter excluding stock-based compensation expenses and other items and posted total operating revenue of $3.0 billion, up from $2.2 billion a year ago. Both beat Wall Street forecasts. Analysts, on average, had expected the South San Francisco-based company to post second-quarter earnings before items of 71 cents per share on revenue of $2.85 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "It was a quality quarter, with total revenue beating expectations by about $160 million," said Robert Baird & Co analyst Chris Raymond, who noted the company had slightly raised its 2007 earnings forecast. The company said it now expects 2007 full-year earnings per share excluding special items to grow 28 to 32 percent, which would translate into earnings of $2.85 to $2.95 per share. It had previously forecast growth of 25 to 30 percent. Investors were focused on results for Avastin, approved to treat colon and lung cancers and getting some off-label use for breast cancer patients. Avastin sales were $564 million for the quarter, up 33 percent. Rituxan, the company's top-performing drug in the United States in 2006 with annual sales of $2.07 billion, brought in $582 million. Shares in Genentech closed up $1.08, or 1.4 percent, to $75.93 on the New York Stock Exchange, off its high of $99.66 in December 2005. (Additional reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York)
