 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) on Wednesday reported a 12 percent rise in quarterly net earnings and nudged up its profit forecast for the year as strength in China and a lower tax rate offset weak results at its Taco Bell chain in the United States. 

 Net income was $214 million, or 39 cents per share, topping Wall Street analysts' average estimate of 36 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the same period last year, Yum earned $192 million, or 34 cents per share. Revenue rose 9 percent to $2.37 billion, compared with an average analyst estimate of $2.29 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales across all of Yum's restaurants rose 2 percent during the quarter. U.S. same-store sales, a key retail measure that tracks sales at restaurants open at least a year, were flat compared with last year. Yum's U.S. business has struggled since more than 70 people fell sick late last year because of an E. coli outbreak linked to Taco Bell restaurants in the U.S. Northeast. Federal health officials said contaminated lettuce was the likely cause. Same-store sales rose 7 percent in mainland China and climbed 5 percent at Yum's international division, which excludes China, Thailand and KFC Taiwan. A lower tax rate of 21.5 percent also helped boost results during the quarter. In the same period last year, Yum's tax rate was 7.5 percentage points higher. Yum said it expects to earn at least $1.63 per share for 2007, a penny better than its previous view but in line with analysts' average estimate. Yum shares rose to $34.45 in extended trade after closing at $34.41 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock increased 4.9 percent in regular trading on Wednesday after UBS analyst David Palmer upgraded his rating on the stock to "buy" from "neutral." Yum's stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 18 times analysts' average 2008 earnings estimate, compared with a multiple of 17 for rival McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) and 21 for Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N
