 ROCHESTER, Michigan  (Reuters) - Cerberus Capital Management Chairman John Snow said on Wednesday the private equity firm was 'confident' in securing Chrysler financing and sees the deal closing in the current quarter. 

 Snow also said the firm has no plans for an "exit strategy" regarding the Chrysler investment. The comments came as DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE shares fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday on market talk of possible financing difficulties for the sale of Chrysler to Cerberus.
