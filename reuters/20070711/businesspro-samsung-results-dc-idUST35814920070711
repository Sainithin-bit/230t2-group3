 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics, the world's top 
memory chip maker, is set to post a 15 percent drop in 
quarterly profit on Friday after a steep fall in computer 
memory chip prices overshadowed improvements in flat screens. 

  But the outlook for the second half is brighter, with 
prices for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips, used in 
personal computers, expected to recover on the back of seasonal 
demand, while the company's mobile phone and display business 
should improve.  "We expect across-the-board improvements thanks to the DRAM 
recovery, lower marketing costs in handsets and stronger 
flat-panel prices," said Song Myung-sup, an analyst at CJ 
Securities.  Encouraged by a strong DRAM market in 2006, manufacturers 
kept churning out the chips at a brisk pace in 2007 despite 
clear signs of oversupply and were faced with hair-raising 
price declines.  DRAM prices fell by 44 percent in the April-June quarter, 
after dropping 24 percent in the first, Prudential Investment & 
Securities estimated.  The scale of the DRAM debacle is likely to overshadow 
strong results in NAND-type flash memory chips used in digital 
cameras and music players and gains in flat screens.
  SHARES UNDERPERFORM  Samsung, the most valuable technology company outside the 
United States, is expected to report a net profit of 1.29 
trillion won ($1.40 billion) in the second quarter from 1.51 
trillion a year ago, according to a Reuters poll of 10 
analysts.  Operating profit is forecast at 880 billion won, down 38 
percent.  "This could be the worst result posted by Samsung since the 
end of 2001 in terms of operating profit," said Lee Min-hee, an 
analyst at Dongbu Securities.  Strength in Samsung's overseas units and an estimated 80 
billion won gain from the 576 billion won initial public 
offering of affiliate Samsung Card are expected to ten the blow 
on the net profit level.  Sales are expected at 15 trillion won, from 14.1 trillion.  Reflecting the poor performance, shares in Samsung, South 
Korea's biggest stock with a market value of about $100 
billion, rose just 0.5 percent in the second quarter, trailing 
the broader market's 20 percent rise.  Analysts expect Samsung to post a net profit of 3.85 
trillion won in the second half of 2007, up from an estimated 
2.89 trillion in the first half of 2007, but down from 4.53 
trillion in the second half of 2006, according to Reuters 
Estimates.  Samsung's DRAM rivals, including Hynix Semiconductor and 
Taiwan's top DRAM makers, Powerchip Semiconductor Corp., Nanya 
Technology Corp., also suffered from the price fall.  Powerchip, a manufacturing partner of Japan's Elpida Memory 
Inc., is expected to post a second-quarter net loss of T$3.57 
billion ($109.1 million), when it reports later this month, 
against T$3.19 billion a year ago.  Nanya is likely to post a net loss of T$2.45 billion on 
July 20, versus a net profit of T$3.71 billion.
  MOBILE PHONES, FLAT SCREENS  Samsung, also the world's third-largest maker of mobile 
phones after Nokia and Motorola, is likely to show continued 
shipment gains from its recent push into the medium-to-low end 
of the market.  Samsung is expected to have sold a record 37 million phones 
in April-June after selling 34.8 million in the first quarter. 
Margins in the telecommunications division are likely to be 
around 8 percent, down from 13 percent, on lower prices and 
higher marketing costs.  The world's biggest maker of large liquid crystal display 
(LCD) panels is likely to have performed better in the display 
business, thanks to an upturn in the flat-screen market after 
makers reined in output.  Operating profit margin is expected at 7 or 8 percent, 
compared with 3 percent a year ago.  ($1=919.9 Won)  ($1=32.73 Taiwan Dollar)
