 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ) confirmed on Wednesday that it has signed confidentiality and standstill agreements with third parties as it seeks alternatives to a hostile $28.6 billion takeover bid from rival Alcoa Inc. 

 "We're in negotiations with third parties," said Alcan spokeswoman Anik Michaud. As part of any negotiations, Alcan has required that third parties sign confidentiality and standstill agreements, she added. Michaud declined to identify the third parties, or comment on reports that Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) ( RIO.AX ) is preparing to bid for the big Canadian aluminum maker.
