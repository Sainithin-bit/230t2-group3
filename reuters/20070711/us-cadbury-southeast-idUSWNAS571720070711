 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cadbury Schweppes Plc's CBRY.L U.S. beverages unit, which makes Dr. Pepper and 7UP, said on Wednesday it acquired Southeast-Atlantic Beverage Corp., an independent, Florida-based bottler, for an undisclosed sum. 

 The bottler, which distributes many Cadbury beverages throughout most of Florida and northern Georgia, is the second-largest independent bottling company in the United States, according to Cadbury, which is getting ready to be separated from its British-based candy company parent.
