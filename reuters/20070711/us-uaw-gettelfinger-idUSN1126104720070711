 DETROIT  (Reuters) - United Auto Workers chief Ron Gettelfinger said on Wednesday the union was not heading into the upcoming labor negotiations with the U.S. automakers in a "concessionary mode." 

 Gettelfinger also said a "jobs bank" program that gives laid-off workers nearly their full salary and benefits should not come up in the union's negotiations with Detroit's Big Three automakers. "It won't be an issue for us," Gettelfinger said, speaking on the sidelines of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) event in Detroit. "We are not going in to these negotiations in a concessionary mode." General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler Group DCXGn.DEDCX.N face a crucial round of contract talks with the UAW beginning this month. The current four-year deal between the UAW and Detroit automakers expires on September 14. Executives at the U.S. automakers have said they would address the "jobs bank" along with health-care and benefit concessions in the labor talks. Gettelfinger also said the union was in talks with Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE on health care costs. Chrysler executives had been seeking a concession from the UAW similar to the groundbreaking deals clinched with GM and Ford in 2005 under which UAW workers and retirees pay more for health care. Gettelfinger last year declined Chrysler's request, saying the union's financial analysis showed Chrysler was in a stronger position than either of its larger, Detroit-based competitors. Chrysler Group is being sold to Cerberus Capital Management. Cerberus said on Wednesday the $7.4 billion deal to take Chrysler private was expected to close this month.
