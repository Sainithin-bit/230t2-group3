 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Europe's top sports bodies won a first battle to keep control of their games on Wednesday but a struggle with the European Commission over how sport should be run across the 27-nation bloc looks set to continue. 

 European soccer's UEFA welcomed the EU executive's long-awaited reform paper published on Wednesday covering television rights, transfers, security and gambling. But a deal by EU leaders in June on the outline of a new treaty for the bloc, including a clause on sport, has raised the prospect of Brussels proposing tougher laws in the future. "If we described the initial draft of this paper as being half empty, let's say this final paper is half full, with more to come," William Gaillard, special advisor to UEFA president Michel Platini, told Reuters. The main conclusion of Wednesday's document noted that the mandate for detailed negotiations on the new EU treaty, starting this month, foresaw a provision on sport. "If necessary, the Commission may return to this issue and indicate further steps in the context of a new Treaty provision," the document said. The treaty is designed to replace the EU's now defunct constitution, rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2004. It would have given sport a special exemption from key EU laws such as on competition and labor. They have implications for how television rights revenues are split up and attempts to foster local talent with quotas for homegrown players. The new treaty is set to maintain the constitution's wording on sport and also gives sports ministers for the first time the power to ask the Commission to propose EU legislation. UEFA said the Commission took "a big step forward" with the paper on TV rights and quotas for homegrown players. Sports bodies wanted Brussels to back central marketing and collective TV rights as the fairest model, rather than individual selling by clubs which allows the biggest teams to dominate revenues. "While joint selling of media rights raises competition concerns, the Commission has accepted it under certain conditions," the paper said. "Collective selling can be important for the redistribution of income and can thus be a tool for achieving greater solidarity within sports. Alternatively, a system of individual selling by clubs must be linked to a robust solidarity mechanism," it added. On rules to encourage the development of homegrown players, the Commission strengthened a proposal in a first draft, saying such rules "could be compatible with EU laws" and "justified". It intends to carry out an impact assessment in this area. "We have never seen such strong language and we acknowledge the effort made by the Commission to meet our concerns," UEFA's Gaillard said.
