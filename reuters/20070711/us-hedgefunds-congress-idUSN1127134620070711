 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The House Financial Services Committee will draft legislation requiring U.S. hedge funds to keep copies of trading data and will take a closer look at the role of credit rating agencies in the collapse of some funds linked to subprime mortgages, the panel chairman said on Wednesday. 

 Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said his planned bill would help protect investors in the lightly regulated hedge fund industry by giving federal agencies the ability to examine funds' records of trades, e-mail exchanges and other documents. "They'll have to retain data of records of trades for the purpose of insider trading enforcement," Frank told reporters after holding a hearing on hedge fund risks. "Anybody in the business is going to have to retain their data." During the hearing, Frank asked Bush administration officials whether Congress should adopt such a law. "We would have to be very careful with something like that," responded Erik Sirri, the head of market regulation at the Securities and Exchange Commission. He cautioned that the additional cost of record-keeping could drive some U.S. hedge funds overseas. Currently, about 2,000 hedge funds are voluntarily registered with the SEC. An appeals court ruling one year ago struck down an SEC rule requiring hedge funds to register with the agency, and some funds have since de-registered. On Wednesday, the SEC adopted a new rule to protect investors from hedge fund advisers who make misleading statements. On the issue of hedge fund data retention, Frank said the requirement would be a good place to start in understanding the role that the funds play in the overall economy. He acknowledged there was "no easy legislative fix" to any risks they might pose. Another market regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, requires some hedge funds to register with it when they participate in commodities pools, but officials at the hearing said hedge funds can fly under the radar by avoiding reporting requirements with any U.S. regulator. Frank asked if Congress should "rationalize" or somehow combine how the SEC and CFTC handle funds' registration. "This has developed on a patchwork basis and there isn't an overarching strategy," said Robert Steel, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance. The department recently announced a task force would review all financial services regulation, which would likely include the roles of the CFTC and SEC, Steel added. Frank also said the committee would hold a hearing this autumn to examine the role credit rating agencies have played in valuing subprime mortgage-related assets, including collateralized debt obligations. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N recently said it would provide about $1.6 billion to bail out one of its two struggling hedge funds that suffered big losses by making bad bets tied to subprime mortgage loans, which are held by consumers with weak credit. Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Services, two leading credit rating agencies, on Tuesday started slashing ratings for more than $17.3 billion of mortgage-related debt. "Somebody sure as hell was overvaluing something," Frank said. "Exactly when and who you don't know." Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh said during the hearing that valuing these illiquid assets is both art and science. "I would expect that the valuation of these securities is at the crux of what regulatory institutions are looking at as we speak," he said. Two other Congressional panels held separate hearings Wednesday examining tax issues and investor risks of hedge funds and private equity funds.
