 LONDON/STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Nordic bourse operator OMX OMX.ST is not in talks with any other suitors, people familiar with the situation said on Wednesday, as market speculation of a rival takeover offer sent shares soaring. 

 Shares of OMX, which agreed last Friday to be acquired by Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ), gained 6.6 percent to 227 crowns as traders discussed the possibility of a counterbid from government-owned Dubai International Finance Centre. Nasdaq is paying $3.7 billion for OMX, valuing the exchange owner at 206 crowns a share, but OMX shares have been trading higher than the offer since it was unveiled in expectation of another suitor. The sources said, however, there are no discussions at the moment. DIFC Governor Omar bin Suleiman told Reuters last Thursday, before the Nasdaq deal was announced, that it was not considering a bid for OMX. This week, a DIFC spokesman has declined to comment. OMX also declined to comment. Britain's Sunday Times newspaper said DIFC had hired HSBC to advise on a possible bid. About 20.5 million OMX shares changed hands on Wednesday compared with average volume of 7.7 million over the last five days, according to Reuters data. The possibility of bids from the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) or Project Turquoise also made their way through trading floors, dealers said, but those are considered unlikely. The LSE is 30 percent owned by Nasdaq and Project Turquoise, a rival trading platform being created by a group of investment banks, has yet to even appoint top management.
