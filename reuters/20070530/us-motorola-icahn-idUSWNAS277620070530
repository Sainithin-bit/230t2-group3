 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn won 717.7 million votes for his bid to win a board seat at Motorola Inc. MOT.N compared with 931.7 million votes cast in favor of the mobile phone maker's preferred candidate, the company said on Wednesday. 

 Billionaire investor Icahn lost his bid to win a seat on Motorola's board in early May after a bitter proxy battle with the company. Motorola candidate John White won the board seat.
