 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - India's Tata AutoComp Systems Ltd. explored a possible bid for Lear Corp. ( LEA.N )but would not be submitting a proposal to rival billionaire Carl Icahn's buyout offer, Lear said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday. 

 The auto parts maker said it was not in discussions with any third party regarding a potential acquisition proposal on better terms than Icahn's offer. A shareholder vote on Icahn's offer has been scheduled for June 27. Icahn has offered $36 per share, or $2.86 billion, for Lear through his American Real Estate Partners LP ( ACP.N ) affiliate. The deal is worth $5.3 billion including debt. Lear had been in discussions with Tata and private equity firms since March 18, but Tata told Lear on Wednesday it would not submit a proposal, Lear said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Shareholder lawsuits challenging the acquisition have been consolidated in the Delaware Chancery Court. Lear made the Tata disclosure in a letter submitted to the Delaware state court that it also filed with the SEC. "To date, all of Lear's extensive efforts have not yielded even a non-binding proposal," Lear said in the letter. The offer from Icahn, Lear's largest shareholder, has drawn some criticism from other large shareholders such as Pzena Investment Management, which believes the Southfield, Michigan, company should be valued at $60 per share. Pzena reiterated its opposition to the Icahn offer in a presentation filed with the SEC on Wednesday. Lear also said it had scheduled a meeting for Wednesday with Institutional Shareholder Services to discuss the Lear special board committee's support of the Icahn offer. Lear, which produces auto seating and electronics, is heavily dependent in North America on sales of pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles by the U.S.-based automakers. Lear's board accepted the Icahn offer in early February and advisers contacted 24 potential financial sponsors and 17 possible strategic buyers over a 45-day go-shop period. Tata and two private equity firms mulled a possible offer and engaged in due diligence, with Tata continuing discussions with Lear even after its potential equity partners withdrew in late April, Lear said. In May, Tata said it would not make a unilateral offer, but identified six possible private equity firms that might join in a competing proposal, Lear said. However, Tata told Lear a potential co-investor withdrew on Tuesday and Tata decided against pursuing an acquisition of Lear on Wednesday, Lear said in the filing.
