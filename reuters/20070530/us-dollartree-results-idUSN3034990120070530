 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Stores Inc. ( DLTR.O ) on Wednesday reported higher quarterly profit, helped by strong sales around Valentine's Day and Easter and a higher operating margin, and it raised its full-year earnings outlook. 

 The retailer earned $38.1 million, or 38 cents per share, for its first quarter ended May 5, up from $32.9 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected Dollar Tree to earn 37 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 13.8 percent to $975 million. Sales at stores open at least a year -- a measure of retail strength called same-store sales -- rose 5.8 percent in the quarter. A colorful and wider variety of merchandise led to strong sales around Valentine's Day, and the company shifted quickly to a different set of products before Easter that also drove sales, Chief Executive Bob Sasser said during a conference call. The company's stock, which rose more than 3 percent on Tuesday in anticipation of earnings, was off 14 cents or 0.3 percent, at $42.41 in afternoon trading after falling as low as $41.55 earlier on the Nasdaq. Despite solid results, stock was pressured because of "raised expectations and recent stock strength," Goldman Sachs analyst Adrianne Shapira wrote in a note to clients. She has a "neutral" rating on Dollar Tree stock, which has risen nearly 40 percent so far this year. The company, known for its traditional $1 price point, started testing more expensive goods last year, following its acquisition of a chain called Deal$. After converting 122 stores to that different price format, "we have had good customer response ... and we are encouraged with the lift we see in terms of average ticket, store productivity and margin," Sasser said. But the multi-price strategy is only an added growth opportunity and the Dollar Tree format will still be the company's main focus, Sasser said. The company forecast second-quarter earnings in a range of 29 to 32 cents a share on sales of $960 million to $985 million. For fiscal 2007, the company raised its earnings per share outlook to a range between $2.00 and $2.12 from a range of $1.96 to $2.10. Analysts expect Dollar Tree to earn 31 cents per share in the second quarter and $2.10 per share for the full year.
