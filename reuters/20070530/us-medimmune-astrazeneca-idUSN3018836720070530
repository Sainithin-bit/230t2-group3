 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities on Wednesday approved AstraZeneca Plc's ( AZN.L ) plan to buy biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O for more than $15 billion. 

 Officials completed their investigation into the deal without taking action, the Federal Trade Commission said in a notice. Last month, AstraZeneca agreed to buy MedImmune in its biggest transaction since the creation of the Anglo-Swedish drugs group in 1999. The all-cash deal aims to boost AstraZeneca's depleted drug portfolio by moving deeper into biotech medicine and taking a first step into vaccines. MedImmune is one of the largest independent U.S. biotech companies and is best known for the nasal spray flu vaccine FluMist. The Maryland-based company also has two other marketed products, Synagis for infectious respiratory disease and Ethyol for reducing chemotherapy side effects.
