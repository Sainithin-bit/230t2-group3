 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications fell last week, weighed down by a plunge in demand for home refinancing as interest rates reached seven-month highs, an industry group said on Wednesday. 

 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes requests for both refinancing and purchasing loans, for the week ended May 25 dropped 7.3 percent to 636.4. Applications, however, were 17.4 percent above a year ago. The four-week moving average of mortgage applications, which smooths the volatile weekly figures, was down 0.8 percent. Torsten Slok, senior economist at Deutsche Bank in New York, said higher interest rates will play a large role on home loan demand going forward. "It has become more expensive to buy a home today than it was a month ago," he said. "Affordability has become an issue again." Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 6.32 percent, up 0.09 percentage point from the previous week and its highest since the week ended October 20, when it stood at 6.36 percent. Interest rates, however, were well below year-ago levels of 6.66 percent. Long-term Treasury yields, which are linked to mortgage rates, have risen sharply in recent weeks as bond investors' hopes of a Federal Reserve rate cut this year faded. Yields move inversely to price. The group's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications dropped 13.0 percent to 1,874.6, the lowest since January, when it touched 1,848.8. The index, however, was up 33.0 percent from a year ago when the index stood at 1,409.0. The refinance share of mortgage activity fell to 39.7 percent of applications from 42.3 percent the previous week. TIGHTER LENDING STANDARDS An unwieldy supply of homes for sale and significantly tighter underwriting standards from lenders, ignited by the rapid meltdown of the subprime mortgage market, is paving the way for a difficult spring housing season. Subprime mortgages are extended to borrowers with poor credit history. "The ongoing correction in the housing market continues," said Slok. "The good news is that the biggest part of this correction is behind us." The MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index USMGPI=ECI, widely considered a timely gauge of U.S. home sales, fell 2.5 percent to 427.0. The index, however, was above its year-ago level of 395.5, a rise of 8.0 percent. Fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 6.05 percent, up from 5.96 percent. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) edged up to 5.74 percent from 5.72 percent. The ARM share of activity decreased to 17.7 percent of total applications from 18.1 percent the previous week. U.S. housing industry indexes tend to be volatile and have recently painted a mixed picture, with some pointing to weakening and others to stabilization in the hard-hit sector. On Friday, the National Association of Realtors will release data on pending sales of existing U.S. homes in April with its Pending Home Sales Index. The MBA's survey covers about 50 percent of U.S. retail residential loans. Respondents include mortgage banks, commercial banks and thrifts.
