 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MTV Networks owners Viacom Inc. VIAb.N said it "welcomes" the opportunity to license its content to Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) after the iPod maker signed a deal with top online video distributor YouTube. 

 Viacom sued Google Inc.'s ( GOOG.O ) YouTube in March for $1 billion charging it with "massive intentional copyright infringement" after finding hundreds of thousands of Viacom-owned videos uploaded to the service without its permission. Apple said on Wednesday that YouTube's entire video catalog will be made available on its Apple TV set-top box device, which lets consumers view media and listen to music stored on computers directly on their television screens. "We're always vigilant about protecting our copyrights," a Viacom spokesman said. "But we would welcome the opportunity to license our content to Apple as we do with all distributors," he said. Viacom separately has a deal to sell some of its shows on Apple Inc.'s iTunes digital media store.
