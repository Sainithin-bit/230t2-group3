 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. ( RL.N ) posted a better-than-expected 17 percent rise in quarterly profit Wednesday on increased apparel sales in Europe and the United States, but shares fell 4 percent in premarket trading on its adjusted 2008 forecast. 

 The maker of Polo by Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco clothing lines said fourth-quarter net income rose to $73.2 million, or 68 cents per share, from $62.5 million, or 58 cents, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, were expecting the New York-based company to earn 62 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net quarterly revenue rose 6 percent, to $1.03 billion, in line with Reuters Estimates, driven by a 10 percent increase in European sales and U.S. sales of children's wear, menswear and Lauren clothing. Retail sales grew 3 percent during the quarter, partially offset by an 11 percent drop in licensing revenue. For the full year, net income grew to $401 million, or $3.73 per share. Total net 2007 revenue rose 15 percent, to $4.3 billion. For fiscal 2008, the company adjusted its forecast and now expects to earn between $3.70 and $3.80 per share including a 27 cent impact from acquisitions. In February, Polo Ralph Lauren said it expected to earn between $3.95 to $4.05 per share. The company expects full-year 2008 revenue to increase mid-teen percentage. Polo Ralph Lauren will also expand its retail stores by a net 24 locations to 316 stores in 2008, as part of a planned $240 capital expenditure investment during the year. The company's shares were down to $90.80 in premarket trading, after closing Tuesday's session at $93.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.
