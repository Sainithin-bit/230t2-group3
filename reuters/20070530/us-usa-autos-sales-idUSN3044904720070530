 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales are expected to have dropped in May as a weak housing market and higher gas prices sapped demand, analysts said this week. 

 "While in previous months, demand had proven more resilient than many forecasted, May is shaping up weaker for automotive sales in the U.S., according to our channel checks," Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said in a research note. "Lower consumer confidence, associated in part with the slowdown in the housing market ... seems to be taking now more of a toll on light vehicle sales," Johnson said. Weak housing starts have also hurt sales of high-margin pickup trucks, which are typically bought by contractors. U.S. vehicle sales are expected to come in at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 15.9 million to 16 million vehicles for May, down from last May's rate of 16.2 million units. "We continue to expect a soft sales environment on the back of housing weakness, mixed employment data, and higher gas prices," Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Barry said. Ford Motor Co.'s ( F.N ) sales analyst George Pipas said on Tuesday the automaker would see an increase in U.S. retail sales in May for the first time in six months, but overall sales were expected to decline as it cut sales to daily rental companies. A 20 percent reduction in fleet sales would drag Ford's overall U.S. sales in May down for a "single-digit" percentage decline, Pipas said. General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), which lost the title of world's largest automaker to Japanese rival Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) in the first quarter, is expected to post monthly sales that are down by 3 percent. Analysts expect growth of 2 percent to 4 percent at the Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE, boosted by heavy incentives on its Dodge Ram pickup trucks and its minivans. Most analysts expect Toyota to post a sales increase of 3 percent to 7 percent. But auto industry tracking service Edmunds expects Toyota's sales to have slipped 0.4 percent, adjusted for an extra selling day this May. "As gas prices climb, many consumers are taking a conservative approach to car-buying," said Jesse Toprak, executive director of industry analysis for Edmunds.com. "Additionally, numbers are down because domestics continue to cut production, reducing fleet sales and better matching supply with retail demand," Toprak said. The Detroit-based automakers -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- which combined lost more than $15 billion in 2006, have been steadily losing sales and market share to Asian rivals in the U.S. market. All three are cutting back on low-margin fleet sales -- typically sold to rental companies and government agencies -- in an attempt to shore up the resale value of their vehicles. But even Japanese automakers are expected to post declines for May. Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) is expected to post a decline of 3 percent to 5 percent, while Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ) is expected to have seen sales fall by 3 percent to 6 percent. Automakers will release monthly sales data on Friday.
