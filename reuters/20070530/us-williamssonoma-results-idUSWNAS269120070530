 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Williams-Sonoma Inc. ( WSM.N ) on Wednesday reported a quarterly profit that topped estimates but the upscale home-goods retailer cut its second-quarter outlook, sending shares down over 3 percent. 

 First-quarter net income fell to $18.2 million, or 16 cents a share, from $23.1 million, or 20 cents, a year ago. Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of 13 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 2.7 percent to $816.1 million but were below estimates of $820.7 million. Sales fell at Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids and its namesake kitchenware stores open at least one year, leading to an overall decline of 0.8 percent in quarterly same-store sales -- a key measure of retail strength. The company's namesake and Pottery Barn stores have been battling a sluggish housing market and competition from chains such as Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ). Pottery Barn, which caters to higher-end shoppers and accounts for a major part of Williams-Sonoma's business, initially weathered a slowdown in consumer spending but began feeling the heat from rivals who offer similar merchandise at lower prices. President Laura Alber said the company was already introducing new products, reducing shipping charges, increasing catalog circulation and revising price points to shake up the brand. But "it will take several quarters to implement all of these initiatives and additional time to determine the sustainable benefits," Alber said during a conference call. OUTLOOK CUT The company said it was cutting second-quarter guidance to 14 cents to 18 cents a share from a range of 16 cents to 20 cents. Citing short-term caution, Chief Executive Howard Lester said: "We continue to see higher inventory levels among our competition and we are concerned about the ongoing pressure of industry-wide markdowns and rising raw material costs." The company affirmed its fiscal 2007 earnings outlook of $1.76 to $1.84 per share on a stronger-than-expected start to the year. But analysts warned that could be a bit much. "We still see risks to this outlook given the magnitude of decline in the first quarter and what is expected for the second quarter" CIBC World Markets analyst Vivian Ma wrote in a research note. Analysts, on average, expect full-year earnings of $1.80 per share. Williams-Sonoma shares were down 1 cent at $33.95 after falling as much as 3.7 percent earlier to $32.71 on the New York Stock Exchange. As of April 29, the company owned 584 stores including the Williams-Sonoma, Williams-Sonoma Home, Pottery Barn, Pottery Barn Kids, West Elm and outlet stores.
