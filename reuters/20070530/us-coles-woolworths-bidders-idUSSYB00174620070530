 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - The private equity consortium looking at bidding for Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX said on Wednesday it could not confirm whether all four members were still in the group. 

 "We can't confirm that all four firms are still in the consortium," a spokesman for the group said. He was responding to speculation that private equity firms Bain and Blackstone Group BG.UL were looking at pulling out of the group. Two other consortium members, CVC CVC.UL and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL, pulled out earlier this week.
