 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O will keep the direct-sales focus that turned it into one of the world's top computer makers, even as it moves into the retail market, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 

 "The direct model was a real revolution in the computer industry, but it's not a religion," Michael Dell told reporters in Toronto. "We're going to expand the number of places and ways that people can buy our products." Speaking after last week's announcement that the Round Rock, Texas-based company plans to start selling personal computers bundled with accessories through Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) in North America in June, he added: "Make no mistake, Dell is going to continue to sell directly to customers and is going to sell to partners." Dell had until last week stuck to the direct-sales model despite sluggish sales, offering its computers for sale by telephone or its Web site. Company founder Dell, who replaced Kevin Rollins as chief executive in January and is also chairman, said while there is much spotlight on the company's retail strategy it will also continue to enhance other aspects of its business. He said consumers should also expect to see new product releases over the next few months, with a focus on industrial design and usability, but would not provide further details. The company is also exploring ways to make information technology less expensive and simpler for its government and institutional, as well as small, medium and large-sized business clients. The computer maker last year lost the No. 1 PC market share spot to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) as HP cut prices and boosted sales of consumer PCs. Consumer and retail accounts for 15 percent of Dell's overall business, while the remainder comes from corporate customers, said Dell. Shares of Dell were up 16 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $26.28 midafternoon on the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC . ($1=$1.07 Canadian)
