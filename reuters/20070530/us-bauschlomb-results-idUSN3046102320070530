 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Bausch & Lomb Inc. BOL.N turned in belated financial reports on Wednesday showing its first-quarter profit rose 56 percent, less than it expected, as it deals with the recall last year of its ReNu with MoistureLoc lens cleaning solution. 

 The Rochester, New York-based eye-care company had net income of $18.4 million, or 34 cents per share, compared with $11.8 million, or 21 cents per share, in the first quarter of 2006, according to a company filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Net sales rose 6 percent to $578.9 million from $546.0 million, matching the company's preannounced results. The company, which has agreed to be acquired by private equity firm Warburg Pincus for about $3.67 billion, earlier this month had expected profits in the recently completed quarter to increase 63 percent to $19.2 million, or about 35 cents per share, from the year-earlier period. A company spokesman declined to elaborate. Bausch & Lomb recalled ReNu with MoistureLoc solution on May 15, 2006, after certain users in the United States and certain Asian markets reported increases in fungal infections. The maker of PureVision contact lenses and other items, said the MoistureLoc recall reduced first-quarter 2006 net income by an expected $19.6 million, or 35 cents per share and has spawned more than 400 consumer lawsuits. Separately, public shareholders have named the company and its directors as defendants in three lawsuits challenging its proposed acquisition by Warburg Pincus. Plaintiffs in each of those cases are seeking class action status and allege, among other things, that the purchase price is inadequate. Company's shares closed up 0.2 percent, or 16 cents, to $67.93 on the New York Stock Exchange and were unchanged in after-hours trading.
