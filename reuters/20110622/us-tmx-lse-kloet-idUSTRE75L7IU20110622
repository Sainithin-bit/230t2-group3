 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange's decision to sweeten its bid for TMX Group, operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange, shows the companies' confidence in the deal, TMX Chief Executive Tom Kloet said on Wednesday. 

 The LSE revised its friendly takeover offer to include a special dividend of C$4 per TMX share and 84.1 pence per ordinary share of the LSE. That brings the value of the deal to $4.1 billion, which tops a hostile $3.8 billion bid from a consortium of Canadian financial institutions. The regular dividend of the combined entity if the LSE-TMX deal goes ahead would also be increased to the level of the TMX's current regular dividend -- a move Kloet said was motivated by discussions with shareholders. "One of the messages that I got from TMX shareholders was the idea that maintaining our gross dividend at the rate we had it at (in the original LSE-TMX offer) resulted in a net decrease in their absolute dividend amount," Kloet said. "I thought we should show the confidence we feel in the combined businesses," he said, calling the dividend rate change the "right thing to do." Some TMX shareholders, however, complained that the special dividend will increase the leverage of the combined company's balance sheet. "We are adding some leverage to the balance sheet with the special dividend, but that's one of the things we consistently told shareholders -- that we had the ability to do that," Kloet said. "We're getting accretion by developing new business while minimizing the leverage put on the balance sheet. My take is that this is very affordable for the company."
