 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada joined the government on Wednesday in calling for a "firewall" around Greece to ensure its debt crisis does not spill over to infect the global financial system. 

 Central bank chief Mark Carney said the Greek situation was "manageable" but warned that if it were to deteriorate the risk to Canada would be "considerable", through indirect linkages with banks in other countries. "We would also join with others in urging that an effective firewall can be set up between possible events in Greece and other parts of the European financial system and therefore by extension the global financial system," Carney said in testimony to the Canadian Senate committee on banking, trade and commerce. "While the situation in Greece is very serious, and it is very difficult for the Greek people, for the Greek government, and the cost of default would be considerable, in the context of the European Union, this is a manageable issue," he said. Earlier on Wednesday, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty made a similar plea for a firewall and said he expected the Group of Seven finance minister and/or central bankers to hold more conference calls on the situation. Carney said Canadian economic growth is set to slow and inflation will remain above 3 percent in the short term. He predicted growth would speed up again later this year to a rate "above potential". Once again flagging his concerns about the high level of household debt in Canada, Carney said the central bank retained flexibility to hike interest rates if needed. "We are in no way incapacitated on our ability to move interest rates in this country. We will take appropriate moves consistent with achieving our 2 percent inflation target," he said. The bank has held its key rate at 1 percent since last September, following three successive hikes. The bank's twice-yearly Financial System Review report issued on Wednesday concluded the risk of instability in the financial system was slightly greater now than it was six months ago.
