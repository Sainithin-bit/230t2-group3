 PARIS  (Reuters) - European banks are strong enough to withstand the fallout if there is Greek debt default, a top Standard & Poor's analyst said on Wednesday. 

 Bernard de Longevialle, who oversees the rating of European banks for Standard & Poor's, also told Reuters that in most European countries banks were in better shape than before. But their equity ratios still fall short of new regulatory standards, he said. "If Greece defaults or if there is a 'haircut' of 60 percent on the Greek debt, it will not floor the European banking system," he said. European governments summoned banks and insurers to urgent meetings on Wednesday, pressing them to share the cost of a second Greek bailout with taxpayers and avoid a market meltdown. "Apart from Greek banks, French banks are those that have the most exposure," de Longevialle said. "This (a default) will not challenge their solvency ... The direct impact is manageable and can be absorbed by their profits with no impact on their equity," he added. According to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), French banks have the biggest exposure to Greece at around 57 billion euros (the exposure includes credit to both public and private sector borrowers), ahead of Germany with 34 billion. Among foreign banks, German banks are, however, the most exposed to Greek sovereign debt at 23 billion euros against 15 billion euros for French banks. In May, S&P cut its credit rating on Credit Agricole, one of the most exposed to Greece's debt-stricken economy, from "AA-/A-1" to "A+/A-1", citing the growing likelihood of a Greek debt restructuring and its impact on Credit Agricole's local subsidiary, Emporiki. S&P, however, believes that Credit Agricole could withstand any Greek default. "The group has the means to face that without impacting its capital ratios ... even if Greece will continue to cost it," Longevialle said. Three years after a financial crisis that crippled debt markets, the banks' situation has improved but their long-term financing remains a problem. "Despite this improvement, the level of their capital remains a weak spot in the ratings of European banks," he said. Longevialle said the new global Basel III minimum capital requirement of 7 percent set for all banks from 2013 should help limit this shortfall.
