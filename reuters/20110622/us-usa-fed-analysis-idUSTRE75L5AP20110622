 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday sounded more downbeat about the economic recovery but said it expected a pick-up in coming months as the effects of high energy prices and disruptions caused by the Japanese earthquake dissipate. 

 In a statement after a policy meeting, the Fed said it also believes an acceleration in inflation will prove transitory. References to inflation did not refer to underlying price growth, a possible nod to the concerns of some top Fed officials who have said the central bank should focus on headline inflation rates, not just core measures that exclude volatile energy and food prices. The bottom line is that the Fed remains unlikely to tighten policy in the near future, but is also not poised to add stimulus in response to recent weak data. Below is a side-by-side of key phrases from the Fed's April and June policy statements and what they mean: APRIL: "The unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate." JUNE: "The Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate." TAKE-AWAY: The Fed is no longer worried about deflation. The slowdown evidenced by the disappointingly weak jobs market is likely transitory and the Fed will continue to set a high bar for any further easing. APRIL: "Increases in the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months." JUNE: "Inflation has moved up recently, but the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside ... as the effects of past energy and other commodity price rises dissipate." TAKE-AWAY: Policymakers are confident inflation rises are temporary and are will be in no hurry to tighten policy in response. APRIL: "The economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace." JUNE: "The economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected." TAKE-AWAY: The Fed acknowledges that data point to a weaker first half than expected. APRIL: "Overall conditions in the labor market are improving gradually" JUNE: "Recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated." TAKE-AWAY: The Fed is still falling short on the full employment side of its mandate. APRIL: "Concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a further increase in oil prices since the committee met in March. Inflation has picked up in recent months, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable and measures of underlying inflation are still subdued." JUNE: "Inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable." TAKE-AWAY: The Fed is not fazed by recent signs pointing to a pickup in inflation, even to gains in core inflation. Against the backdrop of weak growth and high unemployment, it is in no rush to tighten policy.
