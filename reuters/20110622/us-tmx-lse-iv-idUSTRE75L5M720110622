 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange has sweetened its friendly offer for the TMX Group with an enhanced dividend, bringing the value to $4.1 billion for the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

 LSE added a cash component in the form of C$4 dividend per share to TMX shareholders, while LSE shareholders will receive 84.1 pence per ordinary share, sweetening the bid by C$660 million ($680 million). CHRIS DAMAS, INDEPENDENT ANALYST, TMX SHAREHOLDER "The special dividend is a carrot. The TMX's balance sheet was unleveraged before this deal and the deal was going to reduce the LSE's leverage. ... This dividend will now increase the leverage, effectively by paying cash from the TMX's unleveraged balance sheet. ... It's a carrot, but you can't make more value for shareholders by moving the financial shells around. "To get the dividend you have to hang in there until the day before they complete the merger and it doesn't remove any of the regulatory risk. We are voting on a deal, which will be a done deal, if shareholders vote positively and yet we still have all the regulatory risk. "What I suggest is cash up front, not cash the day before a hypothetical closing date in the fall. "These valuations are around 11 to 12 times earnings. And the Deutsche Bourse-NYSE deal, which is being voted on July 7, is more like 13, or 14 times. So these multiples are still pretty low for a stock that has provided a 400 percent return." ALLISON CROSTHWAIT, DIRECTOR GLOBAL TRADING STRATEGY, INSTINET "I'm not surprised at all. I expected this. They certainly needed to do this in order to win the vote on the 30th. And I think the price is about right. Probably. They bested the Maple deal by almost a dollar. I see it right now being worth $48.94. "I don't think the case is made strongly enough for TMX-London -- they sort of rolled over, to some degree. I would just like to see more aggression as to why this is a really good thing -- I mean, you sell me on it. Everybody has gone with this fuzzy feel-good about Canadian control -- what does that mean? "It's a true sweetener, it was needed, because ultimately shareholders -- they're pecuniary -- they're motivated by their own investment return. ... I think this makes a much stronger case for the LSE and much higher probability it will be accepted on the 30th. "There's all the regulatory hurdles of course. The shareholders has to make this strange determination without having the regulatory information. So if they believed the regulatory environment is going to favor the Maple deal, that could sway things in favor of the Maple deal. We'll see, but right now everybody's saying it'll be the LSE." "Any comment that I've seen has said that LSE is more likely from a regulatory perspective. That could shift in two seconds if somebody really influential comes out and says, "no, LSE is not going to pass the net benefit test and this is not a competitive issue", but I think it is a competitive issue. THOMAS CALDWELL, CHAIRMAN, CALDWELL SECURITIES "The thing that would impress me more in the longer term is that they are maintaining the same dividend yield basis on this company, so that's a positive. "Giving back some of our own money, that's also positive - it'll give you some cash, so that means, let's look at the stock and say C$44.20, so I get C$4 back, so it's C$40.20, combined company -- it's probably worth that, I would think. "There is a speculative premium here and they are trying to match the speculative premium with some cash up front. On the Maple deal, I end up with some cash ... and end up with Maple shares, which is a company controlled by its customers, and therefore, what pricing power do you have? And how are they going to value Alpha when they roll it in there? "I think Wellington used the phrase at Waterloo that it was a close-run thing, and that phrase is probably going to be applicable here -- this is a close run deal. "I think the other side are going to come back with something more, something different and something more clarified. "I believe markets should be neutral. A market should not be controlled by the biggest proprietary traders and the biggest internalizers of their own trades -- that is they take the other side of the client order -- because the most important thing an exchange does is determine the price of a trade, the price discovery." MATHIEU ROY, VICE PRESIDENT, LOUISBURG INVESTMENTS "As a TMX shareholder, I'm certainly happy to see the offer being sweetened just before we have to go and vote. "One part of the equations where I think it's going to be difficult to make up your mind today is that I think the market was valuing the LSE as if the LSE-TMX merger wasn't going to happen. "So I wasn't really believing that if you took the 2.9 shares and then applied it and that's what TMX would be trading at today. "With them sweetening the bid and potentially increasing their chances of winning it, or at least getting shareholder approval, I'm curious to see how the LSE will trade when it opens up again, and if it trades off, then even with the $4 dividend, perhaps it still won't be enough to get you to the $48 stated by Maple Group. I guess my first impression is I'm happy to see a bidding war and I'm open-minded, but I want to see how the LSE trades and I'm still a little more intrigued by the Maple bid.
