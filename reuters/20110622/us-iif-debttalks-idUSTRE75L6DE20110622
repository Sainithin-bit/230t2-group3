 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - A representative from the bank lobbying group the Institute of International Finance (IIF) has arrived in Greece for talks about the debt crisis, a spokesman for the industry lobby said on Wednesday. 

 The Institute declined to comment in detail about the nature of the talks, but confirmed that board member Charles H. Dallara had arrived in Athens. "The management of the Institute has for some time been engaged in an informal basis in forging relationships and contacts and discussions between a wide array of parties involved in the Greek situation, including the Government of Greece itself, IIF members and international public authorities," the Institute said in an e-mailed statement. European governments also summoned banks and insurers to urgent meetings on Wednesday, pressing them to share the cost of a second Greek bailout with taxpayers and avoid a market meltdown. On Tuesday it emerged that the IIF, formally headed by Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Josef Ackermann, would meet with Greek lenders to explore possibilities for being "helpful in this process. The Institute, which counts among its members most of the world's largest commercial banks and investment banks as well as a growing number of insurance companies and investment management firms, was created in 1983 in response to an international debt crisis.
