 PARIS  (Reuters) - Airbus will announce orders for its $375 million A380 superjumbo at the Paris Air Show on Wednesday, Louis Gallois, chief executive of parent company EADS ( EAD.PA ), told RTL radio. 

 The planemaker suffered embarrassment earlier this week when the A380 it had planned to fly at the show was damaged when one of its wingtips collided with a building while taxiing on the eve of the world's biggest aerospace event. "The A380 is flying, and we should have some more orders today," Gallois told RTL. "The aircraft has been repaired and will fly today," Gallois added, referring to the damaged plane, which was replaced at the air show on Monday and Tuesday with a just-assembled A380 in Korean Airlines' ( 003490.KS ) light blue livery. Airbus outsold U.S. rival Boeing ( BA.N ) in the first two days of the show, notching up around $26 billion of orders dominated by sales of its revamped A320neo family of aircraft. The planemaker is also expected to announce a record deal worth $16 billion at list prices to sell narrow-body aircraft to Indian carrier IndiGo on Wednesday, an industry source has told Reuters.
