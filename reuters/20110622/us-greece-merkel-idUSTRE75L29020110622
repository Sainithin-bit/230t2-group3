 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel told lawmakers on Wednesday there were clear limits to involving the private sector in a second aid deal for Greece, saying many European states remain opposed to even voluntary steps to bring banks on board. 

 In comments to the European affairs committee of the lower house of parliament, Merkel also cautioned that rating agencies were likely to take a negative view of softer options like a debt rollover. Her comments, a day before a European Union summit in Brussels, appeared aimed at reducing expectations in the Bundestag about the deal that will emerge from the summit and a series of euro zone finance minister meetings on Greece that will follow in the next weeks. "The voluntary participation of private creditors is supported by only very few in Europe. It is the Netherlands, to a certain extent the Finns and it was a major victory getting the French on board," she said. "And therefore what appears to us at home to be self evident is anything but that in Europe and securing a majority for this course will not be easy," she added, calling Germany an "outsider" in the debate. Germany had been pushing its European partners for a bond swap that would have extended Greek debt maturities by seven years, but backed away from this solution last Friday when Merkel met French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Berlin. Some other parties in parliament, notably the Social Democrats (SPD), have called for harsher measures to involve the private sector, evoking the need for a so-called "haircut" that would force big losses on banks. Merkel rejected this, saying it would "push countries under the EFSF (rescue mechanism) that are currently able to solve their problems on their own." "Then we will have a situation in which other countries, but not Germany, are unable to recapitalize their banks without becoming targets of the markets, and we spark contagion in Europe that I don't want to be responsible for," she said.
