 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said the economic recovery was slower than it had expected, although it viewed the recent weakness in the labor market and the uptick in inflation as temporary. 

 The Fed's current $600 billion round of bond-buying stimulus is set to be completed this month, and the central bank said it plans to reinvest the proceeds of maturing securities to keep its balance sheet steady and avoid any passive monetary tightening. The following are recent comments from Fed policymakers (* denotes 2011 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy): FOMC STATEMENT, June 22 "The unemployment rate remains elevated; however, the Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters, and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Inflation has moved up recently, but the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate." * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, June 13 "There's enormous liquidity in the system. As that gets put to work, we're going to have to tighten policy otherwise we're going to give rise to significant inflationary forces." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, June 13 "The inability so far of the expansion to gain more traction has been frustrating." * NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM DUDLEY, June 10 "I anticipate economic growth will pick up enough in the second half of 2011 to sustain a moderate economic recovery. Still, the pace of recovery will probably be painfully slow for the many unemployed and underemployed workers." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, June 9 "I don't think QE3 will be necessary ... I could see the case for a pause that keeps a fairly static level of fairly accommodative policy to support a continuing recovery, obviously in the absence of inflation developments. I can see that for some period of time." * FED VICE CHAIR JANET YELLEN, June 9 "Looking forward, I unfortunately can envision no quick or easy solutions for the problems still afflicting the housing market." * PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, June 9 "I believe that this weakness will likely prove to be a temporary soft patch and that the underlying fundamentals remain the second half of this year and to strengthen a bit more next year." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, June 8 "The first time you tell this to the market, it will throw a tantrum of tantrums," Hoenig said of potential tightening moves. ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT JAMES BULLARD, June 8 "The U.S. fiscal situation, if not handled correctly, could turn into a global macro shock." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, June 7 "The economic recovery appears to be continuing at a moderate pace, albeit at a rate that is both uneven across sectors and frustratingly slow from the perspective of millions of unemployed and underemployed workers." * NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM DUDLEY, June 7 "The recovery remains distinctly subpar." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, June 7 "I have to express some frustration with this economy." * CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS, June 7 "I think it's a little lower than what I previously thought," he said of U.S. economic growth. "But I don't think we're at a point that I would be arguing strongly for a further change in our accommodative stance."
