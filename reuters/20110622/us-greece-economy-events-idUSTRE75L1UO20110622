 Greece's embattled Prime Minister, George Papandreou, and his government survived a confidence vote on Wednesday that was crucial to avoiding a sovereign default. 

 Here is a timeline of economic events since Papandreou first sealed a bailout deal in May 2010: May 2, 2010 - Papandreou says Greece has sealed a deal with EU and IMF, opening door to a bailout in return for extra budget cuts of 30 billion euros ($43 billion) over three years. -- Three-year package amounts to 110 billion euros and represents first rescue of a euro zone member. May 4/5 - Public sector workers stage 48-hour nationwide strike. Three people are killed when a bank is set on fire. May 6 - Greek parliament approves latest austerity bill. May 9 - The IMF unanimously approves its part of the rescue loans, with 5.5 billion euros being provided immediately. May 10 - Global policymakers install an emergency safety net worth about $1 trillion to bolster international financial markets and prevent the Greek crisis from damaging the euro. -- It consists of 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro zone states, plus 60 billion euros in European debt instruments. EU finance ministers say the IMF will contribute a further 250 billion euros. May 18 - Greece receives a 14.5 billion euro ($18.7 billion) loan from the EU and can now repay its immediate debt.
