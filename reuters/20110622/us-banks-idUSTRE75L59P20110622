 PARIS  (Reuters) - European banks are strong enough to withstand the fallout from an eventual Greek debt default, a top Standard & Poor's analyst said on Wednesday. 

 Bernard de Longevialle, who oversees the rating of European banks for Standard & Poor's, also told Reuters that in most European countries banks were in better shape than before. But their equity ratios still fall short of new regulatory standards, he said. European governments summoned banks and insurers to urgent meetings on Wednesday, pressing them to share the cost of a second Greek bailout with taxpayers and avoid a market meltdown. "Apart from Greek banks, French banks are those that have the most exposure," de Longevialle said. "This will not challenge their solvency....The direct impact is manageable and can be absorbed by their profits with no impact on their equity," he added.
