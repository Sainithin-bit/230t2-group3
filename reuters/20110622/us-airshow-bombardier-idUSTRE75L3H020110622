 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Boeing's indecision about how to update its 737 narrow-body jet gives Bombardier a wider opening to pitch its competing CSeries jetliner to potential customers, the chief operating officer of Bombardier's aerospace unit said on Wednesday. 

 Speaking in an interview at the Paris Air Show, Guy Hachey said Bombardier had already made a pitch to one of Boeing's top U.S. customers, Southwest Airlines, and added that he thought it was possible to poach that business. Hachey, whose company announced CSeries orders this week, said Bombardier was in advanced talks with five to seven more customers and could announce deals soon.
