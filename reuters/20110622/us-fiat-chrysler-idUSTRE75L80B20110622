 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Unions representing workers at Chrysler Group LLC and its Italian partner Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) are forming a "global network" to share information and best practices, United Auto Workers President Bob King said. 

 The UAW, which represented U.S. auto workers, will join with other labor unions in about 10 other countries, including Italy, where Fiat or Chrysler have production plants. The group will not collectively bargain with the companies, King told reporters on a conference call from Turin, Italy on Wednesday. He added that the formation of the group of unions would not have any impact on the upcoming talks between the UAW and Chrysler, General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). "Each individual union has their responsibility for negotiating their contract, but all unions will be helped by better dialogue and better information sharing," King said. The UAW and Fiat unions have sent a letter to Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of Chrysler and Fiat, asking him to acknowledge the coalition. Similar global union networks were established at Ford two years ago and GM three months ago. However, King said Ford and GM have not formally recognized the coalitions. Fiat took management control of Chrysler in 2009 after the U.S. automaker's federal bailout and bankruptcy restructuring.
