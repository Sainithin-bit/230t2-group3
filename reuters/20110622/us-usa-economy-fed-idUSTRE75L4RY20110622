 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve on Wednesday said the pace of U.S. economic recovery was proceeding more slowly than it had expected though it was primarily because of temporary factors. 

 COMMENTS: CARL RICCADONNA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK, NEW YORK "We pushed out expectation of a rate hike in to the first part of next year officially Q1 of next year. That can change as expectations of data change. If the soft patch does carry on well into June and potentially in July, that becomes a somewhat bigger problem." NICK BENNENBROEK, HEAD OF G10 FX STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK "There are no hints of further easing from the Fed. The statement overall disappointed investors looking for more bearish language and that's why we are seeing the dollar rally a little bit." RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT OF INVESTMENT FIRM LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK "There was no real surprises there but we've also just kind of come through the Greek trauma and that sort of overshadowed what the Fed had to say. I don't think there were many people making market bets based on this statement. I don't think there is anything they said that would be the main cause of someone to buy or sell." "We seem to be in this in-between world economically where it's not clear things are slowing and it's certainly not clear things are improving. That is a step that people want to see -- either acknowledgment by the Fed that things are getting much better or worse or some actual economic numbers that do that. Statements that they are going to maintain the course don't really say much about where we are headed." RUDY NARVAS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK "It is kind of interesting -- it pretty much says that a lot of the things that are going on in the U.S. economy are pretty much temporary. They give direct attribution to the supply chain disruptions due to Japan on the growth side, but if you look on the inflation side they also suggest that a lot of the uptick in inflation, particularly the core, is due to commodities but also the supply-chain disruption. So this is all just transitory as far as the Fed is concerned." DANIEL PENROD, SENIOR INDUSTRY ANALYST, CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE, ONTARIO, CALIFORNIA "The Fed statement did not offer any real surprises, but it did confirm the job situation is much weaker than was expected. The likelihood is that because of the weakness in the jobs sector, rates are going to stay low. Low rates is the only method the Fed has to try to stimulate job growth. Low rates make money cheaper so businesses can invest in people. Ironically, we're left with a chasm between businesses that can borrow at low rates and individuals who don't have access to credit. So the low rates have just helped the wealthy get wealthier while the average worker is struggling." GENNADIY GOLDBERG, FIXED INCOME ANALYST, 4CAST, INC., NEW YORK "It's really nothing particularly interesting. It's pretty much as expected. The Fed has nodded to the fact that the economy's slowing a little bit and inflation has picked up a bit. There's nothing much more to it, and very little market reaction. Bonds kind of slipped, but it was all marginal. "Not even a hint to QE3. I think things would have to get pretty bad for them to reveal QE3 -- seriously bad." VIMOMBI NSHOM, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS "Just as in their April statement, the Federal Open Market Committee downgraded their assessment of the recovery (from March's 'firming footing' and the most recent characterization of 'moderate pace') to that of a recovery continuing 'somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected,' yet kept the reassurance that they believed the setbacks to be temporary. The labor market also drew concern from the Fed as they described these indicators as coming in 'weaker than anticipated.' This tone indicates continued accommodative policy that the Fed is in no rush to reverse in the foreseeable future (i.e. the bloated balance sheet will not be trimming any fat this summer)." DAN RIPP, PRESIDENT OF BRADLEY WOODS & CO LTD IN NEW YORK "Not a surprise, but this is sort of a Catch-22 for the Fed, which is a little compromised politically. It is very difficult to increase rates because of the perceived impact on the economy and the cost of financing, which would be bad for the deficit. On the other hand, in the long run, it hurts the dollar to keep rates where they are. I don't want the market to crash, but a strong dollar is more important than short-term slow growth, which we've had for a long time."
