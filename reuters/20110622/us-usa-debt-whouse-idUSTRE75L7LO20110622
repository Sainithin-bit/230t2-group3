 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden will meet Democratic lawmakers from the House of Representatives on Thursday morning to discuss the state of debt limit talks, the White House said. 

 The meeting at the White House will involve Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn and Representative Chris Van Hollen, the White House said on Wednesday. "The group will discuss the progress being made toward a balanced framework for deficit reduction through the discussions being led by the vice president," the White House said in a statement.
