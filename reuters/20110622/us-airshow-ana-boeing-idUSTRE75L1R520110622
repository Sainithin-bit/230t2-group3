 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - All Nippon Airways, the launch customer for Boeing Co's long-delayed 787 Dreamliner, expects to take first delivery of the plane in August or September, an executive from the airline said on Wednesday. 

 Japan's second-largest carrier expects to receive 14 of the carbon-composite planes through March and 10 the year after, Shuichi Fujimura, senior vice president of ANA for Europe and the Middle East, said at the Paris Air Show. He said the airline would fly the plane on Japan and European routes. ANA unveiled its new livery for the 787 at the show. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  James Regan )
