 SANTA BARBARA, California  (Reuters) - Three top U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Thursday said they would not favor more monetary policy easing unless economic conditions took a turn for the worse. 
 The jobless rate, which has come down sharply in recent months, would need to be stuck at above 8 percent, "not just for a few months" to require a third round of quantitative easing, known as QE3, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said. "I would not find QE3 a good policy choice," Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser told reporters, adding that a crisis in Europe or a sharp drop in inflation could trigger a change in his view. "I'm in line with that," said Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
