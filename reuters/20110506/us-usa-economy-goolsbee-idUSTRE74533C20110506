 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Austin Goolsbee said on Friday he was "pleasantly surprised' by April's strong pace of job creation and said it showed job creation was picking up. 

 "This is the strongest job creation in five years," he said in an interview on CNBC television. "The trend is clearly going the right way." The Labor Department reported earlier that 244,000 jobs were created last month though the unemployment rate edged up to 9.0 percent from 8.8 percent in March. But Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, pointed out the jobless rate was down significantly from where it was five months ago. "If you're putting up jobs numbers like the ones we have been putting up in the last three months -- quarter million a month -- steadily that's going to bring the unemployment rate down," he said.
