 PARIS  (Reuters) - Alcatel-Lucent spooked investors when its first quarter sales showed its reliance on the U.S. market, and shares in the company fell amid worries it would not be able to deliver on promised profit margin targets. 

 The Franco-American company, which competes with market leader Sweden's Ericsson and China's Huawei, reported first-quarter revenues up 15 percent from a year earlier to 3.74 billion euros ($5.23 billion) and confirmed annual goals to reach an operating margin of 5 percent or more. Revenues in North America were up 40 percent from a year earlier to 1.56 billion euros. Alcatel-Lucent earns about one third of its revenues in the region. By contrast in Europe, where Chinese vendors have made major inroads, Alcatel-Lucent showed it was under pressure. In the first quarter sales in Europe slipped 1.8 percent to 1.12 billion euros. Pierre Ferragu, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, pointed out that 90 percent of Alcatel's sales growth came from North America during the quarter and that it was far more reliant on this one market than rivals Ericsson and Nokia-Siemens networks. The group could surf U.S. market strength this year but would face "significant challenges" afterwards, he said, adding he was "worried about the future of the company." Shares in Alcatel were down 3.3 percent at 4.14 euros by 1300 GMT, recovering slightly from an earlier 7 percent drop. They have risen some 100 percent since the start of the year, prompting investors to pocket returns as they looked over the numbers. Chief Executive Ben Verwaayen took over at Alcatel-Lucent in September 2008 after a value-destroying merger and has focused on higher-margin products in optics and IP technologies in order to slowly improve gross margins. They reached 36.2 percent this quarter, but Alcatel-Lucent still struggles to generate enough cash to cover costs. The company posted negative free cash flow of 213 million, compared to negative free cash flow of 429 million euros in the same period last year. "The momentum is clearly continuing, said Chief Executive Ben Verwaayen in a conference call. "All businesses contributed to growth, and the Americas were especially strong." Verwaayen also confirmed the group's annual goals to grow faster than the overall market, which he said would grow "around 5 percent" this year. Chief Financial Officer Paul Tufano said on Friday that the group was "very committed" to its positive free cash flow goal for 2011 and that the first quarter was "a positive indication we are going to do it." "I wouldn't get too optimistic about all this," said Thomas Langer, an analyst at WestLB, who has a sell rating on the shares. "The market is impressed by the top-line growth at Alcatel, and the management has had a certain success in managing operating costs," he said. "But for us cash is the ultimate benchmark, and Alcatel-Lucent has not shown it can generate cash on an ongoing basis." U.S. WAVE Verwaayen's turnaround efforts have been boosted by strong sales in North America where AT&T and Verizon have been spending heavily to upgrade networks to be able to offer faster download speeds to smartphone customers. The U.S. market is effectively closed to low-cost Chinese vendors like Huawei and ZTE Corp who have been kept out of major operators' networks over security concerns. That means that Alcatel-Lucent and Ericsson basically split the U.S. pie between them, and can maintain higher prices and margins. In Europe Chinese vendors have made major inroads and are cutting prices to grab contracts from operators undertaking network modernization projects to swap out decade-old wireless equipment. Verwaayen said that the company would not cut prices in Europe just to win contracts: "We learned our lesson on that front after the merger. As a matter of principle, we will be very selective on opportunities." (Reporting by Leila Abboud and Marie Mawad; Editing by Sophie Walker)
