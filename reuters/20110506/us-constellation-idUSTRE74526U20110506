 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Constellation Energy Group CEG.N, which has agreed to be bought by Exelon Corp ( EXC.N ), posted lower-than-expected first quarter earnings as severe weather in Texas knocked two power plants offline. 

 Net income fell to $70.4 million, or 35 cents per share, from $191.5 million, or 95 cents per share. Excluding one-time items, earnings of 63 cents per share, below 96 cents that analysts had on average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenues slipped less than 1 percent to $3.57 billion, but fell short of the $4.12 billion analysts had expected. (Reporting by  Matt Daily ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
