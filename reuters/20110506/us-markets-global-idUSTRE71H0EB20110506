 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil sold off for a fifth day on Friday, following a 10 percent crash in the previous session, while the euro sank again after German magazine Der Spiegel reported Greece has considered exiting the euro zone. 

 U.S. stocks recovered from a four-day slide, however, after data showed U.S. employers added more jobs than expected in April, reducing concerns about the economic recovery. U.S. Treasury prices erased some sharp early losses and turned positive as worries about the future of the euro zone revived their safe-haven appeal. In an extremely volatile session, oil prices earlier rose more than 2.0 percent on optimism about demand brought on by the U.S. jobs data, but turned negative later as the euro fell and the U.S. dollar rose, making the commodity more expensive for non-U.S. investors. U.S. crude oil futures closed 2.6 percent lower at $97.18 a barrel. Prices fell $16.75 in the week, their biggest weekly drop since the contract began trading in 1983. Brent crude futures closed at $109.13 a barrel, down 1.51 percent for the day and 13.3 percent for the week, also the largest weekly loss for the contract. Selling pressure on oil and other commodities came on several fronts this week, as investors weighed the implications of the death of Osama bin Laden in the Middle East and concerns about the economic slowdown of China, the world's largest consumer of raw materials. MORE EURO ZONE JITTERS The euro lost 1.2 percent to $1.435 after Der Spiegel reported on its website that a crisis meeting of euro zone finance ministers and the European Commission would be held on Friday evening to discuss Greece's situation. Greece denied it was considering to leave the bloc, but official sources told Reuters a small group of European finance ministers was indeed meeting on Friday to discuss the euro zone debt crisis. "Those Greece headlines definitely had an impact on the euro," said Geoffrey Yu, senior currency strategist at UBS in Stamford, Connecticut. "Greece leaving the euro zone could cause a cascade of problems, especially for the banking sector and particularly if the European Union allow Greece to unilaterally default on its loans. That would need to happen if Greece wants to leave the euro zone," he added. U.S. JOBS DATA RELIEF Key U.S. stock indexes initially jumped more than 1.0 percent after the U.S. Labor Department reported 244,000 jobs were added in April, the most in 11 months and far more than the 186,000 expected by economists. Resurgent concerns about the euro zone crisis erased some of those gains, but stocks still managed to close in the black. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed higher 54.57 points, or 0.43 percent, at 12,638.74, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 5.10 points, or 0.38 percent, to 1,340.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 12.84 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,827.56. The MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS was little changed as emerging market stocks .MSCIEF slid 0.1 percent. Europe's FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares ended 1.2 percent higher. U.S. Treasury prices turned positive as the reports on Greece prompted investors to cover bets that bonds would weaken into next week. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 2/32 in price, with its yield at 3.1459 percent. "It's been pretty aggressive buying," since the headlines broke, said Jason Rogan, director of U.S. Treasury trading at Guggenheim Capital Markets in New York. "A great deal of shorts entered the market after nonfarm payroll and they got caught offside." (Additional reporting by  Steven C. Johnson ,  Karen Brettell  and  Matthew Robinson )
