 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday that the Justice Department had an open investigation into the Sony Corp data breach. 

 "We have open investigations with regard to those hacking situations that have gotten publicity over the last few weeks, the Sony incident among them," Holder told the Senate Judiciary Committee. The FBI is working with federal prosecutors in San Diego as agents try to determine the facts and circumstances of the alleged crimes, an FBI spokesman has said. Analysts have said the incident, in which customers could decide to replace their credit cards, could cost Sony more than $1.5 billion.
