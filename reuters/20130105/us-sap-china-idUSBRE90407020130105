 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German business software maker SAP sees potential for one million new customers in China, five times the number it currently has world-wide, German weekly paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung said. 
 "China will be as important for us as the United States," SAP's co-Chief Executive Jim Hagemann Snabe told the paper, according to an advance extract. Snabe said SAP wants to open the Chinese market by securing a deal with authorities to allow cloud computing services. "We want to find a solution with Chinese authorities this year if possible," Snabe told the paper. As part of SAP's growth strategy, it plans to invest around $2 billion in China by 2015.
