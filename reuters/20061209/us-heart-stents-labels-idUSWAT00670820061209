 GAITHERSBURG, Maryland  (Reuters) - A U.S. advisory panel on Friday was divided over whether current data warrant changes to drug-coated heart stent labels for their use in patients with more medical complications unapproved for the device. 

 The panel's chairman said the labels should say that so-called off-label stent use can lead to more complications. Separately, panel chairman Dr. William Maisel of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center also said that studies for future drug-coated stents should be larger and longer to asses the risk of blood clots.
