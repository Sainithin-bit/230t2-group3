 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate early on Saturday confirmed Jill E. Sommers, a Kansas Republican, to be a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

 Sommers replaces Republican Sharon Brown-Hruska who resigned earlier this year to become an economist with NERA Economic Consulting in its Washington, D.C. office. Brown-Hruska became a commissioner in August 2002 and her current term was due to expire in April 2009. Sommers previously served as Head of U.S. Regulatory Affairs at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, the White House said December 4. Earlier in her career, she was Associate Director of Government Affairs at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Currently, the CFTC has four commissioners: Republicans Walter Lukken and Chairman Reuben Jeffery; Democrats Michael Dunn and Fred Hatfield. CFTC is an independent agency with the mandate to regulate commodity futures and option markets in the United States.
