 GAITHERSBURG, Maryland  (Reuters) - Drug-coated heart stents are more likely to cause blood clots and other complications in certain high-risk cases and patients and doctors should be warned, a panel of medical experts advised on Friday. 

 Labels for the devices, sold in the United States by Johnson & Johnson and Boston Scientific Corp., should note that sicker patients face a higher chance of blood clots that can lead to heart attacks and death than people with simple blockages, the panelists said. There was not enough evidence to conclude whether drug-coated stents are any better or worse than older, bare-metal versions in complicated cases, they said. The FDA has not approved drug-coated stents for patients who have had complications such as severe heart attacks or multiple blockages, but doctors can still use them. Such practice is known as off-label use. An estimated 60 percent or more of drug-coated stents are used in unapproved patients, according to the FDA. "I think the panel would like to see the amount of off-label use go down," panel chairman Dr. William Maisel of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center said after a two-day public hearing called by the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is not bound by the advice of its expert panel but the director of its Center for Devices and Radiological Health, Dr. Daniel Schultz, said the input could prompt changes to the product labels or some type of public notification. The agency asked for advice after research this year showed drug-coated stents -- tiny mesh tubes that work to keep arteries open after they are unclogged -- can cause blood clots in some patients months after implantation. Some cardiologists said patients in high-risk groups might do better with heart bypass surgery. UNAPPROVED USE About 6 million patients worldwide are estimated to have received drug-coated stents, a $6 billion-a-year market. "I'm not sure it's going to change any patient that I treat," said panelist Dr. George Vetrovec of Virginia Commonwealth University. Overall, the panel of cardiologists and other experts said more data was needed to help decide the best care. "We just don't know enough to say it's safe given the fact that its adoption has been so rapid," said Dr. Norman Kato of the California-based Cardiac Care Medical Group. Panel members said they agreed with current guidelines that recommended patients take anti-clotting drug therapy, such as aspirin and Plavix, for up to a year to minimize hazards. Plavix is sold in the United States by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. and Sanofi-Aventis. The panel said studies for future drug-coated stents should be expanded to assess the risk of blood clots. "I think we are saying ... they need to be larger, longer and give us some ideas of (clotting) rates for individual stents," Maisel said. Abbott Laboratories Inc. and Medtronic Inc., which are both seeking to sell their drug-coated stents in the United States as early as next year, told the panel their products should be assessed independently, "All drug-eluting stents are not the same," said Krishna Sudhir, a medical director in Abbott's vascular division.
