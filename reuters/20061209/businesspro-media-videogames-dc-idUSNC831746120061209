 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS sold 
476,000 units of its new Wii video game console in the United 
States in November, more than twice the number of PlayStation 
3s sold by rival Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ), as the two consoles 
debuted mid-month, research group NPD said on Friday. 

  Sony's PS3 sales came in at 197,000.  Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) sold 511,000 units of its Xbox 360 
in November, according to NPD.  That console, released just over a year ago, is locked in a 
three-way battle with the PlayStation 3 and Wii, which were 
released in mid-November amid speculation over whether Sony can 
maintain its dominance over the global console market after 
selling more than 106 million PlayStation 2 units globally.  The Japanese electronics maker had said it would ship 
400,000 PS3s into the United States for its launch, but there 
has been broad industry speculation that the company had fallen 
far short of its initial goal.  Nintendo has said it expects to ship 4 million Wiis 
worldwide by December 31, double the number of PS3s promised by 
Sony. Late last month, Nintendo said it sold 600,000 Wiis in 
the first eight days after its November 19 debut.  Microsoft, which gets most of its sales from North America, 
is targeting global Xbox 360 shipments of 10 million by year 
end.  Nintendo's Wii retails for $250; Sony's top-line PS3 
retails $600; and Microsoft's Xbox 360 retails for $400.  NPD is still calculating historical console sales data.  NPD said overall video game-related sales were $1.7 billion 
in November.  Sales of games that run on consoles and portable players 
were $804 million. Hardware sales were $771 million, fueled by 
consoles and Nintendo's DS hand-held device, which sold 918,000 
units in November.  NPD receives data representing approximately two-thirds of 
the U.S. retail sales and makes projections for the remainder 
of the market based on a sampling of U.S. consumers.
