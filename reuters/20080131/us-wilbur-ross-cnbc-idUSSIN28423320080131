 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Billionaire U.S. investor Wilbur Ross is examining if he should invest in bond insurers, an investment he reckons could be over a billion dollars, he told CNBC on Thursday. 

 But he cautioned that bond insurance firms should not lose their triple-A ratings, amid fears of downgrades due to shortfalls in capital in the wake of U.S. credit turmoil. "We keep looking at a variety of mortgage insurers and the financial guarantees insurers, but we are bound by confidentiality agreements so I really cannot go into detail into any of them," Ross told CNBC, according to transcripts of his interview. Bond insurers like MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) and Ambac Financial Group ABK.N have seen their stocks plunge on concerns that they lack the cash to fulfill guarantees on some $930 billion of structured finance assets. Major rating firms Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings have all put pressure on the bond insurers to raise more cash to preserve their crucial top "AAA" credit ratings. New York state insurance regulator Eric Dinallo has been talking to banks about putting together a bailout package for the industry. The Financial Times reported that Ross is weighing the merits of investing in an existing bond insurer or starting his own company. When CNBC asked how much he would be willing to spend, he said "this is an industry that needs lots of capital and therefore you are probably (looking in the) denomination in excess of a billion dollars," he said. But he hinted that he would prefer having investments in bond insurance firms while they still have triple-A ratings. "I think a triple-A rating is like virginity, it's very important to keep it, once you lost it it's very hard to get it back," he said. Independent firm Egan Jones Ratings Co said earlier this week bond insurers are likely to face more ratings downgrades as their effort to raise capital falls short. (Reporting by Saeed Azhar)
