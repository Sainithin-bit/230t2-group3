 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) reported a quarterly loss on Thursday due to special charges, including a $275 million write-down from the credit crisis spreading through corporate America. 

 The drugmaker is among the first companies outside the financial sector to disclose its exposure to the housing and credit crunch gripping the country. The charge related mainly to mortgages and credit-card debt pooled and sold to investors. The unexpected charge took the market by surprise, especially because the investments had high credit ratings. "It suggests what you thought was safe might not be," Lehman Bros analyst Tony Butler said. Bristol joins just a handful of other companies, including ADC Telecommunications Inc ADCT.O and 3M Co ( MMM.N ) that in the past few months have been hit by losses from so-called auction rate securities.  Bristol-Myers said the market value of its securities fell by $392 million to $419 million as of the end of the fourth quarter. "We have cleared out most of the exposure" related to the securities, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told analysts on a conference call. "There is unlikely to be any additional exposure ... but we have to be prepared if the credit markets deteriorate." Shares of New York-based Bristol-Myers, whose drugs include blood-clot preventer Plavix and schizophrenia treatment Abilify, fell as much as 6.5 percent before recovering all those declines on a generally positive day for the U.S. markets. The $275 million charge does not have a material impact on the company's liquidity or financial flexibility, or hinder its ability to fund its dividend, Bristol-Myers said. The company also recorded an unrealized pretax loss of $142 million, reflecting adjustments to its holdings that have experienced a "temporary" decline in value. Bonfield said most of the company's cash and marketable securities have been moved into safer investments such as Treasury bills in view of the current economic climate. Goldman Sachs analyst James Kelly, in a research note, called the charge disappointing but said it should not materially affect the company's business. Bonfield told reporters in a separate call that the company took the write-down after three well-known brokerages failed to stand by Bristol-Myers when the investments began to sour. He declined to identify the brokerages but said eight others continued to "make a market" in the securities, thereby sparing the drugmaker further losses. He said Bristol-Myers relied on favorable credit ratings for the investments that may not have been justified. The company is assuming it will take another full year for the economy to shake off the "contagion" from investments which include subprime mortgages whose values have continue to collapse, Bonfield said. "We are living in such extraordinary times," company Chief Executive Jim Cornelius said, referring to the credit crisis and its sting. For the quarter, Bristol-Myers reported a net loss of $89 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a loss of $134 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company took several one-time charges. Bristol-Myers earned 35 cents per share, excluding special items but including a 2-cent per-share contribution from a discontinued business. That compares with analysts' average estimate of 34 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. In the latest quarter, Bristol-Myers also recorded charges of $292 million in connection with a cost-cutting initiative and $230 million for acquired in-process research and development, related to the acquisition of Adnexus. Quarterly sales jumped 33 percent to $5.38 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $5.25 billion. The rise was largely due to a 177 percent jump in revenue for Plavix, which was facing tough competition in the year-ago quarter from a generic that is no longer on the market. Although the company expects double-digit earnings growth for the next few years, Butler said contributions from new drugs -- including experimental medicines for diabetes and to prevent blood clots -- will be needed to offset generic competition to Plavix expected by 2011. Bristol-Myers said it has put up for sale its Convatec wound-healing unit and has already heard from an impressive number of potential buyers. The company's shares edged up 9 cents to $23.35 in late afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $21.75 in early dealings.
