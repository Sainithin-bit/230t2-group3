 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Household and personal care products makers Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) and Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) both reported higher quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by sales in emerging markets as the U.S. economy slowed. 

 But while Colgate shares rose more than 3 percent on the news, P&G shares were up less than 1 percent after the maker of Tide laundry detergent, Pampers diapers and a host of other well-known brands said earnings for the current quarter would be below analysts estimates. "Colgate's results looked much better and could increase the focus on P&G's weaker third-quarter outlook," Amy Chasen, analyst at Goldman Sachs, said in a research note. She said Colgate sales growth of 7.5 percent, excluding the impact of the weaker dollar and divestitures, exceeded her forecast by half a percentage point. Like many consumer products companies, P&G and Colgate are getting hit by soaring prices for energy and raw materials, and both have cut overhead costs and increased prices to help offset the rising commodity costs. The companies also count on new premium products to help them command higher prices. Both companies sell toothpaste, soap and pet food, but P&G's products also include things like coffee, paper towels and razors, making it more exposed to rising costs than Colgate, analysts said. "P&G manufactures a much broader assortment of products and their exposure is going to be greater," Morningstar analyst Lauren DeSanto said. Still, with P&G shares down about 11 percent this year, DeSanto also said its stock is a better buy than Colgate's. "I think the shares are pretty cheap right now," she said. "Colgate, I think is fairly valued." P&G shares trade at about 18.7 times estimated earnings for the year ending in June, while Colgate shares trade at about 21.9 times estimated earnings for the year ending in December. P&G, which makes Pampers diapers, Crest toothpaste and other products, posted a 14 percent increase in net income to $3.27 billion for the fiscal second quarter ended December 31. Earnings per share were 98 cents, compared with the average analysts' estimate of 97 cents compiled by Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 9 percent to $21.6 billion, helped by the weaker dollar, which boosts the dollar value of overseas sales. "Organic sales," which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 5 percent. P&G saw strong sales growth in China, Central and Eastern Europe and the Middle East and Africa, a spokesman said. Those increases came as U.S. growth slowed, the company said during a conference call with analysts, though Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley said P&G has not been losing customers to lower-priced private label brands. P&G, which also announced plans to make its Folgers coffee business a separate company with shares offered to P&G shareholders, also forecast fiscal third-quarter earnings per share of 79 cents to 81 cents, hit by higher commodity costs as it waits for price increases in several products to take hold. Analysts on average had forecast 83 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Colgate, meanwhile, said fourth-quarter profit rose to $414.9 million, a 3.4 percent increase, with sales up 13.5 percent to $3.64 billion. Excluding restructuring charges, earnings were 91 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 89 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Colgate shares were up $2.64 at $76.14 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange and P&G shares were up 44 cents at $65.53. (Reporting by Brad Dorfman, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
