 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc Chief Financial Officer Chuck Chaplin said on Thursday the world's largest bond insurer has been more proactive than most rivals in identifying and rectifying capital issues related to mortgages. 

 On a conference call, Chaplin said few market participants projected the potential scope of losses on collateral tied to lower-quality, subprime mortgages. He also said major U.S. credit rating agencies have been struggling to keep up with changes in the housing and mortgage markets. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
