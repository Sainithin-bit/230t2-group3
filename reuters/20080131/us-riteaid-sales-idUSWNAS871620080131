 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp ( RAD.N ) on Thursday posted a 2 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, with gains spread equally among the pharmacy and general merchandise businesses. 

 Total drugstore sales for the four-week period increased 51.8 percent to $2.00 billion compared with $1.32 billion for the same period last year, helped by the acquisition of Brooks and Eckerd U.S. drugstore chains. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
