 PARIS  (Reuters) - BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) confirmed on Thursday it was studying a bid for scandal-hit rival Societe Generale that could bring the country's two biggest banks together, while France told foreign predators to stay away. 

 "We are studying it because all Europe's banks are studying it," said a spokesman for BNP. SocGen ( SOGN.PA ) declined comment, but the weakened bank's shares closed up 1.7 percent at 83.20 euros, putting its stock market value at 39 billion euros ($59 billion), about two-thirds that of BNP, whose stock closed down 1.5 percent at 65.83 euros. In 1999, SocGen escaped a takeover bid by BNP and there has been consistent market speculation ever since. It was rekindled a week ago when SocGen's disclosed 4.9 billion euros of losses and blamed them on a single employee, Jerome Kerviel, kicking off the biggest rogue trader scandal in history. The affair was still unrolling on Thursday after police raided a Paris flat to seize Kerviel's computer, and as a clutch of investigations into how and why the bank's systems failed to prevent the debacle got under way. GSD Gestion fund manager Jacques Gautier said a tie-up would be good for shareholders in both banks. "In terms of the French retail banking network, it will double BNP's capacity. There would also be cost cuts as the two banks overlap in many areas," he said. Meanwhile, France was heading for a clash with its European Union partners over whether foreign bidders should be allowed a free hand. "When we are in very sensitive sectors, and the financial sector is one, because it's structural for the economy, it's normal that the public powers look at how and whose hands the French money is in," said France's minister for European affairs, Jean-Pierre Jouyet. His comments reinforced a view from French Prime Minister Francois Fillon, who said earlier this week "the government is determined that Societe Generale remains a great French bank." Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup set of euro-zone ministers, said on Thursday a bid by a foreign player would not be surprising. "If someone coming from abroad wanted to do good things with SocGen ... why would that bother me?," Juncker, who is also the prime minister of Luxembourg, said on Europe 1 radio. POTENTIAL BIDDERS Thursday's exchanges came a day after EU Internal Market Commissioner Charlie McCreevy warned France that competition rules would apply to the treatment of any bidders. "In a situation of potential takeover, free movement of capital rules provide for undiscriminatory treatment of potential bidders," McCreevy said via his spokesman. SocGen has said it is strong enough to stay independent, but analysts say foreign banks including UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), Santander ( SAN.MC ), BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ), as well as BNP, are among potential bidders for SocGen. A source close to UniCredit said it was not interested. Morgan Stanley, one of two investment banks underwriting a planned SocGen capital increase to plug the hole caused by the rogue trades, cut its price target on the shares to 115 euros from 154. On Wednesday, SocGen's board resisted government pressure to sack its chairman, Daniel Bouton, voting unanimously to keep him in his job. Thursday's French newspapers said the appointment of a committee of independent directors to oversee an inquiry into the crisis meant he was "under surveillance". The SocGen scandal coincides with turmoil in the global banking sector triggered by a meltdown in subprime residential mortgages in the United States. Shares in UBS ( UBSN.VX ) fell as much as 9 percent on Thursday after a regulator said it and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) could face further write-downs from assets not related to subprime. INTERNET FANS Kerviel, whose exploits have spawned Internet fan clubs and support groups around the globe, was placed under investigation for breach of trust and other misdeeds on Monday, but judges threw out the stronger accusation of fraud made by SocGen, and he was freed on bail. In London, bookmakers offered odds of 5/4 on BNP taking over SocGen. Another French bank, Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ), was at 9/4, Credit Suisse at 4/1 or Barclays ( BARC.L ) and HSBC each at 6/1. Even ailing British bank Northern Rock NRK.L -- Britain's biggest victim of the global credit crunch, could be backed as a buyer at odds of 1,000/1. The same odds were being offered on 31-year-old Kerviel succeeding Bouton as the bank's chief. On February 4, Economy Minister Christine Lagarde is due to hand a report to Prime Minister Fillon, giving a first assessment of the SocGen fiasco and outlining recommendations on how to strengthen internal and external controls on its trading operations.
