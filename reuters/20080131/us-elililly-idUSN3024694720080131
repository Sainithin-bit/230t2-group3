 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) is in settlement talks with federal prosecutors regarding a civil and criminal investigation into Lilly's marketing of its top-selling schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, the New York Times reported on Wednesday. 

 Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal told Reuters late on Wednesday that his office was involved in the investigation and negotiations with the company over Zyprexa. "There are discussions," Blumenthal said. But he declined to confirm that those were settlement talks. A settlement could result in Lilly's paying more than $1 billion to federal and state governments, the newspaper reported on its Web site, citing people involved in the probe. Lilly shares fell 1.2 percent to $50.75 on the news in after-hours trade. Zyprexa is Lilly's biggest product with 2007 global sales of $4.76 billion. Federal prosecutors in Philadelphia are leading the settlement talks for the government in consultation with the U.S. Justice Department, the Times said. The U.S. attorney's office in Philadelphia declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department in Washington. Lilly said it has received a grand jury subpoena from the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, seeking documents related to Zyprexa. "As we have long said, we have been and are continuing to cooperate in state and federal investigations related to Zyprexa, including providing a broad range of documents and information. As part of that cooperation we regularly have discussions with the government," Lilly spokeswoman Marni Lemons said in a statement. "However, we have no intention of sharing those discussions with the news media," Lemons added. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker has been accused of promoting the drug for non-approved, so-called off-label uses and of playing down side effects, such as weight gain, which increases the risk of diabetes. While doctors are free to prescribe drugs in any way they see fit, drug companies may only promote them for uses approved by U.S. health regulators. "Lilly is committed to promoting our medications only for approved uses and consistent with all federal and state laws. We disagree with any allegations or suggestions to the contrary," Lemons said, adding that the company disagrees with many speculative statements contained in the Times article. Lilly has had previous Zyprexa settlements with patients. In January of 2007 the company said it was taking a charge of up to $500 million to cover more than 18,000 claims from patients who alleged the drug caused them to develop diabetes. In June of 2005 Lilly agreed to pay $700 million to settle about 8,000 patient claims. (Reporting by  Bill Berkrot  and  Paritosh Bansal ; Editing by  Gary Hill ,  Leslie Gevirtz )
