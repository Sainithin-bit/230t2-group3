 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) assured investors on Thursday it was working hard to bolster its capital to retain its fragile credit rating after writing down $3.5 billion in subprime related assets and posting a record quarterly loss. 

 The company's shares soared as much as 13.7 percent after its chief financial officer said he expected to maintain its credit ratings at Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service through capital raising, and that it was "virtually impossible" to imagine the insurer becoming insolvent. "We're going to work to capitalize the company to the point where there are no questions in the market from serious analysts, investors or customers about our capital position or our intent," said CFO Chuck Chaplin on a four-hour conference call with investors and analysts. But in a sign of how tenuous MBIA's position remains, S&P said after the call it may cut the insurer's top ratings, saying time is of the essence in MBIA's efforts to raise capital. Moody's said earlier this month it might also cut MBIA's ratings. MBIA is not a large company, but many investors fear its difficulties, combined with those of rival Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N and other bond insurers could weigh on the broader economy. New York State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo is working to rescue the industry, and other regulators are watching the situation closely. Raising capital will be all the more difficult with a potential S&P downgrade. "They can raise capital, but it will be hard. They don't have as much credibility as they once did," said Matt McCormick, an analyst looking at financial stocks at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati, which does not own MBIA shares. MBIA, which traditionally focused on insuring municipal bonds against default, strayed into insuring repackaged subprime mortgages and other consumer debt in recent years in an effort to boost returns. That move has cost it dearly. Besides the $3.5 billion write down of credit derivatives linked to subprime mortgages, MBIA said on Thursday it was setting aside an additional $713.5 million for losses, of which $613.5 million was for specific impaired bonds. MBIA reported a fourth-quarter loss of $2.3 billion, or $18.61 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $181 million, or $1.32 a share. On an operating basis, MBIA lost $3.30 a share, wider than the $2.97 loss forecast by analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. The operating number excludes losses on financial instruments at fair value and foreign exchange and estimated credit impairment on insured derivatives. HARD TIMES Other bond insurers have had trouble, too. Standard & Poor's stripped the bond insurance unit of FGIC Corp of its triple-A rating on Thursday, a day after Fitch did the same. Fitch earlier this month downgraded Ambac's insurance unit as well. More pain may be coming in the sector. Activist investor Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management said in a report on Wednesday the company could face losses of more than $11.6 billion from its collateralized debt obligations and related exposure. Ambac could face similar losses, he said. On the conference call, Chief Executive Gary Dunton railed against "the fear mongering and intentional distortions of facts about our business that have been pumped into the market by self-interested parties." Ackman has been vocal about his bets against MBIA since at least 2002. Losses and boosts to reserves slashed MBIA's net worth as a company, as measured by the recorded value of its shareholders' equity, to $3.65 billion as of the end of December from $7.2 billion a year earlier. As of the end of the third quarter, MBIA insured more than $670 billion of debt. Since the end of 2007, MBIA has taken steps to boost capital, including selling $1 billion of surplus notes and securing up to $1 billion of financing from private equity firm Warburg Pincus. The Warburg Pincus deal, which closed on Wednesday, includes a $500 million investment in MBIA equity and a commitment to backstop a $500 million rights offering. MBIA said it is considering the Warburg Pincus backstop and other moves to raise equity. One possible investor in MBIA is billionaire Wilbur Ross, who told CNBC this week he was looking at investing more than $1 billion in bond insurers. The outlook for the first quarter so far is not much better. Municipal bond issuance dropped 47 percent in January and only about a third of securities issued were insured, compared with more than half in the same period last year, Thomson Financial said on Thursday. If bond insurers lose their top credit ratings, the securities they insure will likely be downgraded, potentially forcing investors to sell billions of dollars of bonds, and lifting borrowing costs for consumers and city governments. MBIA's shares rose 11 percent to close at $15.50, but have fallen nearly 80 percent since the beginning of 2007.
