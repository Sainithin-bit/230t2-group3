 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's Europe Minister Jean-Pierre Jouyet said on Thursday that there was "no risk of a bid" on French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), seen by many as a takeover target after huge losses from a trading scandal. 

 "The bank is solid. There is no risk of a bid," Jouyet told LCI television station. On January 24, SocGen revealed 4.9 billion euros ($7.26 billion) of losses which it blamed on rogue trades by 31-year junior SocGen trader Jerome Kerviel. Its woes have reignited speculation that French rival BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) might be tempted to bid for SocGen. BNP Paribas made a failed bid for SocGen in 1999. On Wednesday, SocGen Chairman and Chief Executive Daniel Bouton said SocGen had enough capital to stay independent. (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta ; Editing by  Andrew Callus )
