 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pressure on bond insurers increased on Wednesday after Fitch Ratings downgraded FGIC Corp's credit rating and Standard & Poor's reviewed the ratings on $529 billion worth of U.S. mortgage-backed securities and collateralized debt obligations. 

 Speculation about imminent credit ratings cuts for bond insurers sent the U.S. stockmarket to a lower close, after an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve earlier in the day had boosted U.S. equities. FGIC's bond insurance arm lost its top "AAA" rating from Fitch Ratings, saying the insurer does not have the capital required for a top rating.  In response, the New York State Insurance Department, which is trying to coordinate the recapitalization of the bond insurers, said Fitch's downgrade of FGIC shows the industry must work fast to resolve its problems.  "When rating agencies were ranking all the insurers when this all started a few months ago, FGIC was always on the bottom of the list," said Daniel Solender, director of municipal bond management at Lord, Abbett & Co. in Jersey City, New Jersey. "This one is not a surprise. It continues the trend." The fortunes of the bond insurers have now moved to center stage in the global credit crisis that began last summer, after defaults soared on U.S. subprime mortgages causing losses for banks, funds, and insurers. The insurers have guaranteed municipal and consumer debt worth about $2.4 trillion, of which about $900 million is "structured finance" debt, including mortgage bonds held in vehicles like collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Like other bond insurers, FGIC initially focused on guaranteeing municipal bonds, but later ventured into "structured products" including mortgage bonds to boost earnings. MARKETS EXPECT INSURER DOWNGRADES Ratings agencies Moody's and Standard & Poor's warned several bond insurers in December to raise more capital or risk eventually losing their top credit ratings. "Some of the monolines (insurers) should have been downgraded a long time ago." said Arturo Cifuentes, managing director at fixed-income broker-dealer R.W. Pressprich in New York and a former Moody's analyst. "If any other company with a 'AAA' rating had been in that situation, it would have been downgraded on the spot - two, three days and that's it," he said. If the bond insurers lose their top credit ratings Wall Street firms that bought their insurance are likely to have to write billions of dollars more off the value of "structured finance" debt they hold, possibly forcing major banks into another round of capital raising. FGIC is the fourth-largest bond insurer, with about $314.8 billion of outstanding bonds insured as of the end of September 2007, most of it municipal bonds. The total also included about $31 billion of mortgage-backed securities and $28 billion of collateralized debt obligations. FGIC is owned by a group including mortgage insurer PMI Group Inc PMI.N and private equity firms Blackstone Group ( BX.N ), Cypress Group and CIVC Partners LP. The group agreed to acquire FGIC from General Electric Co ( GE.N ) in 2003 for about $1.675 billion. Fitch's downgrade came after analyst Meredith Whitney of broker Oppenheimer said in a report sent to clients late on Tuesday that U.S. financial institutions are facing as much as $70 billion in new write-downs from bond insurers in 2008. The majority of the write-downs would be concentrated between Citigroup ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N and UBS, Whitney said. Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain said on Wednesday the company's net exposure to troubled bond insurers is about $3.5 billion. The founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, William Ackman, also told regulators on Wednesday that Ambac ABK.N and MBIA ( MBI.N ), the two biggest U.S. bond insurers, face combined losses of over $23 billion from bonds they have insured, and should be forced to stop paying dividends. Ackman's Pershing Square Capital has shorted shares of Ambac and MBIA, meaning the fund profits if the bond insurers' shares drop. A spokesman for MBIA said, "The company strongly disagrees with Mr. Ackman's statement that the company will be insolvent in the second quarter of 2008. He made similar statements in 2002, none of which have come true." Shares of MBIA have fallen nearly 60 percent this year, while Ambac's shares were down almost 75 percent.
