 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italy's biggest bank, UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) is not interested in taking over wounded French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), a source close to UniCredit said on Thursday, reiterating recent comments from the bank. 

 "UniCredit is fully focused on the integration of Capitalia and organic growth," the source said. French bank BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) confirmed it was studying a possible bid for SocGen on Thursday "because all European banks are studying it." (Reporting by Jo Winterbottom)
