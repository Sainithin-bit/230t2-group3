 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The head of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is keeping close track of efforts led by the New York Insurance Department to form a rescue package for bond insurers AMBAC Financial Group Inc and MBIA Inc, CNBC reported on Thursday. 

 The New York Fed's president, Timothy Geithner, is not trying to take over the effort but is there to "monitor and consult" on the situation, CNBC reported, citing a source familiar with the matter. CNBC said its source cautioned against interpreting the Fed's participation in the talks, currently led by New York State Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo, as a signal that a Fed-led rescue is underway along the lines of the one organized for hedge fund Long Term Capital Management when it nearly collapsed in 1998.
