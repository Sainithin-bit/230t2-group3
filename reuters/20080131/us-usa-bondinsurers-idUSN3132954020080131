 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) said on Thursday it will have enough cash to meet its commitments even after reporting a worse-than-expected quarterly loss, while Standard & Poor's is reviewing the top ratings it gave to the world's largest bond insurer. 

 Still, U.S. bond insurers' shares staged a comeback after MBIA held a marathon conference call to reassure investors. U.S. government bonds also rose on a wave of safe-haven buying following a rating agency cut of an MBIA rival. Speculation about looming cuts in credit ratings for bond insurers has battered the U.S. stock market in recent sessions, though the shares were broadly higher Thursday. Despite gloomy employment data Thursday, financial stocks rebounded. MBIA shares closed up 11 percent at $15.50, and Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N jumped 9.2 percent at $11.72, both on the New York Stock Exchange. MBIA stock has tumbled about 50 percent this year, while Ambac has plummeted almost 70 percent. Late Thursday, rating agency S&P cut its ratings on smaller MBIA competitor FGIC Corp's bond insurance arm, and placed its top ratings on MBIA on review for a possible downgrade. The rating agency also said it may cut the "AAA" rating of XL Capital Assurance Inc, the bond insurance arm of Security Capital Assurance SCA.N. S&P cut Financial Guaranty Insurance Co's "AAA" insurer financial strength rating by two notches to "AA." It also cut parent company FGIC Corp's long-term rating by three notches to "A" from "AA." FGIC is owned by a group that includes mortgage insurer PMI Group Inc PMI.N and private equity firms Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ), Cypress Group and CIVC Partners LP. The fortunes of the bond insurers have moved center stage in the global credit crisis that began last summer after defaults soared on U.S. subprime mortgages, causing losses for banks, funds and insurers. The insurers have guaranteed municipal and consumer debt worth about $2.4 trillion, of which about $900 million is "structured finance" debt, including mortgage bonds held in collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). S&P's main competitor, Moody's Investors Service, is also reviewing MBIA and the entire bond insurance sector. THE LOSSES Just after midnight EST on Thursday, MBIA reported a loss of $2.3 billion, or $18.61 a share, versus a profit of $181 million, or $1.32 a share, a year earlier. On an operating basis, MBIA lost $3.30 a share, wider than the Wall Street expectation of $2.97, according to Reuters Estimates. MBIA said it was writing down $3.5 billion in its credit derivatives portfolio, including a credit impairment of $200 million. It also set aside $713.5 million, including $100 million for an unallocated loss reserve for MBIA's prime, second-lien mortgage exposure.  Despite the poor results, investors were cheered by MBIA's declaration it could raise new cash to meet its commitments. There is "reassurance from MBIA today that they have sufficient capital to cover its needs," said Tom Sowanick, chief investment strategist for Clearbrook Financial LLC in New York. Investors and analysts still had many questions about the company's finances. Its quarterly conference call lasted about four hours -- versus last quarter's 1 hour and 42 minutes. THE QUIZ SHOW Many of the most contentious points were raised by William Ackman of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management, who claimed in a letter Wednesday that Ambac and MBIA face combined losses of over $23 billion from bonds they have insured. He said the companies should be forced to stop paying dividends.  Pershing Square has shorted Ambac and MBIA shares, meaning it will profit if the stock drops. Company officials specifically disputed his claims. MBIA called Ackman's model "a black box," containing "extreme assumptions" that produced desired results. They added that the model does not account for cash flow and required payments on deals in which the insurer might participate. MBIA, which guarantees municipal bonds and repackaged consumer debt, said it sold $1 billion in surplus notes to boost its capital levels earlier this month. Chief Executive Gary Dunton said the measures would offset the cash it needed to set aside during the quarter. "We believe that these steps, along with reduced capital requirements resulting from slower business growth, will result in our capital position surpassing rating agency Triple-A requirements ... and will allow us to continue serving the needs of our clients and investors," he said in a statement. The company also said it would obtain further cash infusions as needed. SEES "AFFIRMATIVE" OUTCOME Chief Financial Officer C. Edward Chaplin said on the call the bond insurer would continue to work with Moody's to keep its credit rating at triple-A and believes the outcome of a Moody's review will be "affirmative." S&P's actions came one day after the rating agency said total losses for financial institutions from continuing mortgage market problems will eventually total more than $265 billion. Some wider market data about the municipal market could also raise concerns about MBIA and the bond insurance industry. On Thursday, Thomson Financial said that U.S. municipal bond volume dropped 47 percent in January from a year earlier and only 32 percent of all securities sold this month were insured compared with more than half guaranteed a year ago. But MBIA's CFO said the company's outlook is not that dire. "There is no scenario that we can identify that would result in MBIA becoming insolvent, having a liquidity event or being intervened with by the regulator, and experiencing a default of any kind," Chaplin said. Fears about the U.S. credit situation have spread across the globe. Soured bets on investments tied to the U.S. subprime mortgage market have cost Japan's top three banks $4.7 billion so far, and analysts predict more pain ahead.
