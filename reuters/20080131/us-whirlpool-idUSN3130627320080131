 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ) said on Thursday it planned to close two refrigerator plants and cut about 1,250 jobs in a restructuring expected to cost $15 million to $20 million, while adding 875 jobs at two other plants. 

 The plants to be closed are located in LaVergne, Tennessee, affecting about 500 jobs; and Reynosa, Mexico, where 750 jobs will be cut. The world's biggest appliance maker, which has about 73,000 employees, said the Tennessee's plant output will move to a facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas, that expects to add about 275 jobs. A Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, plant will take on production of the Reynosa plant, and it plans to add about 600 employees. The Benton Harbor, Michigan, manufacturer has announced more than 5,000 job cuts in various plant closures and consolidations since it bought smaller rival Maytag nearly two years ago. It has also moved to cut costs to cope with materials price increases and slower appliance sales. Whirlpool shares were up $2.25, or 2.7 percent, to $84.50 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
