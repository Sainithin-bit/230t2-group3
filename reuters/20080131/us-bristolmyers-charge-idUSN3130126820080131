 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) said on Thursday it took a fourth-quarter charge of $275 million relating to an impairment of the company's investment in auction rate securities (ARS). 

 The drugmaker, which reported fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, said the auction rate securities held at December 31 have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders. Bristol said its investments in ARS represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages or credit cards, insurance securitizations and other structured credits. Some of the underlying collateral for the ARS held by the company consists of subprime mortgages, the company said. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  and Edward Tobin, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
