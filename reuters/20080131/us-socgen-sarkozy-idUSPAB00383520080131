 PARIS  (Reuters) - Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) does not need financial support, President Nicolas Sarkozy's spokesman said on Thursday, answering a question about a possible takeover of the troubled French bank. 

 "As far as I am aware, Societe Generale does not need to be propped up financially," spokesman David Martinon said, adding that the issue of a takeover was "not an issue". (Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; writing by  Crispian Balmer )
