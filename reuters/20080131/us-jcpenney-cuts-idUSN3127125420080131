 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store operator J.C. Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) is set to cut 100 to 200 jobs as it merges its buying and marketing operations for its store and online businesses, Chief Executive Myron Ullman said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. 

 Ullman was also quoted in the interview, published on Thursday, as saying the company may scale back its plans to open new stores, cutting 10 of the 50 stores it planned to open each year in 2008 and 2009. "The precipitous drop in sentiment in the fall is what we feel we need to deal with going forward. We're assuming no improvement in the trend in 2008," he said in the interview. A slowdown in the U.S. housing market, as well as high energy prices and turbulence in the credit market have hit Penney's predominately middle-income shoppers. Its December department store sales fell 7.5 percent on a like-for-like basis, and the company has warned that fourth-quarter earnings would be at the lower end of a previously issued range of $1.65 to $1.80 per share.
