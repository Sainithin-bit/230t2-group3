 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ) on Thursday said its fourth-quarter operating earnings surged on higher credit card activity, pushing shares of the company up more than 14 percent. 

 MasterCard's credit card network feeds off transaction volume but doesn't issue cards, so it is not directly exposed to the debt problems of consumers, MasterCard Chief Executive Bob Selander said during a conference call. In contrast, credit card companies such as American Express Co ( AXP.N ) have been hurt by consumers struggling to pay bills as they face higher fuel costs and falling home prices. Purchase, New York-based MasterCard said quarterly earnings rose to $304.2 million, or $2.26 a share, from $40.9 million, or 30 cents a share, in the same quarter the prior year. MasterCard said it realized $284 million in pretax gains from selling a portion of its investment in Brazil's Redecard SA. Those gains contributed $1.37 a share to earnings. MasterCard earned 89 cents a share without the Brazilian gain. Analysts on average had been looking for MasterCard to earn 73 cents a share before one-time items, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts at JPMorgan Chase said strong gross dollar volume and solid pricing lifted MasterCard's operating results. The company said it expects revenue growth to be slower this year than in 2007, but still at least 10 percent. Assumptions in that outlook include no global recession and no event that significantly disrupts cross-border travel, the company said. MasterCard's fourth-quarter gross dollar volume increased 15 percent to $634 billion on a local currency basis. The number of transactions processed increased 17 percent to 5.2 billion. Shares of MasterCard were up $27.46, or 14.5 percent, at $216.46 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange, (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Dave Zimmerman and Gerald E. McCormick)
