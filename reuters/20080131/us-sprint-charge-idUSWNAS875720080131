 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) said on Thursday it will take a material goodwill impairment charge representing a substantial portion, and potentially all, of the $31 billion goodwill on its balance sheet. 

 The third-largest U.S. mobile service provider said in a regulatory filing that its initial assessment found that the net book value of its wireless unit exceeds fair value of the unit. Sprint said it has to conduct a second review to measure the size of any impairment charge. The charge will be reported in its fourth-quarter results, but will not affect its current cash balance or future cash flows, nor will it result in any violation of its debt covenants, Sprint said.
