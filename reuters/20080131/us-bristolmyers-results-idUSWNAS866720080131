 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) reported a quarterly loss on Thursday due to special charges, including a $275 million write-down from the credit crisis spreading through corporate America. 

 The drugmaker is among the first companies outside the financial sector to disclose its exposure to the housing and credit crunch gripping the country. Bristol-Myers said the market value of certain securities it holds fell by $392 million in the fourth quarter, to $419 million. The securities are tied to collateralized debt obligations supported by pools of residential and commercial mortgages or credit cards, insurance securitizations and other structured credits. "We have cleared out most of the exposure" related to the securities, Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield told analysts on a conference call. "There is unlikely to be any additional exposure ... but we have to be prepared if the credit markets deteriorate." Lehman Bros analyst Tony Butler said of the charge, "These were all AAA investments; it suggests what you thought was safe might not be." Shares of New York-based Bristol-Myers fell as much as 6.5 percent after it also reported operating earnings slightly below Wall Street expectations. The $275 million charge does not have a material impact on the company's liquidity or financial flexibility, or hinder its ability to fund the dividend, Bristol-Myers said. Bonfield said most of the company's cash and marketable securities have been moved into safer investments such as Treasury bills in view of the current economic climate. Goldman Sachs analyst James Kelly, in a research note, called the charge disappointing but said it should not materially affect the company's business. Bristol-Myers reported a net loss of $89 million, or 5 cents per share, for the quarter, compared with a loss of $134 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company took several one-time charges. Excluding special items, Bristol-Myers earned 33 cents per share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was 34 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. In the latest quarter, Bristol-Myers also recorded charges of $292 million in connection with a cost-cutting initiative and $230 million for acquired in-process research and development, related to the acquisition of Adnexus. Quarterly sales jumped 33 percent to $5.38 billion, exceeding Wall Street expectations of $5.25 billion. The rise was largely due to a 177 percent jump in revenue for blood clot preventer Plavix, which was facing tough competition in the year-ago quarter from a generic that is no longer on the market. Bristol-Myers said it has put up for sale its Convatec wound-healing unit and has already heard from an impressive number of potential buyers. The company's shares were down 33 cents to $22.93 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $21.75 in early dealings.
