 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc Chief Financial Officer C. Edward Chaplin said on Thursday he expects the bond insurer's business to be low in 2008, with international sales stronger than in the United States. 

 Chaplin, speaking on a conference call, also said MBIA is boosting unallocated reserves to account for probable losses. He said he expected another "hefty addition" to capital in the first quarter, and that the company intends to capitalize its business to withstand the worst-case scenarios. Earlier in the day the world's largest bond insurer posted a record loss in its fourth quarter of $2.3 billion or $18.61 a share after writing down $3.5 billion and said it was looking at ways to shore up its capital. Chaplin said on the conference call that, even in this difficult environment, there continues to be demand for MBIA insured products. His company insured $700 million of bonds in the first three weeks of January. The MBIA CFO said rumors the holding company would be insolvent in the near term are "without merit," and cash on the balance sheet provides two years of coverage for the holding company's needs. Holding company assets and bank lines also provide substantial coverage for the holding company's cash needs, Chaplin said. Losses and boosts to reserves have slashed MBIA's net worth as a company as measured by its shareholder equity, to $3.65 billion as of the end of December from $7.2 billion a year earlier. The bond insurer is seeking to keep the top credit ratings necessary to win new business. Chaplin said ratings agency Standard & Poor's has indicated that its capital plan is sufficient for keeping its AAA rating. A traditional municipal bond insurer, MBIA began insuring repackaged subprime mortgages and other consumer debt in recent years.
