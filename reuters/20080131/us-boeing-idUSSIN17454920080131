 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) defense unit expects rising Asian military budgets to drive double-digit sales growth in the region and help offset flat U.S. defense spending, its chief Asia-Pacific salesman told Reuters on Thursday. 

 Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier behind Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ), sees revenue growth of up to 15 percent from Asia this year, as countries in the region lift their defense budgets to upgrade ageing equipment. "We believe the U.S. defense budget will be fairly flat for the next few years, so international business becomes more important for us to continue growing," said Joe Song, Asia Pacific vice president of IDS in a telephone interview. Asian countries are making significant defense budget hikes of 5-8 percent annually to modernize their weapon systems, some of which are 35 to 40 years old, Song said. Boeing, the world's largest plane-maker by sales and with a market value of $63 billion, derives about half of its revenues from the defense unit, which sells F-15 fighter planes to Japan and Singapore. The plane-maker on Wednesday reported that 2007 sales rose 8 percent to $66.4 billion compared to 2006, with IDS contributing $32.1 billion. International markets represented 13 percent of the defense contractor's sales, or about $4.2 billion, with Asia contributing up to 55 percent of that amount, said Song. IDS expects to clinch new warplanes orders worth billions from South Korea and India within the first half of this year, he said. Boeing is negotiating to sell 20 jet fighters in a $2.5 billion oncontracttract to South Korea, which bought 40 F-15s from Boeing in 2002. Six suppliers from Europe, Russia and the United States are also competing to supply 126 new multi-role fighters sought by the Indian air force, in a deal potentially worth $10.2 billion. Boeing is offering its F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft, which will go up against planes such as Russia's MiG-35, France's Dassault Rafale, and the Eurofighter Typhoon. "India is emerging as a potentially very huge customer for us and we're very excited about the prospects," Song said. NOT CHINA U.S. officials regard arms sales to India as a way to cement strategic ties as a hedge against China's growing clout.  And while Western corporations, including Boeing's own commercial aircraft unit, have flocked to China to tap its booming consumer market, IDS is still barred by the U.S. government from making sales to the mainland. Song deferred questions on the China sales ban to the U.S. government, and also declined to comment on whether Boeing sells weapons to Taiwan, which China views as a renegade province. But Vietnam, another communist-ruled state in Asia, is very much on IDS's radar as a potential market for products such as the Chinook military transport helicopter, Song said. "As the bilateral relations between Vietnam and the United States improve, we see a potential for a market there," Song said. He said early talks have started with the Southeast Asian country, which in 1975 ended a war with the United States. (Editing by Neil Chatterjee)
