 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ) said on Thursday it planned to close two refrigerator plants and cut about 1,250 jobs in a restructuring expected to cost $15 million to $20 million. 

 The plants to be closed were located in LaVergne, Tennessee, affecting about 500 jobs; and Reynosa, Mexico, where 750 jobs will be cut. The appliance maker, which has about 73,000 employees, added that the Tennessee's plant output will move to a facility in Fort Smith, Arkansas, that expects to add about 275 jobs. A Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, plant will take on production of the Reynosa plant, and it plans to add about 600 employees. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
