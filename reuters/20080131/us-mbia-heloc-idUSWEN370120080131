 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An official at MBIA Inc, the world's largest bond insurer, said on Thursday the company's collateralized debt obligations backed by commercial mortgage- backed securities are not expected to experience material credit deterioration. 

 MBIA has $43.2 billion of CDOs backed by CMBS, said Mitchell Sonkin, head of insured portfolio management, on a conference call. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
