 PARIS  (Reuters) - A bid by a foreign bank for Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), the French bank stricken by a trading scandal, would not be shocking, Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday. 

 "If someone coming from abroad wanted to do good things with SocGen ... why would that bother me?" Juncker, who is also the prime minister of Luxembourg, said on Europe 1 radio. SocGen is reeling from 4.9 billion euros ($7.26 billion) of losses it has blamed on a rogue trader within the bank. Its woes have led many to consider it as a takeover target, and leading French government ministers have expressed their determination to ensure SocGen remains in French ownership. Analysts have said that many leading European banks might be interested in SocGen, such as HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Italy's UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ). French bank BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) is also considered a possible bidder. (Reporting by Anna Willard and  Sudip Kar-Gupta , editing by Will Waterman)
