 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Thursday he was pleased that Motorola Inc MOT.N was considering separating its mobile device unit, but he would still propose a slate of directors for the company's board. 

 "For many months I have been publicly advocating the separation of mobile devices from Motorola's other business and I am pleased to see that Motorola is finally exploring that proposal," Icahn said. "We believe Motorola is finally moving in the right direction but certainly still has a long way to go." Icahn said he would propose a slate of directors at Motorola's annual meeting. The company's announcement on Thursday that it would explore strategic options to realign its business "will not deter us from that effort."
