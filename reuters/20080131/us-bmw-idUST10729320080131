 TOKYO  (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's biggest premium car maker, will raise its production capacity at its Chinese factory by 45 percent over the next few months to as many as 44,000 cars a year, a top executive said on Thursday. 

 BMW would aim to build on its volume growth in greater China this year after a 37 percent rise in 2007 sales to more than 61,000 cars, sales and marketing chief Stefan Krause said at a media conference in Tokyo. BMW has teamed up with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd ( 1114.HK ) to make BMW 3 and 5 Series cars in the northern city of Shenyang, with a current annual capacity of 30,000 units. Chinese media have said the venture is building a second plant capable of making 20,000 cars per year. BMW had said repeatedly, however, that details of the expansion plans had yet to be finalized. "It is our clear goal to strengthen our lead as the most successful premium provider in Asia," Krause said. The German automaker said on Wednesday it expected record sales volume in 2008 for all three group brands BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce. In 2007, it sold 1.5 million vehicles worldwide, up 9.2 percent from the previous year, to keep its title as the world's top premium carmaker, with sporty models like the 3 Series cabrio, X5 offroader and new Mini Clubman fueling sales. In mainland China, BMW boosted its sales by 42 percent last year to 51,588 cars, while in the Greater China region including Macau, Taiwan and Hong Kong, it moved 61,098 vehicles. It has said it aims to sell many more than 2 million cars globally by 2020, and lift the core automotive division's operating margin to 8-10 percent by 2012. That margin was at 5.5 percent for the first nine months of 2007. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Hugh Lawson )
