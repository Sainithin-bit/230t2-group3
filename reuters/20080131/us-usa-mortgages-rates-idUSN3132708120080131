 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Interest rates on 30-year mortgages increased this week after four consecutive weeks of declines, according to a weekly survey released by Freddie Mac FRE.N on Thursday. 

 U.S. 30-year mortgage rates rose to an average of 5.68 percent from 5.48 percent a week earlier. Fifteen-year mortgage rates also rose to an average of 5.17 percent from 4.95 percent the prior week, as one-year adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) increased to 5.05 percent from 4.99 percent last week. Freddie Mac said the "5/1" ARM, set at a fixed rate for five years and adjustable each following year, averaged 5.32 percent, up from 5.13 percent last week. In the same period a year ago, 30-year mortgages averaged 6.34 percent, 15-year mortgages 6.06 percent and the one-year ARM 5.54 percent. The 5/1 ARM averaged 6.04 percent. The increase in average rates on 30-year and 15-year mortgages completely erased the previous week's declines, said Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac vice president and chief economist. "The movement in fixed mortgage rates was broadly consistent with the movement of Treasury bonds over the week," he said. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve cut the benchmark federal funds rate by a half-percentage point to 3.0 percent. Lenders charged an average of 0.4 percent in fees and points on 30-year and 15-year mortgages, as well as the 5/1 ARM, all unchanged from last week. Fees and points on the one-year ARM averaged 0.7 percent, up from 0.6 percent a week earlier. Freddie Mac is a mortgage finance company chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities to sell to investors or to hold in its own portfolio.
