 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - It is "virtually impossible" to imagine circumstances that would make MBIA Inc insolvent, its chief financial officer said on Thursday. 

 Speaking on a conference call, CFO Chuck Chaplin said, "There is not an event on the horizon that anyone can foresee that would result" in MBIA or its insurance units becoming insolvent. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
