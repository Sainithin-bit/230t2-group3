 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ), one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit almost doubled, boosted by the addition of Caremark's pharmacy benefits business. 

 It also said its January sales at stores open more than one year were "healthy," and it provided a 2008 earnings forecast that could come in above current Wall Street targets. Shares, which had fallen more than 8 percent since the drugstore chain reported weak December sales on January 3, rose 8 percent in late morning trading. "Management's outlook on 2008 should have removed most investor fears," wrote Wachovia Capital Markets analyst Matt Perry. "With several positive catalysts including positive 2008 guidance, more PBM (pharmacy benefits manager) new business wins than expected, larger synergies, and $3 billion in deployable cash in 2008, we expect CVS shares to outperform." CVS bought Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager, in March, allowing it to expand its prescription benefits business and mail-order operations. Profit rose to $815.0 million, or 55 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $417.2 million, or 49 cents, a year earlier. CVS had forecast earnings of 54 cents or 55 cents a share, while analysts on average were expecting 55 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Solid revenue growth and improved gross margins in both the retail and PBM segments drove expanded operating margins and healthy earnings growth," Chairman Tom Ryan said in a statement. SURGING REVENUE Quarterly revenue jumped almost 82 percent to $21.94 billion from $12.07 billion, aided by the acquisition. "Core CVS performed decently while Caremark did exceptionally well," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel in a note. Revenue from its retail pharmacy segment rose to $11.64 billion from $11.1 billion. Earlier this month it said its December sales were lighter than expected due to a slow flu season, lower-priced generic drugs and sluggish demand for seasonal items. Revenue in its pharmacy services segment, which comes mainly from its Caremark business, was $11.61 billion, up from $1.01 billion a year ago. "PBM segment performance was very impressive, driven by strong growth in profitability metrics," wrote JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open more than one year, in its CVS/pharmacy division rose 3.4 percent. Same-store sales rose 3.6 percent in its pharmacy section and 2.9 percent for general merchandise, or the "front end." On a conference call, CVS said its January sales are "healthy" and that preliminary data shows January same-store sales are up over 4 percent. It forecast 2008 earnings of $2.26 to $2.33 per share, compared with analysts estimate of $2.32 per share. For the first quarter, it expects earnings of 49 cents to 51 cents per share, compared with analyst expectations of 54 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. As of Dec 29, CVS operated 6,245 retail pharmacy stores, 56 specialty pharmacy stores, 20 specialty mail-order pharmacies and nine mail-order pharmacies. It shares rose $2.90 to $38.92.
