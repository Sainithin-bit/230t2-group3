 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Web search leader Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) has not yet seen an impact from a deteriorating U.S. economy and expects advertisers will still find its paid search listings a more attractive place to spend marketing dollars. 

 "We have not been able to detect any such effects from macroeconomic trends," Google co-founder Sergey Brin said on a conference call with analysts to discuss quarterly results. "Nearest we can tell we offer just such great ROI (return on investment) ... that advertisers in maybe even difficult markets just have a great incentive" to use search, he said.
