 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Video game publisher Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O gave an outlook that was below market expectations on Thursday as it delayed two new titles, sending its shares down 6 percent in after hours trading. 

 Electronic Arts expected fourth-quarter results to range from a loss of 3 cents per share to a profit of 2 cents per share, lower than the 17 cents that was the average forecast on Reuters Estimates. "They have historically made money at the $600 million revenue level. For them to break even on $800 million has people spooked," Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter said. Despite delaying upcoming games "Battlefield: Bad Company" and "Mercenaries 2" to fiscal 2009, EA kept its revenue estimates in line with Wall Street targets due to strong sales of "Rock Band". EA distributes "Rock Band" on behalf of Viacom Inc's VIAb.N MTV Games and, while it books all the sales of that game, which costs at least $170, relatively little of that falls to its own bottom line. "We are shipping out high-margin properties to next year and getting more on the top line from 'Rock Band'," EA Chief Financial Officer Warren Jenson told Reuters. For its fiscal third quarter, Electronic Arts said profit excluding special items was $290 million, or 90 cents per share, compared with $201 million, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier, and one penny higher than the average Wall Street estimate. Third-quarter net revenue was $1.5 billion, up 17 percent from a year ago, boosted by sales of titles such as "Need for Speed: Pro Street" and "FIFA 08." EA shares fell as much as 6 percent to $44.50 in extended Nasdaq trading. Over the past year, the stock has fallen more than 6 percent, compared with a rise of more than 50 percent for chief rival Activision Inc ( ATVI.O ).
