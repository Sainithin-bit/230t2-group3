 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc Chief Financial Officer C. Edward Chaplin said on Thursday the bond insurer would continue to work with Moody's Investors Service to keep its credit rating at "triple A" and believes the outcome of a Moody's review will be "affirmative." 

 Chaplin said MBIA's cash balance at year-end was $434 million, with annual debt service of $80 million and no debt maturities until 2010. He said no cash at the holding company level was pledged to third parties and all was available for expenses and debt service. Moody's said earlier this month that it was reviewing MBIA's top rating for a possible downgrade. Chaplin made his comments on a company conference call that followed its fourth-quarter earnings report earlier Thursday. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and John Wallace)
