 LONDON  (Reuters) - BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) is the clear favorite to buy French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) as its rival reels from a rogue trading scandal -- at least by British and Irish bookmakers. 

 BNP Paribas is given odds of 5/4 to take over SocGen by Ladbrokes. Other suitors on offer at one of the two "bookies" include Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) at 9/4, Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) at 4/1 or Barclays ( BARC.L ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) each at 6/1. Even ailing British bank Northern Rock NRK.L can be backed at odds of 1,000/1 to take over SocGen at Paddy Power. But the longest odds are offered on who will succeed Daniel Bouton as SocGen's next chief executive. SocGen's investment bank chief Jean-Pierre Mustier is given odds of 4/1 at taking over by Paddy Power, but Jerome Kerviel, the trader blamed for SocGen's 4.9 billion euros ($7.29 billion) of losses, can be backed at 10,000/1.
