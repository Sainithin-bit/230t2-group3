 (Reuters) - Boeing said Tuesday that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is requiring inspections of all 787 Dreamliners currently in service to confirm that fuel line connectors have been properly installed. 
 The FAA requirement, due to be issued Wednesday, "makes mandatory inspections already recommended by Boeing," the company said. FAA officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment. (Reporting by  Alwyn Scott ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
