 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd ( 4502.T ) posted a 77 percent drop in quarterly operating profit as it spent to boost its pipeline, and forecast a sharp fall in annual income linked to the costs of its $8 billion-plus purchase of Millennium Pharmaceuticals. 

 But Japan's biggest drug maker also sought to keep investors on side, announcing a near $1 billion share buyback that comes on top of a major stock cancellation. Hit by a major drug development setback and looking ahead to the loss of U.S. patent protection for its top-selling Actos diabetes pill in 2011, Takeda has recently wrapped up several deals to strengthen its drug pipeline. In addition to Millennium MLNM.O, which will significantly bolster its cancer drug business, Takeda will also split its U.S. joint venture with Abbott Laboratories Inc ( ABT.N ) and has bought Amgen Inc's ( AMGN.O ) Japanese unit and the development rights to a range of Amgen drug candidates. Amgen-related costs were the main reason the company undershot earlier company guidance and analysts' forecasts, Takeda President Yasuchika Hasegawa told a news conference. Annual operating profit slipped 8 percent to 423.1 billion yen ($4.1 billion) for the year ended March. That gave Takeda an operating profit of 17.3 billion yen for the January-March quarter, falling well short of a Reuters consensus estimate of 81.8 billion yen derived from the annual forecasts of 19 analysts. The result pushed shares of Japan's largest drug maker down 2.8 percent to 5,490 yen, helping drive the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  2.1 percent lower. Some analysts also noted that Takeda fell short of its annual revenue target, with sales rising only 5.3 percent to 1.37 trillion, instead of a hoped-for 7 percent rise. "It's not really clear what was behind that -- perhaps a stronger yen and/or wholesalers holding back on orders ahead of government drug price revisions in April," Daiwa Institute of Research analyst Kumi Miyauchi said. "It's hard to tell how concerned the market is going to be about that." Hasegawa also said Actos had not benefited as much as once might have been expected from safety concerns that hit GlaxoSmithKline's ( GSK.L ) rival medicine Avandia. "Rather we've seen doubts grow towards the class of drugs, especially in Europe and we've seen a shift towards a new type of diabetes medicine Januvia from Merck ( MRK.N )." But Takeda still expects Actos sales to grow a little over 10 percent globally in the current business year. Takeda said operating profit for this business year would drop 43 percent to 240 billion yen, roughly in line with expectations, on acquisitions costs related to Millennium and its absorption of its half of the TAP Pharmaceuticals venture with Abbott. Without the impact of Millennium and TAP, operating profit would rise 4.2 percent, the company added. Net profit is likely to fall 55 percent to 160 billion yen. Takeda's stock is still up 1 percent since it said on April 10 that it would buy Millennium, largely shaking off the negative earnings impact of the acquisition with a planned cancellation of 6.4 percent of its outstanding stock on May 23. It has helped it hold up better than rival Eisai Co Ltd ( 4523.T ), Japan's fourth-largest drug maker, whose shares have lost about a quarter of their value since it said in December that it would buy cancer specialist MGI Pharma for $3.9 billion. It also said on Friday it planned to buy back up to 100 billion yen worth of its shares, or up to 2 percent of its total shares outstanding between May 12 and June 23. Those shares would also likely be cancelled, Hasegawa said. Hasegawa added the company plans to return nearly all of its free cash flow to shareholders for several years, either in the form of buybacks or higher dividends.
