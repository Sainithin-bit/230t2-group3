 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer, posted its largest ever quarterly loss on Thursday after writing down assets linked to subprime mortgages, and said it would raise $12.5 billion to strengthen its balance sheet. 

 The weaker-than-expected results marked the second consecutive quarter AIG posted record losses, and sent AIG shares down nearly 8 percent in post-market trading. The company said it was replacing its chief financial officer, as operating income weakened across much of the company. "I'm disappointed. It was clearly a difficult quarter for them and the difficulties were fairly widespread, they weren't just in the investment portfolio," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst covering financial stocks at Optique Capital in Racine, Wisconsin, which owns AIG shares. AIG posted a first-quarter net loss of $7.81 billion, or $3.09 a share, compared with net income of $4.13 billion, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, AIG would have made a profit of 93 cents, below the $1.48 a share that analysts, on average, expected, according to Reuters Estimates. Included in AIG's quarterly loss was a $9.11 billion charge for declines in the market value of credit derivatives, a portfolio that also proved thorny in fourth-quarter results. AIG used credit derivatives to essentially insure subprime mortgage bonds and other assets against default. Two rating agencies cut AIG's ratings. The news was not all bad for investors -- operating profits from airplane leases rose and AIG said it was raising its dividend 10 percent. But the first quarter loss follows a $5.3 billion loss in the fourth quarter, which at the time set a record and was also driven by massive credit default swap write-downs. Until late last year, chief executive Martin Sullivan had turned a profit in every period at AIG since he was installed as CEO about three years ago. Now, analysts say Sullivan must work to stem losses and shore up capital. AIG said on Thursday it had started offering a total of $7.5 billion of common shares and mandatory convertible securities. In the future, the insurer plans to issue other securities that combine elements of equity and debt. AIG is the latest in a procession of companies to write down bad assets and raise more capital. Analysts estimate companies globally have recorded more than $300 billion of write-downs and raised more than $200 billion of fresh capital. FILLING KEY POSITIONS In addition to raising capital, Sullivan must fill two key management spots: chief financial officer, which is open after the company named former CFO Steven Bensinger as vice-chairman of financial services; and a head of AIG Financial Products, the unit holding the thorny credit derivatives. Joe Cassano, who had been head of AIG Financial Products, left his post in February and a permanent replacement has not yet been named. "(Sullivan) needs to get some good people into those positions," said Donn Vickrey, an analyst at the research firm Gradient Analytics, who does not own AIG shares. "I would like to see more done to bolster (AIG's) executive team with expertise in terms of risk assessment of financial markets." RAISING DIVIDEND AIG raised its quarterly dividend 10 percent to 22 cents per common share, which puzzled some analysts. "Why would you dilute your shareholders and raise your dividend? How do you justify that? This could be one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life," said William Smith, chief executive of Smith Asset Management, who does not own any AIG shares. At least one analyst thought the dividend was meant to send a positive signal to investors. "What they're trying to say is, 'we're committed to our dividend,'" said Bill Fitzpatrick, a financial stock analyst at Optique Capital in Racine Wisconsin, which owns AIG shares. The additional 2 cents per share per quarter dividend amounts to an extra $200 million a year, which is not much for a company AIG's size. S&P said it lowered its counterparty credit rating on AIG one notch to "AA-minus" from "AA" and Fitch lowered its issuer default rating and senior debt ratings to "AA-minus" from "AA", and said it may cut the ratings further. Amid the losses and write-downs, AIG's shareholders' equity, an accounting measure of the company's net worth, dropped 17 percent to $79.7 billion from the end of 2007 through the end of March. The shares dropped 7.7 percent in after-market electronic trading to $40.75, after closing down 2 percent in the regular session to $44.15.
