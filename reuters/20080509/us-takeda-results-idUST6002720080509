 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd ( 4502.T ) posted a 7.7 percent fall in annual operating profit on Friday and forecast a sharp drop for the current year on costs for its $8.8 billion purchase of U.S. biotech firm Millennium Pharmaceuticals. 

 Japan's biggest drug maker said group operating profit came to 423.1 billion yen for the year that ended in March, falling far short of a Reuters consensus estimate of 488 billion yen from 19 analysts. The acquisition of Millennium MLNM.O, one of the few profitable U.S. biotechnology companies, will significantly bolster Takeda's cancer drug pipeline, but could weigh on earnings for several years. Takeda said operating profit for this business year would slump 43 percent to 240 billion yen as it books costs such as in-process research and development and goodwill. That compares with an estimate of 250 billion yen from the Daiwa Institute of Research and an estimate of 220 billion yen from Nomura Securities. Takeda's shares have risen 4.4 percent since it announced last month its purchase of Millennium, beating a 2.4 percent gain on the Tokyo pharmaceuticals subindex .IPHAM.T. (Editing by  Ian Geoghegan )
