 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co said on Friday it had appointed Hover Automotive India Private to develop its sales network in India, with the aim of establishing 55 dealers by 2012 to sell more than 100,000 vehicles that year. 

 Japan's third-biggest automaker, held 44 percent by Renault SA, currently has just five sales outlets in India, where it sells X-Trail sport utility vehicles and Teana sedans imported from Japan. It sold a total 533 vehicles in India last year. Nissan has said it would launch eight additional models by 2012, including the Murano crossover vehicle due for launch in 2009. Four of the new models will be locally produced. Earlier this year, Nissan and Renault announced a $1 billion car plant in southern India to start production in early 2010. Nissan also has an agreement to procure vehicles from Maruti Suzuki India Ltd, a unit of Suzuki Motor Corp, and is studying a possible venture to develop and build $3,000 cars with Renault and Indian motorcycle maker Bajaj. Hover, established last month, is affiliated with the Westmont Group, a global consortium dealing in hotels, real estate and marketing, among other businesses. Operations will be led by GM Singh, a Mumbai-based businessman with experience in car retail and rental franchises, and Kevin Whalen, an entrepreneur with experience in developing dealer networks in the United States, Nissan said.
