 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp expects a 17 percent increase in its 2010 global production, excluding units Daihatsu and Hino Motors, from this year to about 7.5 million units, Japanese media reported on Saturday. 

 The move comes as recovery signs of the economy emerge in Japan, the United States and Europe. The figure is at a level similar to Toyota's output in 2005 and represents a decline of one million units from 2007, the Nikkei reported, adding the actual number for 2010 could top the projection because it does not take into account the impact from the government extending subsidies for environmentally friendly vehicles. A Toyota spokesman said the company had informed its suppliers of its plans for production for next year, but the figure was still a rough estimate. He added that Toyota would announce a finalized forecast as soon as it was compiled, most likely in January. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim  and  Chikako Mogi ; Editing by  Jerry Norton )
