 AUSTIN  (Reuters) - The United States should not coddle large financial institutions considered "too big to fail", Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said on Tuesday. 

 Fisher made the comments in a question and answer session following a speech to the Austin Headliners Club. Asked about the U.S. government budget deficit, Fisher said the Fed would not monetize the fiscal shortfall. (Reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa , Editing by Andrew Hay)
