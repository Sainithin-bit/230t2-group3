 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp's ( BSX.N ) outgoing Chief Executive Ray Elliott said he knows of no impending surprises at the company. 

 Earlier on Tuesday, Elliott said he would step down at the end of 2011 after less than two years at the helm of the troubled company. Reached for comment by email, Elliott said he knows of no "shoe" to drop at Boston Scientific, which has had troubles over the years with product recalls. Shares were off almost 10 percent to $6.95 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They topped the NYSE's most active stocks. (Reporting by  Debra Sherman ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
