 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - China and the United States agree on the direction of Chinese exchange rate policy reforms, but not the pace, Vice Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao said on Tuesday. 

 "It should be said that China and the United States agree on the direction of reforming the renminbi exchange rate, but there is indeed also disagreement," he told reporters following the annual U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in Washington. The renminbi is also known as the yuan. "China believes that the key to reform is promoting reform of the renminbi exchange rate formation mechanism and enhancing elasticity of the renminbi exchange rate. But the U.S. believes that the renminbi should constantly appreciate." U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner earlier said China had allowed the yuan to appreciate over the past year but that Washington hoped Beijing would let it rise more rapidly and against a broader range of trading partners' currencies.
