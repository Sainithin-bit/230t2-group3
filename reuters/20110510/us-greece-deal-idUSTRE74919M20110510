 LONDON  (Reuters) - Greece expects to receive a new aid package totaling nearly 60 billion euros as soon as next month, news agency Dow Jones reported a senior Greek government official as saying. 

 The Greek government was not immediately available for comment. The official was reported as saying the new package would cover Greece's projected need of 27 billion euros in extra funds in 2012 and 32 billion in 2013. State-owned properties may be offered up as collateral, Dow Jones said. After a meeting of select euro zone officials in Luxembourg on Friday, Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup of finance ministers of the 17-nation euro area, said there was a consensus that Athens would require a second rescue. The issue is expected to dominate a Eurogroup meeting on Monday. Euro zone officials have said options could include a new extension of maturities on Greece's existing bailout loans, a lower interest rate on those loans and allowing the European rescue fund (EFSF) to buy Greek bonds.
