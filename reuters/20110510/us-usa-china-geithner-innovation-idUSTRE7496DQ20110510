 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - China recognizes it needs to rely more on markets and less on government policies to spur domestic innovation, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday at the end of high-level U.S.-China talks. 

 "I think they recognize that if China is going to be stronger in the future, they have to increase the role for the market, strengthen the incentives for innovation in China and allow for a more neutral competition," Geithner said in a closing press conference at the third annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue. "We're very confident we're going to see substantial ongoing improvement in opportunities that American companies have in the Chinese market -- both American companies operating in China and American companies that are creating and building things in the United States," Geithner said. Geithner said the two sides also discussed ways to increase bilateral investment flows. The United States is open to Chinese investment and expects that to grow rapidly in coming years, he said. Washington also believes it would be in China's interest to open itself to more foreign investment, he said. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
