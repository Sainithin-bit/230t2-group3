 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp ( BSX.N ) Chief Executive Ray Elliott will step down at the end of 2011 after less than two years at the helm, a move that shocked investors and sent its shares skidding more than 10 percent. 

 The announcement sparked speculation that the medical device maker, which has been beset by quality problems in recent years, was having additional issues, but Elliott told Reuters he knows of no impending surprises. Earlier, the company issued a statement saying Elliott, 61, would sit on an a CEO search committee to find a successor. In the statement, Elliott said it was "time for me to permanently pass the baton to a long-term CEO." When the industry veteran took over the reins in July 2009 from long-time CEO Jim Tobin, the company was still struggling to recover from a series of high-profile recalls of implantable cardioverter defibrillators and pacemakers and a crushing debt load it acquired in the 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corp. Elliott set about selling off noncore businesses, including its neurovascular unit to Stryker Corp ( SYK.N ), and made substantial progress paying down the debt. In an interview with Reuters in September 2010, Elliott said his turnaround plan would take at least two years. However, the company has been hard-pressed to jump-start growth in the face of stagnant demand in its two largest businesses, ICDs and stents. "I think this was a tougher job than he thought. I don't see him up and quitting out of short-term frustration," said Jeff Jonas, a portfolio manager with Gabelli Health and Wellness Trust Mutual. "Ray is very well-respected on Wall Street and he has done a decent job stabilizing the company. He was dealt a tough hand." "I have no reason to think there are ulterior motives, but there may be concern that there's another shoe to drop, another quality issue coming and maybe that's why the stock is down as much as it is." Boston Scientific shares were down 9.2 percent at $7.00 on Tuesday afternoon, off an earlier low at $6.87. The shares were among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Boston Scientific shares, which nearly doubled in mid-2009 to a peak near $12 on high hopes for an Elliott-led turnaround, have been steadily retreating since then. Michael Weinstein, an analyst with JP Morgan, said the creation of a special CEO search committee "suggests that the preference may be for an external candidate, adding another layer of uncertainty to the situation." Rival Medtronic Inc ( MDT.N ) is also searching for a new executive for its top job. Elliott ran orthopedic device maker Zimmer Holdings Inc ( ZMH.N ) for 10 years before joining Boston Scientific. The company has been restructuring its businesses, divesting some operations and acquiring others. Elliott has cut jobs and other costs to bring the company back to profits in its most recently reported quarter. (Reporting by Debra Sherman, Susan Kelly and  Michele Gershberg , editing by Gerald E.
