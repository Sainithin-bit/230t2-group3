 LONDON  (Reuters) - Greek government bond yields fell and German Bunds retreated from their highest levels in over two months on Tuesday on talk that a new aid deal for Athens could be in place as soon as next month. 

 News agency Dow Jones, citing a senior Greek government official, reported that Athens expects to receive a new aid package totaling nearly 60 billion euros. Greece denied it was discussing a new aid package. The Greek/German 10-year bond yield spread tightened to 1,271 basis points from its widest levels of around 1,296 bps, while five-year Greek bond yields were the biggest movers, over 30 basis points lower at 21.45 percent. "It's certainly positive for peripheral sentiment and is assisting in the unwinding of some yesterday's safe-haven flows into Bunds," said Rabobank rate strategist Richard McGuire. Senior euro zone policymakers acknowledged on Monday that Athens will need a second bailout package soon to avert a disorderly overhaul of its debt obligations but Standard & Poor's -- cutting the country's rating to B -- suggested more radical measures would be needed, implying large losses for investors. Moody's followed, threatening to downgrade Greece by several notches, leaving Greek 2-year yields near 26 percent and 10-year yields around 16 percent and making any return to markets next year -- part of the country's initial bailout plan -- highly unlikely. Euro zone finance ministers will discuss on May 16 whether Greece needs a further economic plan. "A Greek restructuring would be the thin end of the wedge, just as the Greek bailout last year was the beginning and not the end of the crisis, there was a domino effect," McGuire said. "There is an evident risk... that we have a second wave of dominoes with any Greek restructuring prompting market speculation Ireland and Portugal will follow suit." Five-year Greek credit default swap prices indicate a 71 percent probability of default based on a 44.7 percent recovery rate, according to Reuters calculations from Markit data, while Irish prices show a 46 percent probability of default based on a 44.2 percent recovery rate. Other peripheral bond yields were mostly slightly higher although 2-year Irish bonds yields eased around 6 bps to 12.9 percent after rising almost 1 percentage point on Monday. June Bund futures were 23 ticks lower at 124.05 but traders said markets would remain volatile and Bunds generally well supported while there was uncertainty over Greece. "The ramifications of some sort of Greek collapse or restructuring are not fully in the price of Bunds so they should remain well supported," said a trader. European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi warned on Tuesday that a default or restructuring of Greek debt would bring the banking system to its knees. Two-year Bund yields were 4.5 basis points higher at 1.73 percent. Ten-year yields were up 2.5 basis points at 3.12 percent, having fallen as low as 3.08 percent on Monday, an important resistance level corresponding to the 38 percent retracement of the 2008-2010 fall in yields. "It's very hard to call where we go from here. If you look at the German data you can argue yields are too low but the situation in Greece and beyond will probably overshadow anything else," said the trader. Greece will auction 1.25 billion euros of T-Bills, while the Netherlands sold 3 billion euros of reopened July 2021 bonds at an average of 3.405 percent, with the pick-up in demand for core paper supporting the sale. Last month, Greece sold 1.625 billion euros of six-month T-bills at 4.80 percent. "With yields increasing more than 900 basis points in the 2-year sector, we won't be surprised to see a rate close to 6 percent," Lloyds Bank strategists said in a note. (Editing by John Stonestreet)
