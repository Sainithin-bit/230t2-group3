 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Finland's prime minister-elect suffered a setback in trying to win parliament's support for the EU's Portugal bailout plan, as a vote on the package was delayed because the second-largest SDP party remained undecided. 

 Jyrki Katainen, leader of the National Coalition which won the most votes in April's election, had been hoping to gain approval on Wednesday to back the EU's plans at a eurozone meeting on May 16-17. A parliamentary committee has moved the vote to Friday, a senior Social Democratic Party (SDP) member told reporters. The Finnish parliament's approval is important because it, unlike others in the euro zone, has the right to vote on EU requests for bailout funds. Support from the SDP is crucial to securing majority approval in parliament, with the eurosceptic True Finns party strongly opposed to the plan. The True Finns finished a close third in elections after a campaign which attacked bailouts for debt-hobbled members of the European Union. The sticking point on Tuesday appeared to be the SDP's demand that the Portugal package include investor participation. The SDP said it had agreed on an internal memorandum calling for private investors to shoulder more risk in the bailout plan. "We have not today taken a final stance on the Portugal question," SDP chairwoman Jutta Urpilainen told reporters. "We have today passed a memorandum that includes investor participation requirements, and we will start negotiations with Katainen based on that." COMPROMISE POSSIBLE A senior Finnish politician said the vote on the EU bailout package for Portugal may mention the need for investor participation, suggesting a compromise was possible. Kimmo Sasi, a senior member of the National Coalition party and head of negotiations on the Portugal issue, said a reference to investor participation might be included in some form. "I believe that moderate proposals (by parties) will be taken into account," he told reporters. Asked about investor liability, he said: "It was brought up in talks, so it is likely the parties will make proposals about it." The EU/IMF bailout package for Portugal does not provide for any contribution from private bondholders, and it is unclear how Finland could secure investor participation. Sasi did not clarify whether a reference to investor participation would be a specific clause that could hamper an EU bailout of Portugal, or a cosmetic, non-binding measure. Analysts said it was becoming clear that the parliamentary vote depended on the Social Democrats. Many said they would probably approve the bailout plan given their traditionally pro-EU stance and role in Finland's 1995 entry into the EU. "The Social Democrats are waiting in the bushes and hoping they can jump in in the home stretch," University of Helsinki professor Tuomo Martikainen said. "It is likely that they will be for it in the end." TRUE FINNS OPPOSED Katainen said he would listen to other parties. "Finland's decisions cannot be such that hurt other countries, or weaken financial stability. Also, Finnish parties' opinions must be taken into account," he told reporters. The strongest opposition so far has come from the True Finns, led by charismatic Timo Soini. The party is expected to enter government along with the SDP, although differences over the bailout have stalled the formation of a coalition. Katainen has tried to work around that by seeking a mandate in parliament with the help of other parties including the Center Party, previously the leading party and now set to join the opposition after losing many seats to the True Finns. The Center Party would support the bailout, its leader said, while she held reservations about procedures regarding the vote. "From Finland's and from a financial point of view, it is sensible for Finland to participate, although we are not rushing into it," Center Party leader and outgoing prime minister Mari Kiviniemi told reporters after a meeting. Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, who is Finnish, said the loan program for Portugal required unanimity and that he trusted Finland would support it. "I also trust that Finland will continue its active and constructive policy on Europe, which has been its policy line over the past decades, which has served Europe well, and has especially served Finland very well," he told a news conference in Strasbourg.
