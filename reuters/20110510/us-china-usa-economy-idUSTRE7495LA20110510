 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday that international monetary reform must be gradual and orderly, and also told U.S. officials that Beijing was committed to expanding imports to encourage more balanced growth. 

 "Reform of the international monetary system is long-term and complex," Chinese officials said in a statement summarizing their talks with U.S. officials about economic issues. "The international community should advance diversification of the international monetary system in an orderly and gradual way," the statement said.
