 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece paid a higher yield to sell six-month T-bills on Tuesday compared with a previous April auction, raising funds to refinance 960 million euros ($1.38 billion) of maturing government paper later in the month. 

 The auction drew less interest from foreign investors, who bought 34.2 percent of the issue compared with 41 percent at last month's auction as the overborrowed euro zone member keeps funding itself only for short periods. On Monday ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Greece further into junk territory to B and said Athens may have to reduce the face value of its bonds by up to 70 percent, implying big losses for investors. Tuesday's borrowing sortie took place with Greek government bond yield spreads near record highs amid persistent talk of some form of debt restructuring down the line. The issue fetched 1.625 billion euros, including 375 million in non-competitive bids. It was priced to yield 4.88 percent, up eight basis points from last month and above the rate of about 4.2 percent Greece pays on its EU/IMF bailout loans. Up until March, Greece was funding itself on short durations at a lower cost than the 5.2 percent rate on its bailout loans. A summit of euro zone leaders last month agreed to cut the rate by one percentage point and stretch out the repayment period. "The auction's yield rose compared to April because of the restructuring scenarios but this was expected," said Stelios Vyzantinopoulos, a senior fixed-income trader at Marfin Bank. "Any restructuring of Greek debt would not affect T-bills. This, coupled with the attractive yield, explains why there is investor interest in the auctions." Debt agency PDMA needs to roll over 480 million euros of six-month T-bills on May 13 and another 480 million euros of three-month paper maturing on May 20. It is set to auction 3-month T-bills the following week. (additional reporting by Lefteris Papadimas; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
