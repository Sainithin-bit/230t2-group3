 LONDON  (Reuters) - A small, rebel shareholder sought to step up the pressure on Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) on Tuesday, saying the British mobile phone company had no clear strategy for its stake in U.S. joint venture Verizon Wireless. 

 Efficient Capital Structures (ECS), which has called on Vodafone to return up to 38 billion pounds ($77.5 billion) to shareholders by spinning off its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless and issuing bonds, was responding to a report in the Financial Times newspaper that Vodafone had considered buying its joint venture partner, Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ). "At last Vodafone seems to have recognized that it must have a coherent strategy for its investment in Verizon Wireless," ECS Chairman Glenn Cooper said in a statement. "The ill-conceived plans leaked to the Financial Times show Vodafone does not have one." ECS, backed by the former deputy chairman of telecoms equipment maker Marconi, owns just 0.0004 percent of Vodafone shares, but is urging shareholders to back its suggestions at the mobile phone group's annual shareholder meeting next week. Vodafone, the world's biggest mobile phone operator outside China, has rejected ECS's calls and said on Monday that it had no plans to bid for Verizon, responding to an initial report on the Financial Times' FT Alphaville blog. The newspaper said on Tuesday, citing sources familiar with the situation, that Vodafone had considered an offer worth $172 billion, including debt, for Verizon, the second-largest U.S. mobile service provider by subscribers behind AT&T Inc ( T.N ). Vodafone was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. At 1300 GMT, its shares were down 0.3 percent at 161.7 pence, valuing the firm at about 86 billion pounds.
