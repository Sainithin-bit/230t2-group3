 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Electrolux ( ELUXb.ST ), the world's second-largest appliances maker, pleased investors with a strong quarterly performance in a slowing U.S. market, lifting its shares nearly 7 percent on Tuesday. 

 Second-quarter core earnings grew in line with market expectations as product delays in Europe were outweighed by U.S. strength. A slowing U.S. market had been a key point of concern ahead of the report. "This was more positive than expected, mainly in North America, which turned out to be a very positive point, while Europe came in much worse," Danske Equities analyst Michael Andersson said. But he added, "These are still very mixed results." The Swedish firm, dethroned last year by Whirlpool Corp. ( WHR.N ) as the world's top white-goods maker, reported second-quarter earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) of 921 million crowns ($139 million), excluding non-recurring items. That was up from 844 million crowns a year ago and just above the mean forecast of 917 million in a Reuters poll. Electrolux -- whose brands include AEG, Zanussi and Frigidaire and, increasingly, its own name -- stood by its forecast of "somewhat" higher operating earnings for the full year, excluding one-off items. "Isolated quarters can vary and the fourth quarter last year was very strong while we now have these problems in Europe. But I am more confident now than before about our full-year forecast," Chief Executive Hans Straberg told Reuters. The firm also repeated demand for home appliances would grow in Europe versus 2006, but would decline in North America, while higher costs of raw materials would dent earnings this year. Straberg said raw material costs rose around 600 million crowns in the quarter, roughly as much as during the first three months of the year. This was mainly due to price rises for metals such as stainless steel. "Looking at the full year we're still talking about (a cost increase of) 2 billion crowns," he said. Higher margins on the wide range of new products being launched by the firm would help offset the impact, he added. EUROPE MESSY Electrolux has begun to turn its eye back to growth after spending years cutting costs and moving production out of expensive sites in western Europe and North America to fight low-cost competition and surging raw-material prices. The firm shrugged off a slowdown in the U.S. white goods market in the final months of last year, sending its stock to a life high in April. Earnings lagged expectations in the first quarter, but the stock is up more than 45 percent this year. Electrolux shares saw rocky trading last week as profit warnings from Home Depot ( HD.N ) and Sears Holdings ( SHLD.O ) and talk of product delays in Europe prompted analysts to scale back earnings expectations. Both Home Depot and Sears are big retailers of Electrolux products. Straberg said in a statement the company managed to increase market share while boosting earnings, but he was disappointed with results in the European operations due to the raw material costs and delays in the firm's biggest-ever launch of products. "Step by step we will get through this and the way things look right now the launches will be carried out during the third quarter," he told Reuters. "What is very positive is that we are seeing our new products being very well received." Operating earnings in Europe fell to 299 million crowns in the quarter from 376 million despite a 1 percent rise in underlying industry shipments of core appliances. The reverse was true in North America where earnings rose to 422 million crowns from 383 million despite appliance deliveries extending a slump seen in recent quarters, falling 1.8 percent. The maker of vacuum cleaners, washing machines, refrigerators and freezers said sales rose to 25.79 billion crowns in the second quarter from 25.32 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected 25.42 billion.
