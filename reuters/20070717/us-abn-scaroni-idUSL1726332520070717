 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - ABN AMRO board member Paolo Scaroni, top executive of Italian oil company Eni ( ENI.MI ), bought shares in the Dutch bank just before a hedge fund urged its sale or break up, according to regulatory filings, but Scaroni denied he had intentionally bought the stock. 

 According to filings with Dutch financial markets authority AFM, Scaroni bought 10,250 shares in ABN AAH.AS in late January and early February, more than doubling his holdings. The purchases came before British hedge fund TCI sent a letter to ABN's management on February 20, calling on the bank to consider a breakup. But Scaroni told Reuters on Tuesday he declared his stake as soon as he learned his own investment vehicle had bought the shares automatically based on their dividend yield. "In May, I discovered that, using this mechanism, they had bought the ABN shares. So then I took measures to declare them," he said in a phone interview. "It's in my interest that for such a silly thing there be no misunderstanding." ABN is the target of competing takeover bids from Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) and a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland Plc ( RBS.L ). The stock has risen 45 percent since TCI's letter. Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad reported on Tuesday that Scaroni had not registered his ABN holdings with the AFM in a timely manner. The paper said Scaroni's own investment vehicle had purchased ABN shares in line with a DJ Stoxx share index. ABN said Scaroni became aware he indirectly owned shares after the 2006 annual report was published and then immediately told the AFM. Scaroni owns shares indirectly through an investment portfolio held by a trust and managed by bank Fortis FOR.BR, ABN said in a statement. "Mr. Scaroni has informed the AFM that he regrets the oversight," it said. The AFM declined to comment on the transactions. Since Scaroni bought the shares at about 25 euros, according to the filings, he stands to gain more than 100,000 euros ($138,000) on ABN's subsequent appreciation. Shares in ABN closed at 37 euros on Tuesday, down 0.4 percent on Amsterdam's stock exchange. Scaroni has been on ABN's supervisory board, which acts as the bank's board of directors, since 2003. He owned 18,451 shares in ABN as of May 24, according to the AFM. (Additional reporting by  Ian Simpson  in Milan) ($1=.7248 Euro)
