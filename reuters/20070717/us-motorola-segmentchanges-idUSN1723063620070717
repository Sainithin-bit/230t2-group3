 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N, which has warned that it will post a second quarterly loss in a row, announced a business reorganization on Tuesday that one analyst said could help the mobile phone maker cut costs. 

 Hurt by price competition and a lack of advanced phones, Motorola has combined its network equipment business with its television set-top box business into a division that sells to service providers. Motorola also made its enterprise business, which serves corporate and government customers, a separate unit. Enterprise had previously been grouped with network equipment. The mobile devices unit, Motorola's biggest business, remains largely unchanged, though the mobile e-mail business has been moved to the enterprise unit, Motorola said. Pacific Crest analyst James Faucette said the reshuffle made sense as the three units will target specific customer segments, similar to the structure of main rival Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ). "These realignments are in line with the type you'd expect as they try to reduce their overall headcount," Faucette said. But the restructuring alone would not be enough to turn around the company's mobile device business, he said. "While improving cost structure is great, their bigger challenge is getting higher-priced handsets into the market and having those do well," Faucette added. Motorola has announced plans to cut 7,500 jobs, or about 11 percent of its workforce, by the end of 2007. It said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday that the reorganization would "better align its operations with the evolving nature of (its) customers and served markets." The company, which analysts say lost its place as the world's second-biggest mobile phone maker to Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ), will report second-quarter results along these three business lines on Thursday. Motorola said last week that weak phone sales would lead to a loss in the quarter, and it did not expect to make a profit in mobile devices this year. In its Tuesday filing, the company also said it identified two "immaterial" changes to be made to previously filed consolidated financial results. A Motorola spokeswoman did not give the dollar amount of the adjustments. The company said the first adjustment, to operations statements for 2004, 2005 and 2006, related to the elimination of sales between its set-top box and network equipment unit, had a "minor off-setting impact" on sales and costs of sales. The second adjustment, which applies to the second half of last year and the first quarter of this year, related to a "change in classification of certain deposits between cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments," it said. This adjustment had a minor impact on Motorola's consolidated balance sheet and cash flow statements but did not change net operating cash, the company said. Motorola shares were down 18 cents at $17.98 in late afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
