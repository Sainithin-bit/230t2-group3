 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ) on Tuesday promoted the head of its international business to the new post of chief operating officer, part of a slew of management changes focused on the coffee shop chain's rapid global expansion. 

 The moves come as Starbucks has accelerated its store development outside the United States amid slowing sales growth in its home market, and the company said they would help ensure that Starbucks coffee shops offer the same standard of service from Seattle to Shanghai. Martin Coles, who has served as president of Starbucks Coffee International since 2004, will become COO and report to Chief Executive Jim Donald. Before joining Starbucks, Coles was president and CEO of Reebok International. In his new post, Coles will be responsible for store operations and development both in the United States and internationally. He will also oversee the company's consumer products business and supply chain. Starbucks' growth plans are aggressive, with 2,400 stores slated to open this year, including 1,700 in the United States. The company currently has about 14,000 stores worldwide and plans to one day have at least 40,000 outlets. Despite that explosive growth, however, concerns about slowing U.S. sales increases and rising costs have put a damper on the company's stock, which is down 27 percent this year. Mike Koskuba, a managing director with Victory Capital Management, said the management changes were not likely a response to an existing problem. "I don't necessarily think this was addressing a problem that they had," Koskuba said. "These changes have been put in place for the longer term." Victory Capital owns about 1 million Starbucks shares. Last month, Starbucks Chief Financial Officer Michael Casey said the company would likely maintain the number of U.S. store openings at about 1,700 for the next few years to relieve pressure on older outlets and so it can funnel more resources into international markets including China and Brazil. Jim Alling, the head of Starbucks' U.S. business, will replace Coles as president of the company's international unit. Alling has worked for Starbucks since 1997 and has held his current post since 2005. Launi Skinner, who joined Starbucks in 1993 and most recently served as senior vice president of store development, will become president of Starbucks Coffee U.S. Coles, Alling and Skinner will transition into their new roles over the next six weeks, the Seattle company said. "These key appointments will ensure that we deliver a consistent, quality coffee experience globally," Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz said in a statement. Starbucks said recently that it has been working to improve the consistency of its business in China, where many stores have been opened by different joint venture partners. The company also owns its own stores there, which made the business even more fragmented. Starbucks shares edged down 22 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $25.86 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
