 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), a large U.S. Midwest bank, on Tuesday said second-quarter profit rose 8 percent as an increase in fee income helped offset rising loan losses and declining lending margins. 

 Net income for the Cleveland-based company rose to $334 million, or 84 cents per share, from $308 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations rose 11 percent to $337 million, or 85 cents per share, from $303 million, or 74 cents. Analysts on average forecast earnings of 70 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. KeyCorp also forecast second-half profit of $1.50 to $1.60 per share. Analysts on average forecast 72 cents for the third quarter and 74 cents for the fourth. "We are extremely pleased with the company's results in light of continued competitive pressures experienced in a challenging interest-rate environment," Chief Executive Henry Meyer said in a statement. KeyCorp shares closed Monday at $35.10 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 8 percent this year, compared with a 2 percent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX. FEES RISE, JOBS DECLINE Profit from continuing operations from community banking fell 3 percent to $97 million. In national banking, which includes such areas as construction loans, equipment finance, capital markets and asset management, profit from continuing operations fell 4 percent to $169 million. Fee income rose 19 percent to $649 million, helped by gains from principal investing, and loan securitizations and sales. Results also included a $40 million gain from the sale of MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ) shares. Noninterest expenses rose 2 percent to $815 million as a litigation charge offset lower personnel expenses. KeyCorp said it has reduced its work force by 913 people, or nearly 5 percent, since the end of March. Net interest income fell 3 percent to $706 million, hurt by a decline in net interest margin to 3.46 percent from 3.68 percent a year earlier. KeyCorp had expected the margin to remain in the 3.50 percent range in 2007. KeyCorp set aside $53 million for bad loans, up from $23 million a year ago, while net charge-offs rose to $53 million from $34 million. KeyCorp said it operates 954 branches, including many in the Pacific Northwest. It ended June with $94.1 billion of assets.
