 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The Chicago Board Options Exchange, the largest U.S. options market, said on Tuesday that second-quarter profit after taxes rose 31 percent on increased option volume and expanded product offerings. 

 In the past year, the CBOE has restructured into a for-profit business model from a member-owned organization, setting the stage for an eventual initial public offering. Earnings after taxes for the quarter rose to $18.7 million from $14.2 million a year ago. Before taxes, quarterly profits were $32.2 million, compared to $23.7 million during the same period a year ago, the exchange said. Second-quarter revenues grew 20 percent to $84.6 million from $70.5 million a year earlier. The rise in revenues resulted from higher trading volumes, which raised transaction fees by $11.3 million, the CBOE said. Average daily volume at the CBOE during April, May and June was 3.5 million contracts up from 2.9 million contracts during the same three-month period of 2006. During June, volume in options on the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX set a new monthly record of 2,000,936 contracts, a rise of 233 percent from June 2006 volume of 601,445 contracts. Average daily volume was 95,283 contracts, making VIX options the second most actively traded index and the fifth most actively traded product at CBOE. CBOE Chairman and Chief Executive William Brodsky said in a statement that the options exchange maintains its focus on increasing its business through new product development. The CBOE this year rolled out several new products, including a new line of credit products, Credit Event Binary Options, also known as credit default options. Expenses totaled $52.4 million for the second quarter compared to $46.8 million one-year ago. Employee costs rose by $3.1 million due to severance costs and accrued expense for year-end staff bonuses, the CBOE said. The rise in severance expenses during the quarter stemmed from CBOE's restructuring that resulted in the elimination of about 25 positions. (Reporting by  Doris Frankel )
