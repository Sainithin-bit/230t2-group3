 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent oil and gas producer Plains Exploration & Production Co. PXP.N will buy peer Pogo Producing Co. ( PPP.N ) for $3.46 billion in stock and cash, nearly doubling its production capacity, Plains said on Tuesday. 

 When announced, the deal valued Pogo at about $60 per share, a premium of 19 percent over its closing stock price on Monday. But Plains shares fell in early trading, lowering the value of the deal to around $58.24 per Pogo share. The combined company will have proved reserves of 635 million barrels of oil equivalent, and total estimated reserve potential -- which includes probable and possible reserves -- of 1.4 billion barrels of oil equivalent. Plains' top management, including Chairman, President and Chief Executive James Flores and Chief Financial Officer John Wombwell, will head up the combined company, keeping their positions. Two members of Pogo's board will join the Plains board when the deal closes. Plains said the addition of Pogo's assets will position the combined company to create a master limited partnership. MLPs have long been popular with energy infrastructure and pipeline owners because the partnerships pay no corporate taxes and distribute nearly all their profits to shareholders. U.S. exploration and production companies have increasingly been looking to take advantage of the MLP structure. Plains has retained Lehman Brothers as its financial adviser to evaluate the formation of an MLP. Pogo shareholders will receive 0.68201 share of Plains common stock and $24.88 cash for each of their shares. The total consideration for the deal will be 40 million Plains shares and $1.5 billion in cash, Plains said. Hedge fund Third Point LLC took a stake in Pogo last year and demanded that the company put itself up for sale. Plains said Third Point, which owns about 7.9 percent of Pogo's shares, has agreed to support the deal. Plains has also signed a support agreement with Pogo Chief Executive Paul Van Wagenen. Pogo shares rose $7.01 to $57.49 in early trade, while Plains was down $2.26, or 4.4 percent, to $48.93, both on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Michael Erman  and  Matt Daily )
