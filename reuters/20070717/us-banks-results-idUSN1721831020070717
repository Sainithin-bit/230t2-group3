 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. banks led by Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ) and U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ) posted mixed results on Tuesday, as higher customer fees offset rising loan losses and pressure from interest rates and mortgage lending. 

 Profit rose 9 percent at Wells Fargo, but fell 4 percent at U.S. Bancorp, the fifth- and sixth-largest banks. Earnings rose 31 percent at Regions Financial Corp. ( RF.N ) and 8 percent at KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), two big regional banks. Increasing loan losses, the housing downturn and a flat yield curve, where long- and short-term interest rates are about the same, are pushing banks to seek out more revenue from such areas as credit cards and deposit service charges. Lending margins narrowed at all four banks from the first quarter. "The rate environment leaves banks doing everything they can to increase fees to offset margin pressures," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst at JohnsonFamily Funds in Racine, Wisconsin, which invests $1.8 billion. Wells Fargo shares closed up 14 cents at $35.59, while U.S. Bancorp fell 33 cents to $32.87, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Regions fell 64 cents to $33.57, while KeyCorp rose $1.61, or 4.6 percent, to $36.71, also on the NYSE. The 24-member Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX rose 0.43 percent. Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Wachovia Corp. WB.N, the largest U.S. banks, are set to report results later this week. WELLS FARGO Net income for San Francisco-based Wells Fargo rose to a record $2.28 billion, or 67 cents per share, from $2.09 billion, or 61 cents, a year earlier. Revenue increased 13 percent to $9.89 billion, while expenses were up 11 percent. Profit matched the average analyst expectation, but topped the Wall Street revenue outlook of $9.63 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "It was a typical Wells Fargo quarter, and speaks to the strength of the franchise," said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which invests $75 billion. Fee income rose 23 percent to $4.7 billion, as trust and investment fees and card fees helped offset a 6 percent drop in mortgage revenue. Still, the second-largest U.S. home loan provider said it is adding market share in mortgages after dozens of rivals ran into trouble from making exotic loans. Mortgage applications rose 6 percent to $114 billion, while originations fell just 1 percent to $80 billion. Lending was up 18 percent from the first quarter. "Given the turmoil in the market, business is somewhat being directed our way," Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. Credit losses rose 67 percent from a year earlier to $720 million, but just 1 percent from the first quarter. U.S. BANCORP, REGIONS, KEYCORP Minneapolis-based U.S. Bancorp said profit fell to $1.16 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $1.2 billion, or 66 cents. Revenue was up 1.5 percent to $3.51 billion, but expenses rose 7.2 percent as the bank spent more on investments and acquisitions. Analysts, on average, looked for profit of 67 cents per share on revenue of $3.48 billion. Chief Executive Richard Davis lamented that "we have not been immune" to the "challenging" economic environment for banks. On a conference call, he said "we simply needed to" invest more in existing businesses to boost future profitability. Fee income rose 6 percent to $1.86 billion, as double-digit gains from cards and merchant processing offset a 9 percent drop from mortgage banking. Credit losses rose 53 percent. Wells Fargo and U.S. Bancorp operate largely in the western two-thirds of the United States. Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions, which operates mainly in the U.S. Southeast and is the nation's ninth-largest bank, said quarterly profit rose to $453.3 million from $345.3 million. Profit per share fell to 63 cents from 75 cents as the number of shares increased. Excluding merger costs, profit was 69 cents per share, matching the average analyst expectation. Fees rose 48 percent despite a 14 percent drop in mortgage revenue, while loan losses doubled. KeyCorp, a Cleveland-based Midwest bank that also has many branches in the Northeast and Pacific Northwest, said net income rose to $334 million, or 84 cents per share, from $308 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit was 86 cents per share, topping the average Wall Street estimate by 16 cents. Fee income rose 19 percent, though bad loans more than doubled. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
