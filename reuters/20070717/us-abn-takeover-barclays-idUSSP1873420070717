 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Barclays ( BARC.L ) is planning to sweeten its offer for ABN AMRO AAH.AS after a consortium of rivals led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) revised its bid for the Dutch bank, the Financial Times said on Tuesday. 

 The RBS grouping, which includes Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR, on Monday raised the cash portion of its bid to 93 percent from 79 percent, valuing the bank at 71.1 billion euros. The offer of 38.4 euros per share is 10 percent above an all-share offer from Barclays of around 35 euros per share. Barclays could be looking at tactics such as issuing convertible bonds, or using the 12 billion euros in cash from the sale of LaSalle that it had previously earmarked for a share buyback, the Financial Times said, without giving sources. It said Barclays was thought unlikely to look at raising cash by selling some of ABN's businesses.
