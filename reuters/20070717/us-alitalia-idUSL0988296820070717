 ROME  (Reuters) - Rome is scrambling to prevent an embarrassing collapse of the sale of national carrier Alitalia as the unprofitable airline's only real suitor struggles to raise funds for a bid. 

 Less than a week before final offers are due, Italy's centre-left government can ill afford failure as it pursues fragile talks with unions on pension reforms, analysts say. Prime Minister Romano Prodi's government, whose popularity has slipped a year after coming to power, has already pushed back the deadline twice for final offers. The only contender showing signs of life in the auction -- small domestic carrier Air One -- continues to work on its bid. One senior European airline executive said last week that Rome, which holds 49.9 percent, could bring in banks to prop up the sale of Alitalia AZPIa.MI, worth about $1.5 billion by stock market value. But that would only defer the problem to later. "You see this all the time with state-owned airlines," said Frost & Sullivan aviation consultant Diogenis Papiomytis. "Bidders are interested in the beginning because Alitalia has a strong brand name and a good network, but once you see its books and how it's run -- you can't get away from the unions and the political interventionism. All of this can deter any bidder from going forward." Air One's bid is backed by Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ), Italy's top retail bank and the power behind a successful campaign to keep Telecom Italia ( TLIT.MI ) under Italian control this year. Intesa, whose chairman Giovanni Bazoli is a long-standing friend of Prodi, denied any political pressure in that deal. Now Air One -- whose annual revenues of just over 600 million euros barely match Alitalia's losses -- is in talks with banks Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ), Nomura ( 8604.T ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), a source familiar with the matter has said. Air One has declined to comment. Italy's leading business newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore said on Tuesday Air One was still waiting for the key sale contract from the Treasury -- which it said would be the base for an industrial plan and costing of the operation. NO SIGNS OF LIFE Technically, there are still two bidders left after seven months of the auction. U.S. buyout fund MatlinPatterson re-entered last month -- after Russian carrier Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ) pulled out. But few expect MatlinPatterson to make a final offer by the July 23 deadline. Even Italy's transport minister says he is skeptical. MatlinPatterson has declined to comment. Air One, which has just 33 percent of the domestic market, plans over 4,000 job cuts and wants unions to eschew strikes for three years, according to proposals seen by Reuters. But if the sale collapses, Alitalia's future could be in jeopardy. Alitalia says it can keep going for over a year, but it will soon need more cash after writing down its fleet in May and sinking deeper into the red. "We do not see Alitalia making a profit in any of the next three years," J.P. Morgan analysts said in a research note. "If no change in ownership occurs, this group will face a liquidity crisis in due course, in our view." In that event, a fresh injection of cash from Rome would anger the European Commission and rival airlines, but the government risks strikes and unpopular layoffs among the 20,000 strong workforce if it lets the airline go bust. Alitalia's long-time commercial partner Air France KLM ( AIRF.PA ) has said it has no interest in Alitalia unless it is turned around. That would take a drastic restructuring and a reining in of trade union power. Air France KLM's eyes were elsewhere this week nL17470370 as it said it was looking at Spanish airline Iberia IBLA.MC "among others". Last week a source close to Air France KLM told Reuters "It is too late" (for an Alitalia bid). La Stampa newspaper on Tuesday reported a source from the Franco-Dutch airline saying "... if Alitalia does not hurry, it risks being on the outside." nLA474757 Air France was not immediately available to comment on the report. "Alitalia is not exactly a beautiful wife that can find a wonderful prince," said Oliviero Baccelli at Bocconi University's transport economics research centre. "We're at the same point we were several months ago, perhaps much worse." (Additional reporting by  Tim Hepher  in Paris)
