 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York state's economic development agency needs a top-to-bottom overhaul starting with a name change, to refocus it on creating higher-paying jobs instead of fighting poverty, a role better handled by social service agencies, a new study said on Tuesday. 

 A.T. Kearney Inc., which the state hired to analyze the Empire State Development Corporation, said, "The fact that economic development is often funded by legislative appropriation rather than through products administered by the Empire State Development (Corporation) is a strong reminder that the state has lost confidence in the agency's ability to carry out its key mission." "(But) sidelined by more agile, entrepreneurial and scientifically trained competition, the state has been desperately trying to get back into the economic competitiveness race for over a decade," it added. "Almost everything about the historical Empire State Development needs to change, beginning with its name, which fails to leverage the state's most recognizable asset, the words 'New York,'" the A.T. Kearney study said, explaining that agency employees now must begin pitches by first explaining the term Empire State. New York's $960 billion economy makes it the world's 12th- biggest economy, when its gross state product, the broadest measure of its goods and services, is measured, the study said, citing a 2006 World Bank report. Though New York City in the past 15 years enjoyed extraordinary growth as a global financial hub, the upstate area instead mirrored the sorry pattern of other so-called Rust Belt states, whose industrial employers withered or moved. The number of manufacturing jobs in New York fell to 580,000 in 2005 from nearly double that, or 960,000 such positions in 1990, the study said. The state was only 39th in creating private-sector jobs between 1995 and 2005, it added. The Empire State Development Corporation preferred big projects and gauged its performance with "industrial age metrics," such as lower unemployment, the report said. Urging the state to focus on new sectors -- nanotechnology, bioscience and cleantech -- and linking upstate college professors with downstate entrepreneurs, the study also said the "endemic problems" in Empire Zones must be fixed. Saying tax incentive programs were "significantly compromised, the study noted employers got $465 million of tax abatements from Empire Zones in 2005, but $170 million went to businesses that follow growth, such as retail and construction, instead of ones that kick-start the economy.
