 AMSTERDAM/LONDON  (Reuters) - Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) is confident of winning the battle for Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS even after a rival consortium sweetened its bid with more cash, a senior Barclays executive said on Tuesday. 

 "We are confident the deal will succeed because it is based on growth," Frits Seegers, chief executive of Barclays' retail and commercial banking operations, said on the sidelines of a news conference in Amsterdam. Seegers said he had spoken to Barclays shareholders and they were content with Barclays' projected growth based on its all-share offer for ABN, currently worth 65 billion euros ($90 billion). Barclays is considering options that could include improving its bid for ABN, sources familiar with the matter said. The deadline for it to launch its offer is July 23. The consortium of Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR raised the cash portion of its bid to 93 percent from 79 percent, valuing ABN at 71.1 billion euros -- or 10 percent above the Barclays offer. A fund manager said he expected Barclays to pay more to win the deal, but he had sold a stake in the UK bank as a deal would be negative for its earnings prospects. "Our financial team's view is that this is a 'must buy' for Barclays," said Robin Geffen, chief investment officer and managing director at Neptune Investment Management. "Royal Bank of Scotland are more sensitive to shareholder requests and less likely to be seen to be overpaying," he said. Barclays could raise its offer or add cash to its payment, but it may face pressure from some investors who are also big shareholders in RBS and want to avoid the two banks getting into a bidding battle, analysts said. Several analysts said the consortium appeared favorite to win, however, as it can achieve higher synergies and therefore pay more. "Furthermore, we do not think Barclays has widespread shareholder support to enrich its offer," analysts at Sanford Bernstein said in a research note. Given how much Barclays had invested in the acquisition it was unlikely to withdraw until it "has explored all possible mechanisms to raise its offer", they added. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's moved its outlook on RBS to "negative" from "stable" on Tuesday, saying the revised consortium offer "represents a less compelling transaction than the original offer" for RBS. ABN shares edged 0.4 percent lower to close at 37 euros. The consortium's offer is worth 38.4 euros per ABN share, while an all-share offer from Barclays is currently worth about 35 euros per share. RBS and Fortis shares each dipped almost 2 percent, and Barclays added 0.5 percent, reflecting the prospect of the consortium winning, analysts said. Santander was up 0.4 percent. The increase in cash offered by the consortium follows a Dutch court ruling on Friday that allows ABN to sell its U.S. bank LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ) for $21 billion.
