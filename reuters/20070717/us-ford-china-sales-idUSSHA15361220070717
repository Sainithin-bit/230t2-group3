 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Ford Motor's ( F.N ) vehicle shipments are expected to rise as much as 30 percent this year, as the number two U.S. auto maker expands capacity to meet demand, an industry source said on Tuesday. 

 Ford is expected to ship 300,000 to 350,000 vehicles to dealers in the country this year, up from 260,000 to 270,000 units in 2006, the source said. Ford declined to comment on the matter. Ford, a relative newcomer to China, reported a 25 percent increase in retail vehicle sales in the first six months of the year, outperforming 22.26 percent growth in the overall market. The source, who asked not to be identified, attributed the expected strong growth largely to enlarged capacity at Changan Ford Mazda, its venture with Mazda Motor Corp. ( 7261.T ) and Changan Automobile Co. Ltd. ( 000625.SZ ), which was expanding to add new models and to keep up with demand for the Focus mid-range sedan. Shipments of the Focus surged 66 percent to 55,676 units in the first six months of the year, or nearly 60 percent of the venture's overall volume in the period. In the second half, the venture will roll out a new generation of the Mondeo and Mazda 2. Automakers are competing to introduce new models in China, the world's second-largest car market, to appeal to increasingly demanding consumers. By the end of this year, Ford plans to boost annual production capacity in China to 460,000 units, including 410,000 at Changan Ford Mazda and 50,000 at Jiangling Motors ( 000550.SZ ) 200550.SZ, in which it holds a 30 percent stake. Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ), which operates two car manufacturing ventures in China, has projected 20 percent growth in vehicle sales in China this year.
