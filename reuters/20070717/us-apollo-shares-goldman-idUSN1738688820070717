 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Apollo Management LP is planning a two-pronged approach to tap investors without ceding the advantages of being a private company, according to a news report on Tuesday. 

 Apollo plans to list its shares on the new, private Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) exchange, the Wall Street Journal said, after completion of separate deals to sell stakes to an investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government and likely another to the California Public Employees' Retirement System. Apollo, founded by former investment banker Leon Black, may take this route to bypass the scrutiny of being a public company. As it would in an initial public offering, Apollo will be able to raise permanent capital with its Goldman Sachs exchange listing, and give its founders a way to cash out, the report said. But it will not exactly go public, as rival private equity firm Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) and hedge fund Fortress Investment Group LLC ( FIG.N ) have done through listings on the New York Stock Exchange in recent months. By pursuing a private listing Apollo may get around disclosure requirements that are binding on companies listed on public exchanges because the Goldman exchange caters solely to institutional and other sophisticated investors. Goldman launched its GS Tradable Unregistered Equity OTC Market or "GS True" earlier this year as a platform for trading unregistered stock issued through private placements. The venture was announced at the same time as an $880 million capital raising for another private equity firm, Oaktree Capital Management. Apollo would be the second private equity firm to list on the Goldman market, after Oaktree. No one at the firm could immediately be reached for comment on the plans outlined in the Journal report.
