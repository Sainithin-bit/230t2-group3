 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KeyCorp ( KEY.N ), a large U.S. Midwest bank, on Tuesday said second-quarter profit rose 8 percent as an increase in fee income helped offset rising loan losses and declining lending margins. 

 Net income for the Cleveland-based company rose to $334 million, or 84 cents per share, from $308 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. Profit from continuing operations rose 11 percent to $337 million, or 85 cents per share. Excluding items, profit totaled 86 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, topping the average analyst forecast by 16 cents. KeyCorp shares rose more than 5 percent in early trading. "Fee income is contributing to banks with capital markets businesses, and that boosted results," said Mark Batty, an analyst at PNC Wealth Management in Philadelphia, which invests $75 billion. "(Also,) given the credit issues we've seen in the Midwest, credit quality was not as troublesome as one might have expected going in." Noninterest income rose 19 percent to $649 million, helped by gains from principal investing and a $40 million gain from the sale of MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ) shares. KeyCorp forecast second-half profit of $1.50 to $1.60 per share. Analysts on average forecast 72 cents for the third quarter and 74 cents for the fourth. On a conference call, Chief Executive Henry Meyer said he was pleased with results, amid "continued competitive pressures and the challenging interest rate environment." KeyCorp shares rose $1.65, or 4.7 percent, to $36.75 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after earlier rising to $36.95. MERGERS EYED Profit from continuing operations from community banking fell 3 percent to $97 million. In national banking, which includes such areas as construction loans, equipment finance, capital markets and asset management, profit from continuing operations fell 4 percent to $169 million. Noninterest expenses rose 2 percent to $815 million as a litigation charge offset lower personnel expenses. KeyCorp said it has reduced its work force by 913 people, or nearly 5 percent, since the end of March. Net interest income fell 3 percent to $706 million, hurt by a decline in net interest margin to 3.46 percent from 3.68 percent a year earlier. KeyCorp set aside $53 million for bad loans, up from $23 million a year ago, while net charge-offs rose to $53 million from $34 million. Last month, federal regulators lifted special oversight of the company's KeyBank unit, more than a year after finding shortcomings in its controls against money laundering. The regulatory decision freed KeyCorp to make acquisitions. "It's nice to be out from underneath the restraints," Meyer said. "We continue to look for add-on acquisitions for markets that we're in. It isn't like we're at the starting line of an auto race and we've got a green light and we're going to start spending money.... The market still seems very rich on the seller side." KeyCorp operates 954 branches, including many in the Pacific Northwest. It ended June with $94.1 billion of assets. Through Monday, KeyCorp shares had fallen 8 percent this year, compared with a 2 percent drop in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX.
