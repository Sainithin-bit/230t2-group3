 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Foreign media reports on China's food and drug safety problems have hurt exports even though they have been hyped up and domestic media should help by showing the "real situation", an official was quoted as saying on Tuesday. 

 Zhi Shuping, deputy head of the quality and supervision watchdog, also repeated the government line that problems with a few companies should not be taken to mean the system as a whole was riddled with loopholes. "Recently some media have pounced on the quality issues of some of our exports and greatly hyped it up," Zhi told a meeting of newspaper and magazine publishers, editors at reporters, the watchdog said on its Web site (www.aqsiq.gov.cn). "This has seriously harmed the reputation of Chinese products, been a huge impediment to Chinese exports and caused great losses," he said. Zhi reminded the domestic media -- already tightly controlled by the government -- that they must toe the Communist Party line in reporting quality problems, and that it was their job to put a positive spin on things. "Media workers must keep their political responsibilities firmly in mind, not bring shame upon their historical mission, carry out propaganda work on quality inspection well and escort and guide the "made in China" label," he said. The most important part of their "special historical mission" was the promotion of party and state policy, Zhu said. "As for the untrue words of some foreign media, our quality inspection media has a responsibility to uphold the principles of objectivity and impartiality, and reflect the real situation," he added. The deaths of patients in Panama from mislabeled drug ingredients from China, deadly toxins in pet food ingredients and food laced with additives and antibiotics have fanned public anxiety globally about the safety of China's surging exports. But China has been hitting back. At the weekend, China suspended pork and poultry from some U.S. suppliers after finding salmonella-contaminated chicken and meat products with growth agents or other additives. The bans, widely reported in the Chinese media, appeared to be Beijing's latest reminder that anxieties about product quality could also be directed at U.S. goods. Still, Chinese media have continued to report on poor quality food and even encouraged its readers to call in to report suspect goods. Beijing's quality authorities have found 120 meat products in the capital -- including a well-known sausage brand -- which breached standards for starch, bacteria, fat and protein and which could cause stomach upsets, the Beijing Times said. The same newspaper has set up an "exposure platform" on its Web site (www.beijingtimes.com.cn), outlining the latest stories, and a thread where readers can post their own experiences.
