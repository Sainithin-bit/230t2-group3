 LONDON/HONG KONG  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings Plc is to slash up to $3.5 billion in costs by cutting back in wealth management and retail banking. 

 Stuart Gulliver, the new CEO of Europe's biggest bank, outlined his plans on Wednesday. The bank will present its strategic plans in presentations lasting all day in London on Wednesday. Here are the highlights: COSTS: Plans to cut annual costs by $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion to cut expenses to 48-52 percent of revenues by 2013. The ratio rose to 55 percent last year, which Gulliver said was "unacceptable". Will be achieved through consistent business models in retail banking, wealth management and commercial banking and streamlining its business functions, processes and IT. PROFITABILITY: The bank aims to lift its return on equity to 12-15 percent, up from 9.5 percent last year and around 5 percent in the previous two years. Gulliver said it will take two to three years to reach its target. It is targeting a pretax return on risk weighted assets of 1.8 percent to 2.6 percent. UNITED STATES: The bank is conducting a strategic review of its credit card business in the United States. It could release $25 billion of capital if it sold the business, analysts at Barclays Capital had said before the statement. It is also reviewing parts of its U.S. branch network to better align it with group strategy and allocation of capital. RETAIL BANKING: Plans to limit retail banking to markets in which it can achieve profitable scale, it said. Its strategy is to concentrate on commercial and wholesale banking in globally connected markets. WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Will focus its wealth management business in 18 of the most relevant economies. It did not identify the 18 economies it would focus on. DIVIDENDS: Bank will target a payout ratio of 40-60 percent. LENDING: Will leverage its balance sheet and sees room to grow its loans to up to 90 percent of deposits, up from 79 percent. REGULATION: It estimates mitigating management actions can limit the hit on its capital ratios from Basel III rules to 120 basis points. (Compiled by Steve Slater; Editing by Erica Billingham)
