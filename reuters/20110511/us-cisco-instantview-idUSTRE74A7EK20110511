 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc beat Wall Street's quarterly results expectations with corporate spending on IT remaining resilient, helping its shares firm in after-hours trade. 

 Commentary: COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC PARTNERS "You have got to like the EPS number. There was a lot of concern that they wouldn't be able to expand margins. The key thing here is that we are past the low trough on the margin. Plus you have a new COO focused on controlling cost." "The pressure is off John (Chambers), for now. Look at the stock -- it is cranking after-hours." BRIAN MARSHALL, ANALYST, GLEACHER & CO "At face value, April results are good. "This relieves a bit of investor concern in the near term. While April results look decent relative to expectations, we've longer term issues the company needs to address." (Reporting by  Sinead Carew  in New York)
