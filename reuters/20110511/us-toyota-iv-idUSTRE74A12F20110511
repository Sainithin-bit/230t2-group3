 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp reported a 52 percent drop in quarterly operating profit as it suffered from supply disruptions as a result of the March 11 earthquake in Japan. The world's biggest automaker is facing another tough year ahead as a severe shortage of parts caused by Japan's biggest earthquake on record hammers production just as it was putting its recall woes behind it. 

 KEY POINTS -- January-March op profit down 51.6 pct year on year -- Profit forecast possible by mid-June -- Quake cuts op profit by 110 bln yen -- Says Japan, overseas output to increase in June COMMENTARY KOJI ENDO, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ADVANCED RESEARCH, TOKYO "While Toyota did not provide this financial year's forecast, we can see its business situation is worse than (headline) figures suggest from the previous year's results. "Toyota's operating profit was 468.2 billion yen for the year ended in March, but profit from its auto business was only 86 billion yen while financial business earned 358.2 billion yen. "The auto business profit was extremely small in proportion to its revenue. The impact of the disaster will be fully reflected in the current financial year, and Toyota cannot avoid it at least in first-half even if production returns to a normal level a bit faster. "In the last financial year, the effect of the production cost cutting came at only 180 billion yen and its product mix got worse and higher yen hurt profits. These conditions are likely to continue this financial year and the company still has a structural problem of too much domestic production capacity and low operation ratio." KOICHI OGAWA, CHIEF PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT DAIWA SB INVESTMENTS "The focus going ahead for Toyota is what they expect their forecast to be and right now it is very unclear, especially if they can only can operate at 50 percent capacity between April and June, which will make it hard for them to lift profits. "I expect (profits) to recover in the second half and to grow next year, but looking ahead, Toyota's production rate in Japan is high...and with energy and electricity costs in Japan expected to rise, I think it will be necessary for them to rethink their global production strategy in the mid-term." AHN YOUNG-HEE, FUND MANAGER AT KTB ASSET MANAGEMENT, SEOUL "I expect Japanese carmakers to recover after their production is normalized late this year as planned. There is no denying that Hyundai and Kia have improved their brand recognition in the U.S. market, as their Japanese rivals were struggling from the recall crisis. Not only the recall, but Japan's earthquake has benefited South Korean carmakers. But the quake effect will be temporary and Japanese carmakers will gain back market share." TSUYOSHI SEGAWA, EQUITY STRATEGIST AT MIZUHO SECURITIES "Toyota's figures in the fourth quarter were bad, but investors will probably focus on forward-looking factors such as its production plan. "Toyota's president saying that the company's production is expected to recover to 70 percent of its prequake plan in June is positive." YOSHIHIKO TABEI, CHIEF ANALYST AT KAZAKA SECURITIES "I would like to see why Toyota expects faster recovery in production than rivals. I don't think automakers can make changes in their products so easily. I don't expect the Prius to quickly lose market share because there is no rival model that can replace it. But Toyota is likely to lose market share in mass-market models like the Corolla. I think Toyota can regain its market share once its production fully recovers and inventory is rebuilt." BACKGROUND -- Toyota likely to fall behind General Motors Co and possibly Volkswagen AG to rank third in global vehicle sales this year. -- Toyota's shares have led a fall in Japanese auto stocks since the disaster, losing 11 percent compared with 9.9 percent at Honda and 5.8 percent at Nissan as of Tuesday's close.
