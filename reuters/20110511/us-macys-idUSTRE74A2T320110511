 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Macy's Inc ( M.N ) reported a much higher quarterly profit and expects a continued upswing in sales and profit for the rest of 2011 even as it raises prices, reflecting the improving fortunes of its core customers -- middle-class shoppers. 

 Macy's, which also doubled its quarterly dividend, saw shares jump as much as 9.7 percent on Wednesday to their highest level in more than three years. The strong first-quarter sales and forecast for the rest of the year show that rising consumer confidence and employment are prompting shoppers to loosen their purse strings. "There is a bit of middle-class tailwind," said Morningstar analyst Paul Swinand. "This bodes well, but less so, for the Sears shopper or the J.C. Penney shopper." Macy's is less exposed to price-sensitive shoppers than rivals Penney ( JCP.N ) and Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ), he said. Macy's sales at its stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 5.4 percent, outperforming most rivals, during the quarter. The company is benefiting from moves to offer more exclusive and regionally focused products, which command a higher profit per item and give the chain more pricing power. Macy's 2010 sales hit $25 billion, bringing them back up to pre-recession levels. HIGHER SALES AND PROFIT FORECASTS Industry observers have fretted that rising gasoline prices and cotton prices, which have begun to make clothing more expensive, will reignite shopper frugality. Those fears are "overstated," and Macy's tests of price increases have gone well, Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said during a conference call. Sales of private and exclusive brands were growing more quickly than those of brands available broadly, she added. Unlike Penney and Kohl's, Macy's also got help from luxury spending's comeback due to the Bloomingdale's chain, which contributes about 10 percent of sales. Kohl's same-store sales rose 1.3 percent in the first quarter, while Penney's increased 3.8 percent. At Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ), which caters to higher-end shoppers, same-store sales rose 6.5 percent. Kohl's and Nordstrom report results on Thursday, while Penney will report on Monday. Macy's expects its same-store sales to rise 4 percent for the rest of the year, leading to a 4.3 percent rise for the full year that would exceed the 3 percent forecast it gave at the start of 2011. As a result, the retailer raised its fiscal 2011 profit forecast by 15 cents per share and now expects to earn between $2.40 and $2.45, above Wall Street expectations of $2.35, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its shares were up 7.2 percent at $28.23 on Wednesday afternoon, off an earlier high at $28.88. Shares of Nordstrom were up 0.4 percent, Penney was down 0.2 percent and Kohl's was up 0.6 percent. SOARING PROFIT Macy's reported net income of $131 million, or 30 cents a share, for the quarter that ended on April 30, nearly six times higher than the $23 million, or 5 cents, it reported a year earlier. That easily topped the 18 cents Wall Street analysts on average were forecasting. Sales rose 5.7 percent to $5.9 billion. Gross margin, which reflects the profitability of the items Macy's sells, slid 0.3 percentage points to 39.1 percent as Macy's dealt with rising cotton costs. But the company has repeatedly said its clout with vendors was mitigating some of that risk. Inventory per square foot of retail space rose 2.8 percent from a year earlier, which Hoguet said showed Macy's is "controlling our inventory." Retailers have been careful since the recession not to build up too much inventory, lest they find themselves forced to slash prices if items do not sell. Macy's, which operates about 850 department stores under its own and the Bloomingdale's names, doubled its quarterly dividend to 10 cents per share.
