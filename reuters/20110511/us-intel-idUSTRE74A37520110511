 BANGALORE/SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) raised its dividend for the third quarter by 16 percent as the world's largest chipmaker, whose slow progress in the red-hot mobile business has worried investors, tries to boost its stock. 

 Wall Street has been expecting a rebound in dividend payments this year, as companies that have been sitting on cash decide to reward shareholders as the economy improves. "There's no doubt this is an action to shore up the stock. This makes the stock much more attractive," Gleacher & Co analyst Doug Freedman said. "By increasing the dividend yield, they are raising the floor on the stock." Intel shares have gained just 9 percent in the last six months, lagging the 16 percent rise in the broader Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX. The shares are something of a bargain, as they trade at a lowly valuation of 10 times forward 12-month earnings, analysts said. Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) trades at roughly 17 times forward 12-month earnings, Nvidia Corp ( NVDA.O ) at 18 times, while Texas Instruments TXN.N and Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ) trade at 14 times, respectively. Intel declared a cash dividend of 21 cents, up from its earlier dividend of 18.1 cents -- its second increase in six months. It had raised its dividend by 15 percent last November. This year Intel will pay a little over $4 billion as dividend, higher than the $3.5 billion it paid in 2010. Qualcomm raised its quarterly dividend 13 percent in March. "I think Intel is putting their money where their mouth is," Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann said. Assuming the company does not need to make another big acquisition in the next two years, and given they are sitting on a big cash pile, the dividend raise is a very efficient way to use incremental cash, Mosesmann said. Intel has $22.8 billion in current assets, of which $4.19 billion is in cash and cash equivalents, according to a regulatory filing on April 2. "Worldwide demand for computing continues to increase at a very rapid rate, putting Intel on track for revenue growth of over 20 percent this year," Chief Executive Paul Otellini said in a statement. However, Roth Capital Partners analyst Arnab Chanda expressed concerns about Intel's lack of success in the mobile business and competitive pressures. "For me, the key concerns are a lack of success in mobile and potential loss of share in their core PC business," he said. "Increasing the dividend doesn't really change any of those things." Microsoft's ( MSFT.O ) recent move to make its Windows software compatible with chips designed by ARM ( ARM.L ) throws open computer markets previously dominated by Intel. Intel shares were up 32 cents at $23.35 in afternoon trade on Wednesday on Nasdaq.
