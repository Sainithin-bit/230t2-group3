 Feb 14 (Reuters) - The Group of Seven industrialised nations softened its tone on China's yuan in a statement after its meeting in Rome on Saturday but as expected did not single out moves in other currencies, like the yen or pound. 

 Following are comments from officials and the text concerning exchange rates from the joint statements by the G7 on Saturday and at its last meeting in October. FEBRUARY 14 STATEMENT "We welcome China's fiscal measures and continued commitment to move to a more flexible exchange rate, which should lead to continued appreciation of the Renminbi (yuan) in effective terms and help promote more balanced growth in China and in the world economy. "Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We continue to monitor exchange rate markets closely, and cooperate as appropriate." OCTOBER STATEMENT "We reaffirm our shared interest in a strong and stable international financial system. Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. "We continue to monitor exchange rate markets closely and  cooperate as appropriate. "Given China's important role in the global economy we encourage the authorities to allow accelerated appreciation of the RMB effective exchange rate as a means of further rebalancing of the domestic economy and promoting external stability." U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY TIMOTHY GEITHNER "It's very important to point out and emphasize that with China it's going to be very important to stimulise the world economy and financial system today. We very much welcome the steps they've taken to strengthen domestic demand and we welcome their commitment to further evolution of their exchange rate system. I just want to underscore that. And I think you see a nice carefully crafted sentence in the communique and the United States is very much committed to working closely and cooperatively with China as we move together to try to address this global economic crisis." A SENIOR U.S. TREASURY OFFICIAL Asked if he was confident that the long-range value of the dollar would remain stable through the efforts, the official, speaking on condition anonymity, said: "Absolutely. and I think again, like in many areas now, Americans and people around the world will be more confident in this country if they see us moving to deal with these things, candidly, openly." BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER ALISTAIR DARLING Asked if there was any discussion of sterling: "No, on the latter questions." JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER SHOICHI NAKAGAWA "I'd like everyone to think about the significance of the fact that G7 nations wrote down in their communique they will work together to combat any excessive exchange rate moves." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER "Foreign exchange markets are very volatile. We reaffirm our shared interest in a strong, stable international financial system. Excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability." FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER CHRISTINE LAGARDE "You will have noted that on exchange rates we took roughly the same language as usual." "You will also have noticed that there is a paragraph on China and our interest in seeing China undertakes (steps) regarding its internal market to support demand by a pick up of its internal market."
