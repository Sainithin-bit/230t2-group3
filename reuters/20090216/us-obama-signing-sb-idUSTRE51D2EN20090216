 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will sign the $787 billion economic stimulus bill on Tuesday in Denver, a White House official said on Saturday. 

 Obama on Saturday hailed congressional approval of the stimulus bill as a "major milestone on our road to recovery" and vowed to move swiftly to set the plan in motion. "I will sign this legislation into law shortly, and we'll begin making the immediate investments necessary to put people back to work," Obama said in his weekly radio address from Chicago after his biggest legislative victory since taking office on January 20. The Senate cast the final vote, 60-38, late on Friday, hours after the House of Representatives passed an identical bill, 246-183, capping weeks of arguing over how to best jolt the economy out of deep recession.
