 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Sweden is confident General Motors Corp will not leave its Swedish carmaker Saab unprotected under the terms of a restructuring plan it will submit to the U.S. government, a senior government official said on Monday. 

 Joran Hagglund, state secretary of the Swedish Industry Ministry, said he did not expect GM's restructuring plan, which it must submit by Tuesday in exchange for billions of dollars in federal loans, to include a proposal for Saab and other non-core assets to be liquidated or sold under protection of a bankruptcy court. The Wall Street Journal said its Saturday edition that the GM was considering that option as part of a possible Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing that would create a new company, citing people familiar with the matter. "Now I don't think this is a likely scenario tomorrow. But if that is the case, it will be a process where they work out which parts they will keep and which they will not keep," Hagglund said in an interview with Reuters. GM has already said it wants to sell loss-making Saab, and Sweden's center-right government is in talks with the carmaker about giving the unit state support instead. Hagglund dismissed a report from public service broadcaster SVT at the weekend that negotiations had broken down. "It is of course the case that GM has a fair bit on its hands back home, which affects how much time and effort they can put into this," he said of the talks. "But we are continuing the discussions and we will have to see how they formulate the plan that they are to present tomorrow." The Swedish government said in December that it would provide its ailing auto industry, which also includes Ford-owned Volvo, with up to 25 billion crowns ($2.94 billion) in credit guarantees and emergency loans. Ford has not applied for U.S. government funds. Hagglund said the plans being readied by GM ahead of the Tuesday deadline were likely to include statements on how the group would manage overseas operations such as Saab, but that this did not mean negotiations needed to be concluded by then. The state secretary repeated that the Swedish state would not become the owner of any car company. ($1=8.496 Swedish Crown) (Writing by  Niklas Pollard ; editing by Karen Foster)
