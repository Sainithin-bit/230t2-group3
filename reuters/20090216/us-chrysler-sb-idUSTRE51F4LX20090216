 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC and the United Auto Workers have made progress in talks aimed at cutting debt and operating costs ahead of a Tuesday deadline for the automaker to submit a new viability plan, a person briefed on the negotiations said. 

 Like its larger rival General Motors Corp, Chrysler faces a deadline of Tuesday to tender a revised restructuring plan to U.S. officials. Chrysler, which is controlled by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, has been given $4 billion in emergency federal aid and is seeking an additional $3 billion. Talks between the UAW and Chrysler stalled over the weekend but had picked up momentum by Monday, the person briefed on the talks said. The signs of progress in the negotiations at Chrysler come after people briefed on GM's talks said that automaker had also been making progress in its talks with the union.
