 BARCELONA  (Reuters) - Global number two mobile phone maker Samsung launched five new phones on Monday including a model made from recycled plastic with a solar panel on the back for charging. 

 Samsung said in a statement its "Blue Earth" solar-powered model had a touch screen and was made from plastic taken from used water bottles. It did not give pricing information or say when the phone would go on sale. Samsung also launched two phones with 8-megapixel cameras, the Ultratouch and OmniaHD, and two music phones, the BeatDJ and BeatDisc. (Reporting by  Brett Young )
