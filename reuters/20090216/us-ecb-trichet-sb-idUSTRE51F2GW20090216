 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank has to prepare for exceptional situations and does not rule out further action to support the euro-zone economy, ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet was quoted on Monday as saying. 

 In an interview with China Finance, Trichet said the ECB had already expanded its balance sheet in the wake of the financial market crisis. The ECB has cut rates by 225 basis points to 2 percent since last October and announced a range of measures to boost liquidity flows. It is expected to cut rates further in March. "Experience has demonstrated that we have to prepare for exceptional situations, and I would not exclude anything, and equally I will not pre-commit to anything ex ante," Trichet said. "We'll always look at the situation on the basis of our own analysis, taking everything into account." (Reporting by  Krista Hughes ; Editing by Victoria Main)
