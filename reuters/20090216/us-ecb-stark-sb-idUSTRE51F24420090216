 FRANKFURT/ATHENS  (Reuters) - Cutting interest rates aggressively now could damage the economic situation rather than improve it, European Central Bank Executive Board member Juergen Stark was quoted on Monday as saying. 

 "Overly aggressive reductions in our policy rate when we cannot see any risk of deflation would exacerbate and not resolve uncertainty," Stark said in an interview with the Financial Times newspaper. "Gradualism has remained a critical aspect of our monetary policy." In the last few months, the ECB has undertaken the most aggressive series of interest rate cuts since its formation. Since October it has brought rates down to 2.0 percent from 4.25 percent as it, like the rest of the world's central banks, battles the economic crisis. ECB Governing Council member George Provopoulos spelt out just how bad the current situation is, describing it as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s. "The outlook for the global and the euro area economy in 2009 appears dismal," he said as the Bank of Greece released its latest monetary policy report. "The current crisis is the biggest since the 1930s and exiting from it will not be easy or quick. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet told the European parliamentarians the current situation remained extremely difficult, but warned that policymakers must avoid sowing the seeds of future crises. "Our primary and most immediate task as policymakers is to help resolve this crisis, in cooperation with the private sector," he said. "We also need to make sure that our decisions today do not lay the ground for similar disorder in the future." Stark warned that a price stability-orientated central bank that acted only in response to fear risked losing credibility. But he also acknowledged that the ECB had to make optimal use of interest rate cuts. "Yes, use the room for maneuver that is still available but not in a way that would put our reputation at risk," he was quoted as saying. Asked whether the door was open for another significant interest rate cut on March 5, as analysts expect, Stark responded: "I will not exclude anything. However, it is also clear that a potential move, independently of its size, will reduce the room for maneuver in the future." He was also cautious on whether the ECB would use more alternative monetary policy tools such as direct asset purchases -- a tactic already being employed by the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. "Some of the key measures adopted and applied by the Fed are based on Treasury guarantees so there is no or limited risk for the Fed. It is not feasible in my view to expect the ECB to do the same without government guarantees," Stark said. RATE ROOM The ECB is expected to cut euro area interest rates to a record low of 1.5 next month. But this would still leave rates above countries such as Britain, the United States and Switzerland where policymakers have responded to the global financial crisis by slashing rates harder and faster. Stark said he remained wary about cutting rates to the bone. "I would not call it dangerous. I would say it is not to be recommended and not advisable or desirable," he said. "Those who advise us to go to zero and then experiment at the zero level are not those who are responsible for the possible consequences." The former Bundesbank Vice President listed a string of reasons against zero rates, arguing that deflation was not on the cards, there was no knowing how financial markets would react to such low rates and that history showed that keeping rates that low created knock-on problems. It may also give banks little incentive to make vital changes, he added. FORECAST REVIEW Despite the ECB's apparent reluctance to cut rates down zero, analysts are wondering whether the bank can hold off if the economy continues to nosedive. The euro zone suffered its worst ever quarter at the end of 2008 and ECB staff are expected to follow the  International Monetary Fund and European Commission and slash economic forecasts when updated numbers are published next month. Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, a colleague of Stark's on the ECB's Executive Board, told an Austrian newspaper that the ECB was in the process of reviewing the figures. "We are revising our (GDP) forecasts for 2009 and 2010. In December we were still acting on the assumption of minus 0.5 percent for the euro zone. For 2010, growth of 1 percent was assumed. But since then a lot of things have changed," she told Austrian daily Wirtschaftsblatt. Tumpel-Gugerell added that recent interest rate cuts had made an impact on the economy. "We have cut interest rates four times since October 2008. This has had a positive effect," she said, adding that the interbank market and borrowers had benefited from the rate cuts.
