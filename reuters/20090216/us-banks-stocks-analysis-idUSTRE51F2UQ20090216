 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bruised European bank stocks may have to wait five years to regain some of their poise, with asset disposals and a heavy government hand set to weigh on the sector even after the global economy turns around. 

 Shareholders traditionally bet that stocks that have fallen the most in a downturn will be the biggest gainers when markets start going the other way, but banks look set to be an exception. The DJ STOXX European banking index .SX7P lost nearly 65 percent last year, punctured by the credit market crisis; a 15 percent loss so far this year would suggest that investors are worrying now that recession will take its toll. "I think the sector will never get the old valuations again. Even when there is an upturn there will be many more hurdles for the banks to jump," said Philippe Gijsels, strategist at Fortis Bank in Brussels, adding that he expected banks to trade at 8-10 times earnings for quite a while. "It remains to be seen how profitable they are without the sexy parts of the business, and the fact that governments, who have bailed them out, are going to put more pressure on them." Banks now trade at 6.7 times next year's estimated earnings, a discount of 28 percent to the broader market, wider than last summer but still some distance from the 40 percent levels seen in the fallout in 1990s of the earlier savings and loan crisis. Another key metric for banks is the price-to-book ratio, which is at near cycle trough levels of 0.5, according to Thomson Reuters data. Analysts say price to book is typically 2. "We might get back to 1 in about five years' time," said Mark Bon, fund manager at Canada Life. Banks likeliest to rebound are those with stronger balance sheets and good quality loan books. SOME BANKS MORE FANCIED "We like BNP ( BNPP.PA ), SocGen ( SOGN.PA ), Intesa SanPaolo ( ISP.MI ), UBS ( UBSN.VX ), KBC ( KBC.BR ), mainly for the high quality of their loan books and banking style for the last five years, and in the case of UBS, the fact that they were quick to ringfence their problems," said Bon. Santander ( SAN.MC ), BNP and SocGen outperformed the STOXX 600's 65 percent fall last year, and British bank HSBC ( HSBA.L ) fell just 21 percent. Nomura said in a note that only 14 stocks accounted for 80 percent of the European banks index, and that it had a "buy" on three: BNP, Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ). "We highlight the strong differentiation of stocks across the sector, with new NPLs (non-performing loans) being above 40 percent of tangible equity for many Spanish banks compared with under 5 percent (at the nine-month stage) for some of the banks in Switzerland, France and Scandinavia," it said. Over the past year, governments across the world have bailed out financial institutions pushed to the brink of collapse by investments in debt linked to risky U.S. mortgages and a freeze in credit markets. Britain last month launched a second bank rescue plan under which the Bank of England would set up an asset purchase program to buy private sector assets with an initial fund of 50 billion pounds. Franco-Belgian bank Dexia ( DEXI.BR ) and peer Fortis FOR.BR have both recently been bailed out by governments. "Governments have lent banks a lot of money, which will have to be paid back over the next 5-10 years -- they will have to come before the shareholders and dividends will be restricted for quite a long time," said Canada Life's Bon. SELLING ASSETS The crisis has also driven banks to sell assets that made them plenty of money in the good times, and speculation is rife about where the next deal will come from. Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) sold its 4.26 percent stake in Bank of China ( 3988.HK ) for 1.6 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) in January, a clear sign that it was scaling back its overseas ambitions. UBS said earlier this month that it had decided to hang on to its U.S. wealth management arm. Sources have said that it has spoken with Wells Fargo's ( WFC.N ) Wachovia Securities about forming a joint venture for North American wealth management and has also spoken to JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) about a sale. A changed business model will also weigh on profits. "Banks will be restricted on lending to hedge funds and leveraged buyouts, will be forced into corporate lending and lending to good customers, so interest margins will be lower and they won't be able to get much loan growth," said Bon. One of the proposals to help minimize future risks is dynamic provisioning, which requires banks to build up reserves during good times according to a formula calibrated on loan growth and the rate of losses experienced in the past. "Countercyclical provisioning would provide a buffer and be to everyone's advantage, but it does impair the potential for a quick recovery," said Bon. For now, though, many analysts are not looking as far as a recovery: Panmure's Sandy Chen said that banks faced significant further losses as the macro economy deteriorated, and those losses may continue far longer, into next year and even 2011.
