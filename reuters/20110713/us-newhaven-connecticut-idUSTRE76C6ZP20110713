 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The ratings outlook for Connecticut's New Haven was revised to negative from stable, partly because the "already slim" balance in the city's general fund could shrink further, Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday. 

 "The city's already low level of reserves, below average demographic profile and high debt burden leave little flexibility for further weakening of its reserve position within the current rating category," Moody's said in a statement. The term general fund typically excludes federal aid and some fees. New Haven is perhaps best known as the home of Yale University. The Ivy League school generates "important economic benefits," along with some industries, though the university students tend to have a "weak credit profile," Moody's said in a statement. "While Yale and the Yale-New Haven Hospital have mitigated the impact of the recession, the downturn in New Haven has been deep and unemployment remains high, at 13.3 percent as of April 2011 compared to the state at 8.9 percent," Moody's said.
