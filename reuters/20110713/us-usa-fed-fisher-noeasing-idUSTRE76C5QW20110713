 DALLAS  (Reuters) - A top U.S. Federal Reserve official who opposed the central bank's most recent round of stimulus said on Wednesday he will not support any further monetary policy easing, even if the economy worsens. 

 "I will not support further monetary accommodation," Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher told reporters after a speech at the Rotary Club of Dallas. "I do not personally see the benefit of more monetary accommodation even if the economy weakens further. Because again, there's so much liquidity out there, what's the trigger to put it to work?" Chairman Ben Bernanke said earlier on Wednesday that more easing may be needed if the economy continues to weaken. Fisher is a voter this year on the Fed's policy-setting panel.
