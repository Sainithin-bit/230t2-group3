 WORCESTER, Massachusetts  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve must keep monetary policy loose enough to help the jobs market, especially in an environment in which government spending is "unusually weak" for a recovery, a top Fed official said on Wednesday. 

 Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, described Friday's monthly jobs report from the Labor Department -- which showed the economy created a much less than expected 18,000 jobs in June -- as "dismal". With that backdrop, there is little pressure on employers to raise wages, he said, which suggests a continued low inflation rate over the medium term. Coupled with the fact that commodity prices have stabilized after their rapid rise earlier this year, the Fed has "leeway" to keep interest rates low, he said. The Fed cut interest rates to near zero in 2008 and has since completed two rounds of quantitative easing to further loosen financial conditions. "With fiscal austerity slowing down economies both here and abroad, it will in my view be important to maintain sufficiently accommodative monetary policy so that national labor market conditions can improve," Rosengren, who is not a voter on the Fed's policy committee this year, told a forum in Worcester, Massachusetts. Rosengren is one of the central bank's more dovish officials on inflation. President Barack Obama and congressional leaders are struggling to agree on a deal to lift the debt ceiling and cut future deficits by August 2, when the Treasury says it will run out of money to pay the country's bills. In Europe, investors fear a Greek sovereign default could ripple through Europe's banking system, putting pressure on stretched public finances in other euro zone countries. On Tuesday, ratings agency Moody's cut Ireland's credit rating to "junk". Rosengren said the situation in Europe is a reminder of the "significant downside risks" facing even his forecast for only a "very slow improvement in the economy." Rosengren said he would not describe the first half of the year as a "slow patch", but rather as continuation of the weak recovery from recession, in which the last quarter of last year was the only one that saw stronger growth. "The only quarter of strong economic growth so far in this recovery has been the one containing the holiday season at the end of last year," he said. He does expect a pick-up in the second half though, with growth ranging between 3 and 3.5 percent. "With housing activity and government spending likely to continue to be unusually weak for a recovery, we need to see consumer and business confidence improve so that consumption and investment can offset the weaker growth in other components of gross domestic product," he said.
