 LONDON  (Reuters) - News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks was warned by police in 2002 about serious malpractice and possible illegal activities by reporters at a newspaper she edited, former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Wednesday. 

 His allegations could increase pressure on Brooks, one of media mogul Rupert Murdoch's closest confidantes and who has so far insisted she knew nothing of alleged illegal practices at the paper, to resign. Brooks has so far survived a scandal at News International that last week prompted the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World paper she once edited and on Wednesday forced Murdoch to abandon his multi-billion dollar deal for pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB. Last week, Brooks insisted she had no idea an investigator working for News of the World hacked into the voicemail of a missing 13-year-old girl, later found murdered. She was editor of the paper at the time. Commentators have expressed disbelief that she could have known nothing about corrupt practices at the paper and called repeatedly for her resignation but News Corp head Murdoch has stood defiantly by Brooks. "As early as 2002 senior police officers at Scotland Yard met the now chief executive of News International and informed her of serious malpractice on the part of her newspaper staff and criminals undertaking surveillance on their behalf," Brown told parliament on Wednesday. The Guardian newspaper reported last week that when Brooks was News of the World editor she was told by police that one of her most senior journalists agreed to use photographers and vans leased to the paper to run surveillance on behalf of two private investigators suspected of murdering their former partner. News International said it had no immediate comment. WARNINGS The Guardian also reiterated on Wednesday that it warned Prime Minister David Cameron about possible links between his former head of communications and a phone-hacking scandal, but said it did so through political advisers and politicians. Cameron last week rebutted suggestions he had any specific warnings from anyone about hiring Andy Coulson, Brooks' successor at News of the World, who has been accused of sanctioning illegal payments to police and the accessing of voicemail messages. The scandal has caused furor in parliament, where senior politicians are accused of having been too close to Murdoch's media empire. Cameron and Brown both attended Brooks' wedding reception. "The prime minister's account of why he failed to act on the information we passed his office in February 2010 is highly misleading," Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger, whose paper has led coverage of the phone-hacking scandal, said in a statement. The Guardian said its deputy editor telephoned Cameron's senior adviser in February last year and gave him background details about an investigator, whom it said paid police bribes and obtained information improperly, and who worked at the paper under Coulson. Cameron said on Wednesday the information was not passed on to him. The Guardian also repeated that the information to Liberal Democrat Party leader, Nick Clegg, and former party leader Paddy Ashdown, and said Ashdown had confirmed that he sent a warning to Downing Street in May 2010.
