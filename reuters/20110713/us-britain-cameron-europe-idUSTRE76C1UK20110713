 LONDON  (Reuters) - Euro zone countries must step up their joint efforts to resolve the sovereign debt crisis and to stop being at the mercy of the markets, British Prime Minister David Cameron said on Wednesday. 

 "Euro zone countries in my view have to recognize that they have got to do more together and faster, they have got to get ahead of the market rather than responding to the next crisis," Cameron told parliament. (Created by Peter Griffiths)
