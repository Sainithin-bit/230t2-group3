 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Greece's fiscal adjustment program needs to be reinforced to ensure the country returns to sustainable public finances, a report by the European Commission showed on Wednesday. 

 The report by economic officials at the European Union's executive singles out Greece from among the three countries receiving financial aid as the one having struggled with fiscal adjustment -- in part because of its heavy debts. "While Greece has also delivered a notable fiscal adjustment to date, the overall progress is more complex in light of the debt level and the political context," officials write in the quarterly report assessing the euro area. "Reinforcement of the program is therefore needed to ensure Greece's return to a sustainable trajectory of public finances," they add. "Fiscal and broader structural reforms must continue to be pursued vigorously in all three countries," the officials write, referring to Greece, Portugal and Ireland. "This should allow further reductions in government deficits." They also predict that euro zone growth will be slow although they reiterate that economic recovery in the single currency area remains on track. "Growth in the coming quarters is expected to not accelerate much and is bound to be uneven due to divergent adjustment needs to member states."
