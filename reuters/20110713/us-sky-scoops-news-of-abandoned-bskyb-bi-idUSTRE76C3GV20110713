 LONDON  (Reuters) - The news that News Corp is withdrawing its bid to buy the rest of BSkyB broke on Sky News, BSkyB's news station, nearly 10 minutes before a statement was released through official channels. 

 A spokesman for the Financial Services Authority, the regulator that oversees compliance in the City, declined to say whether the broadcaster had broken any rules by reporting on the group's business before News Corp told the stock market. Companies and their advisers are obliged by stock market rules to keep price-sensitive information confidential. If news breaks, companies are required to issue a statement as soon as possible. Shares in BSkyB extended losses after the news broke, and were down 3.5 percent by 1316 GMT. They had recovered much of the losses and were trading 1.1 percent lower at 1413 GMT.
