 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Prime Minister David Cameron told parliament on Wednesday an inquiry into phone hacking allegations at Rupert Murdoch's News Corp would call witnesses under oath and the initial part of the probe would report within one year. 

 He appointed Lord Justice Brian Leveson to head the inquiry, and said that anyone involved in the phone hacking scandal at News International, the UK newspaper arm of News Corp, should play no part in UK media again, no matter how high in the organization they were. (Writing by  Olesya Dmitracova )
