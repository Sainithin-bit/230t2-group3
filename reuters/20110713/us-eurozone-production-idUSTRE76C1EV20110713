 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone industrial output rose by far less than expected in May, data showed, appearing to confirm the economy went through a soft patch in the second quarter with declines in production of consumer goods. Industrial production, a key component of gross domestic product (GDP), rose 0.1 percent month-on-month for a 4.0 percent year-on-year gain in the 17 countries using the euro, the European Union's statistics office, Eurostat, said on Wednesday. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.5 percent monthly rise and a 4.8 percent annual increase. The rise in output was driven by a 0.9 percent rise in energy output from April and a 0.6 percent increase for capital goods. However, durable and non-durable goods production fell by 0.5 and 0.4 percent respectively from the previous month. Output of intermediate goods such as steel was down 0.1 percent. Of the 14 euro zone countries for which details were supplied, industrial production increased in 11, including the first rise in five months in Greece, and fell in three -- Estonia, Italy and Malta. Economists expect GDP to slow after a 0.8 percent expansion in the first three months of 2011. Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics said industrial surveys suggested the slowdown was spreading from the periphery to the core of the single currency bloc, not helped by the high level of the euro. "Given this and the fact that tight fiscal policy will keep domestic spending subdued, the recovery in the wider euro zone economy may soon grind to a near halt," she said. ING economist Philippe Ledent said Wednesday's modest figures had come as no surprise. "We will probably have quite neutral numbers for June and the coming months. As long as it is not a strong decrease it's just the confirmation of a soft patch and nothing more," he said. Eurostat will release a first estimate for euro zone economic growth on August 16.
