 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp media empire has become so powerful that regulators should reduce its influence and prevent it from taking over British pay-TV operator BSkyB, Russian tycoon Alexander Lebedev said on Tuesday. 

 "I don't think it should be that big because then it has too much influence and too much money," Lebedev, the Russian former spy who now owns British newspapers including the Independent and London's Evening Standard, which have been critical of Murdoch since the scandal broke. "I don't think he needs more," Lebedev said when asked by Reuters if Murdoch's News Corp should be allowed to bid for the 61 percent of BSkyB it does not already own. "I don't see the point, I think it is contrary to the public interest - that is what I think." Murdoch was fighting to contain the crisis engulfing his media empire on Tuesday after allegations surfaced that journalists at several of his News Corp papers had targeted former British prime minister Gordon Brown. "I don't think mankind gains anything from living under huge financial or media empires: they start to rule the world, they become stronger than the regulators," Lebedev said, adding regulators should make "more Murdochs." When asked if that meant Murdoch's media empire should be split up he said: "Limiting its influence in the British media, limiting and reducing." When asked if Lebedev would be interested in buying any of Murdoch's publications if they came up for sale, he said: "No." He added that the number of hacking cases in News Corp publications indicated that it would be hard to believe that people at the top of the company did not know what was going on. "The magnitude of the operation is so big that one would have doubts that people at the top knew nothing about it. It has been going on for years," Lebedev said. COURTING POLITICIANS When asked if he thought Murdoch knew, he said: "Hopefully he did not know." When asked if he thought Rebekah Brooks, who runs News Corp's British newspaper arm News International knew, he said: "possibly." On whether his own journalists hack phones, he said: "I don't think they do." Murdoch has moved quickly in recent days to try to draw the sting from the rapidly escalating scandal, first closing the 168-year-old tabloid at the heart of the problem and then referring the takeover deal to a lengthy commission inquiry. "He is an interesting combination of a very talented individual who did a lot to support the freedom of press, but somehow probably contrary to what he wished, he gained a lot of power and influence and money," Lebedev said. "Becoming that influential he automatically attracted a lot of politicians courting him -- it is not necessarily that he courted them. So actually who is more responsible in Britain for this cohesion between the politicians and Murdoch?" Russia's leading television channels are all dominated by the state and fete both President Dmitry Medvedev and his mentor, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, though Moscow's small circulation daily newspapers and vibrant blogosphere frequently lampoon Russia's leaders and uncover allegations of official corruption. But their reach is limited. Lebedev, who has fought for media freedoms in Russia, cautioned that Britain should be careful to ensure reporters were allowed to continue proper investigative journalism. "Do not throw the baby out with the bathwater," said Lebedev. "Tabloids do have a part to play in society." (Editing by  Alison Williams )
