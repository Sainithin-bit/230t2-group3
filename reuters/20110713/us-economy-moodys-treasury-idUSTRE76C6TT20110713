 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Moody's Investor Service's warning that the U.S. risks losing its top-notch credit rating is a "timely reminder" of the need for congressional action to avoid a debt default, a Treasury Department official said on Wednesday. 

 "Moody's assessment is a timely reminder of the need for Congress to move quickly to avoid defaulting on the country's obligations and agree upon a substantial deficit reduction package," Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Jeffrey Goldstein said in a statement.
