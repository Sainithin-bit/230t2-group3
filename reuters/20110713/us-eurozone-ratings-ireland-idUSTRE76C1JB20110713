 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union's executive criticized the downgrading of Ireland's credit rating by Moody's, calling it "incomprehensible" and the timing of its announcement "questionable." 

 "Yesterday's decision by Moody's to downgrade Ireland's credit rating is, in the president's view, incomprehensible and, in the Commission's view, its timing, as the second quarterly review mission is preparing to announce its findings, is, to say the least, questionable," a spokeswoman for the president of the Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, told journalists.
