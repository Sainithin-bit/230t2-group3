 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O has reached an agreement with The9 Ltd. ( NCTY.O ) to buy a 19 percent stake in the Chinese online game operator for about $200 million, a local newspaper said on Saturday. 

 EA, the world's top video game publisher, and The9 have reached a basic agreement, Shanghai Securities News reported. A representative from The9 was not immediately available for comment. Shanghai-based The9 also obtained the exclusive right to run EA's casual game FIFA Online in China at the end of March, the newspaper added. A deal would potentially give The9 -- which offers Blizzard Entertainment's wildly popular "World of Warcraft" online game in China -- rights to run more sports-themed casual games from EA, the paper quoted industry insiders as saying. Meanwhile, a deal would grant EA an indirect way into China's online game market indirectly, the paper added.
