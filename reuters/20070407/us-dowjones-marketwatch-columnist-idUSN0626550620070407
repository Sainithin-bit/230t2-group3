 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A MarketWatch technology columnist is leaving the news service after media reports raised questions about her investment in a technology start-up, parent company Dow Jones & Co. Inc. said on Friday. 

 Bambi Francisco, a veteran reporter covering the Silicon Valley Internet scene since the late 1990s, has resigned from the online financial news service, effective immediately, a Dow Jones spokeswoman said. The followed reports this week that she wrote about several companies involved with a start-up called Vator.tv, a company that she has a stake in. "Dow Jones demands the highest journalism standards at our own publications and services, as reflected by our strict code of conduct," Dow Jones Executive Vice President and Wall Street Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz said in a statement. Francisco "started Vator.tv on her own time with our approval, under certain guidelines on permitted areas of coverage," he said. "Bambi has decided to pursue her enterprise full time." The Dow Jones spokeswoman described the resignation as a mutual decision between Francisco and Dow Jones. Francisco was one of the earliest mainstream journalists to embrace video blogging, posting interviews with up-and-coming start-ups along with written interviews she with the companies. Last September her bosses had allowed Francisco to take a stake in start-up technology company Vator.tv, technology news site CNET's News.com reported on Thursday. MarketWatch editor David Callaway said she was not allowed to write about companies that make pitches through Vator, which matches up other small companies with venture capitalists by showcasing their Web videos, News.com reported. Francisco wrote about several companies in MarketWatch or on her unaffiliated blog that had posted, or later posted, videos on Vator, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. Dow Jones forbids its employees from investing in companies that they write about. Some of those companies were involved with Peter Thiel, co-founder of the PayPal online payment service and manager of $2 billion hedge fund Clarium Capital, the Journal reported. He also is a backer of Vator, the Journal reported. Thiel, Callaway and Francisco were not immediately available for comment. "The understanding had always been that if it got to a point at which I could not proceed without conflicts of interest, then I would leave MarketWatch to focus on Vator.tv," Francisco wrote in a MarketWatch column posted Friday. "So I have decided to run Vator.tv full-time."
