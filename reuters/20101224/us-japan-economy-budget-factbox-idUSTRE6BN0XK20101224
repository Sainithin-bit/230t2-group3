 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's government on Friday approved a record 92.4 trillion yen ($1.11 trillion) draft budget for the year from next April that underscored its struggle to balance the needs to cap borrowing and to support the fragile economy. 

 The government had to dip yet again into savings to stick to its borrowing cap as tax revenues are unlikely to grow enough to make ends meet. The budget, the first drafted from scratch by the Democratic Party-led government, is hardly reassuring for the economy but still calls into question its ability to rein in the government's huge debt in coming years. Following are details of key budget items for 2011/12 and how the government managed to fund them. WELFARE SPENDING: 28.7 TRLN YEN The government plans to spend a record 28.7 trillion yen on welfare, up 5.3 percent from the previous year due to the aging population and its pledge to pay allowances to families with children as a step to counter falling birthrates. As pension payments steadily increase, the government needed to come up with emergency funding of 2.5 trillion yen to continue shouldering 50 percent of the payments and dipped into reserves in special accounts, which it calls "non-tax revenues." But the reserves become applicable only if the government is able to pass related bills in the parliament next year and this may prove tough as opposition parties are likely to try to block their passage. The savings in special accounts are also drying up, putting more pressure on the government to seek a hike in the 5 percent consumption tax as the society ages, but it fears proposing such a rise would alienate voters. PAYOUTS TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN: Y2.2 TRLN The government has decided to raise payouts to families with children younger than three years old to 20,000 yen a month from 13,000 yen, resulting in an additional cost of 250 billion yen. To accommodate the change, it plans to scale back deductions from taxable income and tax deductions for dependants. PUBLIC WORKS: Y4.9 TRLN The government plans to cut spending on bridges, roads and infrastructure by 13.8 percent to 4.9 trillion yen, smaller than a record 18.3 percent reduction the previous year. The 4.9 trillion yen spending is about half of the peak in 1997/98, indicating a continued shift in fiscal policy away from over-reliance on large-scale public works to spur growth. FARM SUBSIDIES: Y600 BLN The government will boost subsidies for farmers to strengthen the sector's competitiveness, as it eyes joining the U.S.-led Transpacific Partnership (TPP) free trade initiative, a plan that has angered politically powerful farmers. NON-TAX REVENUE The government scraped together a total of 7.2 trillion yen in non-tax revenue, down from a record 10.6 trillion yen in 2010/11 with the bulk coming from special accounts that manage foreign reserves and the fiscal investment and loan program that finances public projects. In a sign the government won't be able to depend on these non-tax reserves much longer, it needed to tap 231 billion yen in an anticipated surplus from foreign reserves in the next fiscal year, on top of all of the current surplus of 2.7 trillion yen. The surplus from the fiscal investment and loan account, in addition, is seen declining steadily in coming years from 1 trillion yen in 2010/11. DEBT SERVICING COSTS Interest payments and retiring debt would cost 21.5 trillion yen in the next fiscal year, or 23.3 percent of the overall budget, a 4.4 percent increase from the previous year. Japanese yields are low when compared with the United States and Europe, but they have been rising recently and this could affect next fiscal year's debt servicing costs, according to Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda.
