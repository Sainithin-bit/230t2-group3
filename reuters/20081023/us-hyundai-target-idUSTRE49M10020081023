 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co ( 005380.KS ), South Korea's top auto maker, will meet this year's business target, although world auto markets have been hit by weaker demand on the global economic slowdown, a senior official said on Thursday. 

 Hyundai expected its exports from local factories in the fourth quarter to double from $2.9 billion in the third quarter when its local production was hit by union-led strikes. "Demand for smaller cars is rising although global auto demand is shrinking. We have proper models and diversified markets, so we are confident of meeting this year's target of 33 trillion won (in sales) and an operating margin of 6.5 percent," Park Dong-wook, a director at Hyundai's treasury division, told reporters.
