 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Efforts to unlock global money markets hit a snag on Thursday as banks raised their lending rates on dollar funds for the first time in two weeks. 

 Outside of the interbank lending, the U.S. commercial paper market -- despite evidence of improved demand for this type of corporate debt -- contracted for a sixth straight week to its smallest in 3-1/2 years. Commercial paper allows many U.S. companies to fund their day-to-day operations "Things have stabilized a bit, but it's still spotty," said Jeff Given, portfolio manager at MFC Global Investment Management in Boston. In the last two weeks, bank-to-bank lending costs have fallen sharply after huge cash injections, bank bailouts and interest rate cuts by central banks and governments worldwide. For example, 3-month dollar rates are down nearly 1-1/4 percentage points. Analysts fear the relief could be negated by a sharp global slowdown, which could tighten bank lending to companies. Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said on Thursday he expects the United States will dip into a recession while other major economies continue to slow. This grim assessment, together with the rise in dollar funding rates, reined in optimism that the worst of the financial crisis has passed, analysts said. "You have to ask yourself how much lower we can go given everything we currently see, especially with the expectations embedded in the forward rates," said Dresdner Kleinwort rate strategist Christoph Rieger in Frankfurt. CP MARKET DEFLATES The U.S. commercial paper market continued to deflate despite falling rates and improved investor appetite. U.S. Federal Reserve data showed outstanding CP fell $61.4 billion in the week ended Oct 22 to $1.449 trillion, a level not seen since 2004. But help may be on the way for the commercial paper market as the Fed will launch its purchase program of high-quality, 3-month CP on Monday. "There is an end in sight. A significant (remedy) will come into play on Monday when issuers have ability to effectively sell paper to the Fed," said Stephen Wesselkamper, a money market portfolio manager at Cleveland-based Victory Capital Management, which invests about $59 billion. IMPROVING TREND INTACT While the uptick in dollar lending rates raised some eyebrows, the trend of improving credit conditions remained intact, analysts and investors said. "This slowing of progress may be a little disconcerting. But we do not believe that this retracement means the healing process in the money markets is in jeopardy," said Morgan Stanley rate strategist Laurence Mutkin in London. Mutkin noted that forward Libor/OIS spreads, which reflect the expected premium paid to borrow in the future, have been falling for three weeks and by 2010 are below 35 basis points for euros and dollars and below 45 basis points for sterling. "These levels discount a return to something close to normal, for a world where balance sheet is no longer free, so it will be hard for them to push much tighter," he said. In addition to liquidity measures, global central banks lowered short-term rates in a bid to stimulate lending and to avert domestic slowdowns. In New Zealand, the central bank slashed interest rates by a record 1 percentage point to 6.5 percent and said further cuts were in the pipeline. The Swedish Riksbank cut rates by another 50 basis points to 3.75 percent -- the second such easing this month.
