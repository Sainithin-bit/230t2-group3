 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of major U.S. homebuilders sank on Thursday, a day after Pulte Homes Inc ( PHM.N ) and Ryland Group Inc ( RYL.N ) reported quarterly losses and Pulte said its outlook for cash generation in 2009 looks increasingly difficult. 

 Pulte fell 18.5 percent to close at $8.11, while Ryland slid 11.5 percent to $15.85 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Builders index .DJUSHB was down 12.2 percent. The broader market, as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX , was up 1.3 percent. "We remain negative on the sector as we believe increased concerns regarding 2009 cash flow generation will continue to mount," wrote J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut in a client note, reaffirming his negative stance on the sector. Pulte posted a narrower quarterly loss due to lower writedowns. But the No. 4 U.S. builder painted a bleak picture of the future, and No. 9 Ryland posted a wider loss. The U.S. housing sector, mired in its worst slump since the Great Depression, continues to flail as high-risk subprime borrowers default on mortgages. Defaults push foreclosures and inventory up and prices down, which puts growing numbers of homeowners "underwater" on their mortgages -- owing more than their homes are worth. To cope with the downturn, U.S. builders have shifted into survival mode by selling their land -- much of it bought at peak prices during the boom years -- and ramping up incentives to move homes and generate cash. "2009 will not look like 2008 from a cash generation perspective in the industry in general because again the demand continues to fall," said Roger Cregg, chief financial officer. The excess supply of homes, exacerbated by the increase in foreclosures, has combined with economic turmoil to keep buyers out of the market, despite price cuts by builders and a $7,500 federal tax credit to first-time buyers, the company said. Even a year ago, Pulte was able to generate sales by cutting prices. Today, despite efforts to bring prices level with those on foreclosed homes, the overall lack of demand is translating into dismal sales. Ryland is contemplating shutting down communities where further price cuts do not make financial sense, Chief Executive Officer Chad Dreier said during a conference call with analysts. Earlier in October, Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ), the No. 2 U.S. builder, cut its dividend and No. 3 Centex Corp ( CTX.N ) suspended its dividend altogether. The fate of Ryland's dividend is likewise up for discussion at a board meeting in early December, Dreier said. In October, U.S. homebuilder sentiment sank to an all-time low despite massive global efforts to stem consumer panic, the National Association of Home Builders said on Thursday. For the year to date, homebuilders' shares are down 36 percent, about even with the broader market. On Thursday, shares of Atlanta-based Beazer Homes ( BZH.N ) fell as much as 36 percent to a new lifetime low of $2.00, while other builders, including No. 1 D.R. Horton ( DHI.N ), set a new 52-week low, falling 21 percent to $5.13. "I look forward to the day when the majority of our operational highlights no longer consist of our effectiveness in shrinking the company. Unfortunately, that is the environment we're in," Dreier said. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff ; additional reporting by Lynn Adler; editing by John Wallace,  Richard Chang , Phil Berlowitz)
