 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and revenues on Thursday, but cut its full-year outlook to reflect the continued economic slowdown. 

 The news sent shares up 5 percent. COMMENTARY: TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "Microsoft reported a very solid Q1. What people were expecting was for them to take down guidance and they did. But it was only marginally lower. I think people were expecting much worse." "Everyone was worried about the guidance. If you are a Microsoft investor you should be happy that Microsoft thinks they will weather the storm relatively well." KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP "One of the things we look at Microsoft for is their outlook for how business are doing, and it seems as if their business-oriented division did pretty well in the quarter." "It's no surprise that they're guiding down. Microsoft likes to set achievable goals for themselves. But I do think that spending overall is going to be muted in the future and this is what they're trying to portray." DAVID KATZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS IN NEW YORK "Basically I would say that we're pleased. The company continues to set reasonable expectations and meet or beat them as they did here. The expectation was that they would bring down guidance, they only did that in a modest way. They seem to have a grasp on all their business. "The company's balance sheet is very strong. It's critical to put this in perspective- the stock is down about 30 percent in the year, it's coming down close to where people thought it'd be. In our opinion, the decline is a massive overshoot on the reality of the business. They have a spectacular balance sheet and a huge market share, that's rare for a company this size. "I think that over the next 12 months the stock will move meaningfully higher and get back in the $30 range. The key is that it is doing well in a very difficult environment. The outlook is very, very reasonable and it allows for very good earnings. It's important to remember that Microsoft historically is very conservative in its outlook. If the company shaving the outlook, there is a very good chance that it could beat it."
