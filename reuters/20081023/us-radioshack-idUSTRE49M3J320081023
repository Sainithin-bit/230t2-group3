 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Electronics retailer RadioShack Corp ( RSH.N ) reported a higher third-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by demand for digital television converters and video games. 

 But the company cautioned that sales and earnings trends slowed in September and expects the "challenging retail environment" to continue. Net earnings were $50.2 million, or 39 cents a share in the third quarter, compared with $46.3 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. There were fewer shares outstanding as RadioShack repurchased stock. Analysts expected profit of 36 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 6.4 percent to $1.02 billion, helped by a 45 percent rise in online sales. Same-store sales, or those at stores open at least a year, rose 7.7 percent, aided by analog-to-digital converter boxes ahead of the transition of TV broadcast signals to digital in early 2009. The retailer also cited strong sales of laptop computers, video games and navigation systems. RadioShack has closed unprofitable stores and reduced staff since turnaround veteran Julian Day became chief executive in 2006. The company has also added store help, and last month said it would upgrade 4,000 stores to include redesigned wireless and navigation system displays in time for the holiday selling season. RadioShack said it completed the sale of $375 million of convertible senior notes during the quarter, and had $824 million in cash and an added $325 million available under a revolving credit agreement as of September 30.
