 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical expects that its long term earnings goal will be challenged by a looming global recession in 2009, said Chief Executive Andrew Liveris on Thursday. 

 "We did say we would earn more than $3 (per share) in an industry trough. But, I also did say, if there was a recession all bets are off. Frankly, we're going to re-look at that number in the context of a very weak '09," said Liveris, in an interview with Reuters. Liveris is steering the company away from the typically cyclical and low margin commodity chemical business, toward the more profitable specialty chemicals sector. As part of this move, Dow last year announced it would sell a major part of its plastics assets to Kuwait Petroleum Corp for $9.5 billion. In a bid to expand its specialty chemical assets, the company, in July said it would acquire rival Rohm and Haas for $15.3 billion. The deal, which is expected to close early in 2009, will broaden Dow's product offerings in higher margin markets such as paints, coatings and electronic materials. Liveris said the U.S. economy already feels like it is in a recession and any sectors outside of healthcare and food are feeling the slowdown. "With a recession environment in most of 2009, you basically got to hunker-down and continue your strategy, bring forward your most important projects, but at the same time be very watchful of market demand."
