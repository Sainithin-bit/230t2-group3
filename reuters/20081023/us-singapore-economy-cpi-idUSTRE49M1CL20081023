 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Singapore's annual inflation accelerated in September on higher food and housing costs but stayed below a 26-year high, with price pressures likely to ease in coming months as the financial crisis reduces demand. 

 The consumer price index rose 6.7 percent in September from a year ago, and economists said it showed price pressures will take time to abate, reducing chances of the central bank further easing monetary policy before its next scheduled announcement in April. Eight economists had forecast inflation to hit 6.6 percent in September from a year ago. The index rose 6.4 percent in August. For a graphic see  here "Inflation is still at elevated levels...Unless the global economy tanks big time, we'll stick with the next policy review," said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB. From the previous month, the consumer price index rose 0.1 percent after seasonal adjustments, the Department of Statistics said on Thursday, compared with a forecast for a 0.1 percent fall. Inflation across Asia is expected to have peaked after spiking in the first half of the year as the financial crisis tames price rises. Taiwan's inflation eased to an eight-month low in September, and India's annual inflation fell for a third straight reading to its lowest since the end of May, with a government official saying the downtrend is expected to continue. In a nod that slowing growth posed a greater risk to Singapore's economy than rising prices, Singapore's central bank eased monetary policy for the first time since 2003 in October to let the Singapore dollar rise at a slower pace. The move came just six months after it tightened policy to flight inflation. Singapore's central bank conducts monetary policy by managing the its currency within a secret band against a basket of currencies, instead of setting interest rates. The Singapore dollar was trading at 1.5007 at 0543 GMT, compared with 1.5002 before the announcement. The trade-dependent economy fell into its first recession in six years in the third quarter after exports and manufacturing output slumped. "All the trends are pointing to inflation numbers falling going forward," said Joseph Tan, chief Asia economist at Credit Suisse. "Right now, the focus has definitely moved from one that is concerned with inflation to one that is concerned about growth." Singapore's inflation held at a 26-year peak of 7.5 percent in the second quarter but has since eased, partly as the effects of a two-percentage-point rise in sales tax last year faded from annual calculations. The central bank expects 2008 inflation to be within 6-7 percent this year, and easing to between 2-3 percent in 2009.
