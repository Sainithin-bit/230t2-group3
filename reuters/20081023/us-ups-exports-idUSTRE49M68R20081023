 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc expects its global export package business to grow by 5 percent in the fourth quarter despite evidence of a slowing world economy, a top executive said on Thursday. 

 "Our business will be impacted by the global economy," Chief Financial Officer Kurt Kuehn told Reuters in a telephone interview. "But we expect to see continued growth for our export business in the fourth quarter." Kuehn said the company expected 2009 to be a "challenging" year, but that the second half of the year will be "substantially better" than the first half for the U.S. economy and UPS.
