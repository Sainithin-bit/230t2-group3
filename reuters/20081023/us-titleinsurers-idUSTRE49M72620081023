 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The shares of major U.S. title insurers tumbled on signs the nation's housing crisis will lead both to higher claims and to reduced demand for insurance that homeowners need to protect themselves and their lenders. 

 Thursday's decline came a day after Fidelity National Financial Inc ( FNF.N ), one of the largest title insurers posted a big third-quarter loss after setting aside $261.6 million in reserves. It also halved its dividend and announced 1,000 job cuts and an across-the-board 10 percent pay cut. Title insurance guarantees that property owners have title to property and can legally transfer that title. Many lenders require that buyers have the insurance before extending loans. Yet a housing slump worsened by tight credit and a weakening economy has resulted in lower demand for homes, cutting into title insurers' revenue. "Fidelity National took a big reserve charge and because it is a national company, there might be an assumption that others might follow," said Paul Bauer, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service. "Title losses may also be coming into the system faster than they would have because of stress in the real estate market. Also, with homeowners already in stressed situations because of falling prices or rising interest rates, they might look to their own title insurers if they think something might be wrong with the original title." Standard & Poor's said it may cut Fidelity National's ratings, citing weakened operating performance. The company's shares closed down 58 cents, or 6.4 percent, at 8.44 on the New York Stock Exchange, after hitting a record low of $7.52, Reuters data show. Shares of other title insurers fell Thursday to their lowest levels since at least 2000, the data show. First American Corp ( FAF.N ) fell $2.78, or 13.2 percent, to $18.29; LandAmerica Financial Group Inc LFG.N slid $3.23, or 26.3 percent, to $9.07, and Stewart Information Services Corp ( STC.N ) dropped $3.34, or 18.3 percent, to $14.96. Representatives of LandAmerica and Stewart declined to comment. First American did not return requests for comment. First American and LandAmerica report quarterly results next week, and LandAmerica plans to do so by Nov 10. MORTGAGE FRAUD RISING Fidelity National's third-quarter net loss was $198.3 million, or 95 cents per share. On a Thursday conference call, the Jacksonville, Florida-based company said it plans soon to increase title insurance prices 10 percent to 20 percent nationwide to help offset lower business and rising reserves. It also said fraud and forgery cases have grown more numerous, and now account for about 20 percent of claims. Fidelity National is not alone. James Wells, chief executive of Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ), lamented on a conference call the "abhorrently high cost that mortgage application fraud is inflicting on the industry and SunTrust." Quarterly profit at SunTrust fell 26 percent. New evidence shows a steepening housing slump. U.S. home prices in August dropped 5.9 percent from a year earlier according to the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the largest decline since data were collected in 1991. And data provider RealtyTrac said U.S. foreclosure filings rose 71 percent in the third quarter to a record 765,558. About 44 percent of filings were in just two states: California and Florida. Moody's Bauer said rising foreclosures might actually help title insurers if it spurs increased buying. "Title insurers are much more dependent on transactions taking place than on the prices of homes," he said. First American is based in Santa Ana, California. LandAmerica in Glen Allen, Virginia and Stewart in Houston. (Editing by  Andre Grenon , editing by Richard Chang)
