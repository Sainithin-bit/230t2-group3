 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) posted a third-quarter loss on Thursday as it booked $1.48 billion in charges for probes of its Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment, but sales topped Wall Street expectations on double-digit gains for many of its biggest drugs. 

 The suburban Chicago drugmaker said it lost $466 million, or 43 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $926 million, or 85 cents per share. Excluding special items, earnings rose 14 percent to $1.04 per share. Analysts on average expected $1.02, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales rose 14 percent to $5.21 billion, topping the Reuters Estimates forecast of $5.09 billion. Strong sales gains were seen for the company's treatments for depression, cancer, diabetes and impotence. But global Zyprexa sales rose only 2 percent to $1.19 billion, despite higher U.S. prices, amid continuing concerns that the drug causes weight gains that can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Lilly is attempting to settle a federal probe into allegedly improper marketing of Zyprexa. Separately, it has settled another investigation initiated by various states. The company hopes to become a bigger player in oncology by completing its planned $6.5 billion purchase of Imclone Systems Inc IMCL.O later this year or in early 2009, and selling the biotechnology company's Erbitux colon cancer drug in partnership with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ). Indianapolis-based Lilly also hopes to soon begin selling the most important of its experimental medicines, a blood clot preventer called prasugrel whose approval has been delayed as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration twice cited the need for more time to review the potential blockbuster pill.
