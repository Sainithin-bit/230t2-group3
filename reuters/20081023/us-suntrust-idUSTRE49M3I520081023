 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ), a large U.S. southeast regional bank, said on Thursday that third-quarter profit fell 25 percent, hurt by the effects of the tough credit environment. 

 Net income for the Atlanta-based bank fell to $307.3 million, or 88 cents per share, from $412.6 million, or $1.18 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 20.7 percent to $2.46 billion. SunTrust set aside $503.7 million for loan losses, up from $147 million a year earlier. Earlier this year, SunTrust announced plans to dispose of its 43.6-million-share stake in Coca-Cola ( KO.N ), bolstering capital. It has held the soft drink maker's shares since 1919. Analysts have said the disposition could make SunTrust a more attractive takeover candidate. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and  Franklin Paul ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
