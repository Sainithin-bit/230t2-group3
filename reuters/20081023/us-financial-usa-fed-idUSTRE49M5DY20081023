 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is actively working on solutions to prevent "avoidable" home foreclosures and believes new tools provided in a $700 billion financial bailout plan will aid the effort, a Fed board member said on Thursday. 

 Fed governor Elizabeth Duke did not address the U.S. central bank's outlook for monetary policy nor its outlook for the broader economy in prepared testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. Duke provided a rundown of recent Fed and Treasury efforts to stabilize the financial system and said the Fed was working to develop solutions to rising foreclosures. "Preventing avoidable foreclosures is good for borrowers, communities and the economy," Duke said. (Reporting by  David Lawder )
