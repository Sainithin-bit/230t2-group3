 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) on Thursday said third-quarter earnings tripled from the sale of its ConvaTec wound-healing unit and higher drug sales, but the company took another big charge for soured investments. 

 The New York-based drugmaker said it earned $2.58 billion, or $1.29 per share, compared with $858 million, or 43 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. The results reflect a $2 billion after-tax gain from the sale of the ConvaTec unit in August. Bristol-Myers said its net earnings from continuing operations fell 21 percent to $588 million, or 30 cents per share, primarily due to a charge of $224 million in the quarter related to losses on auction rate securities. The company previously had identified $811 million of such investments whose value had been deemed questionable because subprime mortgages were a component of the securities. It wrote down $275 million of the securities in the first quarter and said the carrying value of remaining invested principal, following the latest charge, has been reduced to $213 million. Excluding special charges, Bristol-Myers said its third-quarter earnings from continuing operations was 46 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 42 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
