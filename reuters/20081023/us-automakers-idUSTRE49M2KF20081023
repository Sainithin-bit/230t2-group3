 DETROIT/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC took steps on Thursday to cut jobs and close plants as automakers from Europe to Asia forecast a deeper global downturn in auto sales. 

 At the eye of the storm, GM and Chrysler, still discussing a merger that could combine the struggling automakers, were forced to cut costs more aggressively than had been anticipated to survive the sweeping economic downturn analysts see as threatening both automakers' survival. "The global credit crisis has had a dramatic impact upon the industry at large and new vehicle markets in North America and Western Europe have contracted severely," GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said in a letter to employees. Results from Germany's Daimler, South Korea's Hyundai Motor and Fiat in Italy added to the gloom facing the automotive industry as recession clouds spread throughout the developed world. Facing a U.S. market expected to tumble near 18-year lows in October, GM said it faced "an increasing need to conserve cash" and would begin dismissing salaried and contract staff as it also cuts benefits, like matching payments to 401(k) plans. Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S. automaker and owned by Cerberus Capital Management, said it would close a Delaware SUV plant a year earlier than planned, cutting 1,825 jobs, after posting a loss of more than $1 billion in the first half. GM and Chrysler are in talks about a cost-saving merger that could also present Daimler a key opportunity to unload its 19.9 percent Chrysler stake which cost it 1.05 billion euros in the first nine months of the year. "These are extraordinary and unprecedented times," Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told investors during a call, citing hits to its sales, revenue, margins and order book. The maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and the world's biggest truckmaker lowered its expectations for the year and said its own forecasts were guesswork. "The (Daimler) figures are even below our very cautious estimates. Provisions for lower residual values and lower margin targets at Mercedes Benz cars are also surprisingly weak," said DZ Bank analyst Michael Punzet. Fiat said global demand for its products could drop 10 to 20 percent and its profit could tumble by as much as 65 percent in a "worst-case" scenario. At Hyundai, South Korea's top car maker, an official expected emerging-market demand to fall next year. In Paris, Renault posted a 2.2 percent drop in third-quarter sales, blaming a sharp fall in European markets in the second half. It also declined to repeat existing guidance for 2009. "The crisis is well and truly here, and it's touching Renault," Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata said. But he said cost-cutting measures would position the group to weather the storm, and be ready for a rebound -- in 2011 or 2012. Global carmakers face a sharp drop in sales as consumers put off major purchases on fears of a recession and credit becomes more expensive or unavailable. Widespread production cuts are also pushing parts suppliers to the brink and forced German diversified conglomerate Rheinmetall to also lower guidance on Thursday due to plummeting orders for pistons, valves and oil pumps. Johnson Controls Inc, a major U.S. supplier, saw its profit almost wiped out by a restructuring charge and repeated a forecast for its first full-year earnings in 18 years amid deepening uncertainty for the sector and the economy. "I think it's ... a North American recession and a consumer confidence that's causing us to try to sit here and guess what that could mean," Johnson Controls CEO Stephen Roell said. "That's the one that's probably on everybody's mind -- where's the consumer going to be for the next year?" GM, like other U.S. automakers, has faced increased scrutiny of its cash position as the market tightens. In a move that will force further charges in the future, GM's union at an SUV plant in Ohio approved a deal including payouts and early retirement benefits to close the plant. SLOWDOWN HITS EUROPE The U.S. auto market has been in sharp decline for almost half a year, but the slowdown has only recently emerged in Europe, and Thursday's reports were the first look at how tough conditions have become for a manufacturing sector that is traditionally one of the hardest hit by recession. Five-year credit default swaps on Fiat were about 140 basis points wider at 992 basis points, a trader said, concerning investors. Hyundai, the world's No. 5 automaker along with affiliate Kia Motors Corp, posted a 38 percent fall in third-quarter net profit. Although it beat expectations, its outlook was gloomy. "The market situation in emerging countries is much worse than expected," Park Dong-wook, a director at Hyundai's treasury division, told reporters.
