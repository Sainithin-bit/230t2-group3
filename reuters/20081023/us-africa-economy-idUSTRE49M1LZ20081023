 NAIROBI  (Reuters) - Economic growth in sub-Saharan Africa will slow to 6 percent in 2008 and 2009 due to tough global conditions, while inflation is seen at 12 percent this year, according to the latest outlook by the International Monetary Fund. 

 "In an increasingly adverse global environment, sub-Saharan African growth is expected to slow to about 6 percent in 2008 and 2009, down from 6.5 percent in 2007," the IMF said. "Meanwhile, inflation is projected to increase to 12 percent in 2008 and 10 percent in 2009." In its latest regional economic outlook launched on Thursday, the IMF said the food and fuel price shock has put upward pressure on inflation and current account deficits although donor aid had failed to raise in tandem. "The worsening macroeconomic situation reflects headwinds from strong increases in food and fuel prices, slower world growth and global financial turmoil."
