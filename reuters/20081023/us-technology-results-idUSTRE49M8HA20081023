 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted stronger-than-expected quarterly results and cut its outlook by less than investors had feared amid the economic slump, sending its shares higher. 

 Other technology companies that reported quarterly results on Thursday include Flextronics International Ltd, Ingram Micro Inc and Juniper Networks Inc. COMMENTARY ON MICROSOFT: TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "Microsoft reported a very solid Q1. What people were expecting was for them to take down guidance and they did. But it was only marginally lower. I think people were expecting much worse." "Everyone was worried about the guidance. If you are a Microsoft investor you should be happy that Microsoft thinks they will weather the storm relatively well." KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP "One of the things we look at Microsoft for is their outlook for how business are doing, and it seems as if their business-oriented division did pretty well in the quarter." "It's no surprise that they're guiding down. Microsoft likes to set achievable goals for themselves. But I do think that spending overall is going to be muted in the future and this is what they're trying to portray." DAVID KATZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS IN NEW YORK "Basically I would say that we're pleased. The company continues to set reasonable expectations and meet or beat them as they did here. The expectation was that they would bring down guidance, they only did that in a modest way. They seem to have a grasp on all their business. "The company's balance sheet is very strong. It's critical to put this in perspective- the stock is down about 30 percent in the year, it's coming down close to where people thought it'd be. In our opinion, the decline is a massive overshoot on the reality of the business. They have a spectacular balance sheet and a huge market share, that's rare for a company this size. "I think that over the next 12 months the stock will move meaningfully higher and get back in the $30 range. The key is that it is doing well in a very difficult environment. The outlook is very, very reasonable and it allows for very good earnings. It's important to remember that Microsoft historically is very conservative in its outlook. If the company is shaving the outlook, there is a very good chance that it could beat it." TRIP CHOWDHRY, ANALYST, GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH "People had already factored in that guidance would be lower. At about $22, it had been literally trading at a rock bottom price for Microsoft, given the potential that the company has." "Everybody has factored in that macro conditions are bad, so I think people are now going to focus on what the company can do today to put it in a stronger position one or two years from now." "Next week Microsoft is going to make many announcements regarding cloud initiatives and services that Microsoft will initiate over the next two years. Historically Microsoft has been a laggard. They missed on the Internet, they missed on search. But the cloud is probably a place where they can lead the industry." KATHERINE EGBERT, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO "It looks good. Every business unit exceeded expectations except for the Windows Vista business, which was a little bit light. Online was about 10 percent more than expected. Xbox was good. The business division was really good." "The big thing is that they guided down for the remainder of the fiscal year. Given the backdrop, that's not a huge surprise." "If you think about it, pretty much everything that Microsoft sells is the lowest price product in its category. Xbox, ads on MSN, Office, SQL server, Windows Server. Every product they sell is the cheapest in their category. That certainly helps them out in this environment." SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN "Everybody was concerned about guidance and it seems to be kind of in line to slightly better than what the Street was fearing so I think the fear factor is subsiding a little. So from that standpoint I think it was a relief for some investors." "Basically there is caution and their guidance is just reflecting that caution." ------------------------------------------------------- COMMENTARY ON INGRAM MICRO: MATTHEW SHEERIN, ANALYST, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS "I've been covering the stock eight years. This is the first time the company has not given revenue or earnings guidance. This is a sign visibility is extremely limited." "I don't think it's a surprise because nobody seems to have any visibility in demand whether it's the distributors or the suppliers." "There's been a virtual freeze on IT spending at corporate clients." He said the results themselves were as bad as expected. ------------------------------------------------------- COMMENTARY ON FLEXTRONICS: SHAWN HARRISON, ANALYST, LONGBOW RESEARCH "The guidance they offered for topline and EPS was weaker than anyone anticipated." "They generally see a pretty big ramp of their handset and consumer electronics business. That may not be occurring." "You're seeing lower-than-normal and very cautionary order patterns from original equipment manufacturers with regards to products being sold to the consumer." "The bottomline takeaway is, caution on the market is resulting in lower-than-normal demand forecasts and negatively impacting profitability. THOMAS CARPENTER, ANALYST, HILLIARD LYONS "The results were probably better than what people expected. Things slowed a little in September but not until the end of the quarter. But the outlook for December was lower than people were expecting a month or two ago." "The mobile unit is doing well. The infrastructure unit is down. Given Ericsson's good results, that points to Nortel." He said the third-quarter revenue guidance of $8 billion to $9 billion is an unusually wide range, suggesting that it does not have a clear view of demand. "The challenging thing is that it looks like Flextronics is also trying to put its arms around how long and deep the downturn is as reflected by their revenue outlook." ------------------------------------------------------- COMMENTARY ON JUNIPER: MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS "The results are pretty good despite a difficult environment."
