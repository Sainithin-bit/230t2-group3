 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Bayer BAYG.DE shares rose as much as 4 percent on market talk that U.S. peer Pfizer ( PFE.N ) may be interested in taking over the German drugs and chemicals maker, traders in Frankfurt said. 

 A Bayer spokesman said the company does not comment on market rumors. The shares were up 3.6 percent at 43.21 euros by 0812 GMT, outperforming the benchmark DAX index, which was down 0.4 percent. Pfizer has consistently declined to comment on the persistent takeover rumors. Many bankers are skeptical of the talk, since such a deal would bring with it many non-core businesses for Pfizer.
