 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - The global credit crisis will finally take a toll on companies in the radiation-oncology industry over the next several quarters, as hospitals increasingly look to curtail spending on new equipment. 

 Sales of big-ticket equipment from companies such as TomoTherapy Inc, Accuray Inc and Varian Medical Systems had been protected from the slowing economy by higher reimbursement rates and the widespread use of radiation therapy as a cancer treatment. Though radiation-oncology machines can cost between $2 million and $4 million, they are among the fastest repaying equipment that hospitals can buy. But with the credit crunch deepening, many hospitals may choose to not replace their aging machines, or put off new purchases till the cost of new credit comes down. "Do you need the new one now or do you wait a year?" is the question that hospitals with existing equipment will be pondering, Jefferies & Co analyst Peter Bye said. Analysts, however, expect the effects of the slowdown to start showing only over the next few months. "The time between closing a deal, actually delivering the equipment and recognizing the revenue is typically 9 months. So, the revenue that will be reported in the September quarter are on deals done in the fourth quarter of last year," Needham & Co analyst Dalton Chandler said. Backlog in the recently ended quarter is expected to be healthy, helped by the annual meeting of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) held in September, Soleil Securities analyst Junaid Hussain said. The annual convention, which usually takes place in October, is a big industry event that allows vendors to pitch directly to their customers, Hussain said. CREDIT COSTS HURT Higher borrowing costs, rather than a lack of credit, is expected to force the slowdown in the radiation-oncology industry. "We are surveying, surveying and surveying hospitals and the companies involved, and there is definitely credit available to these hospitals," Lazard Capital Markets analyst Sean Lavin said. Several analysts expect to start seeing some slowdown in orders in the December quarter, and an even greater impact over the first half of calendar 2009. "The higher borrowing costs that many hospitals began to feel in third quarter mostly sprung up in the last two weeks of the quarter," Soleil's Hussain said. "Any pull-back in capital equipment spending by hospitals could potentially be seen in the fourth quarter and beyond." Among the U.S.-based players in this space, Varian is expected to weather the slowdown best due to its well-received and relatively new 'RapidArc' technology. "RapidArc came at what I could consider to be a right time -- in an environment where hospitals need to do more things efficiently, in an era of declining reimbursements, where the better, faster, cheaper solution is the way to go," Soleil analyst Hussain said. Varian has lost almost 21 percent of its market value this year through Wednesday, but has outperformed rivals Accuray and TomoTherapy. The two companies have lost between 63 percent and 80 percent of their market value this year, underperforming the wider S&P Health Care Equipment Sub-Industry Index, which is down about 17 percent.
