 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ), the world's largest commercial vehicle maker, may post a loss in 2009 due to volatile markets, its Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said, according to German newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung. 

 "One thing has to be made clear: Due to volatile markets I cannot rule out a loss in 2009," Uebber said, adding the company may have to fire workers, the paper reported.
