 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Loews Corp LTR.N said on Monday that it planned to spin off its Lorillard Inc cigarette unit, whose brands include Newport, Kent and Maverick. 

 The spinoff would be accomplished by swapping shares of Loews' Carolina Group CG.N, which tracks the performance of the company's cigarette assets, for new common shares in a separate Lorillard entity. Loews, whose businesses include financial, energy, hotel and watch-making companies, is a New York-based conglomerate run by the billionaire Tisch family. "Over the past several years, the tobacco business has not been a primary focus for Loews," Chief Executive James Tisch said on a conference call. He added that the deal would improve the company's risk profile. The deal calls for the exchange of one Lorillard common share for each Carolina Group share. Carolina shareholders would hold about 62 percent of Lorillard. The remaining 38 percent of Lorillard stock could be exchanged for shares of Loew's common stock if the company believes market conditions are acceptable. Loews expects to complete the Lorillard spinoff in mid-2008, and the cigarette company's stock would trade on the New York Stock Exchange. "We have no plans to dispose or distribute any other subsidiaries that we own," Tisch said. Lorillard generated a record $233.6 million in earnings during the third quarter. Martin Orlowsky will remain chairman, president and CEO of Lorillard, Loews said. On the call, Orlowsky said Lorillard would adopt a dividend payout ratio more in line with its U.S. peers. He also said he was still in the process of formulating the soon-to-be independent company's financial strategy. Moody's Investor Service, meanwhile, affirmed its long-term debt rating on Loews following the announcement. "Even though the spinoff would eliminate the overhang of tobacco litigation, dividends from Lorillard still represent the majority of cash flow to Loews and a highly stable source of earnings and cash flow," Moody's Vice President Janice Hofferber said. Hofferber said she did not expect the spinoff to affect Loews' credit profile. Loews shares were up 3.1 percent to $48.24 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade, while Carolina Group rose 1.2 percent to $88.38.
