 MILAN  (Reuters) - EU Economic and Monetary Affairs 
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said on Monday that foreign 
state-backed investment funds are a great opportunity although 
they have to increase transparency on their investments. 

  "Protectionism has to be avoided ... (Europe) has always 
had an open economy which favor citizens ... we need to set 
general rules suitable for fund managers, for the owner 
countries and for the countries where they invest," Almunia 
said in a interview with Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.  Funds from Middle Eastern investors like Abu Dhabi, Qatar, 
Dubai and Saudi Arabia but also from China, Russia and 
elsewhere have been grabbing headlines for their financial 
firepower and investment decisions.  Almunia said that the European Commission and other 
international bodies need to identify common rules and common 
principles "both for fund managers and for countries where they 
will invest."  More transparency is needed on the kind of investments 
those funds will make, said Almunia.  At the same time, countries where they invest "have to 
define clear rules on whether to set exceptions to the general 
criteria of freedom of movement of capital," Almunia said.  The European Union has to set common rules for 27 
countries, said Almunia adding that the Commission has been 
working on this since September.
