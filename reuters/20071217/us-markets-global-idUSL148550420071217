 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks slid on Monday as rising inflation, weak holiday shopping and housing worries weighed on the outlook for profits and the economy, while bonds rose as investors sought the safety of U.S. Treasuries. 

 A plunge in New York manufacturing activity, another low reading on home builder sentiment and a comment by a San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank economist that the United States faced a heightened risk of recession pushed bond prices up. The dollar rose against the euro amid speculation the Fed would be less inclined to cut interest rates after last week's U.S. inflation data, before falling slightly. A firmer dollar and comments from Algeria's oil minister that OPEC could raise output at a meeting in February led crude prices lower. Consumer marketing firm America's Research Group cut its forecast for holiday sales growth to 1.8 percent from 2 percent after disappointing weekend sales at malls and shopping centers. In a sign that rising food and commodity prices may spur global inflation, U.S. wheat futures surged more than 3 percent and surpassed $10 a bushel overnight for the first time. "There's such a total lack of good news to hold onto for the balance of the year," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. "There's more selling as a result of uncertainty." Benchmark U.S. stock indexes were down, with technology shares taking a heavy beating as investors worried about the outlook for business spending. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 179.00 points, or 1.34 percent, at 13,160.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 22.02 points, or 1.50 percent, at 1,445.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 56.92 points, or 2.16 percent, at 2,578.82. In Europe, shares closed at their lowest in three weeks. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  lost 1.6 percent to 1,491.71, trimming gains in 2007 to 0.6 percent. In Asia, Japanese and Hong Kong stocks fell for the fourth straight session. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  dropped 1.7 percent to end at 15,249.79. The Hang Seng Index  .HSI  fell 3.5 percent during Hong Kong's session to close at 26,596.68. A RUSH TO BUY BONDS The New York state manufacturing index's fall to a seven-month low boosted demand for safe-haven government bonds. U.S. home builder sentiment remained at a record low for a third consecutive month in December, an industry group said. The Fed's looming funding auctions also served as a reminder of a pervasive crisis in credit markets. Investors, expecting a drawn-out process, jumped back into Treasuries despite data last week showing a surprise rise in inflation. "The markets are extremely nervous and so is the Fed," said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Banking in New York. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR shot up 22/32, with the yield at 4.16 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note US2YT=RR gained 7/32, with the yield at 3.20 percent. A stronger dollar was supported by an unexpected surge, to $114 billion, in U.S. long-term capital inflows in October, sharply higher than September's inflows of $15.4 billion. A slower pace of monetary easing would not significantly erode the dollar's yield advantage, since global growth worries are likely to prompt other major central banks to cut rates or hold them steady. "U.S. economic data has been supportive of the dollar, particularly the inflation numbers, and you've seen a scaling back of expectations for Fed easing," said Nick Bennenbroek, senior currency strategist at Wells Fargo in New York. The dollar was down against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, after touching a two-month high of 77.804 overnight, before retreating. The U.S. Dollar Index .DXY was off 0.17 percent at 77.412 from a previous session close of 77.550. The euro  EUR=  slipped 0.3 percent to $1.4379 from $1.4417 late on Friday. Against Japan's yen, however, the dollar declined 0.2 percent to 113.18 yen from 113.39 late on Friday. OIL AND GOLD LOSE GROUND Crude oil prices slipped after Algerian Oil Minister Chakib Khelil said OPEC might increase oil output at a February meeting if the market needed more oil. In the energy futures market, U.S. light sweet crude oil for January delivery CLc1 fell 64 cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $90.63 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Spot gold prices XAU= fell $1.30, or 0.2 percent, to $793.20 an ounce. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ,  Ellen Freilich ,  Steven C. Johnson  and  Matthew Robinson  in New York.)
