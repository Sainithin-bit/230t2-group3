 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Loews Corp LTR.N said it plans to spin off its cigarette unit, Lorillard Inc, which makes Newport, Kent and Maverick cigarettes. 

 The spin-off would be accomplished through a tax-free transaction to investors that hold its Carolina Group stock and Loews common stock the company said. Holders of its Carolina Group stock would receive one share of common stock of Lorillard for each share of stock they own, and would hold about 62 percent of Lorillard. The remaining 38 percent of Lorillard's stock could be exchanged for shares of Loew's common stock if the company believes market conditions are acceptable for the exchange. The Lorillard spin-off is expected to be completed in mid-2008 and its stock would trade on the New York Stock Exchange, Loews said. The company said Martin Orlowsky, will continue as Chairman, president and CEO of Lorillard. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
