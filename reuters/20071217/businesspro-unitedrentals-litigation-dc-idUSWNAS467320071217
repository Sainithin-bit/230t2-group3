 (Reuters) - Equipment rental company United Rentals Inc 
( URI.N ) said the trial in the suit against Cerberus Capital 
Management LP CBS.UL would be postponed by a day by mutual 
consent of the parties. 

  The company said the trial would now start on December 18, 
adding that the postponement was to allow the parties to 
continue settlement discussions that were recently initiated.  In November, United Rentals sued Cerberus after it pulled 
its takeover offer of $34.50 a share.  (Reporting by Avishek Mishra in Bangalore; Editing by
