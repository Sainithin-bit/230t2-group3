 PARIS  (Reuters) - Air France-KLM on Monday detailed its offer to buy all of Alitalia AZPIa.MI, confirming details given on Sunday by its chairman to Italian newspapers. 

 Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) said it had made a non-binding offer to acquire 100 percent of the shares of Alitalia through an exchange offer and that it would acquire 100 percent of Alitalia convertible bonds. The French-Dutch airline would immediately inject at least $1.09 billion into Alitalia through a capital increase, which will be open to all shareholders and be fully underwritten by Air France-KLM.
