 ROME  (Reuters) - Air One's industrial plan for Italian airline Alitalia AZPIa.MI includes a 1 billion euro ($1.45 billion) capital increase and buying 130 Airbus ( EAD.PA ) aircraft for fleet renewal, a newspaper reported on Monday. 

 Carlo Toto, the head of Air One airline, was quoted telling Corriere della Sera daily he would be willing to cede about 20 percent of a future Air One-Alitalia's valuable Rome-Milan slots to meet anti-trust concerns if his acquisition was successful.
