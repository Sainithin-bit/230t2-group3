 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Central banks kicked off a joint plan to alleviate lending market strains on Monday, with the Federal Reserve's $20 billion term auction of 28-day funds. 

 Investors also awaited U.S. banks' latest financial results for the latest tally of write offs for exposure to subprime mortgage debt and other risky assets. Meanwhile, a credit rating agency warned that deepening distress in assets tied to the stricken U.S. housing market threatened bond insurers' ratings. The Federal Reserve closed the term auction for bids at 1 p.m. EST but does not plan to provide details of how the sale went immediately. Detailed results of the Fed, ECB and SNB auctions will be known on Wednesday at 10:00 a.m. EST. London interbank offered rates (Libor) for one-month dollar, euro and sterling money fell on Monday, extending the fall since the major central banks announced their concerted liquidity measures last week. The litmus test for the program's success or failure in assuaging money market stress will be whether Libor -- a key global benchmark for short term borrowing costs -- falls steeply, analysts agree. One month dollar-denominated Libor was fixed lower early on Monday before the Fed auction process started, at 4.96500 percent, down from 4.99625 percent on Friday. Market participants wait to see whether Libor eases much after the official auction results on Wednesday. After that, the next auction will be on December 20 for $20 billion over a 35-day term. "December is a trial run because most commercial paper programs and banks have funded themselves across year end," said Scott Peng, head of U.S. rate strategy at Citigroup Global Markets. "The real test of effectiveness (of the auctions) will be in mid-to-late January when most of the funding rolls off," Peng added. On Monday, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) offered up to $4 billion in short-term funds at a discount to the official U.S. Federal Reserve rate as part of a concerted effort to ease strains on the interbank lending market. Bids for a similar European Central Bank operation closed at 0830 GMT. The Bank of England will join the fray on Tuesday. Yet most experts say the scheme -- whereby the Fed, SNB, ECB, Bank of England, Bank of Canada and others set up a new short-term lending facility at favorable rates -- is unlikely to solve the crisis alone. INSURERS' MOODY BLUES: U.S. mortgage loans gone bad: a root cause of the credit market upheaval that erupted in August, continues to dog short term lending markets. Credit rating agency Moody's Investors Service said on Monday that "unprecedented stress" in the U.S. mortgage market threatens the top ratings for four bond insurers, which the rating company is testing for higher losses. The rating agency said its "stress tests" that model worst cases now assume 19 percent cumulative losses for mortgages originated in 2006. That compares with current estimated losses of 11 percent, Moody's analyst Stan Rouyer said. Bond insurer MBIA Inc's ( MBI.N ) debt protection costs rose on Monday, while Ambac Financial Corp's ABK.N fell, after Moody's late on Friday affirmed the insurance arms of both companies at "AAA," but assigned a negative outlook to MBIA. Moody's is concerned the insurers do not have sufficient capital to support their ratings -- which are crucial to their ability to write insurance contracts -- after the subprime mortgage crisis raised the possibility of widespread losses on insured structured finance securities. Commercial banks have shied away from lending to each other since August when they realized some had high exposure to investments tied to the U.S. subprime mortgage market. Only when trust among them is reestablished can the interbank lending market, which oils the global economy's wheels, run smoothly. Three of Wall Street's biggest investment banks and brokerage firms will report quarterly earnings -- Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) on Wednesday and Bear Stearns BSC.N on Thursday. Financial firms have to date written down more than $65 billion in credit-related losses. With official estimates of total losses from the subprime mortgage debacle around $300 billion, investors are braced for further shocks. "It's the unwillingness to lend that's the real stickiness here. So it's all very well injecting the money into the system, but if it just gets stuffed under the mattress in the banks, that's not necessarily going to alleviate the problem," said Jeremy Stretch, strategist at Rabobank.
