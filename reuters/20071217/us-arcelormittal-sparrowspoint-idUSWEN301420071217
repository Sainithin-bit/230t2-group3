 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Arcelor Mittal ( ISPA.AS ), the world's largest steelmaker, said on Sunday it has terminated an agreement to sell its Sparrows Point, Baltimore facility to E2 Acquisition Corp due to E2's inability to secure financing. 

 E2 is a joint venture sponsored by Esmark Inc and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp, which recently merged. ArcelorMittal said it terminated the agreement on the direction of a court-appointed trustee, and that the trustee's goal is to obtain a transaction with the earliest possible closing date. Earlier this year, ArcelorMittal was ordered by anti-trust authorities to divest the plant. In September, the U.S. Department of Justice had approved the sale of the Sparrows Point steel mill for roughly $1.35 billion.
