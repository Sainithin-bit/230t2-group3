 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warner Music Group Corp is in talks with XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc to settle a lawsuit related to portable radios that can record music, and expects a settlement soon, a person close to the talks said on Monday. 

 "You can probably expect a resolution fairly shortly," said the person who asked not to be named. XM Satellite said on Monday it had settled a similar lawsuit filed by Universal Music Group against XM Satellite's portable "Inno" devices that can record and store music.
