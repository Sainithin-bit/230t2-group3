 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - About 50 large bond investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds and other managers, have banded together to lobby companies for better investment-grade bond contracts, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 The group, which calls itself the Credit Roundtable, will release a white paper later on Monday with details on covenants they would like companies to include with their bonds, the Journal reported. Such provisions would include the right to sell bonds back to the companies if they are taken over and "step-up coupon provisions" that would force issuers to pay higher interest on their bonds if their ratings are downgraded, the article said.
