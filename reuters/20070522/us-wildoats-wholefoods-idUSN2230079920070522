 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Natural and organic grocer Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O on Tuesday extended its tender offer for Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O for a third time, even though enough shares have been tendered, as it waits to hear whether U.S. regulators will challenge the deal. 

 The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has not yet decided whether to challenge the deal, and members of the FTC staff have voiced concerns over the anti-competitive impact of the planned acquisition, Whole Foods said earlier this month. In February, Whole Foods said it planned to buy smaller rival Wild Oats for $18.50 a share, or about $565 million, to compete better with other grocers selling organic and natural fare. The deal was expected to close in April. The tender offer, which was set to expire on Tuesday, will now expire at 5 p.m. EDT on June 20. As of May 21, just under 21 million Wild Oats shares, or about 70.1 percent of the nearly 29.9 million shares outstanding as of April 27, had been tendered and not withdrawn. Wild Oats' board unanimously recommended that holders tender their shares. Its largest shareholder, Yucaipa Cos., committed to tendering its shares. Yucaipa, a private equity firm owned by billionaire grocery magnate Ronald Burkle, owns about 18 percent of Wild Oats' shares. Whole Foods shareholders do not need to approve the deal. Whole Foods and Wild Oats received a second request for additional information from the FTC on March 13. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods said the extended tender offer is subject to additional extensions and to the receipt of customary regulatory approvals. The grocers have felt pressure from private chains such as Trader Joe's and Wegmans, and traditional supermarkets such as Safeway Inc., which have improved their selection of produce and prepared foods.
