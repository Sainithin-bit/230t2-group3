 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Preppy teen clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc. ( AEO.N ) said on Tuesday that quarterly net profit rose, helped by gains in sourcing and production and the strength of its American Eagle brand. 

 Net profit was $78.8 million, or 35 cents per share, in line with analysts' average estimate as compiled by Reuters Estimates, compared with $64.2 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. The company also authorized the repurchase of 23 million shares.
