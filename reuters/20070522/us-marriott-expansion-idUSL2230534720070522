 PARIS  (Reuters) - Hotel chain Marriott International Inc. MAR.N is well on its way to meeting its expansion goals and is keeping its forecast for U.S. revenue growth this year, Chairman and Chief Executive J. W. "Bill" Marriott said on Tuesday. 

 "In the next three years we plan to add 85,000 to 100,000 hotel rooms worldwide and have a portfolio in 2009 of 600,000 rooms, 120,000 of which will be outside North America," he told a news conference. "We are well on the way to meeting our target," he added. At the end of March the company had 517,202 rooms worldwide. Marriott said the group was "very close" to presenting a new boutique hotel brand concept. He said this would be positioned just below its luxury Ritz Carlton brand and consist of hotels with an average of around 200 rooms. Marriott announced on Tuesday it had won approval to open a new 118-room hotel, near Paris's Arc de Triomphe, under its Renaissance brand in 2009. The hotel is owned by Empire SAS, which is a 100 percent subsidiary of Altarea ( IMAF.PA ). The chairman said business in Paris was very strong and that the group was looking at adding properties in and around the French capital and elsewhere in France. On the United States, he said Marriott was maintaining its forecast for revenue per available room growth (RevPar) of between 6 and 8 percent. "We see strong summer travel. Our group business is strong and we are continuing to maintain our outlook." The company was also looking at acquisitions to accelerate development elsewhere in Europe. "We have several (acquisitions) we are looking at but nothing we are ready to announce," he said. Asked about rumors in the past of a possible merger with France's Accor ( ACCP.PA ), he said: "There are no discussions about merging with Accor."
