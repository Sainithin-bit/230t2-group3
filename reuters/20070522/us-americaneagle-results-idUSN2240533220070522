 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Preppy clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc. ( AEO.N ) said on Tuesday that first-quarter net profit rose, but gave a second-quarter outlook that was below analysts' estimates, sending its shares down more than 4 percent. 

 The company gave a second-quarter earnings outlook of 34 cents to 36 cents per share. Analysts were expecting it to earn 37 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net profit was $78.8 million, or 35 cents a per share, in line with analysts' average estimate as compiled by Reuters Estimates, compared with $64.2 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. The company also authorized the repurchase of 23 million shares. Quarterly sales increased 17 percent to $612.4 million. Analysts had been expecting sales of $622.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Earlier this month, the mall-based teen retailer said sales at established stores fell 10 percent in April, well below Wall Street estimates. The company said "disappointing traffic trends" were behind the fall, but did not revise a first-quarter earnings outlook of 34 cents to 35 cents. But Chief Executive James O'Donnell said during an earnings conference call that "customers responded favorably to our summer assortment," which was introduced in stores during the second half of April. Woven shirts, AE jeans for boys and girls, knit tops and aerie-brand intimates drove quarterly sales. The retailer said its aerie line, available at American Eagle stores as well as its own shops in some locations, was a strong performer during spring. "Aerie has emerged as a true stand-alone brand," Chief Merchandising Officer Susan McGalla said during the call. The company plans to increase aerie's brand presence by introducing a line of accessories and a signature fragrance this year. It will also open 40 new aerie stores beginning in July. American Eagle shares were down $1.27 at $28.06 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
