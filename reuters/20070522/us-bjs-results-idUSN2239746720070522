 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. BJ.N said on Tuesday that quarterly profit fell more than 11 percent as it works to turn the business around, but the No. 3 U.S. warehouse club operator stuck by its full-year forecast. 

 The company, whose shares rose more than 2 percent, said profit for the first quarter that ended on May 5 declined to $13.65 million, or 21 cents per share, from $15.42 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain from the sale of pharmacy-related assets, earnings were 20 cents a share, meeting the analysts' average forecast compiled by Reuters Estimates. BJ's, which has lagged behind larger rivals Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) Sam's Club, is trying to get its business back on track in the face of disappointing sales and fewer shoppers. Chief Executive Herb Zarkin, named to the job in March after holding the position on an interim basis, is cutting the number of items that BJ's offers and is stocking merchandise that either has better margins or sells faster. "It was a decent quarter for BJ's, however with traffic trends still weak, there's still a lot more to go," Standard & Poor's retail equity analyst Joseph Agnese said of the company's turnaround efforts. WOW FACTOR Zarkin said on a conference call with analysts that the retailer was trying to sell more general merchandise and perishable items, which have higher margins. To take market share from supermarkets, BJ's will stock more high-quality meats, imported cheeses and organic produce, he said. It will also offer specialty items on a rotational basis so members can find new "wow" items. "We want our members who shop this department two times a month to shop it three times a month," Zarkin said. "We want the members who shop it three times to go to four times." But BJ's is still struggling to get customers into its stores, saying that excluding sales of gasoline, traffic fell about 1 percent. Zarkin said BJ's had hired more in-club recruitment specialists to sign up new members and retain current ones. Customers must buy memberships at BJ's to shop in its warehouses. Sales for the first quarter rose to $2.01 billion from $1.87 billion, while comparable-store sales increased 2.3 percent. BJ's said it had benefited from a 1.4 percent contribution from gasoline sales, but took a 0.4 percent hit from the absence of pharmacy sales this year. The company said in January that it would close its 46 in-house pharmacies and two ProFoods restaurant supply clubs. SLOWING STORE OPENINGS Zarkin said the retailer is planning to open five new clubs for the fiscal year ending February 2, down from a previous view of eight to 10 new clubs. For the fiscal year ending in early 2009, it forecast six to eight new clubs. For the near term, BJ's will open new clubs in markets where the stores have a "reasonable chance" of being profitable in their first full fiscal year, he said. Agnese said that slowing store expansion was positive for BJ's. "I think it's going to allow it to better focus on existing stores rather than continued expansion," he said. Chief Financial Officer Frank Forward said BJ's expected second-quarter earnings of 39 cents to 43 cents per share. Analysts have forecast 41 cents. For its fiscal year ending on February 2, Forward said BJ's still expects earnings per share of $1.60 to $1.70, while analysts are expecting $1.65. BJ's shares were up 79 cents, or 2.2 percent, at $36.30 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.
