 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Takeover news and speculation drove the Nasdaq to its highest close in more than six years on Tuesday, with casino and technology stocks leading the advance. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average both slipped, however, as a drop in oil prices hit energy shares and rising bond yields raised concerns that higher borrowing costs would slow the economy and hurt corporate profit growth. Shares of MGM Mirage surged 27 percent after investor Kirk Kerkorian expressed interest in buying two Las Vegas properties from MGM Mirage Inc. Speculation about more deals in the sector drove up the shares of rivals such as Wynn Resorts Ltd., up 7.4 percent on the Nasdaq. "On the plus side, we had the deals today. On the downside, there is a little uncertainty in the market surrounding the ongoing U.S.-China trade talks, and also with the 10-year bond yield creeping up," said Sam Rahman, portfolio manager of Baring Asset Management Inc., in Boston. "At this important resistance level of the all-time high on the S&P, it's natural that we would need a little bit more energy to break through that." The S&P 500 pulled back again to finish just about 3 points below its March 2000 record closing high, which was setin the last throes of the dot-com bubble. On Monday, the S&P 500 topped that record close at midday and then narrowly missed it at the closing bell. Stocks have rallied in the past two months on a rash of takeovers, record share buybacks and stronger-than-expected earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 2.93 points, or 0.02 percent, to end at 13,539.95,after hitting a fresh intraday record high of 13,586.68. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index dipped 0.98 of a point, or 0.06 percent, to finish at 1,524.12. But the Nasdaq Composite Index gained 9.23 points, or 0.36 percent, to close at 2,588.02. Takeover talk also drove up U.S.-listed shares of Canada's Research in Motion Ltd. and enticed options traders to pile into speculative positions, said Frederic Ruffy, an analyst at options education firm Optionetics in California. The BlackBerry maker's U.S.-listed stock climbed 4.6 percent to close at $159.06 on the Nasdaq. Energy stocks were the biggest drag on the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials as oil prices fell. Exxon Mobil fell almost 1 percent to $82.77 on the NYSE. U.S. crude oil futures fell $1.30, or 2 percent, to settle at $64.97 a barrel. Retailers' stocks fell after disappointing profit reports, reigniting some concerns about the outlook for consumer spending. Office supplies store Staples Inc. said sales of furniture and business machines were weak, while mall-based jeweler Zale Corp. said retail in general showed signs of weakness. Staples' stock fell 2.4 percent to $25.05 and was among the heaviest weights on the Nasdaq 100. But Zale's stock rose 1.1 percent to end at $27.91, recovering from its earlier drop to a session low at $27.06 in NYSE trading. Teen clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc. gave an outlook that missed estimates, sending its shares down 4.33 percent to $28.06 on the NYSE. GAMBLING GAINS An index of gambling casino stocks rose 1.1 percent. MGM Mirage ended at $79.98, up 27.1 percent and the second-biggest percentage gainer on the NYSE. Other casino stocks that rose included Wynn Resorts Ltd., up 7.4 percent at $101.15 on the Nasdaq, and Las Vegas Sands Inc., up 5.6 percent at $80.19 on the NYSE. Starwood Hotel & Resorts Worldwide Inc. stock gained 1.2 percent to close at $69.20 in NYSE trading. U.S. housing stocks notched their biggest advance in almost a month as stocks of mortgage lenders such as Accredited Home Lenders gained on news that iStar Financial Inc. agreed to buy Fremont General Corp.'s commercial real estate business for about $1.9 billion. The Dow Jones U.S. home construction index was up 3.5 percent. Accredited Home Lenders stock rose 4.9 percent to $13.38 on the Nasdaq, while Fremont General surged 40.7 percent to $10 and ranked as the NYSE's biggest percentage gainer. Shares of iStar Financial rose 3.9 percent to end at $47.60 in Big Board trading. Comments by U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson also lent support to housing stocks. Paulson said in an interview with CNBC television that the correction in the U.S. housing industry was "largely past." This week, Paulson is hosting a delegation led by Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi to discuss sticking points in bilateral trade relations, including the value of the yuan, as part of a "strategic economic dialogue" initiated last year. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.48 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.01 billion shares traded, slightly below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 6 to 5 on the NYSE and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq.
