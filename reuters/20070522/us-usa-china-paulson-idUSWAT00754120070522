 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday that China must speed up economic reforms and take steps to help the Bush administration persuade Congress that U.S. workers are benefiting from growing trade. 

 In television interviews prior to the opening of a two-day "strategic economic dialogue" with a top-level visiting delegation from China, Paulson said faster appreciation of China's yuan, or renminbi, would be helpful. "People are looking closely at the currency because ...it is a symbol for continued reform in China," Paulson said on CNBC television. "We have been arguing that it is important that the Chinese accelerate the flexibility, the pace of appreciation of the renminbi," he added. China announced on Friday it was widening a band within which it manages the value of the yuan against other currencies, but that has not tamped down anger in Congress over a record trade deficit with China that hit $233 billion last year. Paulson called the widening of the trading band helpful but said it was not enough. "They agree it needs to move, they've been moving it faster, but we'd like to see it move even more," he said. The strategic economic dialogue with China was initiated last year and the first round of discussion took place in Beijing in December. Paulson said the talks are designed to help manage long-term relations between the two key economic powers but also to handle short-term irritants. "As I explained to the Chinese, and they agree, we want to talk about the long-term issues, but we need to deal with the pressing short-term issues so we have enough confidence on both sides to keep moving forward," he said. In a separate interview on CNN television, Paulson said the issue of the safety of Chinese food imports was one topic for discussion. Tainted Chinese imports were blamed for pet-food deaths in America earlier this year and raised concerns about imports of both animal and human food. "We have (Chinese Vice Premier) Wu Yi and 15 top ministers and this dialogue is to talk about the major economic issues, long term and short term, so that is clearly one of the issues we're going to be talking with China about today," Paulson told CNN. Aside from the tightly guarded, closed-door official talks with the Chinese delegation, Paulson is taking Wu to Capitol Hill on Wednesday and Thursday to talk with U.S. lawmakers who are threatening punitive legislation against Chinese imports. In both the U.S. Senate and the House of Representatives, there has been criticism that China's currency is so undervalued that it represents an unfair trade subsidy and some form of legislative retaliation is widely considered likely. Paulson said he understood that many Americans do not believe the benefits of open trade are evenly shared, but he hoped that Wu's visit to capitol Hill would counter any impression that China was a threat. "Our exports to China are growing very quickly and we've got a big focus on opening up the Chinese markets for U.S. products and services and that will be a big focus of our discussion today," Paulson added.
