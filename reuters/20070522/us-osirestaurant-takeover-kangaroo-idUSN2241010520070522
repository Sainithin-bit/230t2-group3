 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Outback Steakhouse parent OSI Restaurant Partners Inc. said on Tuesday that a group, including Bain Capital, Catterton Partners and OSI's founders, has raised its offer by 3 percent to about $3.18 billion. 

 OSI, which said in November it planned to go private, last week delayed for the second time a shareholder vote on the deal, saying it needed more time to solicit votes. OSI shares gained about 50 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $40.91 in late-afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The investor group raised its offer to $41.15 per share from $40 per share. The previous offer would have been worth about $3.09 billion based on the company's latest share count. In such cases, the investors typically communicate with the shareholders either directly or through proxy advisors in coming up with a new price, said Morton Pierce, chairman of law firm Dewey Ballantine's mergers and acquisitions group. "Usually there is some dialogue and they let you know what they want," Pierce said. "In order for them to know that they aren't going to win, they've obviously been communicating with somebody." Such bid increases have happened in the past. For instance, Clear Channel Communications Inc. recently had to postpone several shareholder meetings to vote on a takeover while the investors trying to buy the company -- Bain and Thomas H. Lee Partners -- raised their offer to appease shareholders. In addition to Bain and Catterton, company founders Chairman Chris Sullivan, Vice Chairman Robert Basham and Director Emeritus J. Timothy Gannon, as well as Chief Executive A. William Allen are participating in the buyout of OSI. Sullivan, Basham and Gannon have agreed to receive only $40 for each of their shares, it said. OSI has agreed not to pay its regular quarterly cash dividend before the merger is closed or terminated. The shareholder vote is expected to take place at a meeting on June 5, the company said. It initially had been set for May 8. The investor group is trying to buy the company through units called Kangaroo Holdings and Kangaroo Acquisition.
