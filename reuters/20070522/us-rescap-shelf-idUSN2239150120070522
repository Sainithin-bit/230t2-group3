 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Residential Capital LLC, a real estate finance company wholly owned by GMAC Mortgage Group LLC, filed with regulators on Tuesday to periodically sell up to $12.5 billion in senior debt securities and subordinated debt securities. 

 The company said in a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it would use the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. Under a shelf registration, a company may sell securities in one or more separate offerings, with the size, price and terms determined at the time of sale.
