 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L said it has decided to join a group bidding for Spanish airline Iberia IBLA.MC led by private equity firm Texas Pacific Group 

  TPG.UL. TPG and its partners have already made an indicative bid worth 3.4 billion euros ($4.6 billion) for Iberia, or 3.60 euros per share. "British Airways has joined with TPG Capital, Vista Capital, Inversiones Ibersuizas and Quercus Equity to investigate a possible consortium offer for Iberia," BA said on Tuesday. "If a bid was successful, Iberia would remain in Spanish control, and the Spanish investors would put in more than 50 percent of the total capital investment," said a spokeswoman for BA, which already owns 10 percent of Iberia. Without Spanish control, Iberia would have to renegotiate airport landing deals with Latin American states, on which its most sought-after routes are based. "Our stake in Iberia has been very beneficial to BA, and we'd anticipate that continuing," added the spokeswoman. "But we're exploring our options and haven't ruled out anything, including disposing of the stake." RIVAL BIDDER TPG founder David Bonderman is no stranger to airlines as chairman of Irish budget carrier Ryanair ( RYA.I ) and as the man behind takeovers of Continental Airlines CAL.N in the 1990s and the catering arm of defunct carrier Swissair in 2002. BA said there was no guarantee a formal bid would be made, but it ruled out making any further investment of its own in Iberia and said it would not make any independent bid for the carrier. BA shares were down 1.7 percent at 472 pence by 1017 GMT, valuing the group at around 5.5 billion pounds ($10.8 billion). But analysts said the shares had largely moved as a result of an increase in the price of oil. "Earnings remain at risk, with high sensitivity to any further weakness on U.S./UK tourism spending, currency effects and to the oil price," Florence Tassan at Societe Generale said in a research note. The consortium could face a rival bid from private equity group Apax APAX.UL, which the Spanish press has reported has the support of Torreal and Inversiones Hemisferio, investment vehicles owned by Spanish billionaires Juan Abello and Jose Manuel Lara respectively. BA had wanted to roll TPG and Apax into one bid team to ensure it did not back the wrong consortium or allow a bidding war to drive up the price, sources close to the deal have said. But an industry source said on Tuesday the door was now closed to Apax. "BA and Apax had detailed discussions, but the two sides couldn't reach agreement on a number of key commercial issues," said the source. "The consortium BA announced today is final." Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) repeated on Tuesday it was interested in Iberia, but said the Spanish carrier was too expensive to justify a takeover. In addition to its 10 percent holding in the Spanish airline, British Airways has the right of first refusal over another 27 percent making it a pivotal player in any battle for control. A bid is not expected until due diligence finishes in two or three months. Iberia is expected to open its books to the consortium any time from now, a source close to the deal said. Spanish financial investors will represent at least 51 percent of the bid offer, in order to maintain Iberia's landing rights. However, they will only account for between 40 and 50 percent of the consortium's total investment, as other financial vehicles, such as loans or bonds, are now being negotiated, a source close to the talks said.
