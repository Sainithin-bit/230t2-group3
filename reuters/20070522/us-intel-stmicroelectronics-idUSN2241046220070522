 NEW YORK/PARIS  (Reuters) - Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) and STMicroelectronics are hiving off their flash memory units and putting them together with the backing of private equity firm Francisco Partners, the two companies said on Tuesday. 

 The deal, if approved by regulators, will help the combined group build scale and address fierce price competition for flash memory products, fitted in mobile phones, MP3 players and digital cameras. The transaction will also enable the two chips makers to offload businesses that weighed on their profit margins. "Our objective is to break even in the first quarter (of combined operations) ... not to lose any money," STMicro ( STM.PA ) Chief Executive Carlo Bozotti told a conference call. Under the terms of the transaction, STMicro, Europe's leading chip maker, will sell its flash memory assets to the newly formed company, while Intel, the world's top semiconductor group, will sell its NOR flash memory assets and resources. In exchange, Intel would get a 45.1 percent stake and a $432 million cash payment, while STMicro would receive a 48.6 percent holding and $468 million in cash. Francisco Partners plans to invest $150 million in cash for convertible preferred stock representing a 6.3 percent stake in the venture, subject to adjustments in certain circumstances. STMicro and Intel said the deal had substantial scope for savings but declined to give figures. They estimated the new unit to have an enterprise value of about $3 billion but would not say how much cash the new entity already had. STMicro said ultimately the aim was to float the business. "Our objective is that this company will go public," Bozotti said. LONG AWAITED DEAL STMicro, which had already placed its flash memory business into a stand-alone unit, said earlier this year it was in discussion with potential partners. The Franco-Italian group has moved much of its manufacturing to Asia over the past three years to lower costs. The sale of its flash memory business is part of a wider strategy to cut capital spending. Intel has already turned over its unit making NAND flash memory to a venture with Micron Technology Inc MU.N and industry analysts have long speculated it would spin off its loss-making NOR flash business. NAND flash, which can retain data after power is shut off, is widely used in digital cameras, photo-snapping phones and portable music players such as Apple Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) iPod. NOR is used to store software programs in phones and other electronics. The newly formed business, which last year generated $3.6 billion in combined revenues, would receive a $1.3 billion term loan and a $250 million revolver facility. Loan proceeds would be used for working capital and to settle payments to STMicro and Intel. Intel said its gross profit margin would improve due to the deal but would remain in line with its April forecast for a 2007 gross margin of 51 percent, plus or minus a few points. Intel shares were up 18 cents or 0.8 percent to $22.81 on Nasdaq by 1619 GMT. STMicro's U.S. shares were up 28 cents or 1.4 percent at $20.16 on the New York Stock Exchange. The new venture, for which a name has yet to been found, will be headed by Brian Harrison, currently vice president and general manager of Intel's flash memory group. The two companies expected to close the deal in the second half of 2007. (Additional reporting by Anup Roy in Bangalore)
