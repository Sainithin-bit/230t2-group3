 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group BG.UL will likely have to offer more yield on its massive $7.4 billion commercial mortgage-backed securitization in early June to boost investor confidence in its stand-alone deal. 

 Blackstone-EOP's sale, backed by Equity Office Property, is currently being marketed to investors by underwriters Goldman Sachs, Banc of America and Bear Stearns ahead of its pricing in June, market sources said. The offering would be the second largest deal in the CMBS market this year, after Wachovia Securities' $7.9 billion sale in March. Unlike Wachovia's conduit structure, which involved multiple loans and borrowers, Blackstone-EOP's transaction includes a single borrower, raising investor exposure in just one name. As a result, it is likely to require additional yield spread from investors, analysts said. "This (deal) is not like those in our conduit market, where you say here's where this tranche, with this average life and rating, are pricing. It's a one-off deal," said Alan Todd, head of CMBS research at JP Morgan Securities. However, a quality issuer, strong collateral and the extra spread could lure investors to the deal. "I would think there's a fair amount of investors out there who say, I like the properties, I like the story and I'm willing to take the lack of diversification for the extra spread," Todd said. Lisa Pendergast, managing director of CMBS at RBS Greenwich Capital, agrees investors may be enticed. "Lately some of the single borrower deals actually get taken down just as well as multi-borrower deals. In this particular case, investors will consider the collateral supporting the Blackstone-EOP deal, which is very high quality, so they are probably more willing to take that on," she said. Wider CMBS spreads will also make it more likely that investors will see additional yield, making it more expensive for the issuer to borrow. Since the beginning of the year, even top-tier "AAA"-rated issues in the CMBS market widened by 6 basis points, traders said. Issuance of CMBS has been heavy. Currently, about $17 billion in deals remain on the calendar of supply through the end of May and that amount is expected to get kicked up to $50 billion by June end, dealers said. Blackstone-EOP's upcoming CMBS floating-rate offering is backed by 145 office properties in 13 cities, led by Boston, New York, Chicago, San Jose, San Francisco and Los Angeles. For details, see <ID:nN21336313>. CMBS sales are growing as private equity firms such as Blackstone Group are able to raise money more cheaply through securitization versus bank loans. Private equity firms buy companies, restructure their businesses, and sell them. Blackstone acquired Equity Office Properties (EOP) Trust, the largest U.S. office landlord for $23 billion in February. Shortly after, it sold nearly half the Equity Office portfolio for roughly $20 billion, analysts said. While a much larger $15 billion sale from Blackstone-EOP was anticipated by the market in recent months, its Equity Office property sales and an $11.4 billion mezzanine loan priced in late February, according to market sources, which are likely to have curbed the need for additional financing. A spokesman for Blackstone declined to comment on the deal.
