 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - Alcan Inc. AL.TO is considering all its strategic options after rejecting a $28 billion hostile takeover bid from U.S. rival Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), the Canadian aluminum producer's chief executive said on Tuesday. 

 "We are in ongoing discussions with other third parties. Our board has asked us to evaluate all alternatives, both internal and external," CEO Dick Evans told Reuters in an interview. Evans declined to identify the others Alcan was talking to, or specify whether Alcan would consider trying to take over Alcoa. "If we thought that it would be productive and could lead to a good outcome for our shareholders...of course we would enter into discussions with anyone," he said. But after two years of merger talks between the two big aluminum makers failed over issues of value, and what Evans said was Alcoa's refusal to sign a two-year confidentiality and standstill agreement, he said he doubts the two companies could come to an agreement. "On the terms of the price proposed by Alcoa, we think it makes no sense to enter into negotiations," Evans added. Alcan's stock slipped 33 Canadian cents to C$88.22 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 7 cents to $81.03 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The shares are still trading about 8.6 percent above the $74.60 a share value of Alcoa's cash-and-stock offer, which suggests investors expect bidding for the Canadian company to go higher. NO HASTY NEXT MOVE Evans said Alcan will not be pressed into making a hasty next move. "It is essential that we get it right and not rush to a decision," he said. "At this point, we do not consider the current Alcoa offer to be a meaningful alternative for us." Evans said he and Alain Belda, chief executive of Alcoa, talked about merging the two companies up until mid-September, but ultimately could proceed no further. "They were unwilling at the end of the day to enter into a standard confidentiality and standstill agreement that we had requested," he said. Evans said he was advised on October 20 that Alcoa's board could not agree to those points because its board wanted to keep the option "to go hostile". Analysts have said that Alcan's best defense against Alcoa's bid may be the Canadian company's deep economic and social commitments to the French-speaking province of Quebec. Under terms of an agreement between Alcan and the Quebec government signed December 13, the company promises to keep its head office in Montreal, invest heavily in the province and prudently manage its access to the waterways used to produce the large amounts of electricity needed to make aluminum. In return, Quebec provides more than $450 million in financing and tax breaks for Alcan's proposed $1.8 billion project to expand its smelter capacity in the province. Quebec also renews and extends long-term power contracts that provide cheap electricity to Alcan for its energy-hungry smelters. Evans said Alcan's pact with Quebec is not a "poison pill" aimed at thwarting a takeover attempt, but it ensures that Quebec has a say about the company's presence in the province. "It also protects Alcan from a reckless or highly conditional bid by requiring the bidder to having a clear or non-condition bid before it would have to be considered," he said. Alcoa has touted the fact that the two companies' share a history in the province of 7.5 million. Alcan was formed as a subsidiary of Alcoa in 1902, and was spun out from its parent in 1928 under a U.S. court antitrust order. Alcoa says its offer meets Quebec's requirements and would honor commitments made by both companies to expand in the province. ($1=$1.09 Canadian)
