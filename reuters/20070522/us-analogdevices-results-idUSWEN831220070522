 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Chipmaker Analog Devices Inc. ADI.N posted a lower quarterly profit on Tuesday, as research and development expenses rose and it took a charge. 

 The company also forecast a revenue range for the current quarter that was below some analysts' estimates and its shares fell 6 percent in extended trade. Analog Devices said that it expects its third-quarter gross margin to be about the same as in the second quarter, reflecting its plan to hold back on chip production in its factories. It expects to boost output in the fourth quarter. The company said second-quarter net income fell to $125.4 million, or 37 cents per share, from $145.8 million, or 39 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 4 percent to $669.1 million. Excluding items, Analog Devices said it had second-quarter profit of 40 cents per share. Analysts had forecast profit of 37 cents per share, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. For the current quarter, the company said it expects earnings per share before items of 37 cents to 41 cents, on revenue of $655 million to $685 million. Analysts currently expect a per-share profit of 40 cents, on average, and revenue of $684 million. Research and development spending in the second quarter rose to $146.7 million from $131.8 million a year ago. Shares of Analog Devices rose 28 cents to close at $40.42. In extended play, the stock declined to $37.99.
