 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBRL Group Inc. ( CBRL.O ), parent of the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain, on Tuesday reported sharply lower quarterly earnings due to higher labor and food costs, higher interest expenses and weak sales at its gift shops. 

 Net income for the fiscal third quarter ended April 27 fell to $12.3 million, or 45 cents per share, down 49 percent from $24.0 million, or 47 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said it had 43 percent fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter due to a recapitalization initiative begun last year. That initiative also led to higher interest expense, the company said. CBRL, based in Lebanon, Tennessee, posted earnings of 44 cents per share from continuing operations. Analysts on average were expecting profit of 45 cents per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Total revenue rose 3 percent to $549.1 million, up from $534.0 million a year before. Same-store sales at restaurants were flat with a year earlier, while comparable sales at the company's gift shops, which are housed inside its restaurants, fell 0.9 percent. CBRL expects total revenue for the fourth quarter to increase 12 percent to 12.5 percent from the year-ago period's revenue from continuing operations, helped by an extra week. It expects same-store sales to be flat to up 1 percent at restaurants and up 4 percent to 5 percent at stores. Analysts on average are expecting earnings of $1.03 per share excluding items for the fourth quarter on revenue of $642.0 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
