   DUBAI (Reuters) - Halliburton ( HAL.N ) said on Tuesday it was looking for major investors to take a long-term stake in its eastern hemisphere operation and is eyeing around $80 billion in projects worldwide over the next five years. 

 "One of my goals would be to find a set of investors or investor interested in taking a longer-term investment in the company," Halliburton CEO Dave Lesar said, when asked if the global oil services firm was searching for major investors for its eastern hemisphere expansion.
