 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - California savings & loan Fremont General Corp. FMT.N is expected to survive its subprime mortgage woes after striking two deals on Tuesday, sending its shares soaring, but the bank will emerge a smaller company under new management. 

 Fremont, whose exposure to home buyers with poor credit dragged down its earnings and stock price in recent months, said it would sell its commercial real estate lending business to iStar Financial Inc. ( SFI.N ) for about $1.9 billion up front plus an interest in the loan portfolio. The company will also sell a minority stake in itself to an investor group led by former S&L executive Gerald Ford for about $80 million in preferred stock and warrants. A Fremont spokesman said the Ford group will initially hold a 16 percent stake; he declined to say when the deal will close. The news sent Fremont shares up 38 percent in midday trade. Other subprime lenders' shares also rose as the news showed that struggling subprime companies continue to attract buyers and raise enough funds to avoid bankruptcy. The Ford group, which formerly ran California thrift Golden State Bancorp Inc., could boost its equity stake to 20 percent, which would be worth roughly $112 million based on Fremont's current market value of roughly $560 million. New management will use proceeds from the commercial unit sale to develop new lending and retail banking businesses, outgoing Fremont CEO Louis Rampino said in a statement. Before Tuesday, Fremont shares had lost 77 percent of their value since reaching a record high at the end of November 2004. They fell 58 percent over the past six months, when worries about subprime mortgage losses prompted investors to flee. FRESH START? Investors are betting on the Ford group, which rolled up a series of thrifts into Golden State, the nation's third-largest savings and loan, can repeat their success with Fremont. Citigroup ( C.N ) bought Golden State in 2002 for $5.8 billion. "This is the team who orchestrated the sale of Golden State," said Sky Capital LLC analyst Theodore Kovaleff. "Three years from now, I have got to believe that Fremont will be history. It will be sold at a nice premium." Ford will become the bank's chairman. Former Golden State executive Carl Webb will be chief executive of Fremont and Randy Staff its chief financial officer. Fremont is one of several subprime mortgage lenders hurt by the rise of borrower defaults, late payments and a downturn in housing prices over the past year. Dozens of lenders have quit the business, while New Century Financial Corp. NEWCQ.PK and others have been forced into bankruptcy. In April Fremont announced it had reached a tentative pact to sell its subprime business and $2.9 billion of loans, at a $100 million loss. Fremont on Tuesday said the buyer of the subprime unit is hedge fund Ellington Capital Management. The subprime unit deal is still pending. Earlier this year, Fremont's auditors resigned and bank regulators ordered it to stop making new subprime loans. The company in March sold $4 billion in subprime loans at a $140 million loss at a time rival lenders scrambled to stay afloat. New York-based iStar, which provides investment capital to real estate owners, agreed to buy Fremont's commercial real estate loans and fund up to about $4.4 billion in unfunded loan commitments. The purchase of the commercial real estate lending unit is expected to be completed by June 30. Santa Monica, California-based Fremont will receive payment of 30 percent of the portfolio upfront in cash, or $1.9 billion. Going forward it will also receive interest payments from the remaining 70 percent to be controlled by iStar. IStar expects the purchase to boost its 2007 earnings by 10 cents to 20 cents a share. It will retain most of Fremont's commercial real estate employees in eight U.S. cities. Fremont shares were up $2.83 at $9.90 on the New York Stock Exchange, while IStar rose $2.23, or 4.9 percent, to $48.04.
