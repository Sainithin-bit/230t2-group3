 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jewelry retailer Zale Corp. ( ZLC.N ) reported a quarterly loss on Tuesday as severe weather before Valentine's Day chilled sales and it changed to a different jewelry protection plan. 

 The net loss was $3.1 million, or 6 cents a share, in the third quarter ended April 30, compared with a year-ago profit of $16.8 million, or 35 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had expected a loss of 10 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Excluding an adjustment in revenue recognition for changing to a lifetime jewelry protection plan and the impact of an accounting change, the company earned 5 cents per share. Quarterly sales decreased 2.9 percent to $511.9 million. The company had warned that sales were hurt as snowstorms and icy weather preceding Valentine's Day forced it to shut several stores. The company lowered its fourth-quarter same-store sales forecast to a decrease of 2 percent to 3 percent from the year-ago quarter. Same-store sales, which tracks sales at stores open at least one year, is a key measure of retail strength. Zale still expects a loss of between 1 cent and 5 cents a share, excluding items, in the fourth quarter. "We believe retail in general is showing signs of weakness, and higher gas prices have directly impacted the discretionary income of the moderate customer," Chief Executive Betsy Burton said in a statement.
