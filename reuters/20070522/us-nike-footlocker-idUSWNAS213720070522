 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Nike Inc. ( NKE.N ) and Foot Locker Inc. ( FL.N ) said on Tuesday that they plan to open up to 50 "House of Hoops by Foot Locker" stores selling only Nike basketball products over the next three years. 

 The U.S. stores will sell Nike's namesake, Jordan and Converse basketball footwear, apparel and equipment. The companies expect to convert an existing Foot Locker location in New York's Harlem neighborhood into the first House of Hoops store, which should open in early 2008. Besides New York, the companies expect to open stores in Chicago, Houston, Las Vegas and Los Angeles. Most of the stores will be converted Foot Locker locations, the companies said.
