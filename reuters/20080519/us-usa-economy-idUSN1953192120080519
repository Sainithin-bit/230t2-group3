 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The economy is weak but has sidestepped a recession, according to a key forecasting gauge that rose for the second straight month in April, the Conference Board reported on Monday. 

 The private Conference Board said its Leading Economic Indicators index rose 0.1 percent, after a matching increase in March, which was unrevised. "These data certainly reflect a weak economy, but not one in recession," Ken Goldstein, a labor economist at the group, said in a statement. "Moreover, the small increases in the Leading Index in both March and again in April could be a signal that the economy may not weaken further." The Coincident Index, a measure of current conditions, was unchanged in April and March, while the Lagging Index rose 0.1 percent in April and 0.4 percent in March.
