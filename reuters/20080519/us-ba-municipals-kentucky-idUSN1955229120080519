 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court decided in The Department of Revenue of Kentucky vs. George and Catherine Davis on Monday that states can continue giving tax breaks on municipal bonds sold within their borders while taxing interest from ones sold elsewhere. 

 Here are some facts about the case: * The 7-2 vote overturns a decision made by the Kentucky Court of Appeals in January 2006 that the tax breaks violate the "dormant Commerce Clause" of the U.S. Constitution, the implied prohibition against states erecting trade barriers. * The Supreme Court primarily based its decision on a case it decided last year known as United Haulers, where it ruled states can favor state-run businesses over private ones. * Forty-two states exempt interest from municipal bonds sold in their states from personal income tax. If the court had upheld the Kentucky decision, those states would have had to either tax interest from all bonds or exempt interest from all bonds. * A Supreme Court decision in 1988, South Carolina v. Baker, stated that the U.S. Congress has the power to tax interest on state and local long-term bonds, but so far the federal government has kept those bonds free from federal taxation. *The total value of municipal bonds outstanding is about $2.5 trillion. *According to the Investment Company Institute, municipal bond funds had a total net asset value in March of $372.8 billion and in February of $362.4 billion. * Nearly 500 mutual funds invest in municipal bonds to take advantage of the tax breaks. In 2007, single state funds had total assets $155.83 billion. If the Kentucky decision had been upheld, they would have had to find new investments, disband or reorganize to sell a national roster of bonds. (Reporting by  Lisa Lambert )
