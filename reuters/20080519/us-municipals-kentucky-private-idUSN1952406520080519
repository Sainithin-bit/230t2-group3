 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left a question mark over the taxation of interest on bonds that state and local governments sell for private projects when it ruled in favor of tax-exemption policies in the municipal bond market. 

 In a footnote to the 7-2 ruling, Justice David Souter said the argument over states' tax exemptions for these so-called private-activity bonds was barely developed in the case, and said the matter was best set aside at this time. The footnote "clearly leaves the validity of the tax exemption for those bonds unsettled," Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank based in Washington, said in an interview. "Now, are they (the Supreme Court) going to be receptive to a challenge to the exemption for private activity bonds?" Viard said. "Well, maybe not." Michael Semes, a tax partner at law firm Blank Rome in Philadelphia, said any challenge to a state tax exemption for private-activity bonds would take years to wind through the court system, giving the market time to adjust to any potential ruling. States, local governments and their agencies regularly issue bonds for private businesses to spur economic development and jobs. These projects include sports stadiums, manufacturing facilities, housing, and pollution-control equipment for ethanol and electricity plants. However, private-activity bond issuance is limited by a volume cap that the federal government sets each year based on states' populations. In 2008, the cap is about $32 billion, according to the National Council on State Housing Agencies. Pressure is building in the federal government to raise the cap as a salve for current mortgage problems. President George W. Bush has proposed increasing it by $15 billion so that more mortgage revenue bonds can be issued to refinance shaky loans. The House of Representatives included a similar $10 billion boost in the housing assistance bill it passed on May 9. The high court's ruling overturned a Kentucky court decision that prohibited the state from exempting interest on bonds sold by Kentucky issuers from income taxes while at the same time taxing interest on out-of-state bonds. The much-anticipated ruling by the high court was key for the $2.5 trillion municipal bond market, but inspired mixed reactions on what it means for debt from Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories. The territories, which also include Guam and the Virgin Islands, sell bonds that are "non-taxable in other jurisdictions," meaning they are exempt from city, state and federal taxation no matter where the investor lives, Jay Abrams, chief municipal bond analyst at FMS Bonds Inc., said in an interview. The decision will likely not have much impact on demand for Puerto Rico's bonds because they would have been free from state taxes regardless of how the court ruled, he said. But others said the decision helped make Puerto Rico's bonds attractive to buyers. "The Supreme Court's ruling today kept Puerto Rico-issued municipal debt valuable to those around the United States who may be unable to find an appropriate in-state bond to buy," said Michael Pietronico, chief executive officer of Miller Tabak's Municipal Asset Management division in New York.
