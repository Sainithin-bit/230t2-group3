 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet company Yahoo Inc said on Sunday that it was considering a "number of value maximizing strategic alternatives" and would evaluate any proposal made by Microsoft Corp.. 

 Yahoo recently rebuffed a $33 a share takeover offer from Microsoft. Microsoft said earlier on Sunday it has proposed an alternative deal to Yahoo rather than a full acquisition. In a statement, Yahoo said it had confirmed with Microsoft that it was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of all of the company, but it was considering alternatives and remained open to pursuing any deal in the best interest of stockholders. The board "will evaluate each of our alternatives, including any Microsoft proposal, consistent with its fiduciary duties, with a focus on maximizing stockholder value," it said.
