 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has not had discussions about Yahoo Inc with activist investor Carl Icahn although it has reached out to Yahoo, a person close to Microsoft said on Sunday. 

 Microsoft walked away from its $47.5 billion buyout offer of Yahoo earlier this month after Yahoo rejected its final offer of $33 a share, holding out for at least $37 a share. Icahn has launched a campaign to replace Yahoo's board with directors who would reopen talks with Microsoft and harshly criticized Yahoo for the breakdown in talks.
