 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Edison International ( EIX.N ) subsidiary Edison Mission will pay $9 million for misleading investigators at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the agency said on Monday. 

 During a FERC investigation into Edison's wholesale electricity market bidding practices on the Northeast power grid, Edison Mission "made a series of representations and produced data and documents to staff regarding its supply offer strategy that ... were found to have resulted in misleading FERC enforcement staff," the agency said in a release. The grid, PJM Interconnection LLC, coordinates the power grid in 13 northeast U.S. states and the District of Columbia and provides power for about 51 million people. Boston-based Edison Mission Marketing and Trading confirmed the settlement, and said it will pay a $7 million civil penalty and spend about $2 million on a regulatory compliance program. FERC described a "protracted" effort by Edison Mission to mislead agency investigators during the investigation, which the agency started in July 2005. "Edison Mission's acts that misled were protracted, related to core issues under investigation and caused extensive misallocation of resources," the agency said. "We expect subjects of investigations to defend themselves," FERC Chairman Joseph Kelliher said. "However, providing investigators with false or misleading information crosses the line in violation of our rules." (Reporting by  Chris Baltimore , editing by Matthew Lewis)
