 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailer Dillard's Inc ( DDS.N ) said on Monday that it expects to open only four new stores in 2009 and that cost cutting could result in savings of about $50 million in fiscal 2008. 

 The company, which made the announcement in conjunction with its annual meeting on May 17, also said that so far this year it has closed three underperforming stores and plans to close six more. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
