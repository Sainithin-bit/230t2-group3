 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ), the world's leading maker of cockpit electronics, reaffirmed its sales and profit forecasts for the year on Monday, and said U.S. economic weakness so far has had minimal impact on its businesses. 

 "We feel pretty good about where we are," CEO Dave Cote told an electrical industry conference in Florida. "The aerospace cycle looks good over the next four or five years." Honeywell said in presentation materials it expects 2008 sales in a range of $36.8 billion to $37.4 billion, and earnings per share of $3.70 to $3.80. Asked about the impact of a possible U.S. recession on Honeywell's range of businesses, Cote said: "If this is as bad as a recession gets for us, then this isn't going to be so bad at all." Other than orders tied to new construction, Honeywell has seen "almost no diminution in order trends." He added the company tried to budget conservatively for costs and new investments in case the economy slows appreciably, but "so far we really haven't seen it." Separately, Cote said the company had no plans to sell its consumer products group, which makes products like thermostats and antifreeze, and where growth has lagged other divisions. "I'm not happy with the performance in the business," Cote said. "That being said, it is not for sale ... and I would just say even if it was, now would not be a smart time to do it." Honeywell shares were up $1.01 at $62.82 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski, editing by Dave Zimmerman)
