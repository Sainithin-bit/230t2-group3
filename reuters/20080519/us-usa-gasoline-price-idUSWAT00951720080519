 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. drivers are facing more sticker shock at the pump as the average price for gasoline soared 6.9 cents over the last week to a new record of $3.79 a gallon, the federal Energy Information Administration said on Monday. 

 The national price for regular, self-service gasoline is up 57 cents from a year ago because of rising crude oil prices that recently reached a record near $128 barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. (Reporting by  Tom Doggett )
