 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A $700-billion proposal for bailing out stressed financial firms would permit the Federal Reserve to begin paying interest on bank reserves, giving it another tool for easing credit strains. 

 The draft legislation says the Fed would get authority on October 1 to pay interest on reserves that financial institutions hold with the U.S. central bank. That would provide it another tool for making funds available to banks and large financial institutions to ensure ample liquidity in credit markets. It would also encourage banks to deposit their excess funds with the U.S. central bank rather than put them into money markets, and so would make it easier for the Fed to manage its key overnight federal funds lending rate target, now at 2 percent. In 2006, Congress authorized the Fed to begin paying interest on reserves but delayed implementation until 2011. The financial bailout proposals say the measure to start paying interest should be amended by "striking October 1, 2011, and inserting October 1, 2008." Congress is expected to vote on the bill this week (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
