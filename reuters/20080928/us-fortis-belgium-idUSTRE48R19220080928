 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgium's national pride and thousands of jobs are at stake as the Belgian and Dutch governments, central banks and regulators seek to secure the future of financial services group Fortis. 

 When the Belgo-Dutch banking and insurance company joined a consortium last year with Royal Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander to buy ailing Dutch bank ABN AMRO, it stirred a rare burst of pride in this linguistically divided country. For once, smaller Belgium -- chronically split between its majority Dutch-speakers and minority French-speakers -- appeared to have the upper hand with the Netherlands, often resented as an overbearing northern neighbor. A Fortis executive involved in the takeover negotiations said soothing political sensitivities in both countries was the trickiest part of the deal. But pride comes before a fall. Fortis bought its share of ABN at the top of the market, a few weeks before the sub-prime crisis in the United States triggered a global credit crunch. The need for capital to pay for its 24.2 billion euro ($35.40 billion) purchase brought the bank to its current plight. Fortis lost more than one third of its market value last week as its shares fell for five straight days, culminating in a 20 percent plunge on Friday, amid concerns about liquidity. Ironically, one possible rescue measure under consideration, according to the Dutch business daily Financieele Dagblad on Sunday, would involve re-selling ABN AMRO. TOO BIG TO FAIL? The Belgian and Dutch governments, national regulators and central banks have spent the weekend working on measures to restore confidence in Fortis because the company is too big and too politically sensitive to be allowed to fail. With 85,000 employees worldwide, it is Belgium's biggest private sector employer, and 1.5 million Belgian households -- encompassing nearly half the country of 10.5 million people -- have accounts or insurance policies at Fortis. "No saver will be left by the wayside," Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme pledged in parliament on Friday, seeking to reassure the public and avoid a panic withdrawal of funds. Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos noted that the Dutch National Bank and banking supervisor still had to give clearance for the final stages of ABN's integration into Fortis. Asked whether the current crisis might have an impact on the process, Bos said: "It may affect our verdict on the (financial) health of the concern into which ABN AMRO is being integrated when we decide on giving our statement of no objection." Fortis's history pre-dates the creation of Belgium in 1831. A precursor, the Algemeene Nederlandsche Maatschappij ter Begunstiging van de Volksvlijt, was founded in 1822 during the brief 15-year unification of Belgium and the Netherlands following the defeat of Napoleon. The modern company was born in the first cross-border financial merger in 1990 to become one of Europe's top 20 financial groups combining insurance, banking and asset management. Jean-Paul Votron, the CEO who led Fortis into the ABN deal but quit in July amid shareholder anger over a capital increase and a skipped dividend, was convinced the bank needed a market capitalization of 50 billion euros to avoid being taken over. He briefly achieved that with the ABN deal, but by last Friday, Fortis's market value was down to just 13 billion euros. (editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Charles Dick)
