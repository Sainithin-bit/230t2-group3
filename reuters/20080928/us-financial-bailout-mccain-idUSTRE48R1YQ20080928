 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain said on Sunday he hoped to support a $700 billion Wall Street bailout package that has been brokered by the Bush administration and the U.S. Congress. 

 "Hopefully yes," the Arizona senator said when asked on the ABC television network whether he would support the deal. McCain said the deal was something people would have to "swallow hard" and go forward with. (Reporting by  Jeff Mason , Editing by Sandra Maler)
