 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democratic congressional leaders said on Sunday they hope to move a bill to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives as soon as Monday on the proposed $700-billion government bailout of Wall Street. 

 "It is my hope that we'll be able to take it up tomorrow," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters at a briefing. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from Nevada, said the Senate could take up the bill by Wednesday. "As soon as we get this from the House, we're going to move on it ... There are ways we could move this as early as Wednesday," he said. Draft legislation to authorize the U.S. Treasury Department to purchase as much as $700 billion in broken mortgage-backed securities, in an effort to get locked-up capital markets moving again, has been posted on the Web site of the House Financial Services Committee, Pelosi said. Asked at the briefing whether Democrats would be willing to make additional changes to the bill to attract more Republican support, Speaker Pelosi said, "The bill is frozen."
