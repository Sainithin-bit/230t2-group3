 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers geared up to vote on Monday on creating a $700 billion government fund to buy bad debt and alleviate the financial crisis while European authorities raced to the rescue of three troubled banks. 

 With global markets hanging on every twist and turn in Washington, European regulators on Sunday scrambled to prevent two banks from collapsing. U.S. President George W. Bush said the plan being finalized by Congress provides the tools and funding to protect the U.S. economy from a "system-wide breakdown." House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi insisted the plan was not a "bailout of Wall Street," but a way to protect taxpayers and turn around the economy, since it included strong oversight and guarantees for public money. The dollar edged up against the euro and yen on Sunday while U.S. stock futures held steady. Analysts predicted a Monday relief rally, but warned there was no guarantee it would be sustained. "I think there will be a sigh of relief (in the markets). Essentially, we will be given nitroglycerin to prevent a heart attack and get some color back in our face," said Sung Won Sohn, professor of economics at California State University. Pelosi said the House could vote on the bill on Monday and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said the Senate could take it up by Wednesday. Congressional leaders from both parties said they had a tentative agreement early on Sunday, but questions abound as to whether the U.S. financial rescue plan, which would use taxpayer funds to buy up toxic mortgage debt, would restore confidence to shaky markets and head off a deeper downturn. Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York, predicted a relief rally in most markets on Monday as any rescue package would be seen as better than inaction. "But the bailout is just a band-aid over a very large problem," she added. "It will help Wall Street in the very short term, but it won't help Main Street -- the U.S. economy will remain challenged in many fronts." EUROPEAN BANK RESCUES In a sign of the spreading financial crisis, Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis faced a shotgun nationalization after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet held emergency talks with Dutch and Belgian officials to rescue one of Europe's top 20 banks. In London, regulators were also preparing to nationalize troubled mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley and were discussing a sale of its savings deposits and branches, people familiar with the matter said. In Germany, Hypo Real Estate was in urgent talks with banking regulator Bafin and the finance ministry about solving a refinancing squeeze at the bank, sources with knowledge of the matter said on Sunday. "Up to now, the typical global investor saw most of the stress here in the United States," said David Dietze, chief investment strategist at Point View Financial Services in New Jersey, describing the Fortis news as "a whopper." "Now investors may say 'Gee, even though a bill may get passed in the U.S. ... can the Europeans move as quickly? Do they understand the problem?'" he said. The New York Times said Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co were locked in a bidding war on Sunday over a possible emergency takeover of Wachovia Corp, the sixth-largest U.S. bank. Citing people involved in the talks, it said the U.S. government, led by the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, were also involved in the Sunday talks after a 27 percent drop in the bank's shares on Friday. QUALIFIED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT In Washington, U.S. congressional leaders from both parties emerged early on Sunday with a tentative agreement that altered key parts of a Wall Street bailout program initially proposed by the Bush administration. They worked through Sunday to win the support of rank-and-file lawmakers. Some Republicans, many of whom are eyeing re-election in November, cautioned they wanted to be certain the plan would shift some costs to a new form of bad debt insurance funded by Wall Street. Both U.S. presidential candidates offered qualified support for the bailout proposal, an issue that threatens to overshadow their campaigns with less than six weeks until the election. "This is something that all of us will swallow hard and go forward with," Republican John McCain said in an interview with ABC television. "The option of doing nothing is simply not an acceptable option." Democrat Barack Obama said he was likely to back the package. "My inclination is to support it," he told CBS television's "Face the Nation." "We have to remember how we got here. Not so much to allocate blame, but to understand the choices that will face the next president," he added. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson lobbied hard for the package saying it would keep credit markets from grinding to a halt under the weight of bad mortgage-backed debt. PUBLIC ANGER SIMMERS With many Americans are struggling to save their homes from foreclosure, lawmakers were bracing for a grassroots backlash against a bailout for Wall Street banks, which many blame for creating the overheated housing market and bad loan crisis. In the final hours of talks, Democrats and Republicans rushed to add safeguards for taxpayers and provisions that would allow the government to recover funds if housing prices recover and its holdings of bad debt gain value. The proposed legislation would disburse the $700 billion in stages. The first $250 billion would be issued when the legislation is enacted, while another $100 billion could be spent if the president decided it was needed. The remaining $350 billion would be subject to congressional review. Institutions selling assets under the plan would issue stock warrants to the government, a step intended to give taxpayers a chance to profit if markets recover. The plan also would let the government buy troubled assets from pension plans, local governments and small banks. In response to a clamor for limits on executive pay, no executives at participating firms could get multimillion-dollar severance packages -- known as golden parachutes. "No longer will the U.S. taxpayer bail out the recklessness of Wall Street," Pelosi told a news conference. An oversight board of top officials, including the Federal Reserve chairman, would supervise the program, while its management also would be under close scrutiny by Congress' investigative arm and an independent inspector general. The government could also use its power as the owner of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities to help more struggling homeowners modify the terms of their home loans. "Passage of the plan is just step one. Step two is execution and there remains considerable uncertainty about how assets will be purchased," said Michael Pond, Treasury strategist with Barclays Capital in New York. "We expect some of the recent flight to liquidy in Treasuries to be unwound as a bill gets passed, but volatility will likely remain until there are clear signs this will actually work," he said. International banking regulators converged on Amsterdam and scheduled a news briefing for Monday. The decade-old Financial Stability Forum is a consortium of central bank officials and regulators from Europe, North America and Asia that came together in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis with the goal of preventing a repeat.
