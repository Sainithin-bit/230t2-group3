 LONDON  (Reuters) - Bradford & Bingley's BB.L savings business will be transferred to Spanish banking giant Santander ( SAN.MC ) under a rescue plan being negotiated with the British government, the BBC reported on Sunday. 

 The British government will on Monday announce plans to nationalize Bradford & Bingley and take control of its 41 billion pound ($75 billion) residential mortgage book, a person familiar with the talks said. A Santander spokesman could not confirm the BBC report. (Reporting by  Adrian Croft ,  Steve Slater )
