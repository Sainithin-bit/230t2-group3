 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A deal on the proposed $700 billion financial rescue package could lend Wall Street stocks some support this week, but any gains may be fleeting as investors turn their attention back to the struggling U.S. economy. 

 U.S. lawmakers were pushing to finalize a deal to create a government fund to buy bad debt from ailing banks in a bid to rescue the beleaguered financial sector and contain fallout from the global credit crisis. After marathon talks, congressional leaders from both parties emerged early Sunday with a tentative agreement, but sources close to the discussion said the U.S. Senate is seen voting on the bill on Wednesday at the earliest. Investors hope the rescue plan to rid banks of bad mortgage debt will help stabilize financial markets as they close the books on September, a month that has changed the face of Wall Street forever. But analysts noted that the bailout was not a save all for equity markets. "I would view any rallies as being transitory because now the real work begins," said Jim Awad, chairman of W.P. Stewart & Co Ltd in New York. "I would describe the plan as necessary but not in and of itself sufficient. Between now and normality you will have more equity destruction and pain." Investors are bracing for a deluge of data during the coming week, including the all-important U.S. nonfarm payrolls report due on Friday, which will likely show further deterioration in the economy. PAYROLLS LIKELY TO SHRINK Before the jobs report, investors will wrestle with a report on personal income and spending on Monday, which features a key inflation gauge favored by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index for July is due on Tuesday, along with a September gauge of manufacturing activity in the U.S. Midwest, known as the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, and a reading on September consumer confidence from the Conference Board. A reading on the vast U.S. services sector is due on Friday from the Institute for Supply Management. For a full economic calendar, see Economic data "has been on the back burner" for a while, but at some point, investors will have to renew their focus on the numbers coming out, very few of which are encouraging, said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management, in Birmingham, Alabama. "If we continue to see weakness in employment -- and there's no reason to assume we won't -- that will create concern with regard to the consumer. It reinforces the idea that we're in a downward spiral," he added. Economists polled by Reuters expect that U.S. nonfarm payrolls lost 100,000 jobs in September, after August's decline of 84,000. The U.S. unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 6.1 percent in September. DISASTROUS SEPTEMBER The toll of the credit crisis has shaken Wall Street to the core in the past three weeks, making September a month that wi The U.S. financial landscape has been torn asunder in recent weeks by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings, the government's takeover of American International Group, the shotgun wedding of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America; the conversion of Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley to bank holding companies from investment banks, and the collapse of the nation's biggest thrift, Washington Mutualin the biggest bank failure in U.S. history. Reports published after Friday's close said Wachovia Corp, the sixth largest U.S. bank, has begun merger talks with a handful of potential partners. In another extraordinary effort to calm the markets, U.S. securities regulators joined regulators from other countries in temporarily banning short sales of financial shares. The U.S. ban is set to expire on Thursday, October 2, but it might be extended if the authorities deem it is prudent to do so. Both the Dow and the S&P 500 rose on Friday on hopes the bailout plan will be approved. But the Nasdaq Composite Index dipped on a disappointing outlook from BlackBerry maker Research in Motion Ltd. For the week, stocks fell. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 2.2 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500 shed 3.3 percent and the Nasdaq lost 4 percent. This week's agenda also includes speeches on the economy by several Federal Reserve officials, including Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Thomas Hoenig and Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart. As the strains on lending increased over the past week, the lack of confidence caused banks to hoard cash. So investors will keep a close eye on interbank lending rates this week to see if there is any easing. "Everybody knows how bad the financial sector is -- but the question is, 'Is it moving to the rest of the sectors? And how bad does it look for the rest of the world?'" said Linda Duessel, market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. "We'll be monitoring whether credit markets will even move in the direction of normal." For the year, the Dow is down 16 percent, the S&P 500 is off 17.4 percent, and the Nasdaq is off 17.7 percent.
