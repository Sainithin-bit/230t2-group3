 LONDON  (Reuters) - Finance minister Alistair Darling will make a full statement on the future of troubled British mortgage lender Bradford & Bingley BB.L before the market opens on Monday, a minister said on Sunday. 

 "The chancellor is going to make a full statement on this before the markets open tomorrow morning. The negotiations are still under way at the moment so there's a limit to what I can say right now," Treasury minister Yvette Cooper told the BBC, adding that B&B savers would be properly protected.
