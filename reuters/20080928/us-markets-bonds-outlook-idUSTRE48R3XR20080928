 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tentative agreement on a financial rescue plan reached Sunday in Washington is likely to dim the safe-haven allure of U.S. Treasuries this week as some of the extreme stress in short-term lending markets eases, analysts expect. 

 Yet even if a bailout bill is passed in short order, investor concerns about the fragile state of banking on both sides of the Atlantic are likely to keep ultra-short-dated government paper strongly bid, while the credit market deep freeze may take weeks or months to definitively haw, strategists add. "It does seem as though progress is being made and that could put a bit of a damper on extreme safe-haven buying of Treasuries on Monday morning," said David Dietze, chief investment strategist at Point View Financial Services, in Summit, New Jersey. "However, I think there will be more support in the Treasury market than would have been the case had there been a fully inked bill by the president by the time that markets opened," Dietze added. In the near term, short Treasury maturities which have tapped much of the flight-to-safety bid from scared investors fleeing corporate bonds and stocks in recent weeks, are most vulnerable to a sell-off. The 2-year note's yield, which moves inversely to its price, has rebounded from a six-month low of 1.37 percent on September 18 to about 2.08 percent late on Friday. "You could see from the recovery of markets on Friday that people know a deal is coming," said Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist, Miller, Tabak & Co in New York. "I expect Treasuries to open weak, with the short end the weakest. Late last week, the market had started to adjust already," Crescenzi said, referring to prospects of agreement on the U.S. government rescue plan, reflected by the two-year yield rising above 2 percent. Last week, the biggest bank failure in U.S. history stepped up the pressure on the Congress to agree to a $700 billion financial rescue plan to breathe life back into credit markets. U.S. regulators seized savings and loan Washington Mutual Inc late Thursday, the biggest ever U.S. bank failure, and sold its assets to JPMorgan Chase & Co. As well as U.S. bank Wachovia Corp's reported hunt for a suitor, the worsening travails of several European banks will also be in focus for fixed-income investors that may underpin safe harbor demand for Treasuries and other global sovereign debt, analysts said. "The other developing story is what's going on in Europe with Fortis. That looks like a whopper too. I think fixed-income investors will be keeping one eye over there to see how European regulators will handle that," said Dietze. Fortis faced for a takeover, break-up or nationalization as European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet held emergency talks with Dutch and Belgian ministers. "Up to now the typical global investor saw most of the stress here in the United States. We saw the big headlines with Fannie and Freddie and AIG and so forth. Now, investors may say 'Gee, even though a bill may get passed in the U.S., ... can the Europeans move as quickly? Do they understand the problem?'" Dietze said. As the potential bailout of the financial sector redraws boundaries on the U.S. financial landscape, economic data that would normally get investors' attention will be overshadowed. The government is expected to report on Friday that U.S. payrolls shed 100,000 jobs in September after losing 84,000 jobs in August, according to economists polled by Reuters. The unemployment rate is expected to hold steady at 6.1 percent. But the usually influential payrolls report should get only passing attention, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. "Two-year Treasury notes are already pricing in a very weak jobs number, so if the number turns out to be even weaker, bonds might rally a little more. But if the number is stronger than expected, people won't believe it and they'll anticipate weaker reports in the future," he said. "Prices right now are all based on market positioning," said LaVorgna. "It's fear. The market is worrying about dealing with residual quarter-end pressures. The economic data won't matter much." Even if the rescue plan approved by Congress does not pack quite as much wallop as originally proposed, it might be enough to satisfy financial markets, some analysts said. "For whatever reason, stocks seem to be going up anyway," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at Bank of Tokyo/Mitsubishi UFJ. "At this level, stocks have discounted everything but the kitchen sink and prices will come back a little bit and Treasury yields will rise," he said. Stock market gains and some mild unwinding of the bid for safe-haven U.S. government securities will be two measures of whether a rescue package has found favor with investors. Another will be the reaction of the interbank lending markets. "The bank funding market is in complete shambles and that's important because corporate borrowing costs are tied to the three-month LIBOR," Rupkey said. "People see counterparty risk everywhere so they're hoarding cash. Lending is strictly on an overnight basis. It will take time to get back to normal."
