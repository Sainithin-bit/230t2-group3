 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives have scheduled a closed-door meeting for 5 p.m (2100 GMT) to review a $700 billion Wall Street bailout measure congressional leaders hope to pass this week. 

 House Democrats have scheduled a separate meeting at the same time. One high-ranking House aide called these meetings the "pressure point" in the drive to pass the legislation. Lawmakers will get a briefing from their respective leaders at these meetings. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan , Editing by Sandra Maler)
