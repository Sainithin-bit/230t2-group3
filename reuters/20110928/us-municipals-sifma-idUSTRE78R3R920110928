 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Greater financial regulation, proposed tax code changes and attempts to weaken the tax-exempt status of U.S. municipal bonds threaten the very foundation the $3.7 trillion market is built upon. 

 And even though borrowing costs are near record lows for state and local governments, bankers and issuers are casting a wary eye at the regulations and possible legal changes that could fundamentally change the way municipalities finance essential services. Regulators, armed with new powers under the Dodd-Frank Act, are pushing for greater financial disclosures by states, cities and other issuers, while redefining responsibilities of key players in the market. At the same time, the core of the market, its tax-exempt status, is under siege. "Unless the municipal market is strong and people feel confident (in it), state and local governments are not going to be able to finance their needs," said Richard Ravitch, who along with former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, is heading a task force on the state budget crisis. More than $1 trillion in federal spending is on the chopping block and possible changes in the federal tax code are looming as Washington deals with the U.S. deficit crisis. Meanwhile, the American Jobs Act of 2011, which President Barack Obama unveiled earlier this month, targets annual incomes over $200,000 for individuals and over $250,000 for families by limiting tax deductions to 28 percent of their income starting January 1, 2013, from the current 35 percent. Panelists at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's Municipal Bond Summit on Tuesday said the limitation would cause yields on tax-exempt bonds to rise, boosting borrowing costs for states, cities, schools and others in the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, where wealthy investors have traditionally turned to reduce their taxable income. If they rise, however, they will climb from record lows hit last week, according to Municipal Market Data, a unit of Thomson Reuters. George Friedlander, Citi's senior muni bond strategist, called the proposal, "an awful idea," even though he said it was extremely unlikely the bill would pass. "It's an early warning," he said. "It is now on the list and once it's on the list, it won't go away." Securities and Exchange Commissioner Elisse Walter told the SIFMA audience that regulatory staff was preparing rules to improve the timeliness and quality of issuer disclosures.

Issuers and banks alike have worried the definition of who is a financial adviser -- now being considered by the SEC -- may be too broad, forcing people with little involvement in a bond sale to answer to a host of new regulations. A strict definition, too, could shrink the pool of underwriters who also serve as advisers. For example, Carol Kostik, New York City's deputy comptroller for public finance said fewer broker-dealers than normal applied during a recent request for proposals process for advisers. Ken Gibbs, president of the municipal securities group at Jefferies & Co, said the bond underwriting process may be transformed because advice is an "integral part of underwriting services." "Every time you discussed the structure of an escrow or some other topic, you would be deemed an adviser," he told the SIFMA summit. Connecticut Governor Dannel Malloy also sounded a warning, pointing out debate about issues that have spooked investors, such as allowing states to file for bankruptcy, may continue to pop up in Washington. "I want to argue here we need to be vigilant," he said, adding that the average citizen does not understand the municipal market.
