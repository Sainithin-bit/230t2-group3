 (Reuters) - Dole Food Co Inc DOLE.N said it has settled lawsuits filed by farm workers claiming injuries from the agricultural chemical DBCP. 

 The settlement will not have a material effect on Dole's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows, the company said in a statement. Dole said the settlement included five lawsuits filed on behalf of farm workers in the United States and 33 lawsuits filed in Nicaragua. The 33 Nicaraguan cases represent about $9 billion in claimed damages and, in seven of those cases, two judgments totaling $907.5 million, the company said. The Los Angeles Court hearing the cases has set November 3 as the date to assess and confirm the fairness of the settlement to all parties, Dole said.
