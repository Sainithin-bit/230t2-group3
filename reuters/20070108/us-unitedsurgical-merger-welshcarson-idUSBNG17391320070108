 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Surgical Partners International Inc. USPI.O, which runs short-stay surgery centers, has agreed to be bought out by a private equity firm for $1.8 billion, the company said on Monday. 

 United Surgical will be acquired by a unit of Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, the company's founding shareholder, for $31.05 a share, a premium of 13.4 percent above its closing price on January 5. Welsh, Carson will also assume certain debt obligations of United Surgical, whose shares rose 13 percent in morning trading. Dallas-based United Surgical has stakes in or operates 141 surgery centers in the United States. The centers typically perform specialized outpatient procedures and are often owned partially by doctors. Such facilities are stealing patients away from general- service hospitals, which face steeper costs and generally must care for those without health insurance. But they also face fierce competition among themselves, which has led to slowing admissions growth and has depressed United Surgical's stock. Its shares fell 12 percent last year. "There is a lot more competition in the marketplace. This way they won't be penalized by the Street for not hitting quarterly targets," said Ryan Daniels, an analyst at William Blair. That was a widely cited reason for last year's management- led $21 billion private equity buyout of No. 1 hospital chain HCA Inc. Surgery centers such as United Surgical tend to specialize in niche areas like orthopedics, pain management, gastrointestinal or opthalmology, Daniels said. The deal is expected to close in the second quarter. Ryan Beck analyst Robert Mains sees United Surgical as a special case, given its long-standing relationship with Welsh, Carson, and he does not expect other surgical companies, such as AmSurg Corp. ( AMSG.O ) and Symbion Inc.SMBI.O, to become buyout candidates. But he added that, if Welsh, Carson decided to expand its surgery business, Symbion would be the more likely candidate, given the similarity of the United Surgical and Symbion business models. Welsh, Carson is focused on investments in the health-care services, information and business-services industries. United Surgical said it has been advised by JP Morgan Securities Inc. and Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP. Welsh, Carson had Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking and Lehman Brothers Inc. as M&A advisers, and Ropes & Gray LLP, as counsel. United Surgical shares were up $3.41 at $30.80 in afternoon Nasdaq trading. Symbion rose 83 cents, or about 5 percent, to $17.92, while AmSurg rose 49 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $22.64.
