 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. said on Monday 
it had fourth-quarter net sales of $489 million from its heart 
rhythm management products and announced a plan to reallocate 
research and development resources in the unit that will result 
in 500 to 600 job cuts in the current quarter. 

  Boston Scientific ( BSX.N ) said the plan would result in 
after-tax costs of about $70 million, which include change-in- 
control payments related to last year's acquisition of Guidant 
Corp.  "This plan will shift resources from less productive 
projects to more productive ones, reinvigorating our product 
pipeline and driving top-line growth," Chief Executive Jim 
Tobin said in a statement.  The job cuts will come primarily from the company's CRM 
(cardiac rhythm management) facility in Arden Hills, Minnesota, 
it said.  The medical device maker bought Guidant last year for $27 
billion to acquire its portfolio of devices used to control and 
restore heart rhythms, including its lucrative implantable 
cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs.  But high profile recalls of some of the devices hurt sales 
and Boston Scientific said it was now seeing something of a 
rebound.  The $489 million in quarterly CRM sales was 10 percent over 
third-quarter sales. The company said fourth-quarter sales of 
ICDs rose 13 percent from the previous quarter to $356 million.  "We were pleased with our sequential quarterly sales 
increase and we believe the CRM market is starting to resume 
its growth," Tobin said.
