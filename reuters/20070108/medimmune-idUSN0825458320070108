  By  Toni Clarke BOSTON  Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have approved an
updated version of MedImmune Inc.'s MEDI.O nasal spray flu
vaccine FluMist, the biotechnology company said on Monday.  Unlike the old version, the new one does not need to be
kept frozen; it can simply be refrigerated, making it easier to
handle and potentially boosting sales.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the new
FluMist to help prevent influenza in healthy children and
adults between the ages of 5 and 49. The company said it
expects to begin shipping the first doses in time to start
vaccinating patients as early as August.  FluMist, the first nasal spray flu vaccine, failed to catch
on when it was introduced in 2003, partly because of the need
to keep it frozen. The company expects to sell close to 3
million doses during the 2006-2007 season.  That figure could more than double in the 2007-2008 season
with the new formulation, said Frank Malinoski, MedImmune's
vice president of medical and scientific affairs.  "Over the next few months we will understand better what
that demand will be," he said in an interview.  The new formulation of the vaccine will also be called
FluMist and cost roughly the same as the old version -- between
$16 and $20 per dose.  Whether it is successful will depend to a large extent on
whether the company is able to get it approved in infants and
the elderly, the groups most vulnerable to the flu, analysts
have said.  The company has filed a separate application with U.S.
regulators to market FluMist for children between the ages of
12 months and 59 months who do not have a history of wheezing
or asthma and the FDA is expected to give a decision by the end
of May.  One way MedImmune hopes to boost its market share is by
pushing forward as much as possible the date that the vaccine
is available -- even, eventually, to early July. That could
give physicians all summer to vaccinate children as they go in
for pre-school physicals, said Malinoski.  The injectable flu vaccine was not available this season
until the end of October 2006.  Gaithersburg, Maryland-based MedImmune has conducted trials
of FluMist involving about 60,000 people, including children as
young as six weeks of age and adults up to 98 years old.  MedImmune shares were down 2 cents at $34.30 in early
afternoon trading on Nasdaq.
