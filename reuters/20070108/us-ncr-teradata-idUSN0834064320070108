 BOSTON  (Reuters) - NCR Corp. ( NCR.N ) said on Monday it plans to spin off its Teradata software division as it looks to boost the stock value of the unit, which has been weighed by lower margins on NCR's core ATM and cash register business. 

 The tax-free spin-off, which sent NCR's shares up as much as 7 percent in heavy turnover, will create two publicly traded companies -- Teradata and NCR's main business of selling banking equipment and retail checkout systems. The transaction is expected to be completed in six to nine months, NCR said, adding that the stock distribution ratio will be determined at a future date. JPMorgan is its financial adviser. Analysts say there are few synergies between the two businesses as they do not share many customers to which NCR can peddle its software alongside its hardware. "Teradata and the new NCR operate in different markets, each with solid prospects for the future. But they have markedly different business models," NCR Chief Executive Bill Nuti said in a statement. Teradata sells data warehousing software, which is used to comb vast amounts of data, analyze retail buying patterns and other types of business trends. It had sales of $1.5 billion and operating income of $309 million in 2005. NCR's core business sells automated bank teller machines, retail checkout equipment and other specialized computer systems. It rang up sales of $4.5 billion and operating income of $251 million in 2005. NCR's shares were up $2.55, or 6 percent, at $44.95 on the New York Stock Exchange in morning trade. Reik Read, an analyst with Robert W. Baird, estimates that the combined value of the stocks of the two companies would be $46 to $47 a share. For several years investors have urged NCR to consider a spin-off, saying that low margins on the company's core hardware business have depressed the value of the stock as its lower profitability has obscured the value of the software unit. Dayton, Ohio-based NCR's core business has an operating margin excluding pension costs of about 5 to 6 percent, compared to 20 to 21 percent for Teradata, Read said. Nuti will serve as CEO of the new NCR. Mike Koehler, senior vice president of the Teradata division, will serve as CEO of the spun off software maker. Founded in 1884 as National Cash Register, the company was the first to make mechanical cash registers and bar-code scanners. It got into the data warehousing business in 1991 with its purchase of Teradata Corp. (Additional reporting by  Ritsuko Ando  in New York.)
