 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ) options trading 
surged on Monday as trader speculation spread that Eastman 
Kodak Co. EK.Ncould acquire the printer maker, options 
analysts said. 

  Analysts downplayed the speculation, noting that such a 
transaction is unlikely to occur because film maker Kodak is 
less than half the size of Xerox by market capitalization and 
is in the midst of a restructuring following years of turmoil 
in its business.  Xerox spokeswoman Christa Carone declined comment, saying 
the company would not respond to rumors and speculation. Kodak 
had a similar response.  Xerox shares have a market value of about $16 billion, more 
than twice Kodak's market capitalization of about $7 billion.  "I don't see Xerox getting bought out," said Paul Foster, 
an options analyst with Chicago-based theflyonthewall.com who 
reported the rumor on the financial news Web site on Monday. 
"But I reported it because that was the chatter on trading 
desks this morning."  Some 23,000 Xerox options had changed hands as of Monday 
afternoon. That is more than 21 times the average daily volume 
over the past month, according to market research firm Track 
Data.  "We do see an interest in Xerox call options today. There 
are rumors of a possible takeover," said independent options 
trader Robert Leone at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. "But 
this is not the first time that Xerox has been mentioned as a 
takeover candidate."  Stamford, Connecticut-based Xerox shares rose 30 cents, or 
1.8 percent, to $17.03 in late afternoon trade on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Eastman Kodak shares fell 15 cents, or 0.6 
percent, to $25.48.
