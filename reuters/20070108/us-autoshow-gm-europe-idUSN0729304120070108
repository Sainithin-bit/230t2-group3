 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM.N ) European operations will put profits above volume growth in what is expected to be a largely flat market for auto demand in 2007, company officials said on Sunday. 

 "The most important target for us is to be better in terms of profitability," GM Europe President Carl-Peter Forster told reporters at the North American International Auto Show. "Honestly, volume is almost a secondary objective." GM Europe improved revenue per unit sold by more than $700 last year based on sales of the Opel, Vauxhall and Saab brands, sales and marketing head Jonathan Browning said. It did this by cutting back on low-margin fleet sales, rolling out new models and improving content. The average transaction price for a three-door Astra GTC compact, for instance, was 5,000 euros higher than for its predecessor, Forster said. GM Europe's unit sales rose by around 19,000 units last year to surpass 2 million vehicles for the first time, Browning said. The overall European market gained around 3 percent last year, with Russia and Ukraine accounting for 70 percent of the growth, he noted. He foresaw a patchy European market in 2007. "We see Russia and Ukraine continuing very strongly. We think Poland will come back a bit after its pretty low level these past two years. Turkey lost around 100,000 units in 2006, we think that will come back a bit," he said. In western Europe, France and Britain will likely contract this year, but Germany -- Europe's biggest car market -- remained hard to predict. "Germany is really the big question mark. Will we see business confidence translating into consumer confidence translating into purchases of cars? That's really the key open question," Browning said.
