 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Advertising spending growth is 
expected to slow sharply this year, as the absence of big 
marketing events and smaller budgets for key categories such as 
autos will likely make it the industry's toughest year since 
2001, according to a study released on Monday. 

  Tracking firm TNS Media Intelligence forecast ad spending 
in the United States to rise 2.6 percent in 2007 to $153.7 
billion, compared with 3.8 percent growth in 2006, and called 
the increase "the smallest since the media economy emerged from 
its 2001 recession."  That lower growth rate is also influenced by weaker 
spending from key advertisers like automakers and by pricing 
pressure due to a larger array of competing media outlets.  For example, Internet display advertising is expected to be 
one of the fastest gainers with 13 percent growth, along with 
the outdoor and magazine segments, compared with traditional 
outlets like network television, TNS said.  TNS forecast that ad spending should increase by 2.1 
percent in the first half of 2007, followed by a gain of 3.2 
percent in the second half.  Steven Fredericks, chief executive of TNS Media 
Intelligence, blamed the downbeat forecast on the absence of ad 
spending for the Olympics and federal elections, which he said 
often meant an extra 80 to 100 basis points for growth rates.  "There's no major advertising event going on in 2007," he 
said in an interview. "We also don't see a lot of key 
advertising categories picking up," he added, naming 
automotive, travel, health and beauty products.  But he said other factors were at work as well, including 
the rise of advertising in digital media, from the Internet to 
mobile phones, which has added to the supply of marketing 
outlets and held back overall prices.  "We're seeing more media, especially digital media, 
continue to expand and therefore the supply of advertising 
inventory is expanding. As a result of the inventory expanding, 
it's holding down media price inflation," Fredericks said.  Among the weaker media, network television is projected to 
be almost flat versus 2006, radio to underperform with 1.7 
percent growth, while newspapers are expected to experience 
outright declines of nearly 3 percent, the forecast said.
