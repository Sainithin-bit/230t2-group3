 PHILADELPHIA/LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) has hired investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc.( GS.N ), sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, stoking investor hopes the struggling apparel retailer could be up for sale and sending its shares up as much as 11 percent. 

 The two sources said Gap, with a market capitalization of more than $15 billion, hired Goldman last month, but it was unclear exactly what the bank was hired to do. A Gap spokesman said the company does not comment on rumor or speculation and added there has been a relationship with Goldman Sachs since 1995. Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Gap, which operates the Old Navy and Banana Republic chains, as well as its namesake stores, has been the subject of much takeover speculation. The company's shares are worth less than half of what they were in early 2000 and its management team, led by Chief Executive Paul Pressler, is under pressure to turn the company around. Dogging the company has been declining sales at its two main brands, Gap and Old Navy, and the company last week said its management and board would be reviewing brand strategies at those chains. That announcement spurred renewed speculation on Wall Street that the tenure of Pressler or other senior management might be at an end at the retailer, whose casual fashions have defined American style for over 30 years. Business news television channel CNBC was the first to report the hiring of Goldman Sachs, saying the bank was given the task of developing strategic alternatives for the company. "Strategic alternatives usually means the company is for sale," said Pacific Growth Equities analyst Christine Chen. "Or they could conceivably separate the segments. "The stock is not expensive and there's value in the brand and there have been rumors that private equity firms could take it private." "AN UPHILL BATTLE" Possible outcomes for Gap could include a sale to a strategic buyer, a leveraged buyout, or spinning off Gap's brands, said Susquehanna Financial analyst Thomas Filandro. He added that the Goldman Sachs news did not come as a surprise. "Clearly this company is fighting an uphill battle," Filandro said. "They've been losing market share and so you have to think about whether this company is better off running as separate brands. There are many alternatives to the business that might make them stronger." Retail watchers agree the problems at Gap stem from merchandising errors that have resulted in declining store traffic as shoppers have headed to rivals such as Target Corp. ( TGT.N ), American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEOS.O and Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) for casual fashions. Since 2005, Gap has reported declines in sales at stores open at least a year -- a key measure of financial performance -- in every month save two. After hitting $53.75 in February 2000, Gap's stock steadily fell, with a few upticks along the way, settling at $8.35 by October 2002. Pressler, who arrived at Gap in the fall of 2002 amid a spate of negative same-store sales, oversaw improved performance in 2003, but sales at established stores once again turned negative for six months in 2004. By June 2004, Gap's stock rallied to $25, but slid back to $15.92 in July last year. The company aggressively bought back shares throughout 2006. As of October 28, 2006, Gap had 810.62 million shares outstanding, according to the company's quarterly report. Founder Donald Fisher -- who started the San Francisco-based company with a single store in 1969 -- his family and its limited partnership have a combined stake in the company of 37 percent. Gap shares rose as high as 11 percent during Monday's trade -- the largest one-day percentage gain in five years -- before closing up over 7 percent, or $1.37, at $20.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.
