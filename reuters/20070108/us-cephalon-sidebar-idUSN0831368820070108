 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Cephalon Inc. CEPH.O said on Monday that its painkiller Fentora, which is currently approved to treat breakthrough pain in cancer patients, also works more broadly as a treatment for nerve pain, according to a late-stage clinical trial. 

 The biotechnology company said Fentora significantly helped relieve pain in patients with a variety of chronic conditions associated with nerve, or neuropathic, pain in a Phase III study of 75 patients known to be able to tolerate opioid therapies. The company said it plans to seek regulatory approval to market the drug for patients with chronic pain conditions associated with breakthrough pain, such as neuropathic and low back pain.
