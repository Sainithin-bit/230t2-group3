 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N won permission 
from the European Commission on Monday to buy Symbol 
Technologies Inc. SBL.N, a maker of bar code and inventory 
scanning technology, for about $3.9 billion. 

  "The Commission concluded that the transaction would not 
significantly impede effective competition in the European 
Economic Area," the EU's executive arm said in a statement.  The deal is aimed at boosting sales of wireless handheld 
devices to corporate customers.  Motorola, the world's second-biggest cell phone maker, will 
pay $15 per share.  Symbol makes rugged handheld computing devices, supermarket 
bar code scanners and radio-frequency identification (RFID) 
tags for inventory tracking.  The deal, analysts said when it was announced in September, 
should complement Motorola technology used in retail, transport 
and health-care markets.  Symbol posted 2005 earnings of $32.2 million, or 13 cents a 
share, on revenue of $1.77 billion.  Motorola said the purchase of Symbol, which will keep its 
Holtsville, New York, headquarters, would help boost its 
enterprise business but not affect the pace of its share 
repurchase activity.  "This is a company we've been looking at for some time. We 
really had our mark set on adding lots of critical mass and 
critical size inside the enterprise area," Motorola Chief 
Executive Ed Zander said when the deal was announced.
