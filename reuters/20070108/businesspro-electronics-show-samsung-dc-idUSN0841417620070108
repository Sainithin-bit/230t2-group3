 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.'s 
( 005930.KS ) North American sales rose 15 percent to about $19 
billion in 2006, driven by strong demand for its flat panel 
televisions, the U.S. chief of the South Korean electronics 
company said on Monday. 

  The company also became the largest LCD TV supplier in the 
key U.S. market for the first time in 2006, with a share of 
about 18 percent in unit terms, Dong Jin Oh, president and 
chief executive of Samsung Electronics America told Reuters in 
an interview.  Oh added he had no intention of letting go of the company's 
new position in the fast-growing, but fiercely competitive 
market.  "We wish to be the No.1 market share holder no matter how 
the situation will be. That's our target to achieve," Oh said 
at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  Securing a leading position in the United States, where 
strong demand is expected for high-margin large-sized 
televisions, is strategically important for any TV maker.  Samsung, which competes with Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) and Sharp 
Corp. ( 6753.T ) in the $63 billion global LCD TV industry, has 
also emerged as the top supplier in the broader U.S. digital TV 
market that also includes plasma and other types of models, Oh 
said.
