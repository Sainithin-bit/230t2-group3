 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Group NYX.N requested on Monday that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission postpone the implementation date of Regulation NMS, a series of sweeping changes designed to update U.S. markets for new, rapid trading technologies, from February 5 to March 5. 

 In a letter to the SEC, the exchange said that delays in rolling out its hybrid trading system meant that if the regulations are implemented as scheduled, NYSE quotations would not meet the definition of "automated quotation" under NMS, meaning they would be deemed "slow" and the NYSE would have to shut off automatic execution. Requiring the exchange to take away automatic execution and routing because it is temporarily unable meet the new criteria would jeopardize best execution for investors and the market as a whole, the NYSE wrote. And rushing the roll-out of its hybrid system would put trading systems unnecessarily at risk, the Big Board added. The exchange expects to complete the delayed phase of its hybrid system by the end of February. NMS compliance, which encourages automated execution, had spurred exchanges to pursue hybrid models or electronic communications networks. In May the SEC postponed a prior compliance deadline, in a move widely anticipated by analysts.
