 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp. ( S.N ) on Monday forecast flat to slightly higher revenues in 2007 and said it will slash 5,000 jobs to cut costs as profit is under pressure from lower margins, sending shares down 8 percent. 

 "In the near term, a lower margin revenue mix, investment of an additional $1.1 billion in our business operations and start-up costs associated with the build-out of our fourth generation WiMAX wireless network will pressure profitability," said Sprint Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Forsee said in a statement. "We will continue to adjust our cost structure, which will include a work force reduction, as we meet the changing demands of the business." Sprint, the No.3 U.S. mobile service provider, forecast consolidated operating revenues of around $41 billion to $42 billion for 2007. That compared with Wall Street analysts' average forecast of $41.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sprint also reiterated its 2006 consolidated operating revenue of about $41 billion and forecast annual capital expenditure of about $7.0 billion to $7.3 billion. It added 742,000 total net subscribers in the fourth quarter, ending the period with a customer base of 53.1 million. It expects to report average revenue per customer above competitors' levels. For 2007, the company forecast capital spending of around $8.5 billion, consisting of $7.1 billion for core wireless networks and spectrum rebranding efforts, adding that it aimed to add network coverage and capacity. Sprint, which acquired Nextel Communications in August 2005, said its full-time head count reduction would be applied across the company, from a base of 64,600 at the end of 2006, with a majority of the cuts planned in the first quarter. It forecast a total of around $700 million in merger integration and severance costs in 2007, with the bulk of those costs in the first half of the year. Sprint also said it was on course to achieve $14.5 billion in net merger synergies. Forsee said problems with its iDEN network hurt demand and increased "churn", or cancellation rates, in 2006. The shares in the company, which have fallen about 17 percent in the past 12 months amid investor concerns over its falling market share and network problems, tumbled to $18 in after-hours trading from the NYSE close of $19.64. Sprint said revenue growth in 2007 would be offset by lower average revenue per subscriber and lower wireline revenue. It expects to continue with its share buy-back program, but the amount and timing of its purchases will vary as the program proceeds. Since the start of the program in August 2006, the company has repurchased 98 million shares for about $1.6 billion.
