 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet company Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) 
said on Monday it was beefing up Web search software offered to 
mobile phone users, including agreements to install the 
services on millions of new cell phones worldwide. 

  Yahoo said its Yahoo Go 2.0 mobile service is available for 
users to download on more than 70 mobile device models from top 
cell phone makers. The announcements were made from the 
Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  Yahoo seeks to outpace arch rival Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), 
which dominates the market for computer Web-search, by winning 
over consumers to its mobile phone Web search and related 
advertising system.  The company said on Monday it expanded partnerships with 
mobile phone makers Motorola Inc. MOT.N, Nokia Oyj 
( NOK1V.HE ), Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) and Research In 
Motion Ltd. RIM.TO to include the new software on some of 
their phones.  In one example of the new agreements, Samsung said it would 
preload Yahoo search, electronic mail and instant messaging 
services on millions of its cell phones starting in the first 
half of 2007.  Yahoo said its new mobile service included a feature called 
"oneSearch" that makes it easier for users to get the 
information they need from a cell phone search, an enhanced 
directory of local businesses and maps and an easy system for 
sharing photos.  A year ago at the same industry trade show, Yahoo unveiled 
relationships with Nokia and Motorola to pre-install Yahoo 
software on several million mobile-phone handsets as part of 
its effort to expand beyond computer-based Web search.
