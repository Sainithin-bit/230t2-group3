 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc. ( ENDP.O ) on Monday issued an earnings forecast for 2007 that fell shy of Wall Street estimates as the company said it expected significant spending for the development and launch of new products. 

 The maker of pain drugs also said it would seek acquisitions in 2007 to bolster its product portfolio. Endo forecast full-year adjusted earnings of about $1.68 to $1.72 per share for 2007, excluding estimated milestone payments to partners and the expensing of stock-based compensation. The Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania-based company also forecast 2007 revenue of between $1.03 billion and $1.05 billion. Analysts on average estimated 2007 Endo earnings of $1.81 per share and revenue of $1.03 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The company forecast net sales of its flagship pain drug Lidoderm of $650 million to $675 million for the year and combined sales of newer drug Opana ER and Opana of between $85 million and $105 million. "Endo intends to be active on the business development front in 2007 as we seek to expand our commercial portfolio through product or company acquisitions in pain management or other therapeutic areas that allow us to remain focused on the specialist physician community," Chief Executive Peter Lankau said in a statement.
