 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Advanced Medical Optics Inc. said on 
Monday that it will buy rival laser vision correction company 
IntraLase Corp. for about $808 million, or $25 a share. 

  The cash deal represents a 12.5 percent premium over 
IntraLase's closing price on Friday of $22.23 on the Nasdaq 
stock market.  Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) said it expects to complete 
the acquisition early in the second quarter of 2007.  The deal is subject to IntraLase stockholder approval, as 
well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing 
conditions, AMO said in a statement.  The news was first reported in Monday's edition of The Wall 
Street Journal.  AMO, of Santa Ana, California, is a global ophthalmology 
company with a near 60 percent share of the Lasik vision 
correction market, the Journal said.  IntraLase, based in Irvine, California, sells lasers that 
replace the hand-held blade traditionally used by eye surgeons 
in the first step of laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis, or 
Lasik, the Journal reported.  AMO said it expects the transaction to dilute its adjusted 
earnings per share in 2007 but to add slightly to adjusted EPS 
the year after.  Including the acquisition, it forecast 2007 adjusted 
earnings per share of $1.40 to $1.55 on revenue of $1.15 
billion to $1.18 billion.  It previously forecast $1.85 to $2 per share on revenue of 
$1.06 billion to $1.08 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters 
Estimates were expecting earnings of $1.79 per share on revenue 
of $1.05 billion.  For 2008, AMO forecast earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.40 
on revenue of $1.35 billion to $1.37 billion. Analysts polled 
by Reuters Estimates were expecting $2.35 per share on revenue 
$1.12 billion.  Investment bank UBS is acting as lead financial adviser and 
Goldman Sachs is acting as co-financial adviser to AMO. UBS 
also is the lead arranger on a $900 million acquisition 
facility for AMO. Bank of America and Goldman Sachs are acting 
as joint arrangers for the facility.  IntraLase's lead financial adviser is Bank of America and 
JPMorgan is co-financial adviser.
