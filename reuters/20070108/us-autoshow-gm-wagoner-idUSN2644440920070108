 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) chief executive Rick Wagoner said that he is hopeful that the world's largest automaker will turn a profit in 2007 after struggling with weak sales, high costs and stiff competition in 2006. 

 In an interview on Monday with Reuters Television at the North American Intermational Auto Show, Wagoner was asked when GM would return to profitability. "We certainly hope so this year," Wagoner said. Through the first three quarters of 2006, GM had lost $3.05 billion. In 2005, GM lost $10.6 billion for the full year.
