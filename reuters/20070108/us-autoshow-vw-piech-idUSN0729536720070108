 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The head of Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) powerful works council urged Chairman Ferdinand Piech on Sunday to stay on the German carmaker's supervisory board when his term expires this year. 

 "I would welcome it if Dr Piech would stay on the supervisory board," Bernd Osterloh said on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, but he did not say whether he thought Piech should remain chairman. Should representatives of VW investors propose a new term for Piech, "then you can be sure he will get the 10 votes from the labor side", he added. Representatives of investors and labor each have half the seats on the board of Europe's biggest carmaker. Christian Wulff, premier of Germany's Lower Saxony state which is VW's second-biggest shareholder, has pushed for Piech to step down from the board this year. But Piech, whose family owns sports car maker Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) -- VW's top investor -- has declined to say whether he will in fact step down. A simmering conflict between Wulff and Piech escalated in November when Piech forced out VW Chief Executive Bernd Pischetsrieder, whose efficiency drive Wulff had supported but which had riled Piech's labor allies.
