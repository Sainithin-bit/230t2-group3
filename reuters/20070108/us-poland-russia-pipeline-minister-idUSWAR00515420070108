 WARSAW  (Reuters) - Poland's economy ministry said on Monday problems with oil supplies through the Russian Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline were connected to a recent trade row between Russia and Belarus. 

 "As far as we know it has to do with a dispute between the Russian Federation and Belarus over export duties on the one hand and transport fees on the other," Deputy Economy Minister in charge of Poland's energy policy Piotr Naimski told all-news TV channel TVN24. The Druzhba pipeline to Central Europe is one of the world's biggest by capacity and length and supplies.
