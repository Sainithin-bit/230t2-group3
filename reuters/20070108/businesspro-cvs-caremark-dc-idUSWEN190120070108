 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) on 
Monday said it expected to close its merger with pharmacy 
benefit manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N in the first quarter. 

  Caremark paved the way for the deal to proceed late on 
Sunday, when it said it had rejected a roughly $26 billion 
takeover bid from rival Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ) in favor 
of CVS's offer of about $22.2 billion.  "We are pleased with the decision of the Caremark board to 
reaffirm its commitment to the merger of CVS and Caremark," CVS 
Chief Executive Tom Ryan said in a statement.
