 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Pharmacy benefit manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N, which plans to be acquired by drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) for $22.2 billion, rejected a $26 billion unsolicited bid from rival Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), setting the stage for a lengthy takeover battle. 

 Caremark said it favored the lower all-stock CVS offer because it had few integration risks and offered significant opportunities for synergies between the two companies. The Express Scripts' cash and stock proposal, said Caremark, faced significant antitrust risks and potential delays, carried the risk of a hefty debt load for the combined company, and lacked strategic rationale. In response, Express Scripts said it would nominate four directors to the board of Caremark -- a move dismissed by CVS as a publicity stunt -- and also made antitrust regulatory filings to acquire stock in Caremark. Express Scripts also said it had commitment letters from Citigroup Corporate and Investment Banking and Credit Suisse, showing it could fully finance its offer. "If it was just price, they could try to throw in a few dollars," said one arbitrageur, who declined to be named. "But they were told (by Caremark) that a deal with them made no strategic sense, so they have to fight at a strategy level -- at the board and management level," the arbitrageur added. Express Scripts said it would prefer to meet Caremark's board and management to negotiate a deal, but was taking action due to Caremark's refusal to discuss its offer. Caremark said late on Sunday that the unsolicited Express Scripts proposal "does not constitute, and is not reasonably likely to lead to, a superior proposal." In November, CVS agreed to buy Caremark in a move to expand its prescription benefits and mail-order business. At the time of the announcement, the CVS deal offered no premium over the price of Caremark's stock. "We believe that Caremark investors view the price offered by CVS as inadequate," said Wachovia Capital Markets analyst Matt Perry. "This overrides any other concerns about the Express Scripts offer at the current time. If (a) vote were held today, we would expect Caremark holders to reject CVS." CLEARANCE Nashville-based Caremark said its deal with CVS had already received antitrust clearance and the companies expected to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2007. In addition to raising antitrust concerns, Caremark said the proposal from Express Scripts created the risk of significant customer attrition and destruction of shareholder value. The Express Scripts plan would also result in a "highly leveraged and weakened business" with diminished financial strength, Caremark added. "Our board gave careful consideration to Express Scripts' proposal," said Caremark's chairman and CEO Mac Crawford. "In the end, our conclusion was simple and straightforward: Express Scripts' proposal is not in the best interests of Caremark, its shareholders, customers and consumers." Caremark and other pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and major health plans, brokering deals in part by buying medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They also have large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions through the mail. Traditional pharmacies face competition from mail-order operations, which are eroding the business of retail chains by siphoning off customers who buy medicines and also shop for other items while waiting at the stores. Shares of Express Scripts shed 8 cents to $68.78, while shares of CVS closed at $31.35, up 18 cents. Shares of Caremark gained 29 cents to close at $56.64.
