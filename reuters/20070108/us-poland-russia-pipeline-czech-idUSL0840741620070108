 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - Oil flow through the Druzhba pipeline from Russia to the Czech Republic have not been interrupted, the Czech Industry and Trade Ministry said on Monday. 

 The Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline splits into two spurs in Belarus. Poland has reported a halt in supplies through the northern spur of the pipeline overnight. The Czechs are served by the southern spur. "We have information there was a stoppage of supplies from Belarus yesterday between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. (16:00-19:00 GMT). It had no impact on us," a ministry spokesman said. A spokesman for Czech refiner Ceska Rafinerska said he was also not aware of any supply disruption.
