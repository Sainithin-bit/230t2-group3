 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ) remains open to an alliance with a North American automaker even after the collapse of talks aimed at bringing General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) into a three-way partnership with Nissan and Renault SA, a senior U.S.-based Nissan executive said on Sunday. 

 "The business model that we have works and it has worked for the past seven years," Dominique Thormann, senior vice president for finance for Nissan in North America, told Reuters in an interview at the North American International Auto Show. Thormann said Nissan-Renault was less interested in pursuing product specific tie-ups with other automakers. "That's not, I think, the way we are going," he said. Thormann said Nissan was projecting that the overall U.S. light vehicle market would decline to near 16 million units in 2007, down from about almost 16.6 million in 2006. Other analysts and industry executives have forecast a nearly flat market for 2007, but Thormann said he thought that a number of analysts were revising their forecasts lower in view of a weaker U.S. housing market. "The consensus lags," he said.
