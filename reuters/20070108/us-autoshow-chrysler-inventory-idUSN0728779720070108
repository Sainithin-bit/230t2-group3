 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group has almost eliminated its stock of unsold vehicles unclaimed by dealers and taken steps to ensure the costly inventory does not return, the company's chief operating officer said on Sunday. 

 "It won't come back," Chrysler Group Chief Operating Officer Eric Ridenour told Reuters in an interview. Chrysler was dogged by inventory management problems 2006 and its practice of holding large numbers of vehicles in a "sales bank" before they had been ordered for showrooms became a flash point for investors and its dealers. At one point last year, the No. 4 U.S. automaker had about 100,000 vehicles sitting in the sales bank of unassigned inventory that were not being disclosed in its monthly sales calls for analysts. Ridenour said that number of vehicles in its unassigned inventory had been reduced to less than 10,000 units as of year end, a level he said represented a more normal level. "It's back to a normal float, which is less than 10,000 (units)," he said. "And we're well below that. We're where we want to be there." Chrysler posted a $1.5-billion third-quarter loss largely because of its inventory of unsold trucks and sport utility vehicles and the unit of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE is readying a cost-cutting plan to be announced in February. Chrysler had set a goal earlier this year of cutting $1,000 from the cost of each car it produces, a step analysts said could save it several billions of dollars annually if it could be achieved. Ridenour declined to comment on the restructuring plans, saying only they were "ambitious, but not crazy." He said: "They have the right amount of stretch in them." Ridenour said Chrysler was also taking steps to improve relations with its dealers, who were hit last year by higher financing costs and had complained the automaker was pressing them to take more inventory than they could sell. Chrysler's head of sales and marketing, Joe Eberhardt, who had come in for criticism by the company's dealers stepped aside in December. Ridenour said Chrysler management was listening closely to its dealers. "We're listening and having a two-way discussion. That's one of the important things we have to do," he said.
