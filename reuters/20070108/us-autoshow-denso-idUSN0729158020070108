 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The head of Japanese parts maker Denso Corp.'s ( 6902.T ) North American operations said on Sunday he expects revenues in the region to rise to $5.7 billion in the year ending in March 2007, up from $5.4 billion last year. 

 "Every year, we've had about 7 to 8 percent revenue growth," Mitsuo "Matt" Matsushita, chief executive officer of Denso International America, told Reuters in an interview at the North American International Auto Show here. "This year is no exception," he said. Matsushita said much of the growth was led by the strength of Japanese auto makers Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ), but that increased business with the U.S. Big Three also contributed.
