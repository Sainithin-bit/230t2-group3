 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ), 
the world's largest package delivery company, on Monday said it 
promoted David Abney to chief operating officer, and Alan 
Gershenhorn to replace Abney as president of UPS International. 

  Abney, 51, will oversee international operations, U.S. 
package operations, global transportation, labor and all 
freight activities. He will also become president of UPS 
Airlines, replacing John Beystehner, who retired last week.  Gershenhorn, 48, became head of non-operating functions for 
UPS Supply Chain Solutions in 2004, and later took over 
responsibility for all supply chain operations in Europe, Asia, 
the Middle East and Africa. He will join UPS' 12-member 
management committee.  Abney joined UPS in 1974, and Gershenhorn in 1979.
