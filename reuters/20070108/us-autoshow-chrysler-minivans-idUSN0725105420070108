 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group on Sunday showed off a redesigned pair of minivans aimed at preserving the automaker's lead in the family-friendly class of vehicles at a time when its overall sales are sagging. 

 Chrysler, the U.S. unit of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, is banking that the minivans equipped with new features intended to make them "family rooms on wheels" can connect with a younger generation of parents. The 2008 Chrysler Town & Country and Dodge Caravan, which were unveiled at the North American International Auto Show here, have been redesigned with over 30 new features, including a swiveling second row of seats. Chrysler, which pioneered the minivan market in the early 1980s, introduced a storage feature known as "Stow 'n Go" in its current minivans, a convenience analysts credited with helping the automaker keep its top spot in the segment. The upcoming minivans add a "Swivel 'n Go" feature that allows the second row seats to rotate to face the third row. A removable table fits between the two rows of seats. Industry analysts and dealers say interior features and safety are more important to minivan buyers than other considerations such as performance, a formula Chrysler executives say the automaker followed closely. "These minivans -- like all the minivans we've ever built - -- are designed from the inside out," Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said at a debut event. In a bid to underscore the importance of the "bread and butter" vehicles for Chrysler, LaSorda spoke from a platform decorated to look like a giant white bread wrapper. The redesigned Chrysler minivans, scheduled to go on sale this fall, offer directed lighting for passengers, an integrated child booster seat and a rear-view mirror designed to let parents keep an eye on their kids in the rear seats. They also offer four bottle holders, nine cup holders, four overhead bins and double glove compartments. Chrysler has forecast a 2006 loss of some $1.3 billion after failing to respond to the shift from high-margin trucks and sport utility vehicles in the face of higher gas prices. DaimlerChrysler's U.S. sales were down 5.5 percent in 2006 and the auto group was overtaken by Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) as the No. 3 player in the American market. In response, Chrysler Group is readying a restructuring plan to be announced in February, aimed at cutting production costs sharply. The current Chrysler and Dodge minivan models are the company's top-selling vehicles and account for almost 20 percent of Chrysler's U.S. sales. Chrysler also sells more than twice as many minivans as the combined total for Toyota Sienna and Honda Motor Co's ( 7267.T ) Odyssey, its closest competitors. The new Chrysler minivans will be built at assembly plants in Windsor, Ontario and Fenton, Missouri, the automaker said. General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) are scrapping minivans in favor of "crossover" vehicles that offer the handling characteristics of a car but with the roomier interior and higher ride of a SUV. "Some families really need a minivan, they need the sliding doors and all the things that a minivan does, but many families that use minivans would be just as well served by a crossover," GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said on Sunday.
