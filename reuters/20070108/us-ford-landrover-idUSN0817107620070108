 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.'s ( F.N ) Land Rover luxury unit expects to be profitable in 2007 for the third straight year, the unit's managing director said on Monday. 

 In 2006, Land Rover's global sales increased 4 percent to 192,500 vehicles, making it the best sales performance in the company's history. Land Rover expects an "even better year in 2007," Phil Popham told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, but declined to give an earnings forecast. Popham said the British brand, which sells luxury sport utility vehicles, ran out of some products last year. "Everything is set up very nicely for a positive 2007," he said. The brand's sales in the United States, one of its largest markets, were up 3.8 percent last year, boosted by the popularity of its new Range Rover Sport SUV, which saw an 80 percent growth. Popham said he expects U.S. sales to grow again this year. The profitability of the brand that is part of Ford's European luxury unit, dubbed Premier Automotive Group (PAG), has been spotty in recent years. PAG also includes Jaguar, Aston Martin and Volvo. Ford does not break out the financial results of its individual brands. Ford, which bought Land Rover from German premium carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) in 2000, has said it will continue to execute strategic studies regarding all its luxury brands as it struggles with a $7 billion overall loss in the first nine months of 2006. Land Rover has been lagging in quality the past few years. It was placed last in J.D. Power's 2006 Initial Quality Survey, logging 204 problems per 100 vehicles. Popham said management, union and workers are focused on improving the quality of Land Rover vehicles. The internal metrics measuring quality are moving in the right direction, he said. "We see it (improvement) a lot earlier than the surveys," Popham added.
