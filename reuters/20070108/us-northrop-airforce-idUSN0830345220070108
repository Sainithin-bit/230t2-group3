 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) is threatening to shun a competition against Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) for the U.S. Air Force's aerial refueling tanker program because of concerns over bidding rules, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 Northrop officially warned the Air Force in writing last week that it may not bid, the Journal said, citing sources familiar with the matter. Northrop officials believe the draft bidding guidelines effectively favor Boeing's less-expensive refueling plane because they do not lay out detailed criteria for how the Air Force will evaluate extra capabilities, such as cargo and capacity, that Northrop's proposed airline offers, the Journal cited sources as saying. The defense contractor is not expected to decide whether to withdraw until after the Air Force issues the final bidding document, which could be as early as next week, the Journal reported. The tanker program is valued at $100 billion or more, the paper said. A Northrop official was not immediately available for comment.
