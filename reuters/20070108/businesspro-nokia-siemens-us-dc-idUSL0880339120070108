 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The United States has imposed 
restrictions on the planned telecoms-networks joint venture of 
Germany's Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) and Finland's Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), 
the Financial Times reported on Monday. 

  The FT said the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investments in 
the United States (CFIUS) had conducted a national security 
review of the proposed joint venture -- which is set to become 
one of the industry's biggest players with sales of about $23 
billion.  Citing people familiar with the review, the newspaper said 
Nokia and Siemens had been forced to sign a so-called 
mitigations agreement, which could dictate whether foreigners 
can work on U.S. equipment and software.  Mitigations agreements contain conditions to which 
companies agree in order to gain regulatory clearance.  The FT said that in particular any deal involving Canada's 
Nortel Networks NT.N NT.TO, which does sensitive work for 
the U.S. government, would face a lengthy investigation.  Siemens referred queries on the report to Nokia Networks.  A Nokia spokeswoman said: "Nokia regards discussions with 
governmental authorities regarding CFIUS filings as 
confidential and as such we cannot comment on discussions or 
agreements with government authorities."  Mobile phone giant Nokia and German industrial conglomerate 
Siemens decided in June to merge the bulk of their telecoms 
network equipment businesses, the latest event in a wave of 
consolidation in the industry.  The new company had been due to start operations at the 
beginning of this year, but Nokia and Siemens said last month 
that a corruption probe at Siemens would delay the start of 
operations to later in the first quarter.  (Additional reporting by Reuters Helsinki bureau)
