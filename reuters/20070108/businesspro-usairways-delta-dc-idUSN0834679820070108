 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) on Monday said 
it would add Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) as a joint lead arranger 
with Citigroup ( C.N ) to underwrite the airline's $7.2 billion 
debt financing for its proposed merger with Delta Air Lines 
DALRQ.PK. 

  The addition requires the approval of US Airways' board. It 
would also allow the airline to add other financial 
institutions to the underwriting syndicate.  "These two world-class firms, combined with the possibility 
for a third firm, reinforce the financial community's 
confidence in the value creation of our proposed merger with 
Delta," US Airways Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr said in a 
statement.  The airline in November made a hostile bid for bankrupt 
Delta. Delta's management has rejected the offer, currently 
worth $8.6 billion based on US Airway's closing share price on 
Friday.  US Airways is appealing to Delta's unsecured creditors for 
permission to conduct more thorough research into the company.
