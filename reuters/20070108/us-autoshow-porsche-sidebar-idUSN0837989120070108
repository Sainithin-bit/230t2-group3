 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking on Monday struck a slightly more optimistic tone than a month ago about pretax profits in the 2006/07 financial year ending next July. 

 "The signals are not in a minor key," he told reporters at the North American International Auto Show, making a musical reference to relatively somber tones. At a news conference in December, Wiedeking had said Porsche would struggle to match the record 2.11 billion euros ($2.75 billion) in pretax profit it made in 2005/06 year. On Monday, he was not more specific, but cited good business so far this year and solid orders for the refreshed Cayenne offroader. In December he cited external factors such as the price of Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) stock as well as VW's dividend policy. Porsche is the biggest investor in VW. At the Detroit show, he declined to discuss Porsche's efforts to get a third board seat at VW until after a European court rules next month on whether to strike down Germany's VW law, which limits any investor's voting rights to 20 percent. But he indicated he thought VW Chairman Ferdinand Porsche could get another term on the VW supervisory board when his current one expires in April. "There is no reason to say anything to the contrary," he said.
