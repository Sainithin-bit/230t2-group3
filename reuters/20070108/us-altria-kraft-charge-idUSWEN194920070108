 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cigarette maker Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) said on Monday that its Kraft Foods Inc. unit is taking a $245 million non-cash asset impairment charge related to a cut in factory capacity for its Tassimo coffee system. 

 The charge will be reflected in the fourth quarter financial results of Kraft, which Altria plans to spin off. Altria said the charge will result in about $3 million in related cash expenditures, mostly related to decommissioning idled production lines.
