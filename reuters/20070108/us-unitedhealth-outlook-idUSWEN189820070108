 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ), which is trying to emerge from a stock options scandal, said on Monday it would affirm its financial outlook for 2006 and 2007 at an investor conference on Wednesday. 

 Estimates of noncash charges related to the stock options are not yet final, UnitedHealth said, and the outlooks exclude any nonoperating cash charges to resolve stock option-related matters, such as taxes, litigation and regulatory costs. The company said the amount and timing of these were uncertain but were likely to be material. In December, UnitedHealth Group Inc. forecast better-than-expected 2007 revenue and a rise in net earnings next year of about 14 percent. The company projected 2007 net earnings of $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion. UnitedHealth also said last month that U.S. securities regulators had launched a formal investigation into its stock options award practices.
