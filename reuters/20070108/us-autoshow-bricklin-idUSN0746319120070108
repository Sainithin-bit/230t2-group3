 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Malcolm Bricklin, the maverick entrepreneur whose efforts to import the first Chinese-made car to the United States have suffered repeated delays, said on Sunday he is talking with 15 new potential partners in China. 

 In an interview during the North American International International Auto Show, Bricklin also said he still has more than $50 million in deposits from would-be dealers who had signed up for his earlier efforts to bring in a Chinese car. On Sunday he said that the import, now be targeted to be in U.S. showrooms by 2009, would be powered by an electric hybrid plug-in engine, a change that contributed to the recent split with his original Chinese partner, Chery Automobile Co. Bricklin said the powerplant would be similar to the one General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) used in a concept car it unveiled on Sunday, the Volt, which is designed to use little or no gasoline. GM said the Volt will draw power exclusively from a next-generation battery pack recharged by a small onboard engine -- if the technology is ready in two or three years. "That's the way we're going," Bricklin said. "They have a engine bigger than we want....We can have a little engine, a little engine, that runs at one constant RPM and does nothing more than fill the battery up full time along with regenerative braking and you can get 100 to 150 miles a gallon." Bricklin said his company, Visionary Vehicles, was talking to 15 Chinese manufacturers "to make sure that we're going to end up with three that we like." He said a working proof of concept would be built in six months and that the cars would be in production by 2009. "We're starting to build the prototype," he said. Bricklin said he still had $2 million deposits each from 27 interested dealers. But he said he had returned $200 million he'd raised from George Soros after the Chery deal collapsed. "They're guys who want to something for the family, the next generation," Bricklin said of the dealers. "They're scared to death of the car business as it stands today. They know there's going to be a big deal in clean and a big deal in economy. And they just know that's going to drive the market for the next generation." Bricklin grabbed headlines with plans to bring Chinese-made cars to the U.S. market. But his venture has faced repeated delays and deep-seated skepticism from industry analysts. In September, Bricklin, best known for bringing the low-cost Yugo car to America, said his ambitious plans to import a range of Chinese-made vehicles had been delayed until the end of 2008 at the earliest. This fall, Bricklin said he had signed 50 dealers to sell the Chery-made vehicles, which he has pitched as a lower cost alternative to luxury brands such as BMW, Audi and Mercedes. On Sunday, Bricklin said the first Chinese-made car he will introduce to the United States would be in the same category as a Mercedes E-Class but sell for $15,000 to $25,000 less.
