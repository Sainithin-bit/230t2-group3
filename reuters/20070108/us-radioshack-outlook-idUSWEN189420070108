 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp. ( RSH.N ) said on Monday that it expects fourth-quarter 2006 net income to rise compared with the previous year's $51 million. 

 It expects the increase to be driven in part by lower SG&A expenses and improved margin and inventory management. The consumer electronics retailer said fourth-quarter comparable store sales would fall about 7.8 percent. Adjusted comparable store sales, excluding the impact of a reclassification, fell some 5.5 percent. The Fort Worth, Texas-based company, which is trying to stabilize its business by closing hundreds of stores and firing employees, said it anticipates "sales challenges" in the first part of 2007. During the all-important five weeks between the Thanksgiving holiday and the end of the year, RadioShack said adjusted same-store sales were down 2.5 percent. RadioShack, which is struggling to counter intense competition from other chains such as Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N and Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ), named turnaround veteran Julian Day chief executive officer in July, to replace David Edmondson, who resigned in February after admitting that he lied about his academic record. The company plans to release its fourth-quarter and full-year financial results on or about February 27.
