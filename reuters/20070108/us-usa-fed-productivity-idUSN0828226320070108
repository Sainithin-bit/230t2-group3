 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It's a mystery. Strong U.S. December job data is good news for workers, but also signals slowing productivity and a puzzle for the Federal Reserve, which must square the numbers with weaker readings on growth. 

 The uncertainty could keep U.S. interest rates on hold longer while the Fed ponders whether there has been a lasting slowdown in the pace at which the country can expand without triggering unacceptable inflation, or if productivity growth is just showing a typical cyclical slowdown. Productivity, a gauge of how much any given worker can produce in an hour, governs a country's ability to lift prosperity over time and is particularly crucial as the retirement of baby boomers shrinks the size of the work force. Government data on Friday showed a surprisingly robust pace of job growth last month, with job creation in October and November also stronger than previously thought. However, this picture of economic strength is at odds with generally softer readings on U.S. output, led by weak housing and manufacturing -- sectors that hobbled overall growth in the third quarter, and likely in the fourth quarter as well. It could mean some of the measurements are wrong and will be revised. Or it could mean the pace of productivity itself is weakening. That may mean higher labor costs and inflation. "This seems likely to fall out in one of two ways," said John Weinberg, director of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. "Either output growth is stronger than initial indicators suggest or productivity looks lower, and then this is a question of whether we are looking at temporary factors pushing productivity growth down, or something more related to trend," he said in a telephone interview. A decline in long-term trend productivity would mean the U.S. economy would have to grow more slowly to avoid sparking inflation than it has been able to do since the mid-1990s, when productivity growth accelerated. RADAR SCREEN The Fed highlighted the issue in the minutes of the December 12 meeting of its policy-setting committee. The minutes contained a careful statement that explained why recent muted readings on output might be misleading. "The growth of structural labor productivity could be weaker than currently thought, helping to reconcile the steady growth in employment with more subdued advances in spending and output," the central bank noted. On Friday, this contrast became starker. U.S. Labor Department data showed 29,000 more jobs were created in October and November than first thought, while December's total of 167,000 compared with forecasts for just 100,000 new jobs. "The Fed is clearly looking at the possibility that the potential growth rate of the economy is slower than thought," said Keith Hembre, chief economist at First American Funds in Minneapolis. "But I'm not sure that you can draw that conclusion from a couple of quarters of employment growth after the economy has slowed, because it follows a couple of quarters of very robust growth" he said. By definition, if output weakens while labor inputs stay strong, worker productivity slows. And since employment typically tracks changes in the business cycle with a lag, economists generally anticipate a temporary productivity drop-off whenever the business cycle turns down. In the third quarter, growth in U.S. labor productivity growth slowed to a mere 0.2 percent annual rate from 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Economists also believe it was pretty weak in the final three months of the year, a view bolstered by the jobs figures. "Certainly, these numbers imply that fourth-quarter productivity won't have been great, and that is bad for corporate profitability," said Richard Iley, U.S. economist at BNP Paribas in New York. Judging if the slowdown in productivity is more structural than cyclical takes a lot longer than two quarters. In the meantime, policy-makers know that even a cyclical slowdown will have some impact on the wage costs employers face for any given level production and, potentially, inflation. "If compensation is moving up and productivity looks low, that is going to make our measures of unit labor costs ... look higher," said the Richmond Fed's Weinberg. "Whether that is something that is going to add to existing inflation pressures, or work against any pressures that might be easing inflation, depends a lot on the state of inflation expectations," he said. "(It) doesn't necessarily feed through into more inflation."
