 RIYADH  (Reuters) - Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal said on Saturday he supports Citigroup's ( C.N ) reverse stock split and reinstatement of its cash dividend. 

 "Citigroup has demonstrated its ability to overcome the recent economic obstacles. I commend Citigroup's performance," Alwaleed, a prominent investor in Citigroup, said in a statement. The nephew of Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, Alwaleed is also chairman of Kingdom Holding 4280.SE. Citigroup, the most actively traded stock in the United States, will resume paying a normal dividend after it uses a reverse stock split to shrink the number of shares outstanding, it said in March. The bank will pay a quarterly dividend of a penny a share, its first payout since 2009. It said it will reduce the number of common shares outstanding to 2.9 billion from 29 billion through a 1-for-10 stock split. In March Alwaleed said he expected Citigroup to post a profit in the first quarter. Citigroup's chairman said in December the bank would not pay dividends in the near term. (Editing by  Nick Macfie )
