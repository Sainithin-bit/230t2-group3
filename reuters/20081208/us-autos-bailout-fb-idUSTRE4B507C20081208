 (Reuters) - Congressional Democrats sent the White House plan to aid struggling U.S. automakers with up to $17 billion in loans drawn from an existing Energy Department fuel-efficiency technology fund. 

 General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC both want billions of dollars by month's end. Ford Motor Co is seeking a line of credit to be tapped if finances worsen more than expected in 2009. The final amount to be available depends on a review of the energy loan fund by congressional budget analysts. Here are key elements of the draft "Auto Industry Financing and Restructuring Act," which is still subject to negotiation: * President to designate one or more officials to oversee the plan and report to Congress periodically. * Loans would be for seven years -- at 5 percent interest for five years, and 9 percent the final two years. * Authorizes loans or lines of credit to automakers that submitted plans to Congress on December 2. * By March 31, requires automakers submit a comprehensive restructuring plan on achieving long-term viability. * Companies required to flag any transaction worth over $25 million, which federal government's plan overseer can veto. * President's car chief would get warrants for common or preferred stock in the companies in exchange for the loans. * Prohibits payment of dividends by a company receiving assistance. * Limits compensation of top executives at automakers receiving assistance and prohibits golden parachutes while a loan is outstanding. * Requires automakers to divest any interest in private passenger aircraft during the period of the assistance. * Gives the General Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, broad access to company information.
