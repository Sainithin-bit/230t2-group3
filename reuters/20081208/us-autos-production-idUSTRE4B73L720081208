 (Reuters) - European car and truck makers are cutting working hours, extending normal year-end holidays and shutting down factories to slow output at a time of slumping demand. 

 Measures announced so far include: FORD Ford in Germany is reducing output by nearly 4 percent this year and cutting 500 part-time and temporary jobs, its head told German newspaper Die Welt. MAN Halting production at its German truck assembly plants for 40-50 days. It says it will probably apply in December for shorter working hours. DAIMLER Shortening working hours at its main German plant in Sindelfingen for three months from January 12, affecting two-thirds of the factory's 28,000 workers, works council head Erich Klemm said. The works council is in talks with management over shortening working hours at all of Daimler's German plants. BMW Suspended production at its factory in Leipzig for a week in October and is operating only one shift a day there. The company plans to cut 400 further temporary workers in Leipzig, in addition to previously announced plans to cut 8,100 full-time jobs around the world.

Its luxury brand Audi is considering similar measures. PORSCHE Closed its main plant for one day in November and plans to shut for another seven days before end-January.
