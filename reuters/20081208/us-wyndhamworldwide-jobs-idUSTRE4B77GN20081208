 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hotel and timeshare company Wyndham Worldwide Corp ( WYN.N ) said on Monday it will cut about 4,000 jobs as it shrinks its timeshare business to help eliminate its reliance on the asset-backed securities market. 

 Wyndham expects to reduce gross vacation ownership interest sales in 2009 to $1.2 billion from expected gross sales of $2 billion in 2008 by eliminating sales offices and marketing programs. "Unfortunately, it has a relatively large impact on individuals, which is the terrible thing -- I would say it's around 4,000 people," Stephen Holmes, Wyndham Worldwide chief executive, said in an interview. The job cuts will affect roughly 12.5 percent of Parsippany, New Jersey-based Wyndham's 32,000 employees around the world. Wyndham now expects 2009 revenue of between $3.7 billion and $4.1 billion, down from a previous forecast of $4.1 billion to $4.5 billion. "For the last couple of decades we have taken the receivables generated when we sell timeshare ... to the market and we borrow money against them," said Holmes. "Now, in this current credit environment, that market has dried up." CHARGES Wyndham expects to take a charge of between $50 million and $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2008 and $10 million to $15 million in the first quarter of 2009 related to Monday's announcements. "With the credit markets showing no signs of improvement, we are effectively eliminating our need to access the securitization markets to support an otherwise well-performing vacation ownership business," said Holmes. On October 30, Wyndham said third-quarter profit rose 21 percent, despite a slowing U.S. economy, but warned the fourth quarter might be tougher. Wyndham's shares, which have plummeted from over $30 a year ago, rose more than 24 percent to close at $5.68 on Monday. The company primarily serves U.S. leisure travelers through its timeshare businesses and economy hotel chains. Wyndham operates brands such as Ramada, Days Inn and Super 8.
