 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is considering cutting its capital spending for the business year starting in April by 30-40 percent from this year in response to a sharp downturn in auto sales, the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper reported on Monday. 

 Toyota and rival automakers are slashing their output as tight credit and deepening consumer uncertainty hit car sales globally. Vehicle sales in the United States, the world's largest market, plunged in November to the lowest level since 1982. Toyota, the world's biggest carmaker, has set up an emergency committee, chaired by President Katsuaki Watanabe, aimed at boosting profitability over the next few months to avoid lowering its earnings forecasts again. Last month, it slashed its annual operating profit forecast by 1 trillion yen and Nissan Motor Co were in the same boat. Endo said he expected Toyota to reduce annual capital spending to slightly below 1 trillion yen next year, compared with its official estimate of 1.4 trillion yen for the year ending in March. That is bad news for machinery and equipment makers such as Fanuc Ltd and Omron Corp, although their shares outperformed the main Nikkei average's 5 percent rise with gains of 6-7 percent on Monday. Toyota's shares ended down 3 percent at 2,730 yen. Suppliers, on the other hand, are already preparing for more pain with production plans being reduced everywhere. Shares of Denso Corp and Aisin Seiki Co, Toyota's core suppliers, have plummeted 48-50 percent in the past month, largely due to fears of big losses at Detroit's General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler, which are likely to shrink their operations as they seek a government bailout to avoid bankruptcy. Toyota is also slashing production plans further to cope with falling sales and rising inventory. It said on Friday it was cutting North American production of its best-selling cars, including the Camry and Corolla sedans, by idling several plants for additional days in December and January. Elsewhere, a South Korean newspaper added to the gloom, reporting that Kia Motors Corp, the country's No. 2 automaker, was expecting a 9 percent fall in sales volumes next year. A company spokeswoman said no official target had been set yet. ($1=92.82 Yen) (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim  and  Taiga Uranaka  in TOKYO, Cheon Jong-woo in Seoul; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
