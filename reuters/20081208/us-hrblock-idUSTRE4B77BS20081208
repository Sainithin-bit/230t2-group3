 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ), the largest U.S. tax preparer, on Monday posted a smaller second quarter loss, after shedding its money-losing mortgage operations to focus on its tax business. 

 The net loss narrowed to $135.9 million, or 41 cents per share, from a loss of $502.3 million, or $1.55, a year earlier, for the fiscal second quarter ended Oct 31. H&R Block reported a loss from continuing operations of $133.2 million, or 40 cents per share compared with a loss of $134.9 million, or 42 cents in the year ago period. On that basis, analysts on average expected a loss of 41 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 1 percent to $351.5 million, short of the average $386 million forecast. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company often loses money in its fiscal first and second quarters, which fall outside the main U.S. tax filing season. Chairman Richard Breeden said H&R Block is heading into that season "in a stronger position" than last year, after shedding assets he said distracted it from tax preparation. Since the departure of Mark Ernst as chief executive last year, Breeden has closed H&R Block's subprime mortgage lending unit and sold a mortgage servicing business to Wilbur Ross' investment firm WL Ross & Co for $1.1 billion. A little over a month ago, the company said it sold its H&R Block Financial Advisors securities brokerage to Ameriprise Financial Inc ( AMP.N ) for about $312 million. H&R Block treated the brokerage as a discontinued unit in the latest quarter. Breeden is a private investor who used to run the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company still expects full-year profit from continuing operations of $1.60 to $1.70 per share, the same as it had forecast on Sept 3. Analysts on average expected a profit excluding items of $1.62 per share. Shares of H&R Block closed Monday up 17 cents at $20.35 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 9.6 percent this year. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by Carol Bishopric)
