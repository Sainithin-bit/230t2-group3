 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev INTB.BR, the world's largest brewer, announced plans on Monday to cut 1,400 jobs in the United States, some 6 percent of the workforce there, as it sought a return on its $52 billion merger. 

 The company, whose key international brands are Budweiser, Stella Artois and Beck's, has targeted merger cost savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2011. About 75 percent of the job losses announced on Monday would be at Anheuser-Busch's former corporate headquarters in St Louis. In addition, more than 250 open U.S. vacancies would not be filled. A further 415 contractors would also be laid off. The job cuts, most to be realized by the end of the year, are in addition to some 1,000 positions that went with an enhanced retirement program, which closed last month, part of Anheuser-Busch's $1 billion saving Blue Ocean plan. That plan, launched as a defense to InBev's then hostile takeover bid, had envisaged cutting the salaried workforce by 10 percent to 15 percent by the end of the year. AB InBev said the latest job reduction plans would cost it a pre-tax $197 million. Workers at Anheuser's 12 U.S. breweries would be largely unaffected. AB InBev also said on Monday it would be carrying out a restructuring of its business in Britain, in addition to finding synergy savings there. It did not say how many workers might be affected. InBev, which bought its U.S. rival for $52 billion, has launched a $9.8 billion rights issue that ends this week and needs to find $7 billion from divestments by late 2009. AB InBev took the number one spot back from SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ), when it bought Budweiser-maker Anheuser. (Reporting by  Philip Blenkinsop ; Editing by Andrew Macdonald)
