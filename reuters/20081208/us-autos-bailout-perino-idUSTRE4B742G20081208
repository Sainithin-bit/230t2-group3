 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House has received the language for legislation aimed at providing billions of dollars to help the ailing U.S. automakers, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said on Monday. 

 "We did receive the language around 2:40 p.m.," she told Reuters. "We're in active communication with them (Congress)." She reiterated her earlier comment that it was "possible" that a deal could be reached on Monday. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , editing by Jackie Frank)
