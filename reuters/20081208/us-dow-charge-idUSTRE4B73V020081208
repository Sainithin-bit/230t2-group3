 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co said on Monday it considered altering the structure of its bid for specialty chemicals maker Rohm & Haas and was committed to completing the acquisition. 

 "Rest assured we've looked at every possible exchange. At the same time, we're committed to closing the deal," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Andrew Liveris said on a conference call in response to a question from an analyst. The company also said it would take an estimated $700 million in pretax charges, or 50 to 60 cents per share, in the fourth quarter to implement the job cuts and operational reductions announced earlier on Monday.
