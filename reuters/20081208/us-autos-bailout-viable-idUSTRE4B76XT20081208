 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House is concerned that the draft legislation to bail out U.S. automakers does not meet its demand that only viable firms get access to the money, a White House source said on Monday. 

 The source, who declined to be further identified, said it was hard to say definitively since the language arrived in the last few hours, but that administration officials would continue talking to lawmakers to address the issue. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky )
