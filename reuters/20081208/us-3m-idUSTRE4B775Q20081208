 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co ( MMM.N ) said on Monday it will cut 2,300 jobs in the fourth quarter and lowered its 2008 outlook due to the global economic downturn, sending its shares down as much as 7.4 percent. 

 3M, an economic bellwether whose products range from cell- phone circuits to Post-It notes, said in a statement that it lowered its 2008 outlook to between $5.10 and $5.15 per share, excluding items, from an earlier estimate of $5.40 to $5.48. "Some people have actually been somewhat critical of our '08 performance and the reality is we were seeing a slowing economy before it ever was officially called a slowing economy," Chief Financial Officer Pat Campbell told a gathering of investors in New York City, also on Monday. The revised outlook disappointed expectations on Wall Street, which expected the company's 2008 earnings to be $5.44 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "3M is clearly more cyclical than most investors realize," wrote Citi analyst Jeffrey Sprague in a note to clients. Sprague has a "sell" rating on 3M's shares in the belief 3M has been mistakenly viewed as more defensive than it actually is. The company is exposed to several end markets, including automotive, consumer and office and dental, that are already taking a hit from the cyclical downturn, Sprague noted. The company has already cut 1,800 jobs in the fourth quarter and will cut 500 more -- about 2.9 percent of its workforce, spokeswoman Jacqueline Berry said. Most of the cuts will affect the United States, Western Europe and Japan. They should cost $215 million, or about 22 cents per share, and save the company $225 million into 2009, the company told investors. Should economic conditions warrant it, the company said it is prepared to implement additional restructuring, wrote John Roberts of the Buckingham Research Group in a client note. 3M joins a long list of companies forced to cut jobs due to the weakening economy. Also on Monday Danaher Corp ( DHR.N ) and Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) announced they were slashing their workforces 2009 VIEW ALSO MISSES 3M's outlook for 2009, in the range of $4.50 to $4.95 per share, also excluding special items, misses analysts' view as well. Analysts were expecting 2009 earnings of $5.38 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Another analyst was more sanguine about 3M's fourth quarter and its future. "While a bit surprised with the magnitude of weakness in (the fourth quarter), it's not shocking," J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note to clients. He said the shares would likely be down on this news, but that could create a buying opportunity. Tusa rates them as "overweight." "No one is immune to economic pressures. That being said, we continue to believe 3M holds up better than most," Tusa said. Indeed, 3M pared some of its losses on comments executives made to investors about its infrastructure business, which they called a potential bright spot. Chief Executive George Buckley said its new water infrastructure technology is "probably the largest single growth opportunity that we have in the company," and that 3M is prepared to invest in it by buying related companies to "see whether we can turn this into a real growth engine." 3M's shares closed down about 4 percent, or $2.47, at $57.38 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are about 31 percent lower year-to-date, outperforming the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX , which is down 38 percent.
