 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Wednesday 
fourth-quarter profit rose, helped by strong sales of its 
commercial aircraft. 

  The world's largest plane-maker by sales, which is also the 
Pentagon's No. 2 supplier, reported quarterly profit of $1.03 
billion, or $1.36 per share, compared with $989 million, or 
$1.29 per share, in the year-ago quarter.  (Reporting by  Bill Rigby ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
