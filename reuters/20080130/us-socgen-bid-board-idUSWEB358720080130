 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale said that a board meeting held on Wednesday never discussed the subject of a takeover bid for SocGen. 

 "The topic was not on the agenda of the board," said a spokeswoman for the bank. SocGen shares were up 5.4 percent in late afternoon trade after French newspaper Le Figaro carried out a report by news agency AFP which said that SocGen chairman Daniel Bouton was "open to a friendly offer." The SocGen spokeswoman said the report was "without foundation." (Reporting by Yann Le Guernigou,  Sudip Kar-Gupta )
