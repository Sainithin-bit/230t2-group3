 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N Chief Executive John Thain on Wednesday expressed confidence in the company's core set of businesses, but analysts continue to worry that more large write-downs are looming. 

 Oppenheimer Inc analyst Meredith Whitney said in a research note late on Tuesday that Merrill could face a write-down of as much as $10 billion if some bond insurers were downgraded. Whitney estimated the write-down at $3 billion to $5 billion, assuming only Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N is at risk of downgrades, but said it could double if MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) is also downgraded. Ambac and MBIA are among a group of bond insurers known as monolines because that is their only business. Merrill shares were down 5 cents at $57.42 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. During a presentation at Citigroup's financial services conference in New York, Thain discussed Merrill's exposure to monolines, but he mostly talked about the company's growth potential, such as expanding the wealth management franchise overseas. "I like our core set of businesses," Thain said. During the second half of 2007, Merrill's write-downs and credit losses were about $24 billion, mostly because of declines in the value of subprime mortgage-related securities. A more recent concern, though, is Merrill's exposure to troubled U.S. bond insurers. The industry is in turmoil as Ambac and MBIA try to rebuild balance sheets depleted by losses from backing mortgage-related securities. As Merrill discussed earlier this month, its net exposure to collateralized debt obligations hedged by monoline insurers is about $3.5 billion. Thain said if monolines "disappeared from the face of the earth" -- which he didn't expect to happen -- they would owe Merrill Lynch about $6 billion. In any case, Merrill has reserved $2.6 billion against the $6 billion, leaving about $3.5 billion in monoline exposure, Thain said. Whitney estimated, however, that Merrill's total exposure to MBIA, Ambac and fellow monoline ACA Capital Holdings ACAH.PK was nearly $15 billion, an amount she said was the largest among big financial institutions.
