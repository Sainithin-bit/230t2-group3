 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pulte Homes Inc ( PHM.N ), the No. 3 U.S. home builder, said on Wednesday its quarterly net loss widened as a deteriorating housing market led to charges related to the lower value of land and inventory, and charges tied to income taxes. 

 Pulte reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $874.7 million, or $3.46 per share, compared with a loss of $8.4 million, or 3 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter.
