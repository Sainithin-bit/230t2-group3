 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve cut a key interest rate by a half-percentage point on Wednesday as part of an aggressive effort to halt a sharp slowdown in an economy hit by a housing slump and a credit crunch. 

  KEY POINTS: * The Fed's action takes the federal funds rate target to 3 percent, the lowest since June 2005. * The cut comes just eight days after it slashed rates by a bold three-quarters of a point. * The cumulative 1.25 percentage point reduction in the benchmark overnight rate in less than two weeks ranks among the most abrupt rate-cutting sprees in the modern history of the U.S. central bank.  COMMENTS: AMO SAHOTA, PRESIDENT AND HEAD OF GLOBAL RESEARCH, HIFX,  SAN FRANCISCO: "This move is really designed to help financial markets even if it allows inflation pressures to pick up later on down the line. "The big challenge is going to be with euro/dollar and whether it has enough momentum to push up through its high and make headway into the 1.50s. The market may want to wait for the ECB and what it does with its policy decision." BILL O'NEILL, MANAGING PARTNER, LOGIC ADVISORS, UPPER  SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "This is certainly constructive. It weakens the dollar and it tends to be inflationary, so this is a plus for gold. And I think it will help continue the upward trend that we've been seeing in gold. This is going to help all the precious metals and should help the copper market as well." "I think the gains in copper are probably exaggerated. But certainly we are going to have more stimulative activity. And the Fed left open the possibility of further rate cuts. That was very significant." IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY  ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: "The Fed's statement does not say, but we expect to see in the minutes, that the Fed's new forecasts are much gloomier than in October. The statement repeats that there is downside risk to growth but drops 'appreciable' and says in addition that the policy action so far 'should promote moderate growth over time.' They are still ready to 'act in a timely manner as needed' but the hint here is that they think further easing will be much slower - markets permitting." DAVID GREENWALD, PARTNER, SCALENE CAPITAL MANAGEMENT,  NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA: "I am a little disappointed by the 50 basis-point cut. I thought the Fed was a little more in control and was hoping they would show a little bit of spine. But they seem to be bowing to the market. Now cutting by 50 seems like they're chasing their tails. Their actions have me concerned about their credibility. Because of that, the euro is nearing its all-time high versus the dollar. I don't think that's a surprise." "The Fed looks foolish. It seems they're afraid of the market. Everyone knows that it takes a while for 75 basis points to get through the economy and by cutting 50 now, I just think they're not leaving much room in the future." DAVID WATT, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT RBC CAPITAL  MARKETS, TORONTO: "It's largely what everybody was expecting. I am somewhat surprised at the violent market reaction to that. People were expecting 50 basis points and for the Fed to leave the door open to more rate cuts. That's basically what they did. The reaction to sell the U.S. dollar seems to be a little bit of a surprise. "Even if (the jobs report) comes in weaker or negative, it's only going to be the first bad employment report. We are not getting any indications that it will necessarily be that weak. Initial jobs less claims have been fairly steady to a little bit lower, the ADP employment number was above expectations. It really doesn't look like we are going to see a bad jobs report. The Q4 GDP number was much lower-than-expected. Everybody seems to be extremely attuned to any indication economy might be slowing into a recession." KEVIN LOGAN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT, NEW  YORK: "They're taking straight aim at the financial markets in order to calm down financial turmoil and create conditions that will help these financial institutions repair some of the damage they've endured over the past couple of months. What they're concerned about is financial markets and the solvency and of all these financial institutions." ART FRANK, HEAD OF MBS RESEARCH, DEUTSCHE BANK AG, NEW  YORK: "It is what many MBS traders were expecting, and at the moment we are tighter to swaps but not dramatically. It is possible MBS tighten more because in the longer term, lower rates make the CMO arbitrage better (via) a steeper yield curve, and there's hope that banks that aren't too capital constrained now have better carry on mortgages, so they might buy more MBS. It would have been a disappointment to the market if it'd only been 25 basis points." JEFF KLEINTOP, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL  SERVICES IN BOSTON: "The Fed is demonstrating that they are getting ahead of the curve. Given that the weakness in the economy is stemming from the repricing of adjustable-rate mortgages, the Fed is pulling a key lever in liming the negative effects from that. The statement itself dropped the word appreciable from "downside risks" so maybe they feel that now, with this latest policy action, they have taken the worst-case scenario of a deep recession off the table." FRED DICKSON, MARKET STRATEGIST, DIRECTOR OF RETAIL  RESEARCH, D.A. DAVIDSON & CO., LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "50 basis points basically placated both the stock and the bond markets. The Fed left the door open for further rate cuts, and the wording of the statement focused on their actions being targeted to the situation in the financial markets. Inflation didn't appear to be a problem, and the bias is still toward easing, with slowing growth in the economy the big risk. It's a convincing move, but expected. It's going to help ease the situation in the credit markets and in availability of loans to smaller business where there might have been some credit tightening. Whether it's enough to ward off a recession still remains to be seen. I think we'll have a better clue on Friday when we see the jobs report. Since 50 basis points was expected, I wouldn't be surprised to see some selling and profit-taking (in stocks) later in the day, and end of up flat on the day or below current levels." KEN LANDON, G10 CURRENCY STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN CHASE, NEW  YORK: "They are not in panic mode. They are focused on the real economy, and they need to cut rates. Let's face it, they were behind the curve before and now they are trying to get to where they think they should be. "The dollar may be some downside in the short term but I think the market will start to reward future growth. At some point, the market is going to wake up and realize this is good for the U.S. economy." PETER BEUTEL, PRESIDENT, CAMERON HANOVER, NEW CANAAN,  CONNECTICUT: "This is kind of what we have been expecting but a lot of people actually needed to see it. In my opinion, which is very petro-centric, this is both good news and bad news. The good news is that this may preclude a recession; the bad news is that this is pushing oil prices higher than they would otherwise be. "Many of the problems of this economy are caused by higher oil prices which are the underpinnings of an inflationary trend that is building. And while Congress is preparing to give people money in the form of tax rebates, higher oil prices, and heating oil prices and gasoline prices at the pump, take that money right back."
