 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ) will spend "somewhat less" on technology and content on a percentage basis than its revenue growth in 2008, the company's chief financial officer said on Wednesday. 

 "We certainly expect it to be somewhat less than revenue growth in 2008," said Tom Szkutak, speaking to analysts during a conference call following the release of the Internet retailers fourth-quarter 2007 results. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
