 PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares in French bank Societe Generale jumped by more than 5 percent on Wednesday after a report that Chairman and CEO Daniel Bouton has said he may be ready to study a friendly offer, two dealers said. 

 A SocGen spokeswoman said the report was without foundation. The report, which appeared on newspaper Le Figaro's website and cited news agency Agence France Presse, gave its source for Bouton's view as a member of the supervisory board who wanted to remain anonymous.
