 PARIS  (Reuters) - Nobody can say the global banking crisis is over, BNP Paribas Chief Executive Baudouin Prot told Le Monde newspaper in an interview published on Wednesday. 

 "The market crisis is too serious for us to have anything to be proud of," he said. "It causes us instead to be vigilant on all levels. Nobody can say we have come through it." As BNP, France's largest bank, delivered an estimated set of higher 2007 results while its cross-town rival Societe Generale struggles with rogue trader losses, Prot declined to comment on market speculation BNP might bid for SocGen. "I do not want to reply to those questions," he said. (Editing by Quentin Bryar)
