 PARIS  (Reuters) - Paris prosecutors have decided not to open an investigation into allegations of insider trading at Societe Generale and are seeking advice from the French markets regulator AMF, a prosecutor said on Wednesday. 

 A lawyer representing around 100 small SocGen shareholders said earlier this week he had complained to police about possible insider trading after it was revealed a SocGen director sold about a million shares on January 9 and January 10. SocGen said the manager sold the shares well before a rogue trading scandal was uncovered. (Reporting by Thierry Leveque; writing by  Crispian Balmer )
