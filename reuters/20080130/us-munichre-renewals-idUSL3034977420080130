 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Munich Re dodged subprime bullets to post record earnings for 2007 and said it would propose raising its dividend by more than a fifth, which boosted its shares over 4 percent. 

 The world's second-biggest reinsurer unveiled preliminary net profit of 3.9 billion euros ($5.8 billion) for 2007 after trimming its exposure to the risky U.S. mortgage market and said risks from U.S. monoline bond insurers were relatively small. "Our prudent investment policy and healthy skepticism towards excesses in individual markets have proved justified," Munich Re Chief Financial Officer Joerg Schneider said on Wednesday, presenting results a month ahead of schedule. The downtrend in reinsurance prices and volatile financial markets would make 2008 a difficult year, but the company was sticking to its broad expectation of making a net profit of around 3.1 billion euros this year, Schneider told a conference call with journalists. The company moved quickly to minimize its risks from the financial market turmoil emanating from the crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, which was still taking its toll on financial houses such as UBS. The Swiss bank on Wednesday revealed another $4 billion in surprise write-downs. In the fourth quarter, Munich Re trimmed its equity investments and booked losses of less then 10 million euros on investments exposed to the subprime market, after writing down about 150 million euros in the first nine months of last year. This cut its holdings of subprime-exposed investments to 340 million euros, less than 0.2 percent of its overall portfolio. "Even downgrades of two to three notches, which could happen, would still not mean anything significant for us," Schneider said. Munich Re also said it faced write-downs in the low double-digit million-euro range, at most, on its holdings of bonds guaranteed by U.S. monoline bond insurers. It could take a hit by covering risks from lawsuits against financial institutions with Directors & Officers insurance, but had made provisions for the claims, it said. The 2007 net profit figure was above analysts' median forecast of 3.83 billion euros, according to Reuters Estimates and topped Munich Re's own 3.5-3.8 billion euro target range. Munich Re plans to raise its dividend to 5.50 euros per share for 2007 from 4.50 euros and aims to pay out at least 1 billion euros in dividends annually through 2010. Investors welcomed the clean bill of health. Its shares rose 4.4 percent at 119.70 euros at 1123 GMT, compared with a 0.5 percent drop among European insurance peers. "The net profit was excellent, and the dividend was higher than expected," said Cheuvreux analyst Michael Haid. PRICE PRESSURE Munich Re said it was seeing ever greater competition in the property-casualty reinsurance business, which was putting mounting pressure on various types of business in negotiations to renew contracts in January. The company managed to limit average price erosion to 2.8 percent in its renewed business, while premiums fell 4 percent to 8.1 billion euros, mainly due to a cut by one big client. "At first glance the outcome of January renewals is better than expected," said DZ Bank analyst Thorsten Wenzel in a note to clients. "The decline in volume indicates that Munich Re remained disciplined in the renewals, and the decline in price is at the lower end of our expectations of 3-6 percent," he added. Munich Re's insurance unit ERGO saw improved business in German life insurance at the end of last year. The company is due to release full results on February 25. (Editing by Will Waterman)
