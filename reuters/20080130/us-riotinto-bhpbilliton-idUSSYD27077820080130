 MELBOURNE/SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto's ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) shares surged on Wednesday amid market talk that an improved offer had prompted the firm to open its books to suitor BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) and media reports which said Rio had signaled a price at which it would sell out. 

 Rio, which has spurned a three-shares-for-one proposal from BHP, said it had nothing to report in response to rumors that it opened its books to BHP on the basis of a sweetened offer of 3.5 shares. "If we had anything to disclose to the market under our obligations we would do so," Rio Tinto spokeswoman Amanda Buckley in Australia told Reuters. Rio shares jumped 4.7 percent in early London trade and were 2.9 percent firmer at 48.06 pounds by 6:30 a.m. ET, making it the third biggest gainer in the FTSE 100  .FTSE  and outperforming a 1.2 percent rise in the UK mining index .FTNMX1770. In the first 45 minutes of trade in London, more than 1.7 million Rio shares changed hands, a quarter of the average for the full day over the past 30 days. A source in London close to the situation said BHP was expected to put forward a sweetened offer, but this would have to be disclosed to the market. "It's all a bit premature at the moment but my guess is a revised proposal will be put forward," the source said. "BHP is going to try and keep it friendly if they can, so they have to adjust the offer and if they adjusted it enough Rio would open its books." BHP must decide by February 6 whether to make a formal offer or walk away for at least six months under a deadline imposed by Britain's Takeover Panel. The shares also gained after Australian newspapers reported that Rio's financial advisers suggested BHP could afford to raise its share offer by at least 42 percent to $157 billion. Rio Tinto also declined to confirm that report, but if true, it would mark the first time Rio has flagged what it might consider a fair bid since rebuffing BHP's original proposal worth around $139 billion last November. The value of the offer has declined to $110 billion as share prices slid. DANCING AROUND EACH OTHER The Australian Financial Review and The Australian newspaper reported Rio's financial adviser Macquarie Bank ( MQG.AX ) as saying BHP could afford to offer to at least 4.25 of its shares for every Rio share. BHP declined to comment. "That's like Rio putting down some opening shot in a way unofficially. They are dancing around each other at the moment," said Robert Hook, a portfolio manager with S.G. Hiscock & Co. "The market is telling you that the offer next week could be somewhere between the two levels," he said. At current share prices in London, Rio shares are worth 10 percent more than BHP's proposed offer. An offer of 4.25 BHP shares would mean a 28 percent premium to Rio's shares. "That's a big premium to Rio's share price and one that would have a lot of Rio shareholders scrambling," said DJ Carmichael & Co analyst James Wilson. "But just because the report says that's what BHP can pay, it doesn't mean that's what it will pay." Market speculation last week suggested BHP was poised to offer 3.58 of its shares, plus A$16.50, for each Rio share, valuing Rio at around A$141.00 a share at the time. The newspapers said the analysis by Macquarie Bank showed BHP could justify an offer of 4.25-for-one based on Rio's forecast earnings for 2008, expected merger savings and a planned share buyback. The estimate increased to 5.02-for-one, assuming the market pushed the combined group's value up 10 percent once a deal was completed. Rio Tinto's chief executive, Tom Albanese, told Reuters last week that BHP's proposed three-for-one share swap was "two ball parks" away from a fair bid. BHP Chief Executive Marius Kloppers has argued that billions of extra dollars in synergies from both companies iron ore, copper and other businesses justified the three-for-one offer.
