 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief executive of Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) on Wednesday said "media hype" of a clinical trial of the company's blockbuster Vytorin cholesterol drug has overlooked the medicine's value but not harmed Merck's reputation. 

 "Certainly we're concerned by the extensive news coverage, which has created a great deal of confusion among health care professionals and patients," Richard Clark said in an interview after release of the drugmaker's fourth-quarter earnings. He was referring to ongoing media coverage of the so-called Enhance study, in which Vytorin cut levels of "bad" LDL cholesterol far better than the widely used generic simvastatin, but failed to reduce the buildup of fatty plaque in neck arteries. The data were unveiled on January 14. Some news accounts said the 21-month delay by Merck and marketing partner Schering-Plough Corp SGP.N in publishing the trial data suggested they were hiding negative findings. Clark said that the companies had acted appropriately and that the allegations -- which are being investigated by Congress as well as the state attorneys general of New York and Connecticut -- have not sullied Merck's image. "I think we've explained in detail the reason for the delay ... what we were trying to do from a science standpoint and a quality standpoint." "The hallmark of Merck has always been and always will be scientific ethics, and I don't think this will do damage to that at all," he said. The controversy comes on the heels of Merck's withdrawal in 2004 of its $2.5 billion-a-year Vioxx arthritis drug, long after it was introduced, once the medicine was linked to a higher risk of heart attack. Tens of thousands of patients filed lawsuits alleging harm from Vioxx, with some asserting that Merck for years had seen strong signals of heart risk but had failed to alert patients. Merck contends it has always put patient-safety first, but it recently offered a $4.85 billion settlement to Vioxx plaintiffs. Shares of Merck and Schering-Plough have fallen more than 20 percent since the Enhance results were made public two weeks ago, as some prominent cardiologists have questioned the value of Vytorin and its sister drug Zetia. "There are no better products in lowering LDL than Vytorin and Zetia," Clark said on Wednesday. He said the companies have aggressively contacted doctors and insurers since the Enhance data were announced in order to underscore Vytorin's value and have received favorable responses. Vytorin, which combines Zetia with the widely used older treatment simvastatin, is sold by a joint venture of Merck and Schering-Plough. The companies also sell Zetia as a separate medicine.
