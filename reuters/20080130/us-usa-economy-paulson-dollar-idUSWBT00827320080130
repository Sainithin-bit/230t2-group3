 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Wednesday that a strong dollar is in the United States' interest and that the economy's underlying long-term strength should show through to currency markets. 

 "Not only is a strong dollar in our nation's interest but ... our economy, like any others, has ups and downs," Paulson said as he took questions at a real estate roundtable. "I believe we're going to continue to grow and we've got fundamental long-term strength and the strength of our economy is going to be reflected in the currency markets," he said.
