 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Subprime losses at Japan's Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ) may have nearly doubled to $2.8 billion, potentially forcing the bank to further cut its forecast and plough more money into its struggling brokerage, newspapers reported on Wednesday. 

 Japanese banks have so far avoided the massive subprime losses that have hit overseas rivals, and Mizuho has invested $1.2 billion in struggling rival Merrill Lynch MER.N. Still, Tokyo lenders have not escaped unscathed. Soured bets on subprime investments forced smaller Mizuho rival Shinsei Bank ( 8303.T ) to cut its earnings outlook for a second time. "Losses from subprime are clearly not over and will continue to increase from here," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. "From the point of view of investors, the bad news will continue to mount." Mizuho could see as much as 300 billion yen ($2.8 billion) of losses on subprime investments, the Nikkei newspaper said, well above the 170 billion yen the bank has estimated for the year to March. The lender may also have to inject an additional 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) or more into Mizuho Securities, where subprime losses are likely to total 250 billion yen, the Nikkei said. That would bring Mizuho's total aid to the brokerage to about $3.3 billion. The unit has fallen into the red and had to delay a planned merger with brokerage Shinko Securities 8606.T by four months until May. The downturn could force Mizuho to further cut its full-year forecast, the Yomiuri newspaper said. Mizuho, which is due to report nine-month results on Thursday, cut its full-year estimate in November by 13 percent to 650 billion yen, citing losses on securitized products at Mizuho Securities. Mizuho spokeswoman Masako Shiono declined to comment on whether the bank would further lower its forecast or inject more capital into Mizuho Securities. SECURITIES WOES Mizuho President Terunobu Maeda acknowledged at a news conference in November that the bank was having a tough time pricing its subprime investments. "The market is crashing and you can't accurately determine prices," Maeda said. Separately, mid-sized lender Shinsei lowered its group net earnings forecast for the year to March for a second time, to 50 billion yen, on growing subprime losses. The bank had originally expected a profit of 72 billion yen. For the nine months to December, Shinsei's subprime-related losses totaled 22.8 billion yen, 15 percent more than the 19.8 billion yen it announced as of the end of September. That helped push down the bank's net profit in the nine months to December by 29 percent from a year earlier to 33.5 billion yen. Shinsei fared better in October-December. It posted a net profit of 10.4 billion yen, up a quarter from the same period a year earlier. Also reporting on Wednesday was Sumitomo Trust & Banking Co 8403.T, Japan's fifth-largest bank. For the third quarter the bank saw a 53 percent drop in net profit to 16.1 billion yen, according to figures calculated from its nine-month results. The bank also said its subprime-related losses would likely amount to 40 billion yen for the 12 months to March. Shares of Mizuho closed 1.6 percent lower at 495,000 yen in Tokyo, while Shinsei gained 2.2 percent to 475 yen. Sumitomo Trust lost 0.4 percent to 690 yen. Tokyo's index of bank shares .IBNKS.T fell 0.2 percent. ($1=106.92 Yen) (Additional reporting by  Edwina Gibbs  and Taro Fuse)
