 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) posted a stronger-than-expected 38 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by a jump in Asian margins in particular and strong global sales of its new CR-V crossover. 

 Honda, Japan's second-biggest automaker and the world's top motorcycle maker, raised its forecasts for the full year ending on March 31 by 5-8 percent, above consensus market forecasts. Analysts are upbeat on Honda's growth prospects as it adds production capacity around the world -- from the emerging regions of China and Brazil to the mature U.S. and Japanese markets -- backed by healthy demand for its fuel-efficient cars. Keeping up with demand has been one of Honda's main challenges due to its characteristic wariness over big capital outlays, but analysts said its recent expansion plans positioned it for a lift in 2008 and beyond. Honda has a goal of selling at least 4.5 million cars in 2010, versus 3.76 million last year. October-December net profit at Honda was 200 billion yen ($1.87 billion), comfortably beating an average estimate of 147.1 billion yen from five brokerages surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter operating profit, which excludes earnings made by its 50-50 Chinese joint ventures, grew 35 percent to 276.2 billion yen. Revenue rose 10 percent to 3.04 trillion yen. Asian margins were particularly strong, rising to 9.3 percent from 6.7 percent excluding Japan and its 50-50 Chinese joint ventures. For the full year ending on March 31, Honda raised its forecasts for a net profit to 690 billion yen from 640 billion yen, and it increased its operating profit forecast to 920 billion yen from 880 billion yen. The gains would be mainly on smaller-than-expected research and development spending and bigger cost cuts, the company said. Consensus forecasts from 18 brokerages were for a net profit of 649.5 billion yen and operating profit of 899.8 billion yen. The soft Japanese market remains a drag on most domestic automakers, but Honda has reversed a decline in non-mini vehicle sales with the success of the revamped Fit subcompact. The remodeled CR-V, one of Honda's core models, has been particularly well-received as American and European consumers increasingly shun traditional sport utility vehicles in favor of more fuel-efficient crossovers, which are built on car platforms. The model last year overtook Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) Explorer to become the best-selling SUV in the United States, with sales growing 29 percent. Honda expects its U.S. sales to rise 2.5 percent this year despite projections for a weaker overall market dampened by the subprime loan fallout. Honda is also leading the auto industry's efforts to clean exhaust emissions and improve mileage -- a crucial task that could continue giving it a competitive edge as the United States, Europe and Japan introduce tighter pollution and fuel economy standards over the next few years. Domestic rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) and Suzuki Motor Corp ( 7269.T ) are also expected to report higher third-quarter earnings over the next week. <ID:nT105816> Shares of Honda, the world's fourth-most valuable automaker behind Toyota, Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) and Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), fell 31 percent in the 12 months to Tuesday, broadly in line with Tokyo's transport sub-index .ITEQP.T, which fell 30 percent. Prior to the earnings announcement, the stock ended up 1.2 percent on Wednesday, against a 0.4 percent rise in the subindex. (Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
