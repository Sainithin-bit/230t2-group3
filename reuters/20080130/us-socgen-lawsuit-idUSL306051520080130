 PARIS  (Reuters) - An organization representing current and former employees of Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) said it had started legal action against the French bank over its handling of a rogue trader scandal. 

 The ASSACT SG organization said it had hired lawyer Johann Lissowski to represent it, citing the fact that SocGen staff had been financially impacted in the affair. It issued its statement late on Tuesday. On Jan 24, SocGen said it had uncovered massive unauthorized stock trading by one of its employees that led to 4.9 billion euros ($7.24 billion) of losses, in the world's biggest rogue trading scandal.
