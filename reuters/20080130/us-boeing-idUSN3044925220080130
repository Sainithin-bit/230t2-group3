 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Wednesday fourth-quarter profit rose a greater-than-expected 4 percent, helped by higher commercial plane deliveries, and said its delayed 787 Dreamliner was on track to meet its new schedule. 

 The Chicago-based company, whose new carbon-composite, widebody plane is running about nine months late, also raised its full-year earnings forecast, citing productivity gains, but left it short of Wall Street's average estimate. It cut its full-year revenue forecast to account for delays in its new 787 Dreamliner, which will not be delivered to the first airline until next January at the earliest. Boeing shares, which have fallen 25 percent since last July on concerns about the 787, rose 3.1 percent to $83.44 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing said it was on target to meet the new production schedule for the 787 set earlier this month, when it put back the first test flight and first delivery by three months, following a six-month delay announced last year. The company said it would provide a 787 delivery schedule and 2009 financial guidance three months from now. "(The) 787 is likely to continue to drive the stock, for better or for worse," said Bank of America's Robert Stallard, in a research note. "Investors will have to judge the merits of the revised delivery schedule in April before the stock is likely to have a chance of meaningful appreciation." The world's largest plane-maker by sales, which is also the Pentagon's No. 2 supplier, reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.03 billion, or $1.36 per share, compared with $989 million, or $1.29 per share, in the year-ago quarter. That beat Wall Street's average forecast of $1.32 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales were essentially flat at $17.5 billion as higher commercial plane sales were offset by lower revenue from its defense unit, due to fewer military plane deliveries and moving its government satellite launch business into a separate joint venture. It still beat analysts' average estimate of $17.2 billion. RAISES OUTLOOK Boeing, which outsold rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) last year in the commercial plane market, raised its 2008 profit forecast to a range of $5.70 to $5.85 per share, from its previous forecast of $5.55 to $5.75 per share, citing higher expected commercial plane deliveries and productivity gains. Wall Street is expecting $5.95 per share, on average. It cut its full-year revenue forecast by $500 million, to a range of $67 billion to $68 billion, due to first deliveries of the 787 being pushed into 2009. Work on the 787 is sticking to its new schedule, Boeing said. Production of the hot-selling, fuel-efficient plane has been hobbled by unfinished work from its network of global suppliers and a shortage of key parts. The first plane is now set to be delivered early next year, rather than the original target of May this year. Despite early production problems, Boeing's 787 is the company's most successful launch. The aircraft, which promises to cut airlines' fuel bills and give passengers a smoother ride, has racked up more than 800 firm orders since launch in 2004. Boeing said on Wednesday it "continues to address challenges associated with assembly of the first (787) airplanes" but expects the first test flight around the end of June and the first delivery in early 2009. RECORD ORDERS LAST YEAR The U.S. plane maker booked an industry-record 1,413 net plane orders in 2007, beating Airbus' 1,341. That made for the industry's most successful year on record, with more than 2,750 orders between them, driven by a sustained resurgence in travel that has fueled demand for jets, particularly in the Middle East and Asia. Boeing's commercial airplanes unit posted a 17 percent increase on fourth-quarter revenue to $8.9 billion, driven by a 9 percent increase in airplane deliveries and higher services revenue. Boeing delivered 112 commercial planes in the fourth quarter, up from 103 in the same quarter last year. For all of 2007, it delivered 441 planes, compared with 453 for Airbus. Wall Street analysts pay special attention to plane deliveries as that is when the companies get the bulk of their payments for planes. Boeing said it is now expecting to deliver between 475 to 480 planes this year, down from its previous estimate of 480 to 490, due to the delay on the 787 program. The company's Integrated Defense Systems unit, which is the No. 2 U.S. defense contractor behind Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ), posted a 14 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue to $8.4 billion, because of lower military plane deliveries and the shifting of some government satellite launch revenue into a joint venture with Lockheed Martin.
