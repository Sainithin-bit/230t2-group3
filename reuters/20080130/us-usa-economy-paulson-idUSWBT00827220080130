 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A steep slump in U.S. homebuilding that slowed growth at the end of 2007 will help wring out excesses and the Bush administration is not trying to ward it off, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Wednesday. 

 "After years of unsustainable home price appreciation, this is a necessary correction," Paulson said in prepared remarks for delivery to a real estate roundtable. He said the housing downturn's impact was evident in the sharp deceleration in national economic growth to a 0.6 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, which the Commerce Department reported earlier on Wednesday. Nonetheless, Paulson said he was confident the economy will keep growing "although not as rapidly as we have seen in recent years," rather than stall into recession.
