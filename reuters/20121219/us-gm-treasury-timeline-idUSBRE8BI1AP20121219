 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Wednesday it will sell 200 million shares in General Motors Co ( GM.N ) and divest the rest of its holdings over the next 12 to 15 months, ending public ownership of the company rescued by taxpayers in 2009. 
 GM's $50 billion bailout comprised of nearly $7 billion in direct loans and $43 billion in bailout cash and bankruptcy aid. The following is a timeline of events: January 2009: GM receives first of four government funding installments - a $13.4 billion injection authorized by then-President George W. Bush under the emergency Troubled Asset Relief Program. April 2009: GM gets $2 billion from President Barack Obama. May 2009: GM receives further $4 billion under a third TARP installment. June 2009: GM receives $30.1 billion from TARP under its bankruptcy arrangement. April 2010: GM uses some of the bailout money that it did not need to repay $6.7 billion in outstanding loans. November 2010: GM returns to public equity markets with a massive initial public offering. Treasury sells $13 billion of GM stock, leaving it with about 500 million shares. December 2010: GM repurchases Treasury's $2.1 billion in preferred stock, leaving Treasury with only common stock. December 2012: Treasury announces its planned exit from GM, selling 200 million shares to the company at $27.50 per share, for about $5.5 billion, and undertaking to sell the remaining 300 million shares over the next 12-15 months, starting January.
