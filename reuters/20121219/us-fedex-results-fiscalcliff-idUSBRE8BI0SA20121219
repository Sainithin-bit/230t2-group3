 (Reuters) - FedEx Corp's ( FDX.N ) fiscal 2013 profit forecast presumes that the White House and lawmakers in Washington reach a deal to avoid the year-end "fiscal cliff" of higher taxes and sharp cuts to government spending. 
 "Our outlook ... assumes that the U.S. does not go off the fiscal cliff and into a recession," said Alan Graf, chief financial officer of the No. 2 U.S. package-delivery company. (Reporting By  Scott Malone ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
