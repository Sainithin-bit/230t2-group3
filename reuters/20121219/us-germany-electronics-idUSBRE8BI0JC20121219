 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's electronics industry expects production to rise 1.5 percent in 2013 after shrinking 2 percent this year amid the euro zone crisis. 
 Trade group ZVEI said on Wednesday the return to growth depended largely on politicians getting a grip on the euro zone debt crisis and Germany pushing through its planned shift to a greener energy mix. Sales have fallen to 175 billion euros ($231 billion) this year on weak domestic sales, while exports rose 2 percent thanks to demand from eastern Europe, the United States and Asia, ZVEI said. The electronics industry is Germany's second-largest employer after engineering with more than 848,000 workers. Its members mainly comprise mid-sized companies and top names such as chipmaker Infineon ( IFXGn.DE ) and engineering group Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ). (Reporting by  Maria Sheahan ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
