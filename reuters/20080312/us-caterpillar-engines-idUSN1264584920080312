 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - The top executive of Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), the world's largest maker of earth-moving equipment, said the company still hasn't decided what to do with its on-highway diesel engine unit, which faces challenges because of changes sweeping the truck-making business. 

 "We're still considering many alternatives," Chief Executive and Chairman Jim Owens said on Tuesday in an interview on the sidelines of a big construction equipment industry conference. "I think it's important, personally, that we find a way to successfully play in the on-highway truck industry." For years, Caterpillar and other independent suppliers have sold their diesel engines to the companies, such as Navistar International NAVZ.PK and Paccar Inc ( PCAR.O ), that make the big and medium-sized trucks that haul a good chunk of the freight on the continent's highways. But the U.S. truck-making industry is rapidly changing as manufacturers move more and more engine-making in-house. That's thrown a big question mark over Caterpillar's diesel engine business and raised speculation the Peoria, Illinois-based company, best known for its earth-moving equipment, might exit the business altogether. "We have an engine, we sell to all the OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and we have contracts that go out to 2010," Owens said. "But beyond that we have to develop new product technology for the on-highway truck market and we have to decide how we're going to market with that product." He said the company had a strategic choice to make: "We could exit. We could partner. We could acquire." Owens said no matter what choice the company made, Caterpillar would be able to meet its longstanding earnings-per-share target of $8 to $10 for 2010 -- and its new goal, announced Tuesday, of about $60 billion in revenue for 2010, up from a previous forecast of "$50 billion plus." "Regardless of which way we go, it has almost no impact on our earnings per share between here and 2010," he said. (Reporting by  James B. Kelleher ; editing by Louise Heavens)
