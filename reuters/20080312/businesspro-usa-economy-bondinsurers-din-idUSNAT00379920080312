 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Some local governments might find 
they do not need insurance for their municipal bonds as bond 
insurers emerge from their current crisis, New York's insurance 
industry regulator said on Wednesday. 

  "Time and the market will determine the need for municipal 
bond insurance," Eric Dinallo said in the text of prepared 
testimony to a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on the 
shaken municipal bond insurance sector.  "Some governments have stated recently that they believe 
they no longer need bond insurance... That may mean that the 
demand for bond insurance shrinks," according to the prepared 
testimony obtained by Reuters.  Dinallo said that his steps to stabilize the bond insurance 
industry should buy time for stability in other sectors of the 
market.  (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by Theodore
