 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, which offers 
adjustable-rate mortgages that let borrowers decide how much to 
pay each month, believes the U.S. housing downturn is far from 
over, Chief Risk Officer Don Truslow said. 

  "It feels like we have a ways to go," Truslow said on a 
Deutsche Bank Securities Inc conference call. Referring to the 
nine innings of a baseball game, Truslow said he was "unsure" 
whether the downturn was in the third, fourth or fifth inning, 
but "we haven't reached the seventh-inning stretch."  Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia, the 
fourth-largest U.S. bank, on February 28 said it expected 
first-half loan losses to exceed 0.75 percent of loans on an 
annualized basis in 2008, higher than it had forecast two weeks 
earlier.  Chief Executive Ken Thompson also admitted in a letter to 
shareholders to "poor" timing in his $24.2 billion purchase in 
October 2006 of Golden West Financial Corp, a California 
mortgage lender. Thompson nevertheless affirmed his opinion of 
the quality of Golden West's franchise and staff.  (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E.
