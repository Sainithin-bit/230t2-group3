 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - World number two truck maker Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) said late on Tuesday it had agreed with the United Auto Workers union on a wage deal for employees at its New River Valley plant in Virginia. 

 The tentative three-year agreement covered about 2,600 employees at the plant, who have been on strike since early February, halting nearly all production at the factory which normally turns out around 100 Volvo and Mack trucks per day. Volvo's North American trucks unit said in a statement that further details of the agreement were being withheld "pending ratification by the local union organization". A Volvo spokesman said the strike was expected to be called off once the agreement was ratified. (Reporting by Stockholm Newsroom; Editing by Rory Channing)
