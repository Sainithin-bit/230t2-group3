 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) expects operating profit to rise again this year and next as lucrative business travelers keep flying despite stuttering financial markets and as fuel prices hover at record levels. 

 "The perspectives for the aviation industry are full of promise," Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber told a news conference on Wednesday. "In spite of the current uncertainty in the financial markets, the economic conditions remain good for Lufthansa. There have been no ground-breaking changes in terms of the fundamental conditions or the need for mobility." Shares in Lufthansa gained 3.6 percent to 15.56 euros by 1230 GMT, giving it a market value of around 6.9 billion euros ($10.60 billion) and outperforming a 1 percent gain for the German blue-chip DAX index  .GDAXI . Lufthansa sees growth at its main passenger airline of around 6 percent on intercontinental flights and 4 percent on European services in the years ahead, with increased focus on fast-growing markets such as China, India and Russia. High-margin business travelers now account for more than half of sales on intercontinental flights. Cheuvreux analysts wrote: "Passenger growth remains strong...we see no sign of operational weakness, and Lufthansa's market value is still below the book value of its fleet." Mayrhuber's optimism for 2008 contrasted with a warning issued last Thursday by rival British Airways BAY.L, with its greater dependence on routes to and from North America, that airlines were entering a downward cycle due to global economic weakness, though smaller German rival Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ) said on Wednesday it had "cause for optimism". Lufthansa said a condition for raising the operating result in 2008 from the record 1.38 billion euros -- a 63 percent rise -- achieved last year was continuing to compensate for high fuel prices. Crude oil has reached almost $110 a barrel. Fuel costs rose 15 percent to 3.86 billion euros last year, though the weak dollar brought these costs down by 7.3 percent and hedging saved 109 million euros, Lufthansa said. This year the bill was expected to soar to 4.9 billion euros. Lufthansa had hedged 83 percent of its fuel needs for this year, with significant cost benefits over $75 a barrel. The airline was 27 percent hedged for 2009. "GOOD START" Lufthansa also imposes surcharges on customers to offset the cost of fuel and has said these will rise to 17 euros each way on European and domestic routes. It charges 77 euros each way on long-haul flights. Lufthansa finance chief Stephan Gemkow told a news conference that the airline had not been shaken by financial turbulence in the United States. "Significant repercussions of the U.S. financial crisis are not yet apparent in our advance bookings," he said. "Quite the contrary, we got off to a really good start in 2008." Lufthansa reported last month that 2007 revenue rose 13 percent to 22.42 billion euros. Net profit more than doubled to 1.66 billion euros. "The results clearly prove that things are not as bad as the overall pessimistic view of the airline sector would indicate," the Cheuvreux analysts added. British Airways said on Thursday that revenue was expected to rise by 4-4.5 percent in the year to March 2009, but that its operating margin would fall. Air Berlin's 2007 earnings before interest and tax plunged by two-thirds to 21.5 million euros and its shares dived nearly 11 percent to an all-time low. "Although the preliminary results for 2007 do not meet our expectations, we have cause for optimism for 2008," CEO Joachim Hunold said in a statement. "We are also pleased with the current bookings situation." (Editing by  Louise Ireland )
