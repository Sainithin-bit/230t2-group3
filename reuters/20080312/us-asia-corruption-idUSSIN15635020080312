 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Corruption may erode the economic competitiveness of China, India and Vietnam by wiping away the countries' low-cost advantage, said a report on Wednesday. 

 The annual report by Hong Kong-based Political and Economic Risk Consultancy (PERC) surveyed the views of 1,400 expatriates who were asked to grade corruption in Asia and the extent it would affect a country's business environment. Philippines, Thailand, Indonesia and China were graded the most corrupt while Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan were viewed as the least corrupt countries in Asia. PERC said that the cost of maintaining standards and the high levels of corruption are eroding the low-cost advantages of the fast growing economies of India, China and Vietnam. "Corruption is yet another cost," said PERC in the report. "If governments do not reduce it as an issue, the competitiveness of their environments...will be eroded that much faster." Out of a scale of 10, with zero being the least corrupt and 10 being the most corrupt, the Philippines rated 9.0, China was 7.98, Vietnam got 7.75 and India was 7.25. Singapore was rated 1.13 in the survey, done between January and February this year. The "most serious" corruption problem in China did not involve foreign investors but state-owned companies and those with access to state assets, PERC said. "One estimate -- put as 'conservative' -- is that 10 percent of land revenues, investment and government spending are 'stolen or misappropriated'," the report said. For Vietnam, the main problem facing investors was not under-the-table bribes but rather "legislative gaps" that exposed investors to punishments for activities that would be commonplace in the international arena. In India, corruption and bureaucracy are difficult to tell apart, the report said, adding that the "biggest problem" of corruption happens at the local government level. However, the rapid economic growth of some Asian economies have trumped many firm's concerns over corruption. "Most companies cannot just walk away from a very lucrative business environment because they might have to deal with local corruption," the report said. For Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan, the report credited tough government action and private sector vigilance for perceived success in fighting corruption. "People had to be taught to stand up for their own rights and understand that they were not helpless victims in a flawed but unchangeable system," the report said of Hong Kong's success.
