 PARIS  (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy believes continued vigilance is needed on financial markets, even though they have held up well so far, the spokesman for the centre-right government said on Wednesday. 

 Speaking after a cabinet meeting chaired by Sarkozy, government spokesman Laurent Wauquiez also said the European Central Bank's monetary policy should find the right balance between controlling inflation and helping growth. "It's a coin with two sides. One side is controlling inflation and the other is not handicapping growth and job creation. All that is therefore a question of balance," Wauquiez said.
