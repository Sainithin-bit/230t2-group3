 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) Chief Executive Jim Mulva said on Wednesday the company would consider an acquisition or investment of up to $3 billion to move further into the ethanol business. 

 Mulva, speaking at the company's annual meeting with analysts in New York, said any acquisition or investment would likely focus on non-corn-based ethanol. He said any larger acquisitions were highly unlikely. The company also said it expects proceeds of $3.8 billion to $4 billion from its asset sales program in 2008.
