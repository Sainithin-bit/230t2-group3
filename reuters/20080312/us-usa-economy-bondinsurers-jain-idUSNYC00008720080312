 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Troubles at Jefferson County, Ala. and Vallejo, Calif. could be the "tip of the iceberg," as economic woes raise the risk of insuring municipal bonds, a Berkshire Hathaway official said on Wednesday. 

 Moreover, if the rating agencies level the playing field in terms of how they rate municipal versus corporate obligations, "there will be little need for a financial guaranty insurance marketplace as we know it," Ajit Jain, head of Berkshire's ( BRKa.N ) new bond insurance unit, said in prepared testimony to a U.S. House of Representatives hearing on the muni bond insurance sector. "I remain very concerned about the long-term viability of this business in general and for us in particular," said Jain, whose company just started insuring municipal bonds in January as other bond insurers faltered. "With insured muni bonds selling at higher yields than corresponding uninsured bonds, buyers have every right to question the value of the bond insurers' promise to pay," Jain said in testimony obtained by Reuters. Berkshire got into the business because it was asked by New York insurance regulators, Jain said. He added that it also entered the business because the subprime crisis and resulting financial losses had raised awareness of risk and meant insurers could charge more for their product.
