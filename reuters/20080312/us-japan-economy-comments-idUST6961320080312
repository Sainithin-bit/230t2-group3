 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's upper house of parliament voted down the government's nominee for the next Bank of Japan chief, Toshiro Muto, on Wednesday, adding to uncertainty over who will succeed current governor Toshihiko Fukui when he retires in a week. 

 The vote was expected after executives of the main opposition Democratic Party had said on Tuesday they would veto the nomination of Muto, currently a deputy BOJ governor. Following are recent comments by Japanese policymakers on the selection of the next governor: FUKUSHIRO NUKAGA, FINANCE MINISTER, March 12, speaking to reporters after the upper house vote: "It is desirable for the new governor and deputies to be decided by March 19 (when Fukui retires) given that economic and financial conditions in Japan and overseas are extremely unstable." "The government will make the utmost efforts to win understanding (from parliament) while consulting with the ruling bloc ... We have put forward the best trio for the job." "I will watch the lower house voting and see how the ruling bloc will discuss the issue with the opposition." Asked about the possibility of seeking other candidates: "We're not thinking about it." NOBUTAKA MACHIMURA, CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY, March 12, in a news conference: Referring to the opposition's rejection of Muto: "We cannot understand their decision." Asked whether the government has any plans to change its nominees for BOJ leadership positions: "We are not at a stage where we could tell you something of that sort." YUKIO HATOYAMA, DEMOCRATIC PARTY SECRETARY-GENERAL, March 11, told reporters: Explaining why his party rejected the government nominee: "It cannot ensure the BOJ's independence." "We are not opposing Muto just because he is a career finance ministry official, although he is dubbed 'Mr Finance Ministry'." Asked about impact of a possible vacuum in the BOJ leadership on financial markets: "We've consulted with a lot of people and our conclusion was that, globally, it would not affect markets." PRIME MINISTER YASUO FUKUDA, March 11, told reporters: "I'm puzzled as to what to do as I don't know the reason why the Democrats opposed him (Muto)." "It is an outrageous talk that he is rejected just because he used to work at the Ministry of Finance. He has been working as deputy BOJ governor for five years and has done well." "Experts and the business community have approved our nominees, so I really don't know why they opposed them." TAKEO NISHIOKA, FROM DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND HEAD OF UPPER HOUSE STEERING COMMITTEE, March 11, told reporters: "If the government proposes a candidate again, I hope to make arrangements so that the upper house can swiftly carry on with necessary procedures." Asked what the upper house will do if the government proposes Muto again: "That point hasn't been discussed yet at the executive meeting of the steering committee. But I think it is impossible for such a thing to happen." MACHIMURA, CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY, March 11, in a news conference: On the possibility of renominating Muto after he is rejected by parliament: "That would be an option ... We'll give it some thought while watching moves in parliament." PRIME MINISTER YASUO FUKUDA, March 10, speaking to reporters: On the possibility of him meeting Democratic Party leader Ichiro Ozawa over the issue: "It all depends on the situation." THOMAS SCHIEFFER, U.S. AMBASSADOR TO JAPAN, March 10, speaking to reporters: "These are pretty turbulent times in the financial markets and it is important for Japan to have a steady voice that people can rely on to understand what their particular reactions might be to a monetary crisis. "So it is important for the world economic community to know whose hand is on the tiller of the Japanese central bank." FUJIO MITARAI, HEAD OF JAPAN'S BIGGEST BUSINESS LOBBY, THE JAPAN BUSINESS FEDERATION, March 10, in a news conference: "The government has picked the best candidates. "At a time when global financial markets are unstable, we cannot have the BOJ governor position vacant from the viewpoint of Japan's credibility in the international field." PRIME MINISTER FUKUDA, March 6, speaking to reporters: "We cannot allow any policy vacuum, even a day." He said a person with suitable experience, financial expertise and an ability to work on the international stage should head the central bank, regardless of where the person previously worked. MACHIMURA, CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY, March 6, in a news conference: "The central bank's independence is important, so it is important that a person with awareness of this is selected." OZAWA, DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADER, March 1, in news conference, quoted by Kyodo news agency: After the ruling coalition forced budget and tax bills through the lower house on February 29: "Relations of trust with the government and the ruling bloc have been completely lost." "We can no longer talk calmly with them on the BOJ governor or any other matters." (Reporting by Tokyo Policy Desk)
