 MAEBASHI, Japan  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan board member Tadao Noda said on Wednesday it would be appropriate for the central bank to stick to a stance of raising interest rates gradually if the nation's economy stays on a sustained growth path. 

 "There is no clear evidence suggesting that (the positive economic cycle) will fall apart completely," Noda said in a speech to business leaders in Maebashi, north of Tokyo. Noda, a banking industry veteran, is regarded by markets as somewhat hawkish on monetary policy. Following are some of Noda's comments in his speech and at a news conference that followed: MONETARY POLICY (From speech) "The BOJ has conducted monetary policy under the following way of thinking. First, because monetary conditions remain very accommodative, the central bank will raise rates if the economy stays on a sustained growth path. "The second point is that the bank has no preset idea on the pace of rate hike, which would depend on the degree of improvement in the economy and prices. "Some yellow lights are flashing for Japan's positive cycle of output, incomes and expenditures, which is driven by exports. But there is no clear evidence suggesting that (the positive economic cycle) will fall apart completely. "As such, it would be appropriate to maintain the BOJ's main scenario that the economy will likely continue expanding gradually. If so, it would also be appropriate to stick to the bank's basic monetary policy stance up until now." (From news conference) Asked if the "yellow lights" flashing for Japan's positive cycle could turn red, meaning if there is a chance for the cycle to collapse: "Growth in corporate earnings is slowing, so compared with the time when the light was blue, we need to be a bit more careful. But the level of corporate revenues is expected to remain high. As such, I can say for sure that the positive economic cycle is not at the brink of collapsing. "I can't completely rule out the possibility of the light turning red (from yellow). But that is still only a risk so it would be inappropriate for me to comment on what policy steps should be taken once this risk materializes." BOJ GOVERNOR NOMINATION (From news conference) "I believe someone who can earn the world's high expectations should be chosen, since this person will be representing Japan's central bank and in the important position of being in charge of managing the bank." JAPAN ECONOMY "Japan's economic growth is slowing due to a decline in housing investment and rising energy and raw material prices. As for the outlook, the economy is expected to continue expanding gradually, albeit at a slower pace in the near term. "We need to be careful of risk factors to our economic view. A particularly important risk is the course of exports, as well as global market and economic conditions, because exports have been a driver of production, which forms the base of Japan's positive economic cycle of output, income and expenditures." GLOBAL MARKETS (From speech) "Global stock and foreign exchange markets have seen big swings and investors continue to take a risk-averse stance. "Such market movements show that an unwinding of positions is taking place after market participants became too complacent towards risk amid a prolonged period of sound global economic and financial conditions. As such, market adjustments will take significant time, and in the process losses (by banks and investors) will be unavoidable." (From news conference) "Japan's money market remains relatively stable compared with European and U.S. markets, so I don't think there is a need for the BOJ to make changes in its money market operations for now. "But world central banks need to be mindful more than ever before of global market developments. There is a shared view within the BOJ over the importance of conducting money market operations flexibly in reaction to changes (in the market environment) toward the fiscal year-end." YEN RISE (From news conference) "When we think about the short-term economic impact of the yen's rise, the biggest problem undoubtedly would be its effect on Japan's export industry and export firms. "But when we take a slightly longer-term perspective, a high yen helps improve Japan's trade conditions. In that sense, (a high yen) is positive (for the economy) as it helps the nation increase its overall income. "The short-term impact (of a high yen) is important, but we must not underestimate its medium- and long-term impact on the economy." OVERSEAS ECONOMIES "Our basic view is that the global economy will continue expanding, but at a slower pace. Downside risks are rising as adjustments in the U.S. economy and global financial markets deepen. "If the U.S. economy slows further and investors' risk appetite declines sharply, that could slow fund flows to emerging nations and hurt their overall growth. Such a risk needs to be kept in mind."
