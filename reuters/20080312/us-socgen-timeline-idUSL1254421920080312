 (Reuters) - Police arrested another employee of Societe Generale on Wednesday as part of its inquiry into an alleged rogue trading scandal at France's second-biggest listed bank, the Paris prosecutor's office said. 

 Following is a timeline of events in the scandal that caused $7.5 billion of losses at the French bank: 2007 - SocGen junior trader Jerome Kerviel starts building up large positions. As his losses mount he tries to cover up his positions by misappropriating the bank's computer systems. November 2007 - The Eurex derivatives exchange questions SocGen about Kerviel's trading positions. This is revealed by a Paris prosecutor on Jan 28, 2008. January 19/20, 2008 - SocGen senior executives begin investigation and top management question the trader. January 21 - Management decides to liquidate Kerviel's positions. Equity markets plunge that day, with many stock indexes suffering their worst one-day close since 9/11. January 24 - SocGen issues a statement saying it has uncovered a fraud resulting in losses of 4.9 billion euros. January 25 - French police carry out searches of the home of Kerviel and of the headquarters of SocGen. He is taken into police custody the next day. January 27 - SocGen says the trader ended up with a position of 50 billion euros which SocGen decided to unwind from Jan 21-23. January 28 - Paris prosecutor says Kerviel admitted hiding his activities from superiors but added that Kerviel said other traders played fast and loose with bank rules. -- Paris prosecutor reveals that in November 2007, the Eurex exchange had alerted SocGen to suspicions it had concerning Kerviel. --- Kerviel is released under judicial supervision. January 30 - A SocGen board meeting decides that bank chief Daniel Bouton and his deputy Philippe Citerne should stay on. -- Bouton appears on France 2 evening news saying the bank has enough capital to stay independent. February 4 - Lagarde says that France favors a friendly approach if a merger were needed for the bank. February 5 - Kerviel says he will not be "turned into a scapegoat of Societe Generale." February 8 - Kerviel is jailed. February 20 - An internal investigation into the massive trading loss finds controls at the bank lacked depth. February 21 - SocGen confirms a record fourth-quarter loss of 3.35 billion euros ($4.93 billion). February 25 - Bouton says he will continue to lead the bank despite having offered his resignation twice. March 12 - Police arrest an employee from a SocGen trading room as part of their investigation.  Sources: Reuters; SocGen, French police, Paris prosecutor, statements.
