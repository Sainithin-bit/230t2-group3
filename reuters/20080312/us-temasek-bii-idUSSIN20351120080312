 KUALA LUMPUR  (Reuters) - HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, Bank of China and Malaysia's Malayan Banking Bhd have emerged as the final bidders for Singapore state investor Temasek's stake in Bank Internasional Indonesia (BII), valued at more than $800 million, sources told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 Temasek TEM.UL, which has stakes in two Indonesian banks, is trying to sell its 42 percent stake in BII ( BNII.JK ), the country's sixth-biggest lender, to comply with a new central bank rule that bars foreign investors from owning more than one bank in Southeast Asia's biggest economy. It also owns a controlling stake in Bank Danamon ( BDMN.JK ). Temasek has until the end of 2010 to comply with Indonesia's new policy on bank ownership, but banking sources said the deal could happen much earlier. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) are advising Temasek on the deal. But BII's valuation is rich -- it is trading at 3.3 times its book, higher than Maybank ( MBBM.KL ) at 2.24 times and HSBC ( HSBA.L ) at 1.4, although below that of Bank of China ( 3988.HK ) at 3.6 times, Reuters Data shows. Due diligence was expected to take place for the remainder of March, with a deal possible in mid-April, said one source familiar with the process who declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter. Strong economic growth, bolstered by the global commodities boom, has boosted demand for loans and earnings at Indonesian banks. Many lenders predict loan growth of 20 percent or more this year. "Our bullish stance on Indonesian banks is largely premised on the sector's strong growth and high profitability prospects. Inflation concerns have not derailed our confidence," said Ismael Pili, a banking analyst at Macquarie Securities in Singapore. The loan-to-GDP ratio in Indonesia is 21 percent, against South Korea's 79 percent and Thailand's 76 percent, he noted. BII shares have rallied on speculation about the stake sale. Its shares are up 35 percent so far this year, beating the benchmark Jakarta index  .JKSE  which is down 6.3 percent. Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's biggest lender, is down 9.3 percent BII shares gained 4 percent on Wednesday, triple that of the broader market. BATTLE Felix Kesuma, a banking analyst at Indonesian brokerage firm Ciptadana Securities, said the battle could be between Bank of China and HSBC. "HSBC is strong in trade financing and fee-based income. So I think they could use BII's network to boost their existing business here and increase their fee-based income," he said. "The strength of Bank of China is the market access to China, so Maybank is likely to be the weakest among the three. I think it would be either HSBC or Bank of China." Maybank, which has faced investor criticism for moving too slowly to expand outside its home market, declined to comment on the shortlist. But Malaysia's top bank said last week it was interested in buying Temasek's stake in BII, but would only make an announcement at an appropriate time. Sandy Flockhart, Asia chief executive for HSBC ( 0005.HK ), Europe's biggest bank, told Reuters earlier this month that the bank was stepping up its presence in Indonesia and other developing Asian economies. HSBC now has more than 80 branches in Indonesia and is the second biggest foreign bank there, in terms of assets, after Citigroup ( C.N ). HSBC has declined to comment on BII. Temasek holds the indirect stake in BII through its 75 percent holding in BII's controlling shareholder, Sorak Financial, which owns 55.78 percent of the Indonesian lender. Temasek has said it has received several indications of interest from various parties for its stake in BII. Lehman Brothers LEH.N is advising Bank of China, a source familiar with the matter said. Lehman declined to comment. Bank of China of spokesman Wang Zhoawen said: "The bank is considering many M&A opportunities in order to establish a diversified financial platform," but said there was no transaction that required disclosure at the moment. A spokesman for South Korea's Kookmin Bank 06000.KS, which also has a small stake in BII and had expressed its interest in raising its stake, said there was no change in its stance.
