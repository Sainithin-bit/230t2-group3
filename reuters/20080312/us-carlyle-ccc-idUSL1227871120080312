 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S.-based buyout company the Carlyle Group CYL.UL said on Wednesday the challenges facing a Dutch-based affiliate will have no "measurable impact" on any other Carlyle-backed funds or businesses. 

 The Washington, D.C.-based private equity firm which has advanced a $150 million credit line to troubled Carlyle Capital Corporation (CCC) CARC.AS, added that none of its other investment funds or portfolio companies have investments in CCC. Carlyle Capital, which trades residential mortgage-backed securities, said last week it may run out of cash as lenders asked it for margin calls amid the credit crunch. Its shares tumbled after resuming trading on Tuesday. "We believe that the challenges facing CCC will have no measurable impact on any other fund sponsored by The Carlyle Group or any of our portfolio companies," Carlyle Group said in a statement. The buyout firm added that it has no shares in CCC, although individuals at Carlyle Group own about 15 percent of CCC securities. It also stated that the two groups are separate legal entities, although Carlyle Group serves as the investment advisor to CCC. "The Carlyle Group is working tirelessly with CCC to assist it in its efforts to maximize value for all interested parties. CCC will continue to provide updates on its progress as the situation develops," said Carlyle. (Reporting by Mathieu Robbins; Editing by Mike Elliott)
