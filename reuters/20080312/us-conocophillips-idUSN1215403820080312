 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) said on Wednesday it was lowering its long-term production growth target to 2 percent from 3 percent. 

 "We have a great resource base. If we wanted to throw capital at it, we definitely could increase production more than this 2 percent," said Executive Vice President John Lowe, speaking at the company's annual meeting with analysts in New York. "We're not going to chase volumes to the detriment of value," he said, noting that the company needs to balance capital spending with shareholder distributions. The company owns 20 percent of Russian oil company Lukoil ( LKOH.MM ). Lowe said Conoco's long-term production growth target includes modestly more than 2 percent growth from Lukoil. Chief Executive Jim Mulva said ConocoPhillips expects its reserve replacement rate to exceed 100 percent over the next five years. The rate measures whether a company has found more oil and natural gas through exploration and acquisitions than it has produced. The company also said it is engaged with foreign partners in looking at opportunities to expand its global refining portfolio. Spokeswoman Kristi DesJarlais said these opportunities were primarily with Lukoil. Shares of ConocoPhillips were down 69 cents to $78.81 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
