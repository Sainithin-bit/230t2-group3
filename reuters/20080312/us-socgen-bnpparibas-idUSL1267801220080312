 PARIS  (Reuters) - BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) could set out terms for any offer for embattled rival Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) in May, La Tribune newspaper reported on Wednesday without saying where it got the information. 

 A BNP Paribas spokesman declined to comment on the report, saying the bank did not comment on rumors. La Tribune newspaper said BNP "could advance its terms" for a bid a few days before SocGen's annual meeting on May 27. BNP holds its annual meeting on May 21.
