 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Kohl's Corp said on Wednesday that it expects increased online sales this year but added it was still behind major rivals in the volume of business it generates on the Internet. 

 "Our Internet business is going to grow hugely this year, particularly in the second half," Kohl's Chief Executive Larry Montgomery said at a Bank of America conference that was broadcast over the Internet. Montgomery said the mid-priced retailer had designed a new Web site and would offer 100 percent of its assortment online for the first time. "We have a long way to go as we're not doing as much business on the Internet and we're behind our competition," Montgomery added. The Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, retailer has reported drops in sales at stores open at least a year for the past three months as consumers grappled with rising gasoline and food prices and falling home values. Montgomery said lower-end goods were showing the most weakness, a sentiment that has been echoed by other department stores such as upscale Saks Inc. "The business in better and best has been better than the opening-price business," he said. He said private and exclusive brands such as Simply Vera clothing and accessories by designer Vera Wang and Jumping Beans children's wear accounted for about 39 percent of Kohl's sales, and that percentage would grow as the retailer extends its unique brands into new lines of business. Kohl's said it would sell Liz Claiborne Inc's Dana Buchman line of clothing and accessories exclusively beginning in spring 2009 under a licensing agreement. Montgomery said he expected that brand to improve sales of women's traditional classic sportswear, a category that has been soft. Kohl's shares were up 48 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $43.92 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares have risen 16 percent from a year low of $37.89 in January but are down 45 percent from a high of $79.55 reached in April 2007. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
