 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Law firm Milberg Weiss, set to go on trial later this year on charges of paying illegal kickbacks to clients, was the top-ranked U.S. class-action firm last year with $3.8 billion in settlement winnings for plaintiffs, according to a new report. 

 The firm, a specialist in bringing securities fraud lawsuits against large corporations, had a good year in terms of settlements despite legal travails of its own that have hurt its ability to bring in new business. Both the firm and co-founder Melvyn Weiss have pleaded not guilty to criminal charges stemming from allegations they secretly paid clients illegal kickbacks to plaintiffs in securities fraud lawsuits. A trial in the case is set for August in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. In the rankings published Tuesday by shareholder advisory firm RiskMetrics Group RMG.N, Milberg Weiss was first in terms of total dollars won on behalf of investors based on class-action securities settlements finalized in 2007. Of the $3.8 billion in pacts the firm negotiated, about $3.2 billion was from settlements for investors who sued Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) following an accounting scandal several years ago that led to the imprisonment of ex-chief Dennis Kozlowski. Milberg Weiss, along with law firms Grant & Eisenhofer and Schiffrin Barroway Topaz & Kessler, all represented plaintiffs in the Tyco case. Grant & Eisenhofer ranked No. 2 in the RiskMetrics study, with $3.45 billion in settlements. Schiffrin Barroway was third with $3.33 billion. The rankings are based on the firms with the largest total dollar amount of settlements in which they served as lead or co-lead counsel. Milberg, Grant & Eisenhofer and Schiffrin Barroway were all credited with the $3.2 billion settlement, under the rankings, because they were all lead lawyers in the Tyco case. In fourth place was Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins with $1.85 billion. One of Coughlin Stoia's founders, William Lerach, was sentenced to two years in prison in February after pleading guilty to a conspiracy charge related to paying kickbacks at Milberg, his former firm. Lerach retired from Coughlin Stoia last year and the firm no longer bears his name. Coughlin Stoia was at the top of the RiskMetrics rankings for the 2006 year, when it collected more than $7.3 billion for investors. About $6.6 billion of that was tied to Enron-related settlements with several corporate defendants. For 2007, Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, with $1.34 billion in total settlements, came in fifth place. Grant & Eisenhofer had the highest average settlement amount among plaintiffs' firms in 2007, averaging $690.3 million in its five settlements finalized during the year, RiskMetrics said.
