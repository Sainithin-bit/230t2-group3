 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The union representing mechanics at US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) on Wednesday said it has reached a tentative agreement with the airline on a contract that would cover the former US Airways and America West workers and extend through 2011. 

 US Airways, formed in 2005 from a merger of those two airlines, has 3,300 mechanics and related workers. The International Association of Machinists did not immediately disclose details of the agreement, which requires approval by union members. But US Airways said the contract, if ratified, "would move pre-merger America West maintenance-and-related employees to the higher pay scales of the pre-merger US Airways labor contract" and modify the existing US Airways labor agreement in ways "mutually beneficial" to the company and the union workers.
