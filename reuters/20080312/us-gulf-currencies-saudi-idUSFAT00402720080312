 MAINZ, Germany  (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar is a "good buy", and excessive dollar volatility is undesirable, Saudi Arabia's central bank governor said on Wednesday. 

 Asked after a meeting with European Central Bank officials about market talk the Saudi central bank had been in the market buying dollars, Hamad al-Sayyari said rumors should not be listened to but added: "I said it is undervalued, but the market determines the value of the U.S. dollar."
