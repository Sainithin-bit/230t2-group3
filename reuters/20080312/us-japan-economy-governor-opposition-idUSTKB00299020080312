 TOKYO  (Reuters) - A senior lawmaker from Japan's main opposition Democratic Party said on Wednesday he was not completely against the idea of holding talks between his party leader, Ichiro Ozawa, and Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda if the government nominates a new candidate to head the Bank of Japan. 

 "We have no intention of being 100 percent against the idea of party leader talks," Yukio Hatoyama, secretary-general of the Democratic Party, said in a TBS radio program. (Reporting by  Yoko Nishikawa )
