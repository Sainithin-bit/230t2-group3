 MAEBASHI, Japan  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan board member Tadao Noda said on Wednesday the yen's higher exchange rate could hurt exporters in the short term but would help increase the economy's overall income in the long term. 

 "The short-term impact (of a high yen) is important, but we must not underestimate its medium- and long-term impact on the economy," Noda said at a news conference in Maebashi, 100 km (60 miles) north of Tokyo. Noda, a banking industry veteran, is regarded by the markets as somewhat hawkish on monetary policy. (Reporting by  Leika Kihara )
