 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Opposition lawmakers vetoed the Japanese government's pick for central bank governor on Wednesday, leaving the Bank of Japan (BOJ) in the middle of the global credit crisis with no successor to Governor Toshihiko Fukui one week before he retires. 

 The rejection of current deputy governor Toshiro Muto threatens a monetary policy vacuum in Japan at a time when central banks are working together to ease the crisis, including concerted action on Tuesday to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into credit markets.  Parliament's upper house, where the main opposition Democratic Party (DPJ) and smaller allies hold sway, also rejected one of the nominees for deputy governor but approved the other, retired central bank official Masaaki Shirakawa. It was not clear how the issue would be resolved. Government ministers said they had not given up on promoting Muto, although Shirakawa is likely to serve as acting BOJ head if the Democrats and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) cannot resolve the stalemate by Fukui's departure on March 19. "It is the shame of the government and the Democratic Party," said Morgan Stanley economist Takehiro Sato, adding that the two sides in the debate had let the issue go far too close to Fukui's long-known retirement date of March 19. "Both the LDP and DPJ have to make concessions to each other. The DPJ should have proposed alternative ideas, but they didn't." There was also speculation that the government and opposition might reach a deal under which Muto would be renominated and opposition parties would abstain from voting in return for concessions on other policies, such as cuts to gasoline taxes. The row has added to political paralysis in Japan that has sent Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's popularity sliding.  "To have such confusion over deciding the top of the Bank of Japan, which holds Japan's purse strings, shows Japan is in crisis," said Masufumi Akutagawa, 29, who works in an IT business. "Both sides are at fault. Fukuda has no leadership at all, and (Democrat leader Ichiro) Ozawa is also responsible." CONFOUNDING EXPECTATIONS The rejection of Muto comes amid fears of a U.S. recession and a slowdown, possibly also a recession, this year in Japan. Fourth-quarter Japanese growth was confirmed by the government at 0.9 percent on Wednesday, confounding market expectations for a revision down.  But Taro Saito, a senior economist at NLI Research Institute, said the economy was likely to stall, or even contract, in the current quarter. While appointing Shirakawa as acting governor would ensure the BOJ had a leader, economists say a temporary central bank governor is not a good solution as the world faces the prospect of a recession in the United States. Major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, teamed up on Tuesday to channel hundreds of billions of dollars in fresh funds to cash-starved credit markets. The BOJ spoke out in support of the moves, but took no specific steps of its own to boost liquidity.  Finance Minister Fukushiro Nukaga said the government had not yet given up on Muto as central bank governor. "The government has put forward its best proposal, so we need to continue efforts to gain understanding on this," he told reporters. "It is desirable for the new governor and deputies to be decided by March 19 given that economic and financial conditions in Japan and overseas are extremely unstable." Ruling party officials said parliament's lower house would press on with a vote on the three nominees on Thursday, but it was unclear what would happen next, as the upper house veto would still be in effect. Opposition lawmakers have consistently opposed Muto because of his close ties to government as a former top bureaucrat in the Ministry of Finance. He pledged in parliament to act independently if approved as governor but that failed to persuade opposition lawmakers, who said the next move was up to Fukuda. "As I can tell from media reports, the prime minister seems to feel troubled," said Azuma Koshiishi, a senior Democrat upper house lawmaker who cast doubt on any deal to approve Muto later. "I don't think it is possible for the reasons behind our opposition to change just because a few days have passed," he told reporters. The deepening global credit crisis has wiped out expectations for a Japanese rate hike this year, with some market players now expecting instead a rate cut from the current 0.5 percent.
