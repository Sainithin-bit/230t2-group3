 (Reuters) - The Japanese parliament's upper house approved Masaaki Shirakawa as deputy governor of the Bank of Japan on Wednesday. 

 He was the only one of three government nominees for the central bank that escaped a veto from the opposition bloc, which controls the upper house. Following are key facts about and quotes from 58-year-old Shirakawa: -- Currently a professor at Kyoto University School of Government, Shirakawa worked at the Bank of Japan for 34 years, serving in various divisions such as monetary affairs, international affairs and financial markets sections. He also briefly worked at the BOJ office in New York. -- Played a pivotal role in the bank's exit from its super-easy policy of flooding the banking system with cash in 2006. -- Personal views on monetary policy are not widely known in the market, but he represented the mainstream view of the BOJ while he was serving at the central bank. Shirakawa said on Tuesday he had no particular position now on interest rates. -- Served as a BOJ executive director for the monetary affairs department for four years until 2006, helping the bank's governor in running monetary policy. There are six executive directors at the BOJ, which are top posts for BOJ staff. Shirakawa attended policy board meetings in a supporting role, but executive directors do not vote on policy. -- A graduate of the prestigious University of Tokyo, which has educated many top Japanese government officials. He received a master's degree in economics at the University of Chicago in 1977. -- Skeptical about introducing an inflation targeting policy. Comments at a parliamentary hearing on March 11: -- "Downside risks and uncertainties for Japan's economy are increasing, such as a sharp U.S. economic slowdown, falling domestic housing investment on revised construction rules and rising crude oil costs that are weighing on corporate earnings and household income. In this environment, the task for monetary policy is to achieve sustained economic growth with price stability. -- "At the moment, I don't have a particular position on whether we should raise interest rates or not. If I were to be appointed, I would like to make up my own mind by using information accumulated within the BOJ and from outside, as well as based on discussions at the policy board." -- "When I was at the BOJ, I closely watched what the governor and deputy governors did. Through this experience, I think the first role for a deputy governor is supporting the governor, in areas such as monetary policy and the bank's operations." -- "The second role is to contribute to the policy board's decision as a board member. I understand that people would expect me to give consideration to appropriately providing information that is accumulated within the BOJ and is useful for policy decisions." -- "Compared with Japan's real economic growth and potential growth, the nation's effective short-term interest rate is very low. Interest rates reflect the economy's temperature. If rates are kept low in light of the economy's temperature for too long, that could lead to a buildup of various (market) positions. As a result, it could prevent the economy and financial markets from expanding stably. I don't think that will necessarily happen, but we need to keep an eye on various risks, both to the upside and downside." -- "It is necessary to envisage to a certain extent an inflation rate that would represent stable prices in the long run. But I don't think that fixing such a rate is necessarily appropriate." (Reporting by Tokyo Policy Desk; Editing by  Rodney Joyce )
