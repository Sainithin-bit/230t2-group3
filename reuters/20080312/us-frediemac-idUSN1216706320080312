 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.N has enough capital to weather the worst housing market in a century and has no plans to raise more dilutive capital, executives of the second largest U.S. home funding company said. 

 The government-chartered housing company raised $6 billion in capital last quarter in a preferred stock sale, but reported a loss of $2.5 billion as falling home prices and rising defaults hiked credit-related costs. Soaring defaults and foreclosures have sped up the housing market slump. Once considered among the safest of investments, yield premiums on bonds issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. home funding company, jumped to the highest levels in more than two decades last week. "From a defensive position we feel OK," Chief Financial Officer Buddy Piszel told analysts and investors at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. "There is no dilutive capital raise planned." Freddie Mac last month said it had increased its estimate of total credit losses for 2008 and 2009 by a combined $1.5 billion to $5.1 billion. The losses have escalated in what Richard Syron, Freddie Mac's chief executive, called the worst U.S. housing market in about a century. The push to increase the overall share of single family home ownership may have been too aggressive, he said. Many borrowers got homes by taking higher-risk loans, or loans that they could not afford once adjustable rates spiked higher, and are increasingly defaulting or headed into foreclosure. Multi-family housing may play a bigger role going forward, Syron said. To help offset these rising risks, Freddie Mac expects the fees it collects for guaranteeing U.S. mortgages to nearly double by later this year from last year's level. "We should see all-in guarantee fees climb into the mid 30s (basis points) later this year," said Senior Vice President of Single Family Housing Paul Mullings at the conference. They were in the high teens in 2007. Freddie Mac has been criticized for its fee increases because they essentially make credit more expensive, which may hurt the housing market. Freddie, however, has raised fees to compensate itself for taking on greater risk due to the housing slump. (Writing by  Lynn Adler ; Reporting by Al Yoon; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
