 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen retailer American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ) said on Wednesday that quarterly net income fell, amid lower customer traffic, weak sales, and competition from rivals. 

 The mall-based chain known for colorful, preppy fashions for young men and women said net income for its fiscal fourth quarter ended February 2 was $140.48 million, or 66 cents per share, compared with $150.16 million, or 66 cents per share, a year ago. The company had fewer shares outstanding in the most recent quarter, which boosted per-share results. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
