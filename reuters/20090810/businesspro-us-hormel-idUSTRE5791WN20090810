 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp ( HRL.N ) raised its fiscal 2009 earnings forecast on Monday, citing a stronger-than-expected third quarter. 

 The maker of Spam lunch meat said the third quarter benefited from a strong performance in refrigerated foods, improvement at Jennie-O turkey and solid results in grocery products. Hormel also benefited from better investment performance in its "rabbi trust" investment trust, Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger said in a statement. Hormel now expects to earn $2.36 to $2.42 per share this year, up from a prior target of $2.15 to $2.25. Analysts, on average, expected $2.29. The company said it would release third-quarter results on August 20. (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl ; editing by John Wallace)
