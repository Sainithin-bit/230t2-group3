 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Dish Network Corp ( DISH.O ) rose sharply on Monday after the No.2 U.S. satellite TV operator posted a lower quarterly profit but added subscribers for the first time in over a year. 

 Dish added about 26,000 net new subscribers during the second quarter, helped in part by the June 12 U.S. digital broadcast transition. Gross subscriber additions during the quarter fell 3 percent to 731,000, far less than what some analysts were expecting. Investors will consider the gross additions especially strong compared to the year-ago period because last year's number included the benefit of a distribution deal with AT&T Inc ( T.N ), Goldman Sachs analyst Ingrid Chung said in a note. The AT&T partnership accounted for about 17 percent of gross subscriber additions in 2008, Dish said. These improvements helped boost shares by as much as 9 percent in early Nasdaq trading. Net income fell 81 percent to $63.4 million, or 14 cents a share, from $335.9 million, or 73 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue was largely flat at $2.9 billion. Analysts had on average forecast revenue of $2.91 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Dish's profit was hurt partly by $196 million in espenses related to a litigation with TiVo Inc ( TIVO.O ). The Englewood, Colorado company, controlled by satellite entrepreneur Charlie Ergen, has been under extensive competitive pressure in recent quarters from its larger rival DirecTV Group ( DTV.O ) as well as phone and cable operators. The company's previous focus on the low-income end of the pay-TV market had hurt its operations as the economy turned weak. Sister company EchoStar Corp ( SATS.O ), which sells set-top boxes and other equipment to Dish, also reported second-quarter earnings on Monday of $1.18 per share on revenue of $383 million. Dish shares rose 5.8 percent, or $1.09, to $19.50. (Reporting by  S. John Tilak  and  Anupreeta Das  in New York; Editing by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri, Vinu Pilakkott)
