 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's National Bureau of Statistics will issue all its monthly economic data for July at a news conference on Tuesday. 

 The bureau had planned to publish figures for consumer and producer prices on Monday; for urban fixed-asset investment on Tuesday; and for industrial output and retail sales on Wednesday. In a statement on its website, the NBS said a monthly news conference would become a routine event, held on or around the eleventh of each month depending on holiday schedules. Quarterly GDP figures will still be released around the 16th of January, April, July and October. July trade figures, released by the Customs Administration, are due on Tuesday; money supply and lending data from the central bank are scheduled by the 15th of the month.
