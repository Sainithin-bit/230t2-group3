 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Midwest utility Alliant Energy Corp. ( LNT.N ) on Friday posted a first-quarter profit, reversing a year-earlier loss that included charges for debt reductions at its nonregulated business. 

 The Madison, Wisconsin-based company said net income was $63.9 million, or 55 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $1.6 million, or 1 cent a share.
