 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Post Co. ( WPO.N ) said on Friday that its quarterly profit fell from a year before, hurt by a decline in results from its Kaplan education and test preparation service. 

 The Post reported first-quarter net income of $64.4 million, down from $76.9 million a year earlier. Net income available to common stockholders fell to $6.70 a share from $7.95 a share a year before. Revenue rose 4 percent to $985.6 million.
