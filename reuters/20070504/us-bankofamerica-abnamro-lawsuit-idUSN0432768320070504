 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) sued Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS on Friday over the No. 2 U.S. bank's agreement to buy ABN's U.S. unit, LaSalle, seeking an injunction barring the unit's sale to any other party. 

 Bank of America also said in the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, that ABN had been "unjustly enriched" by billions of dollars because of the premium that Bank of America agreed to pay in its $21 billion offer for LaSalle and sought unspecified money damages.
