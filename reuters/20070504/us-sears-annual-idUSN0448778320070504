 HOFFMAN ESTATES, Illinois  (Reuters) - The chairman of Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) said the retailer is investing in technology to improve its retail operations, but was also considering acquisitions and other ways to use its cash. 

 "We still have a lot of cash and a variety of options to deploy that," Edward Lampert told shareholders at the company's annual meeting. Lampert, a billionaire investor, didn't mention specific acquisition candidates, and also declined to comment when asked if he had bought stock in home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), a company some media outlets reported he was interested in last year. Under Lampert's leadership, Sears has posted declining sales amid heated competition but solid profit growth due in part to cost-cutting efforts. Sears Holdings was formed when Kmart acquired Sears in 2005. Sears also said a new brand positioning to be unveiled in a few days would hearken back to the heritage of both its chains. For example, ads it displayed showed an animated Mr. Blue Light touting Kmart products, while Sears commercials showcased the chain's appliances, patio furniture and other products with the tagline "Sears-Where it Begins." Shares of Sears Holdings were down $8.56, or 4.6 percent, to $179.76 on Friday. On Thursday, the retailer forecast earnings below Wall Street estimates, citing a drop in same-store sales at both Kmart and Sears. Sears estimated net income of $200 million to $235 million, or $1.30 to $1.53 per diluted share, for the fiscal first quarter ending May 5. The estimate includes a gain of 27 cents a share from a legal settlement. "You had an Easter shift this year; you had cold weather," Lampert said when a shareholder asked about business conditions. Many retailers have said they expected sales at stores open at least a year to suffer in April since March results were helped by an earlier Easter holiday. The Sears outlook was "very consistent with what we're seeing in other elements in the industry," said Deutsche Bank analyst Bill Dreher, who attended the meeting. During the meeting, President Aylwin Lewis said the company would boost its lineup of Craftsman tools and Kenmore appliances in its Kmart stores. Craftsman and Kenmore are proprietary brands of Sears. Lewis also said the Sears Grand format, which includes bigger stores that carry a wider range of goods, "is not going to go away."
