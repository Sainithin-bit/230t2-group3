 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Photography company Eastman Kodak Co. EK.N on Friday reported a smaller first-quarter loss as cost-cutting helped offset a revenue decline. 

 Kodak, in its first report since the camera maker completed the sale of its health imaging business, said its net loss was $151 million, or 53 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $298 million, or $1.04 a share. The world's top maker of photographic film, which says it is in the last year of a costly transformation into a provider of digital products and printing services, said revenue fell to $2.11 billion from $2.29 billion.
