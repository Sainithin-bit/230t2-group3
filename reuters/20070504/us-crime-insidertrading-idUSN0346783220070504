 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Credit Suisse ( CS.N ) investment banker was charged on Thursday for an insider trading scheme linked to acquisitions involving nine publicly traded U.S. companies that netted a co-conspirator more than $7 million. 

 Hafiz Muhammad Zubair Naseem, a 37-year-old Pakistani who worked for Credit Suisse's Global Energy Group in New York, has been charged with one count of conspiracy and 25 counts of securities fraud, prosecutors said in a complaint. The complaint alleged that between April 2006 and February 2007 Naseem tipped off a co-conspirator about acquisitions involving Northwestern Corporation, Energy Partners ( EPL.N ), Veritas DGC, Jacuzzi Brands JJZ.N Trammell Crow Co., Hydril Company, Caremark RX, John H. Harland Co., and TXU Corp  TXU.N. "Because many of the subject transactions were staffed by members of the Global Energy Group, Naseem had access to information about these transactions by virtue of his membership in the Global Energy Group," the complaint said. It said Naseem's desk was also near a printer used for some of the non-energy deals that he allegedly gave tip-offs about. "Naseem regularly and repeatedly called a co-conspirator (CC-1) and provided him with material non-public information regarding the subject transactions (the "Credit Suisse Inside Information)," the complaint said. "CC-1 executed dozens of securities transactions, including trades in an offshore account, based on Credit Suisse Inside Information; CC-1 profited from his trading in each of the Subject Securities and earned total profits in excess of $7.5 million from the scheme," it said. Naseem is due to appear in Manhattan federal court on Friday. If convicted he faces up to five years in prison for the conspiracy charge and up to 20 years in prison for each of the securities frauds charges.
