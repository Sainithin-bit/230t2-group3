 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News and financial information company Bloomberg LP is not looking to buy publisher Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N or its rival news service Reuters Group Plc RTR.L RTRSY.O, a spokeswoman said on Friday. 

 "We are not currently looking at either company," Bloomberg spokeswoman Judith Czelusniak said. Reuters earlier said it had received a takeover approach from an unidentified bidder, following news this week that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.NWSa.N had made a $5 billion bid for Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones.
