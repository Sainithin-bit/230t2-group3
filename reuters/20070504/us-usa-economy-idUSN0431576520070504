 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added a modest 88,000 jobs in April, the slimmest gain in more than two years, and the unemployment rate edged up, the government said on Friday in a report that showed weak economic growth taking a toll on the job market. 

 The Labor Department said the jobless rate ticked up to 4.5 percent from 4.4 percent in March, suggesting tight labor market conditions have finally begun to ease following tepid economic growth in the first three months of 2007. The report is likely to give comfort to Federal Reserve policy-makers, who had been worried a low unemployment rate could fuel a rise in wages that could push inflation higher. The Fed's rate-setting policy committee meets next week. "One big puzzle in this economy has been the resilience of the labor market in the face of weak GDP growth. Today's employment report for April gave a hint that the labor market may be starting to soften," said Nigel Gault, U.S. economist for Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. While a bit weaker than expected, the report broadly matched expectations and the market response was muted. U.S. stock prices edged higher on talk of potential takeovers and an easing of inflation fears. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average closed up 23 points at 13,264. At the same time, government bond prices rose and the dollar slipped as markets saw the data slightly increasing the chance the Fed would lower interest rates later in the year. "The Fed will probably like the signs of easing cost pressures coming from the labor market. We'll probably need a few more months like this, however, before they relax their inflation vigilance," Liscio Report editors Philippa Dunne and Doug Henwood said in a note to clients. A Reuters survey of primary dealers -- big bond firms that deal directly with the Fed in the markets -- found most expect an easing of monetary policy in the second half of the year. DETAILS SOFT Adding to the picture of a slightly less robust jobs market, the government revised down its count of jobs created in March by 3,000 and in February by 23,000. The report also showed average hourly earnings rose only modestly last month, further supporting a view of less-tight labor conditions. The 12-month gain in earnings slipped to 3.7 percent, the smallest increase since last May. "Wage inflation looks like it's starting to subside," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards and Sons in St. Louis. Significant job losses in April came in general merchandise stores, where employment dropped by 41,000, and credit intermediation, where 14,000 jobs were lost. Factory employment fell by 19,000, the 10th straight monthly decline. Meanwhile, construction employment slipped 11,000 after a gain of 50,000 in March. There has been almost no net change in construction employment so far this year. Analysts had been puzzled, before the April jobs report, on why the unemployment rate had been drifting down despite signs of a slowing economy. The Fed has worried that a tight labor market could create an inflationary spark, but has said that sub-par economic growth should eventually help price pressures ease. While economic growth has slowed sharply, the U.S. central bank has made clear that its main concern is that inflation might fail to moderate, and it has held benchmark interest rates steady since raising them to 5.25 percent in June.
