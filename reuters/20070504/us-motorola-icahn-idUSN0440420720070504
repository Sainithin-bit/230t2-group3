 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn said on Friday he would likely seek the resignation of Motorola Inc. MOT.N Chief Executive Ed Zander if he fails to turn the electronics company around this year. 

 The billionaire investor, who is waging a heated proxy battle to win a seat on the Motorola board at Monday's annual meeting, until now has been relatively quiet about his plans for the company should he win the seat. Icahn, who has backed off previous calls that the company should undertake a major share buyback, now suggests that management changes would be at the forefront of his plans if he wins shareholder support. "This is a great company," Icahn said in an interview. "If Zander turns it around, we love him. If he doesn't turn it around, someone else should get a shot at it." Motorola shares were up 36 cents, or 2 percent, at $18.09 on the New York Stock Exchange. Icahn also said he plans to speak at the Motorola meeting outside Chicago on Monday to further persuade shareholders that his voice on the board can add value. But the high-profile investor, who has hired a proxy solicitation firm to poll stockholders and get a sense on how they will vote, acknowledged his campaign is anything but a sure shot. Motorola has strenuously objected to the Icahn candidacy, calling him unqualified and suggesting he would be overstretched, since he already serves on a number of boards of public companies. These include XO Holdings Inc. XOHO.OB, Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N, American Real Estate Partners LP ( ACP.N ), ImClone Systems IMCL.O and Cadus Pharmaceutical Corp. ( KDUS.OB ). In a flurry of statements this week, Motorola also suggested Icahn might resign his post and sell his Motorola holdings if the stock rose, since he also has a fiduciary duty to his investors in his hedge fund. In response, Icahn promised in an open letter published on Friday to "resign from a sufficient number of boards" to allow him to "devote all of the time and energy required to contribute to stockholder value." He also promised to "remain a long-term stockholder" of Motorola. Icahn stressed that he would be only a minority voice on the Motorola board if elected and that it needs a bigger shareholder voice. His $1.2 billion in Motorola stock, he said, exceeds that held by all board members combined. "It's a simple question," said Icahn in the interview. "Why would you not want to have large shareholders on the boards of companies?" While not all of Icahn's investments have generated returns, he touted his experience with drugmaker ImClone as evidence that management changes can yield positive share performance. Icahn was appointed chairman of ImClone last October after a management brawl when the shares were trading around $30. They have since risen to trade over $45. "While I don't presume to take credit for the whole move, this proves the point that the involvement of large shareholders can strongly enhance value," said Icahn.
