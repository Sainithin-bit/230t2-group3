 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) insists its new chief financial officer will not embark on a new course at the medical device company, but many on Wall Street are expecting major moves, including efforts to strengthen the balance sheet. 

 Shares of Boston Scientific, down 65 percent from a peak set three years ago, bounced earlier this week on news that Sam Leno, CFO of orthopedic device maker Zimmer Holdings ( ZMH.N ) would replace the retiring Larry Best, a hard-driving deal maker. The announcement came just ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting on May 8. Speaking at the Morgan Stanley Global Healthcare Conference this week, Boston Scientific executives told investors that they did not expect Leno's arrival to have a dramatic impact on operations. They said they expected him to continue the restructuring efforts already under way, and his appointment did not necessarily signal big changes. The company is in the midst of digesting its acquisition of Guidant, and analysts believe that additional restructuring efforts are likely. "We still contend that efforts to simplify and strengthen the company's financial structure and balance sheet do have the potential to negatively impact the P&L," Morgan Stanley analyst Glenn Reicin wrote in a research note. Among the most pressing issues facing Leno as Boston Scientific's new CFO are debt reduction in the wake of the Guidant acquisition, divestitures of noncore businesses and cost cutting, said David Heupel, portfolio manager of Thrivent Investment Management. "We'd like to see those issued addressed," said Heupel, whose fund does not own Boston Scientific shares. "People want someone to come in and take a hard look at the organization and Sam Leno is well regarded ... He could be the right person to do that. The company grew from a small maker of catheters into the largest cardiovascular device company with last year's acquisition of Guidant -- a deal Fortune Magazine called the "$25 billion mistake" and the "second-worst deal ever." 'LIGHTNING ROD' Reicin said some considered outgoing CFO Best a "lightning rod of controversy," seeing him as defiant to many on Wall Street who questioned the company's strategy and financial position. "Best's footprint has been etched in Boston Scientific's financials, as the capital structure is relatively complex," Reicin said. By contrast, he described Leno is a relatively quiet figure. "Zimmer's financials were rather straight forward with little use of leverage and complex financial instruments," Reicin said. "We think Leno will bring greater discipline to the Boston Scientific's P&L, but it will probably take some time for this to play out." Jeff Jonas, portfolio manager at Gamco Medical Opportunities Fund, said Leno was likely to bring the same focus on driving operating margins and cutting costs that he had at Zimmer. Jonas, whose fund does not own Boston Scientific shares, said he was less concerned about the company's balance sheet than its declines in market share and revenues generated by heart stents, tiny wire mesh tubular devices that prop open arteries after angioplasty. "We could see the balance sheet improve within six months," he said, but added that the stent market would become increasingly tough as top rivals bring competitive products on the market over the next two years. He said he was encouraged that Boston Scientific had resolved some issues with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and hoped it follows through with a potential sale or spinoff of its endosurgery business. The company could also raise money by selling its stakes in Aspect Medical ASPM.O and Cyberonics ( CYBX.O ). Added Thrivent's Heupel: "Back in the early 1990s, people thought this company wouldn't make it. It's hard to ever bet against Boston Scientific ... It's on our radar."
