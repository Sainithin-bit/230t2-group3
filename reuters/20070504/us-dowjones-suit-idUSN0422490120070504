 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An investor lawsuit filed in New York State court this week accuses the Bancroft family and directors of Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N of failing to properly evaluate News Corp.'s NWSa.N bid for the company. 

 Earlier this week, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. made a $5 billion bid for the publisher of the Wall Street Journal. The company said its board would not act on Murdoch's $60 per share offer after a majority of the Bancroft family, which controls 64.2 percent of Dow Jones voting stock, indicated they would veto a deal. The shareholder class action suit, filed by Nora Vines on Thursday in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, alleges the Bancroft family and company directors exercised poor business judgment and rejected Murdoch's offer "in bad faith." The suit claims the Bancrofts and Dow Jones directors rejected Murdoch's offer with the motive of solidifying their dominance over the company. The rejection of the offer by the Bancrofts and directors "represents an ill-considered, hasty reaction, which did not satisfy their duty to obtain adequate information before rejecting a bona fide acquisition proposal," the suit read. Michael Elefante, the trustee representing the Bancroft family and a member of Dow Jones' board, did not return a telephone call seeking comment. "We have not received a copy of the complaint and, accordingly, have no comments at this time," said Howard Hoffman, a Dow Jones spokesman.
