 PARIS  (Reuters) - French investment manager Meeschaert said on Saturday it had applied for the seizure of a yacht owned by a Bernard Madoff company as part of a battle to claw back client losses from the jailed fraudster. 

 Meeschaert pledged in February to return losses to clients who bought shares in the Luxalpha fund of Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and has filed suit against the bank's Luxembourg unit for compensation. The firm said it had filed a request with authorities in the south of France to seize the yacht, "Bull," which it said was moored in Cap d'Antibes on the French Riviera and owned by a Madoff company registered in the Cayman Islands. "We decided to act quickly to prevent the yacht leaving French waters," chairman Cedric Meeschaert said in a statement. He said the action would not affect the suit filed in Luxembourg or forthcoming legal action against Ernst and Young, the auditors of the Luxalpha fund.
