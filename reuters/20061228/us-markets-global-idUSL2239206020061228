 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. government bond prices fell on Thursday and the dollar pared losses after a clutch of surprisingly strong U.S. data suggested the economy remained more robust than initially expected. 

 But U.S. stocks edged lower as investors moved to lock in recent gains before year end, while worries about options grants at Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ) weighed on the Nasdaq. In New York, oil prices crept toward $61 a barrel after the United States reported a large crude stock drawdown last week, while gold futures climbed, helped by a weak dollar. A trio of economic reports on consumer confidence, Midwest business activity and existing homes sales painted a picture of a resilient U.S. economy on Thursday. The data "lends credence to the opinion that we're a good portion of the way through the housing slump," said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Boston. Many of the bleakest views on U.S. growth next year and the accompanying expectations of lower U.S. interest rates have been tied to fears that housing weakness will seep into the broader economy. The rosy economic news weighed on Treasury prices, with the benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR slipping 15/32 to 99 10/32 for a yield of 4.71 percent, above 4.66 percent late Wednesday. The two-year note US2YT=RR fell 3/32 in price for a yield of 4.82 percent, up from 4.79 percent late Wednesday. STOCKS EDGE LOWER Share prices got little boost from the data, partly, analysts said, because investors were taking profits in thin trade ahead of the New Year's holiday. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 15.94 points, or 0.13 percent, at 12,494.63. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 3.03 points, or 0.21 percent, at 1,423.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 5.67 points, or 0.23 percent, at 2,425.55. Shares of Apple ( AAPL.O ) slid 2 percent to $79.88 after the Financial Times reported the company gave Chief Executive Steve Jobs 7.5 million stock options in 2001 without the required authorization of the company's board. Other leading lights from Wednesday, when the Dow closed at a record high above 12,500, turned into laggards on Thursday, among them Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ). In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 Index  .FTEU3  ended unofficially little changed at 1,488.20 points, having come within two points of a 5-1/2 year high in early trade. Asian stocks continued a strong year-end run, with MSCI's Asia ex-Japan index up 0.7 percent at an all-time high. DOLLAR PARES LOSSES, EURO UP VS. YEN The dollar slipped against the euro but moved off its session lows after the stronger-than-expected U.S. data tempered views that the Federal Reserve may have to cut interest rates in early 2007. In recent trade, the euro was up nearly 0.4 percent at $1.3167  EUR=  but off its session peak at $1.3202. The dollar rose 0.1 percent to 118.84 yen  JPY= . "For the dollar, this should raise fresh doubts about the notion of a March Fed rate cut," said Ashraf Laidi, chief currency analyst at CMC Markets in New York. The euro also hit a new peak above 156 yen EURJPY= after European Central Bank Governing Council Member Yves Mersch said euro zone rates remain low. The dollar was up 0.1 percent at 118.85 yen  JPY= . Analysts, though, said currency moves tend to get exaggerated, particularly in weeks such as this with thin liquidity going into year-end. "The market has taken this positively, but as for whether or not it's going to have any legs to it, I doubt it," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. "The market is not predisposed to going on a dollar buying binge right now." On New York's Mercantile Exchange, February crude oil CLG7 gained 18 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $60.52 per barrel, after earlier trading as high as $60.75. Gold for February delivery GCG7 on the COMEX metals trading division of the New York Mercantile Exchange was up $5.70 at $636.10 an ounce, having traded between $629.20 and $638.20. Carlos Perez-Santalla, at Hudson River Futures, said gold rose "in anticipation of further strengthening in the U.S. economy in the next couple of months and on the weak dollar. Iran woes and the threat of terrorism have also extended firm support to gold, he said. On Wednesday, Iran's parliament passed a bill obliging the government to "revise" its level of cooperation with the IAEA nuclear watchdog after the United Nations approved sanctions on Tehran.
