 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence rebounded in 
December, rising to an eight-month high as consumers' view of 
the labor market improved, a survey showed on Thursday. 

  The Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment 
climbed to 109.0 in December -- its highest reading since April 
2006 -- from an upwardly revised 105.3 in November.  Economists polled by Reuters on average had forecast a 
December reading of 102.0.  But Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer 
Research Center, said there was little to suggest sharp 
improvement in overall economic activity in the fourth quarter 
of the year.  "Given the see-saw pattern in recent months, it is too soon 
to tell if this boost in confidence is a genuine signal that 
better times are ahead," Franco said.  Consumers' assessment of current conditions was rosier in 
December than in November. The business research group's 
present situation index rose to 129.9 in December from an 
upwardly revised 125.4 reading in November. The expectations 
index also edged up to 95.1 from an upwardly revised 91.9 
reading the prior month.  Consumers took a similarly upbeat view of the labor market. 
Those who said jobs were "plentiful" rose to 26.9 percent from 
a downwardly revised 25.7 percent in November. Those who 
claimed that jobs were "hard to get" slipped to 21.2 percent 
from a downwardly revised 22.1 percent the prior month.  Sentiment indexes have traditionally been seen as a gauge 
of U.S. consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 
two-thirds of overall economic activity.
