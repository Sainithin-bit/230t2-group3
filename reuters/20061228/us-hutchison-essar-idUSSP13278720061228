 HONG KONG/MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Bidders for Indian mobile operator Hutchison Essar jostled for position on Thursday as analysts urged main shareholder Hutchison Telecom to set a high price on any exit from India's vibrant telecoms sector. 

 In the latest twist to a $17 billion takeover tussle, Hutchison Essar's 33 percent Indian shareholder, Essar group, has approached one potential bidder, Britain's Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ), about a carve-up deal, one press report said.

Other reports have said Essar wants to buy out the whole business in a deal valuing Hutchison Essar at $17-$18 billion, while the Financial Times said Vodafone had made a solo bid with a similar valuation. Hutchison Telecommunications International 2332.HK relies on India and its 67 percent Hutchison Essar stake for an estimated four-fifths of operating income. The Hong Kong firm is expected to end 2006 in the black after a hefty 2005 loss. Hutchison Essar is poised to ride swelling demand growth over the next half-decade. Analysts say mobile penetration could double over two years from 12 percent now, and triple in four years. India's government expects 180 million mobile phone users by end-2007, up more than 25 percent from 143 million now. Goldman Sachs analyst Helen Zhu argued in a report last week that the business was the crown jewel in its owner's portfolio. "We would be surprised if HTIL were interested in exiting its Indian telecom business at this time," she wrote on December 22. "That being said, we consider HTIL and its parent co Hutch Whampoa to be likely sellers at the 'right' price." Hong Kong-based Hutchison Telecom HTX.N has been an avid deal maker across Asia. But long-cherished hopes of listing its Indian business have been hampered by regulatory changes amid a dispute over local acquisitions with partner Essar, a conglomerate controlled by India's Ruia family. Cashing out at a premium might prove a quick solution, analysts said. "If you're in the industry, you may have other concerns. If you just think as a financial investor, then if the price is right, the deal would get them an exit strategy that can be explored," said Paul Chan, senior analyst at Tai Fook Securities. Essar, Hutchison Telecom and Vodafone all declined comment on Thursday, although Vodafone has confirmed it is considering making an offer, and both Hutchison Telecom and its parent, billionaire Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa ( 0013.HK ), have confirmed receipt of approaches. Hutchison Telecom, which runs networks in Hong Kong, Thailand, Israel and elsewhere, says its subscriber base in India had more than doubled to 20.4 million by the end of September in an overall base of 26.5 million users. An $18 billion offer would imply an enterprise value some 27 times estimated 2006 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization -- more than double the valuation of Reliance Communications ( RLCM.BO ), Goldman Sachs reckoned. Other potential suitors include private equity giant Texas Pacific TPL.UL along with Malaysia's Maxis Communications ( MXSC.KL ), and India's own Reliance Communications ( RLCM.BO ), the country's second-largest mobile operator, via a tie-up with private equity group Blackstone BG.UL, sources and newspaper reports say. Buying Hutchison Essar would boost Vodafone in a market where its existing interest is limited to a 10 percent stake in industry leader Bharti Airtel Ltd ( BRTI.BO ). India's Business Standard newspaper reported on Thursday that Bharti would start talks on "disengagement" from Vodafone when the UK company had firmed up a plan for India. Hutchison Telecom shares have benefited from all the talk. The stock has risen some 12 percent since speculation of a bid surfaced in early December.
