 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Union workers at the largest U.S. tire 
maker, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. GT.N, are voting on a 
proposed new contract and a final tally could come later on 
Thursday, a company spokesman said. 

  Goodyear and the United Steelworkers reached a tentative 
agreement last week to end a 10-week strike by 15,000 union 
workers in the United States and Canada.  A majority of workers at a majority of plants must ratify 
the proposed three-year contract, which would lower Goodyear's 
labor costs while securing retiree health benefits and boosting 
the company's investment in union-represented plants.  "We know that the voting is ongoing," said Ed Markey, a 
spokesman for Goodyear. "We may or may not have something this 
evening, we might not have anything until tomorrow."  If the contract is ratified, the company has said it would 
provide its details next month for investors and Wall Street 
analysts.  Goodyear shares, which this week touched a 52-week high, 
were down 20 cents at $20.02 in late trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange.
