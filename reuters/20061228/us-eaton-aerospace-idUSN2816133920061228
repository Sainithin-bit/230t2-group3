 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Industrial goods manufacturer Eaton Corp. ( ETN.N ) said on Thursday it will buy AT Holdings Corp., the parent of Argo-Tech Corp., from two private equity firms for $695 million to expand its aerospace business. 

 The deal, a combination of cash and debt, with private equity firms Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and Vestar Capital Partners is expected to close in the first quarter of 2007. Eaton declined to provide details. Eaton's products range from electrical power distribution and control equipment to engine parts and hydraulic and fluid power systems, many of which are used in the aerospace sector. Argo-Tech makes aerospace engine fuel pumps and systems, airframe fuel pumps and systems, and ground fueling systems for commercial and military aerospace markets. Eaton said adding Argo-Tech will allow it offer customers a total fuel system. Greenbriar and Vestar acquired AT Holdings in October 2005 for $120 million in equity and notes for a total deal value of $450 million, according to an October report from Standard & Poor's Ratings Services that cited Argo-Tech's sizable debt load and solid profit margins. Prudential analyst Igor Maryasis praised the deal, saying Eaton was trying to offset its exposure to the declining North American heavy-duty truck and automotive markets, but expressed some concern. "While we have a positive view on this acquisition, we feel that it comes as a relatively high price," he said in a research note. Maryasis, who does not expect the purchase to have a significant effect on 2007 results, said Eaton will pay 11 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), which is above the average ratio of its past acquisitions of six to seven times EBITDA. He maintained a "neutral weight" rating on the stock. Prior to the deal closing, AT Holdings will be reorganized to exclude its cryogenics and other non-aerospace businesses, which had sales of $22 million in 2006, and certain other assets, Cleveland-based Eaton said. Argo-Tech's aerospace business had sales of $206 million and EBITDA of $63 million for the fiscal year ended October 28. It is the world's largest supplier of main engine fuel pumps, used in over 60 percent of large commercial aircraft, according to Eaton, and derives about one-half of its sales from the more lucrative replacement parts market, according to  S&P. Argo-Tech employs 640 people in Cleveland; Costa Mesa and Inglewood, California; and Tucson, Arizona. It is the sole source supplier of the main engine fuel pump for the General Electric ( GE.N ) GEnx engines to be used on the Boeing ( BA.N ) 787, Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A350 and the Boeing 747-8, and is the fuel system supplier for the Eclipse 500 and Adams 700. "The acquisition of Argo-Tech adds an important component to Eaton's aerospace fuel system strategy by acquiring a leading provider in engine fuel pump technology," Eaton Chief Executive Alexander Cutler said in a statement. "Argo-Tech will strengthen our aerospace operations by providing Eaton with a total fuel system capability, attractive aftermarket opportunities and an increased portfolio and customer base," he added. With this acquisition, Eaton's aerospace operations will grow to about $1.5 billion in annual revenues. Eaton shares were up 22 cents at $75.65 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
