 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. department store operator J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) on Thursday said it fired its chief operating officer, Catherine West, after only six months on the job, sending its shares down 1 percent. 

 West, 47, was named executive vice president and COO in June and previously worked for Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ), where she had been president of its U.S. card business. Her termination was effective immediately, J.C. Penney said in a brief statement. The company did not give a reason for her firing. The store operations, property development and logistics departments, which were reporting to West, will now report to Myron "Mike" Ullman, Penney's chairman and chief executive, the company said. The Plano, Texas-based company, which operates more than 1,000 stores, would not provide further details. Company spokeswoman Darcie Brossart said she could not comment on the reason for West's firing. Citigroup analyst Deborah Weinswig wrote in a research note that West's termination came as a surprise, but added that her departure would not represent a big loss for the company, given her short tenure. "We believe this decision came as a result of Ms. West not being a good fit for the company," Weinswig wrote. Analyst Robert Buchanan of AG Edwards suggested in a research note that West's lack of retail experience might have figured into the decision to terminate her. "The transition from any other "world"/business to the highly peculiar and specific and fast-moving world of retailing is as tough as barbed wire for anyone," Buchanan wrote. According to a June filing with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, West was to earn a base salary of $750,000 -- to be reviewed annually starting in 2007 -- with an additional cash bonus targeted at 75 percent of base salary, but that could be as much as 150 percent of her salary. West was also to receive stock option awards and restricted stock awards valued at over $20 million in recognition of forfeited benefits at her former employer, Capital One, as well as a minimum cash bonus for 2006 of $1 million. Starting in 2007 West was to be eligible for long-term incentive awards with a target value of $1.4 million. J.C. Penney spokeswoman Kate Parkhouse said that the company would honor terms of a severance agreement with West. That agreement calls for West to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to annual salary and incentive compensation for 18 months. Under terms of the agreement, West will receive roughly $10 million, most of it in equity, Parkhouse said. West could not immediately be reached for comment. Penney shares, which are up 39 percent since January, closed down 76 cents at $77.64 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded in a 52-week range of $82.45 to $54.20.
