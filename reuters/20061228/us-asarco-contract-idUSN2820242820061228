 PHOENIX  (Reuters) - The union representing 1,500 workers at plants operated by copper company Asarco in Arizona and Texas has agreed with the company to extend the labor contract which expires on December 31, the head of the union said on Thursday. 

 United Steelworkers chief negotiator Terry Bonds said a deal was within reach with Asarco, which is majority-owned by Mexican mining giant Grupo Mexico ( GMEXICOB.MX ). "I think we're close to getting this (contract) done," he told Reuters. "I don't think we would have had an extension if we didn't think we would be able to work out a contract."
