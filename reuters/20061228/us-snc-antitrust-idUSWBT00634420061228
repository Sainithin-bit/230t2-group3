 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp. ( GD.N ) on Thursday received conditional U.S. antitrust approval to acquire Canadian ammunition company SNC Technologies, the Federal Trade Commission said. 

 The FTC said it would not oppose the deal after General Dynamics agreed to sell its interest in a joint venture that does assembly work for mortar and artillery shells. SNC Technologies is a unit of SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. ( SNC.TO ) General Dynamics said in February it had agreed to buy SNC Technologies for about $275 million. Under a consent agreement reached with the FTC, General Dynamics will be required to sell its interest in American Ordnance LLC, the FTC said. American Ordnance and SNC Technologies are two of only three companies that provide the service, which consists of filling mortar and artillery shells with molten TNT, assembling components and packing the rounds for delivery. Combining the two companies would likely have forced the military to pay higher prices, the FTC said. The only other company that provides the services uses a facility that is slated to be closed. Under the agreement, General Dynamics will have to sell its interest in the venture to an FTC-approved buyer within four months of acquiring SNC, the FTC said.
