 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) is to 
step up its pursuit of ports, airports and regulated utilities 
around the world after the investment bank raised more than 
$6.5 billion for its first dedicated infrastructure fund, the 
Financial Times reported. 

  The fund, which was expected to close on Wednesday, would 
be one of the largest single pools of capital dedicated to 
infrastructure investing, the FT reported.  In September, Reuters reported the investment bank was 
raising money for an infrastructure investment fund.  Goldman was not immediately available for comment.
