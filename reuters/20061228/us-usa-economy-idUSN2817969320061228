 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. existing home sales rose in November for a second straight month and consumer confidence hit an eight-month high in December, according to reports on Thursday showing the economy ending the year on a solid note. 

 Other reports showed business activity expanded in the U.S. Midwest this month, suggesting the ailing factory sector could be finding its footing, while initial claims for state jobless benefits edged up slightly last week. Prices for U.S. government bonds fell and the dollar trimmed losses as traders saw the stronger-than-expected data as lowering chances the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates early next year. The data gave only a brief boost to stock prices which closed slightly down on the day. The National Association of Realtors said the pace of existing home sales rose 0.6 percent in November to a 6.28 million-unit annual rate, defying Wall Street forecasts for sales to ease slightly and providing the latest suggestion that housing activity was stabilizing after a steep drop. Separately, the Conference Board said its index of consumer sentiment climbed to 109.0 in December -- the highest since April -- from an upwardly revised 105.3 in November as consumers' views on the labor market improved. In addition, the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago said its gauge of U.S. Midwest business activity rose to 52.4 from 49.9 in November, moving back above the 50 line in a sign activity was expanding. "Across the board the data was strong -- it was a royal flush," said Michael Woolfolk, currency strategist at Bank of New York. "GOOD NEWS" Woolfolk said the increase in the Midwest business barometer was particularly welcome, calling it "definitely good news for the underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy." A drop in the index below 50 in November had presaged a similar move by the Institute for Supply Management's national gauge of factory activity. While the employment component of the Chicago index fell to 45.8 in December from 49.4 in November, showing a second straight month of contraction, prices paid held steady and new orders rose. "The survey suggests expansion of manufacturing, but it is just a regional survey; we have to wait until Tuesday for the Institute for Supply Management (national) report," said Michelle Meyer, an economist at Lehman Brothers in New York. The upbeat reading on home re-sales followed a report on Wednesday that showed a stronger-than-expected pace of new home sales last month as well. "It lends credence to the opinion that we're a good portion of the way through the housing slump," Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategy at Delta Global Advisors in Boston, said of the existing home sales report. The number of existing homes on the market slipped 1 percent to 3.82 million units, the Realtors' trade group said. The November's sales pace marked a 7.3 months' supply, down from 7.4 months in October. Although sales volume rose for a second straight month, median home prices were off 3.1 percent from year-ago levels, the fourth consecutive drop. NAR Chief Economist David Lereah said the data held "mixed news" but it broadly signaled a stronger housing sector with inventories and sales stabilizing. "The housing contraction has bottomed," he said. Earlier on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department said the number of workers applying for first-time jobless benefits rose 1,000 to 317,000 last week, suggesting stable labor-market conditions. Wall Street economists had expected claims to rise to 320,000. (Additional reporting by  Glenn Somerville  in Washington,  Ros Krasny  in Chicago and  Steven C. Johnson  in New York)
