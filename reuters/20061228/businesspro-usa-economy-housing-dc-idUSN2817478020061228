 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales of U.S. existing home rose 0.6 
percent in November hitting a 6.28 million-unit annual rate, 
according to a report from the National Association of Realtors 
on Thursday that modestly topped economists' expectations. 

  November saw the second consecutive rise in sales volume 
but the median home price dropped 3.1 percent, the fourth 
straight month of a year-over-year fall in prices.  The inventory of homes for sale was down 1 percent at the 
end of November to 3.82 million units.  Analysts expected home resales to slow to 6.20 million-unit 
pace from the 6.24 million-unit rate in October.  NAR Chief Economist David Lereah said November's data held 
"mixed news" but it broadly signaled a stronger housing sector 
with inventories and sales stabilizing.  "The housing contraction has bottomed," he said.  Lereah said it appears "existing home sales hit bottom in 
September" when they were at a 6.21 million-unit pace and 
inventories have hovered around a 7.3 months' supply since 
July.
