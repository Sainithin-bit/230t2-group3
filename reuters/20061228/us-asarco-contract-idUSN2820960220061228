 PHOENIX (Reuters) The union representing 1,500 workers at plants operated by copper company Asarco in Arizona and Texas agreed with the company Thursday to extend its labor contract which expires on December 31, a union leader said. 

 Terry Bonds, United Steelworkers chief negotiator, said he believes that a deal is well within reach following four months of labor talks with Arizona-based Asarco, which is majority owned by Mexican mining giant Grupo Mexico ( GMEXICOB.MX ). "I think we're close to getting this (contract) done," Bonds told Reuters. "I don't think we would have had an extension if we didn't think we would be able to work out a contract." No deadline has been set for when the contract now would expire, he said. Tentative plans call for the union and Asarco representatives to resume face-to-face contract negotiations next Friday in Phoenix or Tucson, Arizona, Bonds said. A company official could not immediately be reached for comment. The two sides are bargaining to replace a one-year contract approved in November 2005, an agreement forged while the U.S. mining company was in bankruptcy and workers had been out on the picket lines for four months. Asarco, which filed for Chapter 11 protection in August 2005 amid huge environmental cleanup and asbestos claims, remains in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Corpus Christi, Texas. The company has asked for a four-month extension from a January deadline to file its reorganization plan. Union representatives have said they are seeking a wage hike for workers at its five facilities in Arizona and one in Texas as part of a three-year contract. They would not be specific. "We believe we deserve a raise with the price of copper being at an all-time high," Bonds said. Another key to the deal is considered to be a successorship clause that will retain the union as the bargaining agent and force a labor contract to be worked out if the company is sold, officials said. That was a key sticking point during last year's negotiations.
