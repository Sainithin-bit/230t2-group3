 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Slowing economic growth in Canada will 
undercut domestic auto sales in 2007 and contribute to the end 
of a five-year cycle of record global auto sales, Scotia 
Economics said in a report on Thursday. 

  In its Global Auto Report, Scotia Economics said weaker 
sales in mature markets such as Canada, the United States, 
Western Europe and Japan will offset momentum in China, India 
and Latin America next year.  Car and light truck sales in Canada are expected to drop 
4.3 percent to 1.54 million units in 2007 from 1.61 million in 
2006, due partly to the dampening effect of slowing economic 
growth in the United States, the unit of Canada's Bank of Nova 
Scotia ( BNS.TO ) said.  "Vehicle purchases in China, India and Latin America will 
remain in the fast lane in 2007," Carlos Gomes, Scotiabank's 
auto industry specialist, said in the report.  "However, after five consecutive years of record sales, 
global volumes are expected to be flat next year, as slowing 
economic growth undercuts sales in the mature markets."  Gomes said China, which surpassed Germany to become the 
world's third-largest car market in 2006, will remain the 
growth leader next year and should pass Japan for the number 
two spot by 2010.  In India, where manufacturers like General Motors Corp. 
( GM.N ), Suzuki Motor Corp. ( 7269.T ), and Hyundai Motor Co. Ltd. 
( 005380.KS ) plan to invest more than $5 billion through 2012, 
Scotiabank said auto sales should build on the 20 percent rise 
recorded in 2006.  In Latin America, economic growth and low vehicle ownership 
rates in some regions will lead to "solid gains in 2007," the 
report said.  But in the United States, the world's largest car market, 
auto sales in 2007 are expected to drop below 16 million units 
for the first time since 1998 due partly to high gasoline 
prices and slowing economic growth.  ($1=$1.16 Canadian)
