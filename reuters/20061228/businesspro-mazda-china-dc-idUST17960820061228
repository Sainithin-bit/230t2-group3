 TOKYO/SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. 
( 7261.T ) said on Thursday it would restart sales of its locally 
built Mazda3 compact car in China next month after a suspension 
of over nine months. 

  The Hiroshima-based auto maker had on April 7 voluntarily 
stopped producing the model at Changan Ford Mazda Automobile 
Co. -- a tie-up with Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Changan Auto 
( 000625.SZ ) -- citing a flaw in the process of acquiring 
government approval for the model's production and sale.  It resumed production of the model in October, but was 
waiting state approval for a sales resumption.  After years of difficult negotiations with authorities, 
Mazda had gained approval early last year to form a sales joint 
venture, FAW Mazda Motor Sales Co., with another local partner, 
the FAW group, that would have exclusive rights to sell all 
Mazda-branded cars in China.  Mazda had made much of the approval for the exclusive sales 
company, calling it the first of its kind and a crucial step in 
building its brand in the competitive Chinese market. Most 
foreign car makers have two distinct joint venture partners in 
China, and vehicles produced by the companies must be sold 
through their own sales channels.  Sales of the Mazda3 will restart under a revised framework, 
however, assigning distribution rights -- including marketing 
and pricing decisions -- to Changan Ford Mazda, which produces 
the car, and only the retail activities to FAW Mazda Motor 
Sales.  "It's a soft-landing," said a Mazda spokeswoman in Tokyo.  Mazda, held one-third by Ford, last month lowered its sales 
target in China to 134,000 units from 150,000 for the business 
year ending March 31, 2007, partly due to the suspension of the 
Mazda3 production.  It has set a target of selling 300,000 units annually by 
2010.
