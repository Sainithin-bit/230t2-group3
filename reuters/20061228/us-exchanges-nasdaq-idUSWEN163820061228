 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Stock market will be closed on January 2 in observance of the death of President Gerald Ford, the market said on Thursday. 

 Tuesday will be a national day of mourning for the 38th U.S. president, President George W. Bush said earlier on Thursday. President Ford served on the NASD board from 1999-2000, Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq president and chief executive, said in a statement.
