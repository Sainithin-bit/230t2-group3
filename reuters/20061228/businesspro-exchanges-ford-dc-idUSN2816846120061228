 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. financial exchanges continued to 
wait on Thursday morning for official word on a national day of 
mourning for former President Gerald Ford before announcing 
plans for observing the death of the 38th U.S. president. 

  The exchanges have historically closed on a national day of 
mourning for a former U.S. president, such as on June 11, 2004, 
for former President Ronald Reagan. Official details for the 
mourning of Ford had not been announced by Thursday morning.  "We are waiting for the government to make an official 
executive order and declare a Federal holiday," New York Stock 
Exchange NYX.N spokesman Christiaan Brakman said. "That is 
the appropriate order when you have a presidential ceremony 
that involves many different parties."  President George Bush said on Wednesday that he planned to 
select a national day of mourning for Ford, but did not specify 
a date.  The Nasdaq Stock Market ( NDAQ.O ) and New York Mercantile 
Exchange NMX.N also said they are waiting for official 
details before announcing commemoration plans.  If the exchanges close next week to commemorate Ford, they 
would do so during an already holiday-shortened week with New 
Year's Day on Monday, causing speculation that there may be 
reluctance to close for a second full day.  But Rob Hegarty, managing director at Boston consultant 
TowerGroup, doubts the exchanges would close for less than a 
full day in commemoration of Ford.  "Historically the exchanges close for a full day," he said. 
"This does present a bit of a difficult situation with the New 
Year's holiday but they may not be able to part with that 
tradition."
