 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - IBM and Siemens have won a 7.1 
billion euro ($9.3 billion), 10-year contract to modernize and 
manage the non-military IT systems of Germany's armed forces, 
the two companies said on Thursday. 

  Siemens will receive a 60 percent share of the deal, the 
biggest contract ever won by the German industrial 
conglomerate. U.S. computer services group IBM will receive the 
rest.  Siemens shares rose 1.2 percent to 75.02 euros on the news 
and were the top gainer in a flat German DAX.  The two companies will co-manage the project, jointly 
holding 50.1 percent in the consortium running it. The German 
government holds the remaining 49.9 percent.  Sources close to the process had told Reuters that IBM and 
Siemens, both of whom already work with Germany's armed forces, 
could sign the contracts by the end of the year.  IBM and Siemens said in a statement on Thursday they would 
bring the armed forces' data centers, software, computers, 
telephones and data networks up to the latest standard as part 
of the modernization project, named "Hercules."  Under the German armed forces contract, IBM will be 
responsible for modernizing the data centers, while SBS will 
take care of PCs, servers and phone systems at more than 1,500 
locations around Germany.  The deal is a welcome boost for Siemens' IT unit SBS, which 
is cutting thousands of jobs amid stiff competition. The unit 
made an operating loss of 549 million euros in the fiscal year 
to end-September, on sales of 5.157 billion euros.  The Siemens group, whose products range from trains and 
turbines to light bulbs and hearing aids, made sales of 87.325 
billion euros in 2005/06.
