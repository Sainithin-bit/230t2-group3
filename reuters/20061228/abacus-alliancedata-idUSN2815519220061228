  (Adds financial background, DoubleClick going private) 

 NEW YORK  Dec 28 (Reuters) - Alliance Data Systems Corp.
( ADS.N ), a provider of transaction, credit and marketing
services, said on Thursday its Epsilon unit will buy Abacus
from DoubleClick Inc. for $435 million to provide more services
to the retail and catalog industry.  The price is one-fourth the $1.7 billion DoubleClick paid
for Abacus in 1999, hoping to improve its online marketing by
mining data to predict shoppers' behavior. DoubleClick,
however, soon became a lightning rod for fears about online
privacy.  Abacus provides data, data management and analytical
services to help more than 1,500 marketers, retailers, and
catalog and online merchants attract and retain customers.  Its clients include Brookstone, Patagonia and Sur La Table,
among others. Abacus has offices in Lafayette, Colorado;
Schaumburg, Illinois; and the United Kingdom.  The transaction is Alliance Data's second with DoubleClick
in less than a year. In February, Alliance Data agreed to buy
DoubleClick's Email Solutions unit for about $90 million.  Alliance Data expects the purchase to add to earnings after
2007, and expects to fund it mainly from its existing credit
facility. Abacus' 525 employees will join Epsilon, and the
firm's services will retain the Abacus name.  Alliance Data expects the purchase to close in the first
quarter of 2007 upon regulatory approval. The company and
Epsilon are based in Dallas.  Once an investor favorite amid the dot-com boom,
DoubleClick was taken private last year by San Francisco-based
private equity firm Hellman & Friedman LLC for about $1.1
billion.  Shares of Alliance Data closed on Thursday up 72 cents at
$62.72 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 76
percent this year.
