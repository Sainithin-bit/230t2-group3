 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) said on Thursday it will start building the Yaris subcompact, the smallest car in its product line-up, at a joint venture plant it owns with Guangzhou Automobile Group in China in mid-2008. 

 The Yaris, called Vitz in Japan, will be the second model to be produced at the 200,000 units-a-year plant in southern China, which began building the Camry sedan this May. The world's second-largest auto maker said it would boost its capital in the joint venture, Guangzhou Toyota Motor Co., by $49 million partly to help finance the plan. Toyota is aiming to expand its share of China's passenger car market to 10 percent from the current 4 percent by around 2010 as it plays catch-up to early entrants General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ). The subcompact class, dominated by local brand Chery's Windcloud and Honda Motor Co.'s ( 7267.T ) Fit, makes up about 15 percent of China's passenger car market, where demand for fuel-efficient cars has been growing. Toyota plans to build about 80,000 to 90,000 Vitz cars a year at the Guangzhou plant. Sales of the Camry are set to exceed an initial plan of 50,000 units by 7,000 units this year, Toyota said in the statement. In 2007, it aims to sell 150,000 units of the popular model. With the start of the Vitz production, the factory would reach its maximum capacity of 200,000 units in 2008. Toyota, which also has local joint ventures with China's FAW, has said it expects to have sold 278,000 cars in China this year, up 52 percent from 183,000 units in 2005. Shares of Toyota ended flat at 7,920 yen on Thursday after touching a record high 7,990 yen earlier.
