 (Reuters) - MAF Bancorp Inc. MAFB.O said it expects to record a fourth-quarter charge of 45 cents a share as it is undertaking a balance sheet restructuring. 

 In a statement, the parent company of Mid America Bank said it will sell about $532 million of available-for-sale securities and about $220 million of residential mortgage loans, and will also repay about $498 million of wholesale borrowings. About one-half of this after-tax charge had already been reflected as a reduction in stockholders' equity at September 30 due to the decline in market value of the securities to be sold, it added.
