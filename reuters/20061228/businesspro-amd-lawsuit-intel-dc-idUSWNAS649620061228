 (Reuters) - Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD.N ) 
said a U.S. federal court had overruled Intel Corp.'s ( INTC.O ) 
objections in an ongoing antitrust litigation. 

  The court has ordered Intel to produce documents and other 
evidence bearing upon its "exclusionary conduct" outside United 
States, AMD said in a statement.  (Reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore)
