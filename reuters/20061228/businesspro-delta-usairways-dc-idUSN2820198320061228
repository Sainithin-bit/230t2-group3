 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) has no 
immediate plans to boost or back off from its offer to buy 
Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK, despite the bankrupt carrier's 
resistance, US Airways' chief executive said on Thursday. 

  "We believe our offer is more than fair and don't feel any 
need to amend it at this point," Doug Parker said in comments 
to the Associated Press. "We think this is such a unique 
opportunity that we have an obligation to pursue it and because 
of that obligation we will pursue it."  Company spokesman Phil Gee confirmed the comments.  In November, US Airways offered to buy the No. 3 U.S. 
carrier for $4 billion in cash and 78.5 million shares.  Last week, Delta rejected the bid and presented a 
stand-alone plan that it says values it at $9.4 billion to $12 
billion, topping US Airways' $8.3 billion offer.  US Airways, the No. 7 U.S. carrier, is pressed for time to 
win support from Delta's creditors before Delta exits 
bankruptcy. US Airways needs creditors to push Delta into 
opening up its books so that it can perform due diligence, a 
condition of its offer.  Delta plans to have a hearing on February 7 to begin 
seeking approval from creditors to exit bankruptcy as an 
independent carrier.  At the hearing, Delta's creditors are expected to vote on 
the carrier's disclosure statement, which details its 
restructuring proposal. If the statement is approved, the 
company's creditors will proceed to vote on the restructuring 
proposal. The process could take several weeks.
