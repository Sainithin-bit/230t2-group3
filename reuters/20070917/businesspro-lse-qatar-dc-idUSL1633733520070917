 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qatar's state investment fund 
is close to buying Nasdaq's 31 percent stake in the London 
Stock Exchange Group ( LSE.L ) for just over $5.6 billion, 
newspaper reports said on Sunday. 

  U.S. exchange Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) has put its LSE stake on the 
market to boost its chances of buying Nordic exchange operator 
OMX OMX.ST.  The Sunday Times of London said the Qatar Investment 
Authority's 2.8 billion pound ($5.62 billion) bid is equivalent 
to a 1,400 pence per share. LSE shares closed at 1,397 pence on 
Friday.  The Wall Street Journal reported that the fund was close to 
buying the stake, but said it wasn't clear how much it was 
offering.  The stake will be diluted to 22 percent of the LSE after 
the LSE completes its acquisition of Milan exchange group Borsa 
Italiana, the Wall Street Journal said.  Qatar, for now, isn't looking to buy all of LSE, the WSJ 
reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  The paper added that the Qatar fund may not make the 
purchase alone. It has held talks with other Middle Eastern 
investment funds about taking a junior role, although those 
talks haven't concluded and may not come to anything, the paper 
said.  If such a deal succeeds, it would be the latest investment 
from the Middle East in the UK. State-owned Qatar Investment 
Authority has offered to buy British supermarkets chain J. 
Sainsbury Plc ( SBRY.L ) while State-owned Dubai Ports World 
bought UK-based port operator P&O.  No one was available for comment at the LSE or the Qatar 
Investment Department. Nasdaq declined comment.
