 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Microsoft general counsel Brad Smith said on Monday an EU court ruling upholding a landmark European Commission antitrust decision against the software giant would have an "extraordinary impact". 

 "It gives the Commission quite broad power and quite broad discretion," Smith told reporters. "This decision will occupy the thoughts and discussions of many people in the months and years to follow. It is one of those decisions that has an extraordinary impact." He was speaking after the European Union's Court of First Instance handed a stunning defeat to Microsoft, upholding a 2004 European Commission ruling against it, including a 497 million euro ($689.2 million) fine.
