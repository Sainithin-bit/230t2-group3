 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Mario Monti, who took the European Commission's antitrust action against Microsoft in 2004, said Monday's court ruling upholding the decision vindicated his rejection of a settlement with the company. 

 Monti also praised his successor, European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes, for her determination in carrying through the case. By telephone from Milan, where he is now president of Bocconi University, Monti recalled that before his decision in March 2004 that Microsoft was abusing its market dominance, Microsoft President Steve Ballmer visited him in Brussels and offered a settlement. "Although I was very tempted, I did not agree on the settlement proposed by Mr Ballmer," Monti said. Had Monti agreed to the deal the Commission would have lost control of new issues that could arise the in future, he said at the time. Less than one week after turning down the settlement idea, the landmark decision was issued. A deal would have been "a nice way out, much less risky for the Commission" but would have failed to provide legal certainty, he said. Monti said the precedent set by the ruling in the Court of First Instance (CFI) on Monday empowered the European Commission to act more quickly in the future. Some critics have said the ruling comes too late. The Commission acknowledges that Microsoft's tactics long ago eliminated most of the competition that the Commission decision of 2004 meant to promote. But the legal certainty generated by the ruling is necessary for the Commission to act as new instances of abuse of dominance arise in the high-tech industry, Monti said. Even if Microsoft appeals, he said, there is still much more legal certainty than before. The Italian was strong in his praise of Kroes. "She displayed remarkable, continuing determination and vigor in pursuing the implementation of the decision", he said. But the decision is also a vindication for Monti's leadership. Monti rebuilt the confidence of his department after court setbacks in 2002, and the CFI also backed his decision to turn down a merger of General Electric and Honeywell. During his time in Brussels, Monti sponsored a major overhaul of the antitrust and merger rules. Monti said although the European Union approach diverges from the views of the Justice Department of President George W. Bush, it matches those of the Justice Department under former President Bill Clinton. Clinton's Justice Department successfully won a major Sherman Act antitrust suit against Microsoft but the Bush administration accepted weak remedies that several states recently criticized as ineffective. Monti noted that there is no similar divergence between the states of the EU and Brussels, because the European Commission has clear authority in the matter.
