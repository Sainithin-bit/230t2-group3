 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - A spokesman for European Commissioner Neelie Kroes clarified her remarks on Microsoft on Monday, saying abuse of a dominant market position, rather than dominance itself, is against the law. 

 A European Union court backed the European Commission's landmark 2004 antitrust ruling against the software giant earlier in the day. After that, Kroes said she hoped to see a lowering of Microsoft's 95 percent market share. "Clearly, holding a dominant market position is not a problem under antitrust law. Abuse of that dominance is," said spokesman Jonathan Todd. He said what Kroes meant was that "once the illegal abuse has been removed and competitors are free to compete on the merits, the logical consequence of that would be to expect Microsoft's market share to fall".
