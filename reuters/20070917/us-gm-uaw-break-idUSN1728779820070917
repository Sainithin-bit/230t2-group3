 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and the United Auto Workers union called a break in contract negotiations after about 16 hours on Monday with both sides agreeing to return to the bargaining table later in the day. 

 The two sides adjourned talks just before 3 a.m. EDT, GM spokesman Tom Wickham said. Negotiators will return to work later on Monday, he said. The UAW has agreed to extend its contract with the top U.S. automaker on an hour-to-hour basis as talks continue and around 73,000 GM factory workers prepare to return to work on Monday.
