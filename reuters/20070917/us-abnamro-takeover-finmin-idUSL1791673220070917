 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - A Royal Bank of Scotland-led ( RBS.L ) consortium will be given Dutch Finance Ministry approval later on Monday for its bid to take over Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS, a source close to the deal said. 

 The Dutch ministry approved Barclays' rival bid for ABN last month and is expected to set similar conditions, the source said, adding he did not expect any deal-breakers. "We have been in intensive discussions over the last week, just as we have been with the European Commission, which asked for a couple of remedies. I think we are on course," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I think it will be a 'yes' with conditions similar in nature to the conditions for Barclays," he said. Asked if he expected any show-stoppers: "No, I don't think so." He said he had not seen the text of the Dutch decision. RBS, Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis FOR.BR, and Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) launched a rival bid for ABN AMRO, which they plan to carve up between them.
