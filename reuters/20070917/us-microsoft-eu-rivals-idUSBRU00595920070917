 LUXEMBOURG  (Reuters) - An EU court ruling confirming Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) had abused its near-monopoly in computer operating systems sets the principles for the company's behavior, a lawyer for Microsoft's rivals said on Monday. 

 The Court of First Instance upheld a landmark 2004 European Commission antitrust decision that the software giant had abused its 95 percent share of the market in personal computer operating systems to elbow aside and damage smaller rivals. "This decision establishes principles for the behavior of this company. Microsoft should now finally comply with the Commission decision on operability," lawyer Thomas Vinje said.
