 (Reuters) - RTI International Metals Inc ( RTI.N ) entered into a supplemental agreement with Airbus ( EAD.PA ) for the long-term supply of titanium mill products, valued in excess of $1.1 billion, the titanium producer said Monday. 

 The agreement supplements the earlier deal announced in 2006 and would start in 2010 and run through 2020, said RTI, a long-standing supplier for the European plane maker. RTI will supply a guaranteed minimum of 45 million pounds of titanium mill products over the term of the agreement, the company said, adding the products support the manufacture of Airbus planes, including the largest passenger aircraft A380. The Niles, Ohio-based company also said it would build a titanium sponge facility in Hamilton, Mississippi, for a projected cost of $300 million, in addition to a previously announced $100 million facilities expansion. The facility, which will begin operations in 2010, would support the new Airbus agreement as well as the recent $2 billion contract extension with Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ) for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.
