 LONDON  (Reuters) - French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde is an "outstanding candidate" to head the International Monetary Fund, her British counterpart said on Saturday. 

 "We support her because she's the best person for the job, but I also personally think it would be a very good thing to see the first female managing director of the IMF in its 60-year history," Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne said in a statement. "She's shown real international leadership as chair of the G20 finance ministers this year. She has also been a strong advocate for countries tackling high budget deficits and living within their means," he added. (Reporting by  Olesya Dmitracova )
