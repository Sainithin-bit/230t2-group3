 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) said on Monday it planned to buy back up to 4 billion Swiss francs ($4.4 billion) in outstanding securities in a bid to comply with the new Swiss and Basel III global capital adequacy rules. 
 The tender was for public Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments, Credit Suisse said. "Credit Suisse continues to take a proactive approach to satisfy the new capital requirements, aimed at transitioning its capital structure well in advance of the required implementation dates," Chief Financial Officer David Mathers said in a statement. As part of the Swiss government's tough new capital rules, flagship banks UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Credit Suisse, whose balance sheets are several times the size of the Swiss economy, have begun to issue loss-absorbing forms of capital, including contingent convertible bonds, or CoCos, which turn into shares if the issuer hits trouble. Credit Suisse has already issued 6 billion Swiss francs of CoCos to existing shareholders and a further $2 billion of CoCos publicly. (Reporting by  Catherine Bosley ; Editing by Will Waterman)
