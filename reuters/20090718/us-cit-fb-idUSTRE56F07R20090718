 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ), a lender to hundreds of thousands of small and mid-sized U.S. businesses, is struggling to stay afloat after bailout talks with the government ended. 

 Here are a few facts about the company, which is now fighting to stave off bankruptcy: * The company was founded in St Louis in 1908 and first sold stock to the public in 1924. * Tyco International agreed to buy CIT for about $10 billion in 2001 but was forced to spin it off to shareholders a year later as Tyco struggled with a massive debt burden from such acquisitions. * The commercial lender has more than $60 billion in finance and leasing assets and boasted on its website that 1 million business customers depended on it for financing. * CIT, a Fortune 500 company that is a member of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, closed at $1.64 on Wednesday, down from over $60 in June 2007. * CIT Group, which had been based in Livingston, New Jersey, moved to a brand new, 28-story, glass-encased tower on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue in New York in April 2006.
