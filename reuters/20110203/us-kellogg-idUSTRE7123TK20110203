 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kellogg Co ( K.N ) raised its sales view for 2011, suggesting that the world's largest breakfast cereal company may be turning its ailing business around. 

 Kellogg, whose brands include Apple Jacks and Corn Pops, had a rough year in 2010 due to a recall of millions of boxes of its cereal, deep discounting across the industry, higher raw material costs and a lack of new products. While it still expects a difficult operating environment this year, Kellogg raised its 2011 net sales forecast to an increase of 3 percent to 4 percent. It had earlier forecast 2011 sales to rise at a low single-digit percentage rate, in line with its long-term target. "We expect significantly better topline performance in 2011 due to increased pricing and a very strong innovation pipeline," said John Bryant, who became Kellogg's chief executive officer in January. "We started to see a gradual improvement in our business in the fourth quarter." Kellogg also affirmed its full-year forecast calling for earnings per share to rise at a low single-digit rate. Shares in the company rose 3.2 percent. Kellogg said it expects cost inflation of about 7 percent this year, with cost savings offsetting about 4 percentage points of that. The company is also about 80 percent hedged on commodities for 2011 and said it has increased prices on many of its products to offset rising costs for ingredients such as grains and sugar. The forecast, along with solid fourth-quarter results, represent "a sign of stabilization and somewhat of a turn, which is a welcome change relative to the last two or three quarters at Kellogg," said James Tierney, chief investment officer of WP Stewart, which has $1.7 billion in assets under management. Tierney does not currently own shares of Kellogg but has in the past. Kellogg said its fourth-quarter net income was $189 million, or 51 cents per share, up from $176 million, or 46 cents per share, a year earlier and in line with analysts' average estimate. Sales fell to $2.86 billion from $2.90 billion a year earlier, slightly ahead of the $2.85 billion forecast by Wall Street, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Kellogg shares rose $1.62 to $51.98 in late morning trading. (Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by Dave Zimmerman)
