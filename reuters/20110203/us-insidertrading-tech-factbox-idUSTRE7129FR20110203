 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday charged six expert network consultants and employees with insider trading, marking the latest expansion of the government's probe into insider trading. The SEC's complaint disclosed new information about companies whose securities allegedly were subject to insider trading. 

 Here's a look at some of the publicly traded companies tied to the scandal. * Marvell Technology Group Ltd Winifred Jiau, who was arrested in December, is accused of providing confidential information about Marvell's public earnings announcements for the first and second quarters of fiscal 2008 to hedge funds, which traded on the information, according to a criminal complaint. The complaint said she gave hedge fund portfolio managers specific quarterly revenue and gross margin figures as well as earnings per share figures. * Nvidia Corp Jiau is accused of providing detailed information on Nvidia's second-quarter earnings announcement in 2008, including a specific revenue number and information about a stock buyback. Nvidia spokesman Hector Marinez said Jiau was a contractor at Nvidia before leaving the firm about a year ago. * Flextronics International In 2009, Walter Shimoon, a senior director of business development, allegedly told a hedge fund about plans for the iPad. Flextronics supplied camera and charger components to Apple Inc for its iPhone and iPod, according to an earlier complaint. Shimoon, who participated in contract negotiations with Apple, placed calls to hedge funds on his cellphone, prosecutors said. In those calls, some of which investigators said they monitored, he talked about sales figures for iPods and iPhones, and said the upcoming iPhone would have two cameras. In November 2009, Shimoon told a hedge fund employee, "that would really suck if you recorded all the calls." * Research In Motion Former Flextronics employee Shimoon also allegedly passed on non-public information in 2008, saying that the wireless device company was expecting its guidance to double year over year for the next few years, as well as information about its orders for a new phone Flextronics was involved in making. * Omnivision Shimoon, the former Flextronics employee, also allegedly gave hedge funds non-public information about the California-based technology company, which supplies miniature cameras to Apple, which they traded on. Shimoon projected Omnivision might double its sales to Apple in 2010 based on material non-public information about Apple's new iPhone, U.S. securities regulators claim. * Dell Inc A former Dell global supply manager, Daniel DeVore, pleaded guilty to wire fraud and conspiracy charges on December 10. Court documents show that he passed on information about the company's sales figures and purchasing information. Dell said DeVore was no longer with the company. * Advanced Micro Devices Inc A supply chain manager, Anthony Longoria, allegedly gave out revenue information, average sales prices, product sales figures and gross margin information to an unidentified hedge fund. He received some top-line revenue numbers on the chipmaker from a friend who worked in AMD's finance department. He leaked the tips to Richard Choo-Beng Lee, a hedge fund manager who has been cooperating with the investigators. * Western Digital The SEC claims that former Dell employee DeVore disclosed non-public information about the volume of Dell's purchases from the California based hard-drive maker. * Seagate The SEC alleged that DeVore also disclosed the volume of Dell's purchases from the Dublin, Ireland-based hard drive maker to an expert network employee. Dell was a key client of the company at the time and that information was not available through public sources, according to the SEC. * Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co A manager, Manosha Karunatilaka, provided product sales and shipping information to hedge funds and financial analysts, according to complaints. He also allegedly provided semiconductor orders data. (Compiled by Emily Chasan. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
