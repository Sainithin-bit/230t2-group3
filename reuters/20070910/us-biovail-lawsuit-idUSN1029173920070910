 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Biovail Corp. BVF.TO has agreed to drop a former Banc of America Securities analyst and the bank itself from a group of nearly two dozen parties the drugmaker is accusing of conspiring to drive down its stock price, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 Canada's biggest publicly traded drugmaker will drop analyst David Maris and the Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) unit from the racketeering case filed in New Jersey state court last year, this person said. A Biovail spokesman declined to comment. A Bank of America spokesman, Scott Silvestri, said the bank does not comment on pending litigation. The news was first reported in Monday's editions of the New York Post. The report said that Biovail had also agreed to pay Banc of America Securities $2 million in legal fees, citing a person familiar with the proceedings. In its lawsuit, Biovail contended that its share price was sabotaged by hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors, research firm Gradient Analysts and other analysts who it said conspired to produce unflattering reports. The lawsuit sought $4.6 billion in damages. SAC, Gradient and Banc of America Securities have all said previously said that Biovail's accusations are false. Banc of America Securities decided to end its research coverage of Biovail soon after the lawsuit was filed, saying it needed to focus on its defense of the litigation. Biovail has been hounded by concerns about its financial bookkeeping since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission launched an inquiry into its accounting in 2003. The investigation surrounds a company warning of a revenue shortfall in the third quarter of 2003, an October 2003 truck accident involving the company's Wellbutrin antidepressant and its disclosure of the accident's impact on 2003 earnings. The company is also being investigated by federal prosecutors about similar matters. (Additional reporting by Scott Anderson in Toronto and  Lewis Krauskopf  in New York)
