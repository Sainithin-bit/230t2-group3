 PARIS  (Reuters) - Capgemini ( CAPP.PA ), Europe's largest computer consultancy, said on Monday it would partner U.S. software group Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) in supporting the Google Apps software package. 

 Capgemini said partnering with Google would enable the company to extend its portfolio of desktop solutions and help it support more office staff. "Incorporating Google Apps Premier Edition into our offering is yet one more way that we are helping our clients adopt technological innovations within a robust and tested framework," Capgemini global outsourcing chief executive Paul Spence said in a statement. The Google Apps package includes Google's Email service Gmail and word processor, spreadsheet and business presentation software. Google's development of the package is part of its strategy to diversify away from its core businesses of Internet searches and advertising.
