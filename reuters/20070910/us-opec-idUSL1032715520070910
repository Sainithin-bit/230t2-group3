 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states back a token rise in OPEC oil output in a gesture to consumer nations worried by the economic impact of $76 oil and rapidly diminishing stocks, an OPEC source said on Monday. 

 The source was speaking after an informal meeting of the oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in Vienna and after U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman told reporters in Florida he had encouraged OPEC to hike production. OPEC's 12 members will meet on Tuesday to set oil supplies for the peak winter demand season. An increase of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd) would placate consumer nations without flooding the market and causing a price collapse. But such a plan may struggle to win support from members including Iran and Venezuela that take a more hawkish price view. "They favor a small increase," the source said of the Gulf Arab states. "But if they meet stiff resistance, they may just drop the idea." The ministers themselves declined comment. Libya was swift to voice its opposition. "I don't think an increase is needed," said Shokri Ghanem, the head of Libya's OPEC delegation. "We think there is enough oil in the market," he added. OPEC, pumping some 30 million barrels per day into the 86 million bpd global market, is trying to make sense of conflicting economic data ahead of Tuesday's meeting. Industrialized consumer nations are forecasting their crude oil stocks will fall to the bottom of the five-year average range by January unless OPEC pumps more crude oil, and fast. U.S. crude oil is above $76, close to its August 1 record high of $78.77 a barrel. But uncertainty over the U.S. economy -- last month employers cut jobs for the first time in four years -- has cast doubt over oil demand growth in the world's top consumer. The views of the Gulf states, particularly the world's biggest exporter Saudi Arabia, are key to OPEC policy decisions. They straddle more than half of OPEC's proven oil reserves and have almost all the organization's spare production capacity. GESTURE A small rise would unwind some of the 1.7 million bpd of cuts agreed since Oct 2006 without making a ripple. The 10 OPEC states subject to restraint are already pumping nearly 1.0 million bpd above their 25.8 million bpd limit. "The impact of any decision seems marginalized by physical production already above official output limits," Citigroup analysts noted. The position adopted by the Gulf Arab states marked a shift for most. The ministers of Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates had all said on arrival that crude oil supplies were ample. Some said they were concerned credit turmoil stemming from U.S. subprime loans might hit the real economy. "Kuwait is inclined to keep the output level without change while monitoring the market continuously," acting Kuwaiti Oil Minister Mohammad al-Olaim said earlier on Monday. Demand forecasts for the final quarter of the year point to an increase of up to 2.0 million bpd. At the top end, the International Energy Agency sees consumption rising to 88.1 million bpd. OPEC puts the figure at 87.08 million bpd. U.S. Secretary of Energy Sam Bodman told reporters in Florida he had encouraged OPEC to increase supplies. "They heard. They were courteous," he said. The IEA's executive director, Nobuo Tanaka, said he believed extra oil would be needed in coming months. "We think that the current market is very tight," Tanaka said at a news conference in Berlin.
