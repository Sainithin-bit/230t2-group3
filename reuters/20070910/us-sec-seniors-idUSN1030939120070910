 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - More than a third of "free lunch" investment seminars targeting U.S. seniors may involve unsuitable recommendations or outright fraud, securities regulators say. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators conducted a study of the educational seminars, 100 percent of which were sales presentations, many with claims such as "Immediately add $100,000 to your net worth" and "How $100K can pay 1 Million Dollars to Your Heirs." The SEC released the report ahead of its second annual Seniors Summit on Monday to combat investment fraud and abusive sales practices against older U.S. investors. "The SEC and our fellow regulators intend to put a stop to this," said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox in a statement. "We will step in whenever false claims are being made. We will sanction crooks who try to feast on the life savings of older investors." At the summit, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced two regulatory sweeps designed to protect older investors, including one that would target early retirement seminars conducted by securities firms. FINRA said that some of these seminars are specifically designed to get older workers to liquidate their retirement funds and invest them with a specific firm or representative. The other regulatory sweep will examine brokers' use of professional titles such as "senior specialist" and "retirement advisor" that indicate an expertise in financial services for seniors but require no meaningful training or specialized knowledge. FINRA said it would examine whether the titles are used to mislead and defraud investors and would then consider rulemaking on the use of the designations. The regulators said in their report that 50 percent of the investment seminars featured exaggerated or misleading advertising claims and that 59 percent were weakly supervised by financial services firms. The report also said 23 percent involved possibly unsuitable recommendations, such as illiquid investments recommended to older Americans with a short-term need for cash. Further, it said 13 percent of the seminars appeared to be fraudulent and have been referred to the most appropriate regulator for possible enforcement or disciplinary action. The report recommends that financial services firms supervise the sales seminars more closely and review the suitability of the investment recommendations to seniors. It also recommends more education for seniors about the "free lunch" seminars and their sales role. The SEC worked with FINRA and state securities regulators in conducting the examinations between April 2006 and June 2007 in areas with large retiree populations, including Florida, California, Texas, Arizona, North Carolina, Alabama and South Carolina. "With almost 8 out of 10 seniors being targeted with these tactics, the findings underscore a true need for increased educational and enforcement efforts," said FINRA Chief Executive Mary Schapiro in a statement. FINRA was created in July from the merger of the National Association of Securities Dealers and the New York Stock Exchange's member regulation, enforcement and arbitration operations.
