 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said on Monday that financial turmoil had "appreciably" increased risks facing the U.S. economy, but other Fed officials said it was unclear if the economy had taken a turn for the worse. 

 "I see significant downward pressure based on recent data indicating further weakening in the housing sector and the tightening of financial markets," Yellen told an economic conference in San Francisco. Fed policy-makers gather on September 18 to consider interest rate policy. Economists widely expect the central bank to cut the benchmark federal funds rate, with some arguing a surprise drop in employment in August, revealed in a report on Friday, justifies a hefty half-percentage point move. The Fed has held the bellwether overnight rate at 5.25 percent since June 2006. Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said the weak jobs data, which showed the economy lost 4,000 jobs in August and was weaker than earlier thought in June and July as well, should be evaluated in tandem with strong retail sales. "Employment data certainly are very important, and clearly have to be taken very seriously," Lockhart told a business group in Atlanta as he stepped back from an assertion he made on Thursday that data had not provided conclusive signs that housing problems were spilling over into the broader economy. Still, he suggested he had yet to be convinced the case for aggressive rate cuts had been made. Similarly, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, speaking in Laredo, Texas, said the U.S. economy still seemed sound despite a tightening of credit conditions related to rising defaults in the U.S. mortgage market for borrowers with poor credit histories. "Our economy appears to be weathering the storm thus far. The future path of that storm and the appropriate policy course, however, are still to be determined," he said, giving a relatively upbeat assessment based on his business contacts. "I am encouraged by what I have heard against a background of constant negative speculation and the occasional discordant note, such as last week's employment numbers," Fisher said. JOBS NOT THE ONLY STORY A Reuters poll after Friday's jobs report showed all but one of the so-called primary dealers -- firms that deal directly with the Fed in trading U.S. government securities -- expect the central bank to lower borrowing costs next week. Of those polled, 15 expected a quarter-point reduction, while four saw a relatively unusual half-point move. However, two of firms in the quarter-point camp -- Deutsche Bank and Citigroup -- said on Monday they now felt a half-point cut was more likely. Traders in the bond market also saw increasing chances of aggressive rate cuts and they pushed prices of U.S. debt higher, building on hefty gains made on Friday. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell as far as 4.30 percent, their lowest since early 2006. But Fed officials noted the jobs data was not the only signal on the soundness of the U.S. economy, which had been pronounced healthy outside of housing by a number of officials last week -- not just Lockhart. Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser told Bloomberg in an interview published on Sunday that the surprising decline in employment was "not encouraging," but that in itself, it may not merit lowering interest rates. "We want to be careful not to overweight one piece of information," he said. Fed policy-makers indicated consumer spending, which makes up roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy, would be key to the economic outlook. Yellen said declining home prices could hurt consumer spending and warned that risks to economic growth would be "significant" if housing prices were to continue falling in the context of rising unemployment. "The key point is that ... a drop in house prices is likely to restrain consumer spending to some extent," she said. Yellen, Fisher, Lockhart and Plosser are not voting members of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee this year. Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin was scheduled to speak on the economic outlook later on Monday. Members of the Fed's Board of Governors always have a vote on rates.
