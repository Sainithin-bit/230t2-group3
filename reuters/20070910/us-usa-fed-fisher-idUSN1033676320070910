 LAREDO, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher on Monday said the U.S. economy appears to be weathering troubles in housing and financial markets, but it was uncertain how things will play out. 

 "Our economy appears to be weathering the storm thus far. The future path of that storm and the appropriate policy course, however, are still to be determined," Fisher said in remarks to a community forum. His comments come after a report on Friday showed the U.S. economy shed jobs outside of the farming sector during August, the first decline in four years. However, the Dallas Fed president cautioned against placing too much weight on the employment data, saying he has not concluded from his study of the evidence that recent financial market turbulence has hurt the broader economy. "I ... have not yet reached any conclusions," he said. "However, it is fair to say that I am encouraged by what I have heard against a background of constant negative speculation and the occasional discordant note, such as last week's employment numbers," Fisher said. The Dallas Fed bank president also said he continues to weigh how much damage the housing downturn has done to the broader economy. He also said he believes inflation is coming under control, although he added that he would like to see an inflation gauge used by the Dallas Fed -- the trimmed mean personal consumption expenditures (PCE) -- drop lower. "I personally see marginal improvement," he said after speaking. Fisher, who is not a voting member this year on the Fed's interest rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, said new regulations would be more likely to resolve troubles stemming from the subprime mortgage lending boom than policy moves by the central bank. He added that it was not the Fed's job to protect risk takers. "I do not believe the Federal Reserve's job is to protect specific risk takers who failed to protect themselves from potential downside wounds," he said. "The Federal Reserve's job is to protect the system itself." "In my humble opinion, the standard tools of monetary policy are insufficient, by themselves, to deal with the subprime market fallout," he added. He emphasized the goal of the Fed is to achieve long-term, noninflationary economic growth. "I set aside the passions of the moment and the conventional wisdom in the markets and keep a steady focus on the Fed's mission," he said. "Conducting monetary policy is not a popularity contest." Financial market participants widely expect the Fed to cut interest rates at the Federal Open Market Committee's next meeting on September 18 to protect the economy from a sharp housing market downturn and related strains in credit markets. Some economists are predicting a hefty half-percentage point reduction in the Fed's benchmark federal funds rate, currently at 5.25 percent.
