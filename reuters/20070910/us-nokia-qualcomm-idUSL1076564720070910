 HELSINKI/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission on Monday opened a hearing in a case in which U.S. chip maker Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) accused Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) of infringing some of its patents in cellphones using the GSM technology. 

 Nokia said it was confident its products did not infringe on Qualcomm patents in the case. Hearings at the ITC are scheduled to take place during the next two weeks. ITC, which hears disputes on trade, patent and copyright issues, said on its Internet site it aims to reach decision by March 12, 2008. The two companies have been wrangling over a key cross-licensing agreement over technology patents that expired in April 2007, and their battle is worrying investors and the industry on both sides of the Atlantic. Analysts estimate Nokia has paid Qualcomm around $500 million per year and now aims to get a better deal. Nokia says its patent portfolio is much stronger now than 15 years ago when the original cross-licensing deal was signed. Qualcomm filed the case alleging Nokia products infringe six of its patents in GSM technology, which is the world's most widely used wireless technology standard. Qualcomm later withdraw three patents from claim. "We look forward to proving that the claims regarding the three remaining patents have no more merit than those already withdrawn by Qualcomm," Nokia's Chief Legal Officer Carl Belding said in a statement. In June, the ITC ruled that Qualcomm infringed a Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) patent, and banned imports of some new advanced cell phones using Qualcomm's chips. Shares in Nokia were 1.9 percent higher at 25.06 euros by 9:30 a.m. EDT in Helsinki, while Qualcomm stock opened 0.9 percent lower at $37.55.
