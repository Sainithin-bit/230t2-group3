 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank Dennis Lockhart on Monday stepped back from his assertion last week that housing woes had so far not clearly affected the broader economy, but said weak jobs data should be evaluated in tandem with strong retail sales. 

 "Friday's data ... show employment was beginning to soften back in June. This news should be evaluated with recently positive reports in retail sales," Lockhart told a business group. On Thursday, Lockhart had said he had not seen data providing conclusive signs that housing problems were spilling over into the broader economy. Lockhart amended his remarks on Monday to say he is now processing new information and other timely data as he prepares for the U.S. central bank's September 18 rate-setting meeting. Lockhart's speech otherwise closely paralleled remarks he made September 6. The government reported on Friday that U.S. nonfarm payrolls shrank by 4,000 jobs in August, the first fall in four years, raising expectations the Fed would need to cut its benchmark federal funds rate. However, in a sign consumer spending remained resilient despite the housing market downturn and financial market turbulence, major retailers turned in better-than-expected August sales.
