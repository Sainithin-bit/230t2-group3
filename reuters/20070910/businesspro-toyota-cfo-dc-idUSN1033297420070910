 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) should hit 
its target of 5-percent U.S. sales growth this year despite a 
recent slowdown and building concerns about the knock-on effect 
of the subprime mortgage crisis, the automaker's chief 
financial officer said on Monday. 

  "Sales were down in August but that was also compared to a 
very good month the year before," Toyota Executive Vice 
President and Chief Financial Officer Mitsuo Kinoshita said.  "We were at 5-percent growth on a year-to-date basis in 
August, and I believe we can meet our full-year sales target if 
we work at it," he said.  Kinoshita, who was speaking to financial analysts and 
reporters at an event hosted by Toyota, also said the Japanese 
automaker was considering investment in more production 
capacity in China to keep pace with expected sales gains in 
that market.  "We are not yet in a position to say anything, but we would 
like to increase our production capacity in China and are 
currently studying that," Kinoshita said in response to a 
question.  (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
