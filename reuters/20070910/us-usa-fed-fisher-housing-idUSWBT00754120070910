 LAREDO, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Monday that he has yet to conclude how severely the U.S. housing slump may have affected the rest of the economy. 

 "When the housing sector turns down, there is a ripple effect through the rest of the economy," Fisher said in response to questions after a speech. "The degree of severity of that effect, I, personally, am still trying to figure out."
