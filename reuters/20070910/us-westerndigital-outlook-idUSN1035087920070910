 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Western Digital Corp WDC.N, the world's second-largest computer disk-drive maker, boosted its fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue forecast on Monday due to improved demand, pricing and product mix. 

 The shares rose 2.4 percent in extended trading following the new outlook after closing up 4 cents at $22.41 in New York Stock Exchange trading. Western Digital said it now expects earnings of 61 cents to 65 cents per share, for the quarter ending September 28, excluding the impact of the acquisition of Komag Inc. The company said on July 26 it expected first-quarter earnings before items of 43 cents to 47 cents per share. Western Digital also increased its first-quarter revenue forecast to between $1.6 billion to $1.65 billion and its gross profit margin to about 17.5 percent, compared with an earlier forecast of revenue of $1.45 billion to $1.5 billion and gross margin of 15.5 percent to 16 percent. Analysts, on average, were expecting Western Digital to report first-quarter earnings before items of 48 cents and revenue of $1.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, based in Lake Forest, California, increased its forecast after Seagate Technology STX.N, the world's largest disk-drive maker, last month significantly raised its fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue projections, also citing stronger-than-expected demand, higher product prices and a better product mix.
