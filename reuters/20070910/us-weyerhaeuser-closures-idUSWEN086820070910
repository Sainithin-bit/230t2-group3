 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Weyerhaeuser Co ( WY.N ), one of the world's largest paper and lumber companies, said on Monday that weak market conditions would probably force it to close plants and trim operations at its wood products business, which serves the housing and construction industries. 

 Weyerhaeuser said in a U.S. regulatory filing that the market for wood products had not improved in the third quarter and would probably result in closures, curtailments and restricted operations at its wood products facilities. Shares of Weyerhaeuser, which operates in 18 countries, showed only modest weakness, dipping less than 1 percent to $66.77 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock had tumbled 25 percent from mid-July to mid-August, but has hovered between about $66 and $69 since then. "It's not exactly news that the housing markets are soft, and the company is in mode of taking downtime," said Paul Latta, director of research at investment services firm McAdams Wright Ragan in Seattle. Weak housing markets across the United States have dampened demand for wood products over the past several months, and comments from upscale home builder Hovnanian Enterprises ( HOV.N ) last week indicate market players do not expect a rebound in the near term. However, Weyerhaeuser said that markets in cellulose fibers, container board, packaging and recycling have continued to improve. Last month, the Federal Way, Washington-based company posted an 11 percent decline in second-quarter sales from a year earlier and said the weak U.S. housing market had hurt prices at its wood products business. Weyerhaeuser had said at the time it expected that business, which contributes about 36 percent of the company's revenue, to post a smaller loss in the current quarter than the $123 million loss in the second quarter, as prices for oriented strand board and cost decreases offset weakness for softwood lumber and engineered wood products. Latta said the credit markets and home lending markets had deteriorated since the company posted its second-quarter earnings. "My gut feeling is ... results in the third quarter will effectively look the same as they were in the second quarter," Latta said. (Reporting by  Matt Daily  and Ed Leefeldt)
