 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart on Monday said the U.S. central bank has to take jobs data very serious, adding that policy-makers are also watching consumer behavior closely. 

 "Employment data certainly are very important, and clearly have to be taken very seriously. The other set of data that we are watching carefully ... is the consumer spending data," Lockhart told a business group in answer to a question. "Even small changes in consumer sentiment resulting from either direct impact on households of the housing-related issues, or just conceivably caution coming into household thinking ... all of that can add up to a change in consumer sentiment," he added.
