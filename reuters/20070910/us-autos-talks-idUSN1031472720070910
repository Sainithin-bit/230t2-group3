 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) are likely to establish a trust fund for health care costs that would be administered by the United Auto Workers union, JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said on Monday. 

 The Voluntary Employee Benefit Association deal, modeled after one adopted by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.N, would be funded at 60 cents to 70 cents on the dollar, Patel said in a research note. "We continue to believe a (Goodyear)-style healthcare VEBA deal is likely, and our conversations with industry sources suggest that Ford, contrary to public perception, is as eager as GM in clinching a VEBA deal," Patel said. All three Detroit-based automakers headed into contract talks with the UAW that began in late July, looking to cut the spiraling health care costs they blame for undercutting their competitiveness against Japanese rivals. The current labor contract expires on Friday. Patel said "the lack of public UAW rhetoric" during these talks is a positive sign. Executives at all three Detroit-based automakers and Cerberus had expressed interest in exploring the idea of setting up the UAW-run trust fund before talks began with the union. Officials at Ford and Chrysler did not immediately return phone calls seeking comment. GM and UAW declined to comment. The model for the automakers has been the ground-breaking deal reached last year by Goodyear and the United Steel Workers union. In exchange for an upfront payment of $1 billion, Goodyear funded a USW-aligned trust and stepped away from $1.2 billion of liabilities stemming from health care costs of 30,000 current and future union retirees. "The more difficult question for us to answer regarding a VEBA deal is whether the UAW will accept partial equity payment," Patel said. "A refusal by the UAW to take equity could be partly mitigated from a credit-rating perspective by the public issuance of equity-linked/convertible securities." The overall health care obligations for the automakers are huge. GM's underfunding for U.S. retiree health and life insurance benefits stood at $47.4 billion at the end of 2006 and Ford's at $25.9 billion. Chrysler has about $17 billion of unfunded health care obligations, according to previous disclosures. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
