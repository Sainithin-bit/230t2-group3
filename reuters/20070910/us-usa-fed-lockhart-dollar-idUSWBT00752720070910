 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart on Monday said he is not overly worried that foreign investors will dramatically shed dollars because doing so would hurt their own interests. 

 "I think the concern for a dollar sell-off is exaggerated," he said in response to questions after a speech. "If you are a central bank and if you are selling, a little bit of activity would conceivably shoot yourself in the foot by driving rates down."
