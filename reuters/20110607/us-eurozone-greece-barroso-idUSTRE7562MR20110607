 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - There is a risk that the depending crisis in Greece will affect Ireland's ability to return to financial markets next year, the president of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, said on Tuesday. 

 "We have seen in the past that, in fact, sometimes the markets react not only to a situation in one country, but they make some kind of generalization, and so in fact some risks exist," Barroso told reporters. "That's an additional reason to work with our partners in Greece, for them to, of course, go ahead with the necessary reforms and the fiscal consolidation efforts."
