 BRATISLAVA  (Reuters) - Slovakia would not consider approving fresh aid for Greece unless it came with guarantees that private sector investors would bear part of the burden, its finance minister said on Tuesday. 

 German newspaper Handelsblatt earlier cited an EU official as saying that resistance from Slovakia meant finance ministers would likely not be able to approve a new Greek package on June 20. A senior Slovak government source close to negotiations told Reuters that report was not correct. "We cannot block the debate (on the second Greek aid) if it goes within the EFSF (temporary rescue fund)," Miklos later told reporters. "The problem is serious and the situation in Greece has no good solution. We honor our commitment and the rules of the game." But a new deal would have to be bound by strict conditions including private sector participation in any debt rollover and a political consensus within Greece on compliance with the aid program, he said. Plans for a second bailout are taking shape, with a proposal for a three-year package worth 80 to 100 billion euros set to be ready in the next two weeks, euro zone official sources told Reuters in Brussels. Handelsblatt said Germany wanted the new package to be financed via the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) since it could then avoid a potentially precarious parliamentary vote. The EFSF has an effective lending capacity of 250 billion euros, but EU leaders are expected to boost that to 440 billion euros later in June. Slovakia refused to participate in the first, 110 billion euro ($161 billion) rescue of Greece last year, accusing its richer euro zone peer of profligacy. But the euro area's second poorest state did sign up for the EFSF -- established to bail out subsequent victims of the region's debt crisis -- and could in theory block any payments to Greece from that fund. "Political will (in Greece) to fulfill the first package is questionable, therefore it is logical there is a need for tougher guarantees in the new program," Miklos said. "A ... condition (in the second aid) should be private sector participation, at least via a debt rollover." If approved by euro zone governments, the new package will consist of revenue from three sources: sales of Greek state assets, a rollover of Greek debt by private sector creditors, and fresh funds from the EFSF and the International Monetary Fund, the euro zone sources told Reuters. But key aspects of the scheme, including how to persuade private sector investors to participate, have not been resolved. (Reporting by Martin Santa; Editing by John Stonestreet)
