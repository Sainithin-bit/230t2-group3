 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL is setting up a A$4 billion ($3.1 billion) joint venture with Australia's Seven Network Ltd. SEV.AX in TV, magazines and online businesses, marking the U.S. group's first foray into Australia's media sector. 

 Shares in Australia's second-ranked TV broadcaster, controlled by media mogul Kerry Stokes, soared 17 percent to a record high of A$12.41 and closed up 12 percent at A$11.80, giving the group a market value of A$2.6 billion. KKR is the third major private equity group to grab a piece of the Australian media industry following the passage of a law easing restrictions on foreign and cross-ownership of newspapers, radio and TV stations. The move cashes up Seven for takeovers next year, when the law comes into effect allowing owners of one media platform -- newspapers, radio or television -- to own a second platform in the same market. "The business has tremendous momentum and is well positioned to benefit from changes in the media environment," KKR founding partner George Roberts said in a statement. KKR is investing A$735 million for a 50 percent stake in the joint venture, Seven Media Group, while Seven Network will receive cash proceeds of about A$3.2 billion for its assets going into the venture and will hold a 50 percent stake in it. The venture will own Seven's television and magazines businesses and its 50 percent interest in the Yahoo!7 online joint venture. Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Mizuho ( 8411.T ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) are underwriting the deal, lending A$2.5 billion. For Seven shareholders, the main issue now is how Seven will invest the A$3.2 billion it has fetched to build on its track record of creating value. "The question the market will ask is whether that can continue, given the scarcity of media assets out there," said Jack Chemello, an analyst with fund manager BT Financial Group, which holds shares in Seven. He said while Australia's media heavyweights and private equity groups had a lot of firepower for acquisitions, Australia's A$12 billion media industry had too few assets to fill their appetite. "It could see valuations pushed even higher for those few scarce assets that potentially could be in play," Chemello said. PRIVATE EQUITY PUSH The new media law has opened the door to the big private equity investors offshore who are hunting for media assets. KKR was reportedly pipped at the post last month when CVC Asia Pacific CVC.UL took a 50 percent stake in a TV, magazine and Internet joint venture with Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. PBL.AX, controlled by Australia's richest man, James Packer. Providence Equity Partners, considered a leading investor in media, is backing a plan by Irish media group Independent News and Media INWS.I to buy out regional newspaper group APN News & Media Ltd. ( APN.AX ). KKR and Providence were beaten last week in an $18.7 billion bid to buy out the No.1 U.S. radio station operator, Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ). An industry source said Seven talked exclusively to KKR on the joint venture plan. "KKR has invested in every possible media platform. There's a strong mix in this transaction. They're backing Seven's management," said the industry source, who declined to be named. Seven was advised by Morgan Stanley and KKR was advised by O'Sullivan Pullini. Seven grabbed a 14.9 percent stake in West Australian Newspapers Holdings Ltd. WAN.AX last month, which it said on Monday it would retain. Other industry heavyweights have been maneuvering ahead of Australia's anticipated media shake-up. Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWS.N bought a 7.5 percent stake in its main Australian newspaper rival John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. ( FXJ.AX ) and Macquarie Media Group MMG.AX bought a 13.8 percent stake in radio and TV station owner Southern Cross Broadcasting Ltd. SBC.AX. KKR has been scouring Australia for media and retail assets, after making its first investment in the country in June buying the Cleanaway waste management business and an industrial services business from Brambles Industries Ltd. BIL.AX for A$1.83 billion. It led an A$18.2 billion bid for Australian retailer Coles Myer Ltd. CML.AX, but withdrew it last month after the Coles board balked. ($1=A$1.30)
