 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group said on Monday it would buy Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N for $20 billion in the largest-ever acquisition of a real estate investment trust, lifting the entire sector on speculation about the next takeover target. 

 "It's kind of shocking given the magnitude of its size," UBS analyst James Feldman said. Shares of Equity Office, the largest owner of U.S. office property after the U.S. government, rose as much as 8.5 percent to $48.51 on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal is also one of the largest in a string of leveraged buyouts by Blackstone and other funds. "There's still a tremendous appetite for real estate by institutional investors," BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato said. Equity Office has been the subject of buyout rumors for the past few months as private funds, including Blackstone, have snapped up publicly traded REITs. Blackstone said the cash offer of $48.50 per share -- an 8.5 percent premium to the stock's closing price -- valued Equity Office at nearly $20 billion, including all of the company's securities. Including the assumption of debt, the deal is worth $36 billion, surpassing the combined $35 billion in private equity deals announced for 16 REITs since the beginning of 2005, Adornato said. Equity Office shares were up 7.9 percent, or $3.55, at $48.27 in late-afternoon trading. Other REITs, such as SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N ), Federal Realty Investment Trust ( FRT.N ), Public Storage Inc. ( PSA.N ) and REIT fund manager Cohen & Steers Inc. ( CNS.N ) also rose, putting them among the top gainers on the Big Board. BLACKSTONE'S RECORD Blackstone has raised more than $67 billion for alternative asset investing, including almost $13 billion for real estate. The firm has a long track record of investing in office buildings, hotels and other commercial properties. It recently acquired office REIT Trizec Properties Inc. for $4.8 billion, plus the assumption of $4.1 billion in debt. In July, Blackstone bought office property owner CarrAmerica Realty Corp. for $5.6 billion. Many deals have been driven by the amount of debt buyers can use and the luxury of being able to wait for property values to rise, said Jahn Brodwin, a partner in The Schonbraun McCann Group, which advises REITs and fund sponsors. "I think Wall Street tends to be a little bit myopic at times," Brodwin said. "They don't look out far enough." Blackstone and other private buyers typically buy large portfolios of property and sell the buildings individually or in groups, a "buy wholesale, sell retail" strategy. Markets such as New York and Washington, D.C. have seen vacancy rates tumble since the office market bottomed out at the end of 2002. Equity Office's other markets -- like Boston and San Francisco -- have recovered as soon or as quickly. "If you look at EOP's weakest markets, (Blackstone) thinks they've got farther to go than the (stock) market's pricing suggests," Feldman said. "If they're not recovering faster, then they're making a bet that they can hold on to great real estate for a long time if they have to." Unlike publicly traded REITs, private buyers can finance their purchases by using more than 90 percent debt, allowing them to boost the return on their own money they use. Public markets frown upon the use of more than 50 percent debt. "These facts make it possible for large transactions like was are seeing today," Adornato said. "We believe that the skills and strengths of Equity Office will greatly enhance our existing office platform, which has been expanded through our recent acquisitions of CarrAmerica and Trizec," Blackstone Senior Managing Director Jonathan Gray said in a statement. Foreign investors and pension funds also have been pouring more of their funds into real estate to diversify their investments. REITs also have been active in acquiring their rivals, making a dozen such purchases valued at a combined $40 billion in the past two years, Adornato said. Founded by real estate magnate Sam Zell in 1976, Equity Office in 2001 became the first REIT to join the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . The Chicago-based company has interests in 581 buildings, comprising 109 million square feet, in 16 states and the District of Columbia. Equity Office's board has approved the deal, which is expected to close in the first quarter. The company said neither management nor trustees were part of the buying group. For the past five years, Equity Office has been exiting noncore markets in the Midwest and South and purchasing buildings in high rent growth markets. It also cut its dividend, one of the most investor-alluring features of a  REIT. "In some ways, EOP was a broken REIT," Adornato said. Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N advised Equity Office. Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ), Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Bear Stearns BSC.N, Blackstone Corporate Advisory and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) were financial advisers to Blackstone. Acquisition financing will be led by Goldman, Bank of America and Bear Stearns. (Additional reporting by  Megan Davies ,  Mark McSherry )
