 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Retailer Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ) on Monday posted a better-than-expected third-quarter profit as it controlled costs, but sales disappointed as the cooling U.S. housing market hurt consumer spending. 

 The second-largest home improvement chain behind Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) again cut its full-year profit and sales outlooks, yet Lowe's shares rose more than 1 percent as analysts had expected weak results. "Investors are looking ahead to next year, when six to nine months from now, these negative results will become easier comparisons," said Dan Popowics, an equity analyst with Fifth Third Asset Management. Earnings were $716 million, or 46 cents a share, for the third quarter that ended November 3, up 11 percent from $646 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 43 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5.8 percent to $11.2 billion, shy of analysts' estimates of $11.5 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail gauge, fell 4 percent, the first decline in this measure for Lowe's since the first quarter of 2001. Lowe's and Home Depot benefited from strong U.S. home sales and hurricane-related demand a year ago, but now face difficult comparisons as the housing market cools. Atlanta-based Home Depot missed Wall Street estimates last week by reporting a 3 percent drop in third-quarter profit and pared its forecasts for full-year profit and sales growth, saying the housing-related weakness would continue into 2007. Lowe's, which is adding stores in big U.S. cities such as New York, said fewer damaging hurricanes and lower lumber prices also hurt third-quarter sales as the average store purchase fell. It forecast a 4 percent to 6 percent same-store sales decline for the fourth quarter. Housing turnover has fallen "more than we anticipated," Lowe's Chairman Robert Niblock said in an interview. "By the middle of next year I think we will have cycled through that in most markets, and as we go into the second half (of 2007) we would expect to return to positive" same-store sales. Mooresville, North Carolina-based Lowe's cut its full-year profit forecast to $1.95 to $1.97 a share, and said it expects fourth-quarter profit of 36 cents to 38 cents a share. Lowe's said the fourth quarter and year would include one less week because of a calendar shift. Analysts on average expect profit of 41 cents a share for the fourth quarter and $1.97 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. In September, Lowe's had said annual earnings would be near the low end of a range of $2 to $2.07 a share. "I do expect better results out of Lowe's" longer-term, said Popowics, the Fifth Third Asset Management analyst. "Home Depot is in more of a turnaround process with their stores and Lowe's in contrast is growing quicker," he added. Lowe's shares rose 37 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $30.85 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Home Depot was up 25 cents at $38.53. Lowe's stock is down 8 percent so far this year, while Home Depot is off 5 percent.
