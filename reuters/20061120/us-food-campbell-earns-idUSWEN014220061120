 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ) posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Monday as price increases and new items like low-sodium soups helped lift sales. 

 But the stock was about flat as some analysts questioned the near-term growth potential of a company that already trades at about 20 percent times fiscal year 2007 earnings. "At some level, the Street is waiting for a big upward earnings/guidance revision that, in our opinion, is not coming due to management's conservatism and long wish list of investments for the future," Jonathan Feeney, an analyst at Wachovia, said. he rates the stock "market weight." The company, which makes its namesake soups, Pepperidge Farm cookies and Godiva chocolates, said profit was $291 million, or 72 cents a share, in the fiscal first quarter, ended October 29, compared with $302 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company recorded a $47 million tax benefit. Earnings from continuing operations were 66 cents a share, 5 cents better than the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Campbell sold its UK and Ireland businesses in August and used $620 million of the proceeds to buy back shares. Campbell did not lift its full-year earnings forecast despite the solid first quarter and management said on a conference call there were opportunities for the company to spend more to build its business. For the year, Campbell stood by its forecast for an increase of 5 to 7 percent from earnings of $1.73 a share in the prior year, before one-time items. "The combination of incremental marketing, UK divestiture dilution, diminishing productivity improvements, higher taxes and tougher soup comparisons in the back half of the year will likely limit more meaningful growth in fiscal 2007," said Christopher Growe, analyst at A.G. Edwards, in a research note. He rates the stock "hold." Like many food companies, Campbell has raised prices to offset rising costs for energy and ingredients. The company has also been spending money to promote new products, like the low-sodium soups. Initial shipments of the low-sodium soups, which are made with a special sea salt that is lower in sodium, were better than expected, Campbell Chief Executive Douglas Conant said in a news release. First-quarter sales rose 8 percent to $2.15 billion, with price increases adding about 2 percentage points to the rise. Volume and mix, a measure of products sold that factors out currency factors and price increases, rose 4 percent. U.S. soup, sauce and beverage sales also rose 8 percent in the quarter, with profit in that segment up almost 12 percent, the company said. Soup sales alone rose 10 percent, with condensed soup sales up 7 percent and ready-to-eat soups up 15 percent. Baking and snacking sales rose 6 percent, and profit in that unit rose 36 percent, helped by lower marketing costs than a year earlier. Campbell shares were down 4 cents at $37.51 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Before Monday, the stock was up 26 percent this year, and trading at about 20 times estimated earnings for the current fiscal year, compared with a multiple of 18 for rival General Mills Inc. ( GIS.N ), which makes Progresso soups.
