 LONDON  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) said 
on Monday it had rejected an offer worth 2.7 billion pounds 
($5.1 billion) from U.S. stock exchange Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ). 

  "Nasdaq's final offer fails to recognize the outstanding 
growth record and prospects of our group on a standalone basis 
let alone the Exchange's unique global position," chief 
executive Clara Furse said in a statement.  Earlier, Nasdaq, which had built up a 25 percent stake in 
LSE after a previous bid was rebuffed, said it was offering to 
pay 1,243 pence a share in cash for the rest of the company, 
Europe's biggest stock market.
