 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - Canada's TD Bank Financial Group ( TD.TO ) ( TD.N ) offered $3.2 billion on Monday for the shares it doesn't already own in TD Banknorth Inc. BNK.N, looking to breathe new life into its U.S. retail banking arm where profits have been falling. 

 TD Bank, which owns about 130 million shares, or 57 percent, of TD Banknorth, will offer $32.33 a share in cash for the minority stake in the Portland, Maine-based bank in which it bought an interest in 2005. The offer represents a 6.5 percent premium over TD Banknorth's closing price of $30.35 a share in New York on Friday. Shares of TD Banknorth closed at $32.18, up 6 percent or $1.83, while shares of TD Bank eased 30 Canadian cents, or 0.4 percent, to C$67.45 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. "I think $32.33 represents a very fair price today, knowing that this market environment is not going to get better in the near future," TD Banknorth Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Ryan said on a conference call. "We have margin compression, intense competition for loans and deposits, and the inverted yield curve," said Ryan, who approached TD Bank this weekend with the buyout offer. An inverted yield curve, where short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates, narrows the gap between what banks can earn on loans and what they pay on deposits. TD Banknorth, facing slowing loan growth and stiff competition, warned last week that fourth-quarter profit could be at the low end of its forecast and said it may close some of its 600 branches to cut costs. "This (transaction) is no surprise. The timing was always up in the air, but everyone knew this was coming," said Kevin Timmons, banking analyst at C.L. King & Associates in Albany, New York. "TD has long said bank prices in the U.S. were too high, but if we got to a point where the profitability outlook improves, it would probably end up paying more. It is paying less now than if it were to wait." The boards of both TD Bank and TD Banknorth have unanimously backed the deal, which also needs the approval of a majority of TD Banknorth's minority shareholders. They are expected to vote on the deal early next year. TD Bank's Chief Financial Officer Colleen Johnston said Private Capital Management, TD Banknorth's biggest shareholder after TD Bank, has agreed to vote its stake of some 18.2 million shares, or about 8 percent, in favor of the deal. She said Ariel Capital Management, which owned 8 million shares, or 3.5 percent, of TD Banknorth at the end of September, according to Reuters data, has also indicated it will back the transaction. TD Bank Chief Executive Ed Clark said TD Banknorth remained a strong platform for growth, despite tough banking conditions in the northeastern United States, which "could get worse before they get better." He said TD Bank aims to slow any further TD Banknorth purchases and build it into "a better bank rather than a bigger one," and that would be easier to do with a 100 percent stake. Clark said management aimed to grow TD Banknorth's earnings by 7 percent to 10 percent a year. However, strong performances from TD Bank's other units would ensure a robust overall performance for TD, which is Canada's second biggest bank by assets. "Do I believe that next year TD Bank Financial Group can do more than 10 percent earnings growth? I believe the answer to that is 'yes'," Clark said. Johnston said no management changes were planned at TD Banknorth and Bharat Masrani will become president, as planned, in the fall. TD Bank, which took a majority stake last year in TD Banknorth for $4 billion, expects the deal to add to earnings in 2007 and 2008 even though no meaningful revenue or expense synergies are expected. "We view this announcement as a positive development for TD as it accretively advances its U.S. commercial banking expansion," said Michael Goldberg, an analyst at Desjardins Securities.
