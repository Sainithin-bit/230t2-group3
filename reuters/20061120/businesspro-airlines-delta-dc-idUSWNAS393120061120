 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. 
DALRQ.PK said on Monday it plans to recall about 700 
maintenance employees from mid-December, on top of the 200 or 
so previously furloughed maintenance workers it has recalled 
over the past few months. 

  Delta, which last week received an unsolicited $8 billion 
takeover offer from rival US Airways Group ( LCC.N ), also said 
it continues to make progress in its restructuring and is on 
track to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the 
first half of 2007, as a standalone company.
