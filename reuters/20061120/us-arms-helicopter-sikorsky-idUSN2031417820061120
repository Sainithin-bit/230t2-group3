 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin ( LMT.N ) Corp. and the Sikorsky Aircraft unit of United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) each said Monday it had protested to the U.S. government over a potential $13 billion Air Force contract they lost to Boeing ( BA.N ) for combat search and rescue helicopters. 

 The protests were filed with Congress's General Accounting Office, which reviews federal contract awards if requested by a losing bidder and certain conditions are met. Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed, the Pentagon's top supplier, said it was protesting reluctantly in the belief that the industrial team it headed offered "the most capable and most affordable solution." "This review will give us the opportunity to more fully understand the reasons for the decision that was made," said Greg Caires, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Systems Integration in Owego, New York. Lockheed had teamed with AgustaWestland Inc., a unit of the Italian defense manufacturer Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ), to vie to replace the Air Force's fleet of HH-60 Pave Hawks, used extensively in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sikorsky was seeking to make sure the selection process accurately evaluated the characteristics and performance of its HH-92 candidate helicopter, the Stratford, Connecticut-based company said in a separate statement. Boeing won the so-called CSAR-X contract on November 9 for 141 helicopters. The Air Force chose what it portrayed as a low-risk option, using Boeing's version of the Ch-47 Chinook, a military workhorse for five decades. Joseph Haddock, a Sikorsky vice president for government business, said in a telephone interview that Sikorsky was "just looking to understand how the Air Force came to the decision they did."
