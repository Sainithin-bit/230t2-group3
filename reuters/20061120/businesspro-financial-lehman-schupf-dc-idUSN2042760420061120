 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N 
said on Monday it is buying H.A. Schupf & Co., a New York-based 
money manager for wealthy individuals. 

  The acquisition represents the first for Lehman's 
investment management division since George H. Walker started 
working at the firm last week.  Terms of the deal were not disclosed.  H.A. Schupf, which has $2.5 billion of assets under 
management, will be merged into Lehman's Neuberger Berman unit, 
which now has about $50 billion of assets for wealthy 
individuals in its private asset management business.  As part of the deal, H. Axel Schupf, Elisabeth Lonsdale, 
and Barbara Tarmy, partners at H.A. Schupf, will join private 
asset management teams at Neuberger Berman.
