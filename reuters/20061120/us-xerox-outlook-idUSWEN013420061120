 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ), one of the world's biggest printer makers, said on Monday it expects 2007 per-share profit to be in line with Wall Street views, and will expand its stock buyback plan. 

 Xerox sees its 2007 full-year profit rising to $1.12 to $1.16 per share, fueled by growth in color printing, its most robust business. Analysts expect a profit of $1.16 in 2007 and $1.23 in 2006, according to Reuters Estimates. Over the past few years, Xerox has banked on new digital printers, color and office systems in an effort to boost profits and increase market share. Gross profit from color pages is five times greater than black-and-white. The company estimated the color printing market for businesses to be about $21 billion. "Color pages are up 39 percent through the third quarter of this year and now represent 9 percent of Xerox's total pages, more than double from two years ago," the company said in a statement. "Color now represents 34 percent of the company's total revenue." Xerox also reiterated fourth-quarter guidance, expecting earnings in a range of 21 cents to 24 cents per share, including restructuring charges of about 13 per share. Excluding restructuring, Xerox expects fourth-quarter adjusted earnings of 34 cents to 37 cents per share. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts, on average, expect a profit of 37 cent in the fourth quarter. Xerox said it is on track to generate between $1.2 billion and $1.5 billion in cash from core operations this year and expects the same for 2007. Xerox said it will expand its $1.5 billion stock repurchase plan, originally announced in October 2005, by $500 million. Xerox, based in Stamford, Connecticut, plans to host an annual meeting with investors on Monday in New York. Xerox shares closed on Friday at $17.14 on the New York Stock Exchange, and earlier this month hit a 52-week high of $17.31.
