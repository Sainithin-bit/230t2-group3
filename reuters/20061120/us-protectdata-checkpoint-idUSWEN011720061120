 TEL AVIV  (Reuters) - Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., one of the world's largest Internet security companies, said on Monday it would buy data security company Protect Data AB for about $586 million. 

 The deal values Stockholm-based Protect Data at 180 Swedish crowns per share, or 4.2 billion crowns. Protect Data's shares closed at 175.50 crowns on Friday. Protect Data's board of directors unanimously recommends the offer, and it is also supported by Protect Data's largest shareholder, Monterro Holding Ltd, which owns 10.46 percent. Protect Data is the owner of Pointsec Mobile Technologies. Israel-based Check Point said the proposed acquisition of Pointsec, a provider of data security on laptop and desktop PCs, PDAs and smartphones, was the first step in its strategy to secure all enterprise data. "With businesses facing increasingly severe consequences from data breaches and a stricter regulatory environment, it is apparent that protection must extend beyond the infrastructure to the data itself," Gil Shwed, chief executive officer of Check Point, said in a statement. Pointsec provides automatic data encryption solutions that provide protection at the endpoint. The expansion of network access to mobile workers is driving demand to secure all devices that connect to the corporate network, Check Point said. In the first nine months of 2006, Protect Data's revenues grew by 92 percent to 370.8 million crowns. After-tax income for the first nine months grew by 166 percent to 58.7 million crowns. "After an evaluation process of the strategic alternatives for the company, both our board of directors and I believe this opportunity represents the best strategy for Protect Data, its customers, shareholders and employees," said Martin Bjaringer, chairman of Protect Data's board. Check Point's offer is subject to a minimum acceptance of more than 90 percent of all of the shares of Protect Data. The acceptance period is expected to run from November 27 to December 22.
