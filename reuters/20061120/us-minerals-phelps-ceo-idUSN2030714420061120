 NEW YORK/TORONTO  (Reuters) - Only three months after coming under intense pressure from disgruntled shareholders for making an expensive bid for two major Canadian mining companies, the chief executive of Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N has turned the firm's fortunes around. 

 Steven Whisler is creating the largest North American-based mining company by selling his U.S.-based copper producer to compatriot Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) for $25.9 billion. The news sent Phelps' stock up 27 percent to $120.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Freeport was down 3 percent at $55.63. The only downside is that Whisler, who has spent the last three decades working for Phelps, will not hold a position at the new Freeport-McMoRan. Instead he will retire after the transition period. "I get the feeling that the old boys wanted to get out, and now they can say 'We did a good deal for our shareholders,' declare victory and leave," said John Kinsey, portfolio manager with Caldwell Securities in Toronto, which previously held shares of Inco, Falconbridge and Phelps. In an uncharacteristic gamble earlier this year, Whisler made a $40 billion mostly stock bid for Canada's Inco Ltd. N.TO, the second largest nickel producer in the world, and Falconbridge, a major copper and nickel producer. Phelps stock dropped 8 percent after it announced plans to buy the two miners and Whisler was grilled by the investment community. One vocal shareholder wanted the company to buy back shares instead, and publicly slammed the deal. Phelps would have had to take on billions of dollars in debt to complete the deal and several analysts characterized the move as a heavy bet on long-term commodity prices. "He was betting his company, his job and his career; he went all the way out," said one source familiar with the Inco-Falconbridge-Phelps negotiations. "He was battered by shareholders after the announcement." To add to the discontent, during the second quarter, when most miners were reporting record earnings because of strong metal prices, Phelps reported a sharp drop in profit because of its hedging strategy. "I think he has fallen. His reputation is not the same," said the source. In the end, Whisler lost Inco to Brazilian iron ore giant Companhia Vale do Rio Doce ( VALE5.SA ) ( RIO.N ) and lost Falconbridge to Swiss-based Xstrata Plc XTA.L. Whisler's attempt to form the largest mining company in North America could transform his reputation as a steady leader best known for guiding Phelps Dodge through a difficult period when metal prices dipped as he took over as CEO six and a half years ago, industry watchers said. Now, Phelps shareholders will receive $88 in cash plus 0.67 common shares of Freeport for every share held. Based on Friday's closing prices, that values the offer at $126.46 a share and represents a premium of 33 percent. "It's a good deal for Phelps because of the premium," said Kerry Smith, an analyst with Haywood Securities in Toronto. Whisler, who has been an employee of Phelps Dodge since 1976, has portrayed himself as a careful executive with strong financial discipline. In a 2001 commencement address delivered to the Colorado School of Mines, he said he subscribed to famed American humorist Will Rogers' investment theory: "Don't gamble. Take all your savings and buy some good stock and hold it till it goes up. Then sell it. If it don't go up, don't buy it." He also advised graduates to "ride the ups and downs" of their careers -- "because like all of us, you will have plenty."
