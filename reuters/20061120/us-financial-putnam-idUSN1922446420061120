 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The auction of Boston-based money manager Putnam Investments will move into its latter stages this week with final offers due from three bidders before the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Sunday. 

 Citing a person familiar with the matter, the newspaper said that before Thanksgiving on Thursday, bids were expected from fund manager Amvescap Plc. AVZ.L; Italian bank Unicredito; and Power Corp of Canada ( POW.TO ). It could be weeks before any decision is made by Putnam's parent, Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. ( MMC.N ), the Journal said. Marsh may decide to hang on to Putnam if it can't get a price its board considers fair, the newspaper said. Putnam's sale value has been put at anywhere between $3 billion and $6 billion. Marsh & McLennan was not immediately available for comment.
