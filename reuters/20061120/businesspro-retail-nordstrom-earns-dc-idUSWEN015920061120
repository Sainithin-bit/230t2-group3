 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Upscale department store operator 
Nordstrom Inc. ( JWN.N ) said on Monday its quarterly profit 
rose, helped by strong sales at stores open at least one year. 

  Nordstrom reported net income of $135.7 million, or 52 
cents per share, for its fiscal third-quarter ended October 28, 
compared with $107.5 million, or 39 cents per share, a year 
earlier.
