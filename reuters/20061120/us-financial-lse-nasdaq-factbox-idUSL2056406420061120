 (Reuters) - U.S. stock exchange Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) launched a 2.7 billion pound ($5.1 billion) offer for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) on Monday in a bid to become the world's first transatlantic bourse. 

 Nasdaq offered in March to pay $4.2 billion in cash to buy the LSE but it was rejected as too low. Following are details of Nasdaq's new offer: SHARE PRICING: * The new offer raises its cash offer to 1,243 pence from its March offer of 950 pence per ordinary share, representing a 54 percent premium over the closing price on March 10, 2006. * Nasdaq says it has already acquired 7.07 million LSE shares for 87.8 million pounds ($166.4 million), taking its total holding in LSE to 61 million ordinary shares or 28.75 percent of the issued ordinary share capital of LSE. POST-MERGER DETAILS: * Combining the two would create a market place with over 6,400 listed companies with a total market capitalization of about US$11.8 trillion. * LSE would continue to be a Regulated Investment Exchange (RIE), regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which is the U.K. financial watchdog. * Nasdaq would preserve an FSA regulated main market and AIM, the London Stock Exchange's junior market. * LSE would have its own board of directors with a majority of non-executive independent directors. * Nasdaq would establish a London Oversight Committee (LOC), comprised of board representatives and an independent chairman, to retain veto rights over proposed changes to LSE listing standards and location of the main RIE operations. OPERATIONAL DETAILS: * LSE's headquarters would be maintained in London, and the location of the main RIE operations would be subject to the veto of the LOC which would remain independent of Nasdaq. * Nasdaq board meetings would regularly be held in London and it would seek a secondary listing in London after the completion of the merger. * Greenhill is acting as lead financial adviser to Nasdaq, with Dresdner Kleinwort acting as broker. * Nasdaq says the transaction is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2007.
