 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Retailer CSK Auto Corp. CAO.N said on Monday sales rose about 16 percent in its fiscal third quarter mainly on acquisitions, and that it would further delay filing formal results due to ongoing financial restatements. 

 CSK Auto said in September that two top executives and several finance staff had left the retailer following an investigation of accounting errors and improprieties that will result in various restatements dating to 2001. Sales rose 16 percent to $473.8 million in its third quarter ended October 29, mainly due to the acquisition of Murray's Discount Auto Stores in December 2005.
