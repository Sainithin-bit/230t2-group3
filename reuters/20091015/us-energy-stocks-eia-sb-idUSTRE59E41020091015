 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. oil product inventories logged big surprise drops last week as refiners curtailed operations, prompting a modest build in crude oil stocks, government data showed Thursday. 

 U.S. weekly gasoline supplies sank a whopping 5.2 million barrels to 209.2 million barrels in the week to October 9, the Energy Information Administration said in its weekly data. This countered analysts' forecasts for an 800,000 barrel build. Weekly distillate stocks dropped 1.1 million barrels to 170.7 million barrels versus forecasts for a 100,000-barrel gain. Meanwhile, commercial crude oil stocks rose 400,000 barrels to 337.8 million barrels last week, which fell short of projections of a 700,000 barrel increase. EIA said crude oil imports were off 367,000 barrels per day at 8.73 million bpd last week. Crude runs at U.S. refineries were down by 510,000 bpd at 14.1 million bpd as refinery utilization sank 4.1 percentage points to 80.9 percent of capacity, compared with forecasts of a much smaller drop of 0.4 percentage point. On Wednesday, the American Petroleum Institute trade group reported that U.S. crude oil stocks unexpectedly fell by 172,000 barrels last week. It said gasoline inventories also logged a surprise decline while distillates rose. <API/S> Both reports came out a day later than usual due to Monday's federal Columbus Day holiday.
