 LONDON, June 27 (IFR) - Hopes that contingent capital would make up a large part of global systematically important banks (G-SIBs)'s additional capital requirements were seemingly dashed at the week-end. 

 The Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), said on Saturday that additional loss absorbency requirements were to be met with a progressive common equity tier one capital requirement ranging from 1% to 2.5%, depending on a bank's systemic importance. However, capital solutions specialists still hope that the nascent asset-class will have a role to play, globally or nationally, and are eagerly awaiting the consultation paper from the Financial Stability Board due in July on the topic. The release from the GHOS merely stated that it would "continue to review contingent capital, and support the use of contingent capital to meet higher national loss absorbency requirements than the global minimum." It added that high-trigger contingent capital could help absorb losses on a going concern basis. "On the face of it, it doesn't look very good but I don't think it's the end of contingent capital," said Daniel Bell, head of EMEA new product development at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. "A number of national regulators have been talking about higher capital requirements than those set by Basel and it could be that the extra requirements can be fulfilled with contingent capital." Meanwhile, Prasad Gollakota, co-head of capital solutions at UBS, said that while it was difficult to draw specific conclusions about contingent capital just yet Basel had left the door open for its role. "The consultation paper should give the market more direction, but the Basel statement does note the support for the use of contingent capital to meet higher capital requirements, with a focus on the high-trigger version." SOME DISAPPOINTMENT But there was disappointment that contingent capital is unlikely to play a very prominent place in banks' capital structure. "Given investor demand for the product is on the up, it is unfortunate that contingent capital will play a smaller role than expected," said BoAML's Bell. European Credit Management is the latest fund to have said that it was setting up a fund focused on banks' subordinated debt and coco issuance. "There was a lot of regulatory support for it in the past - including out of the UK, US and among Basel Committee members - but that seems to have faded," said Bell. Bell's view was echoed by Simon McGeary, head of new products group at Citi. "The statement notes that the use of contingent capital remains under review," he said. "However, it is also clear that different regulators have got different views on whether contingent capital should have a place in banks' capital structure. We now have to wait for the consultation paper from the Financial Stability Board." He added that most G-SIBs already had enough capital under the new rules. "Banks can control their capital ratio in a number of different ways and pretty much all of the G-SIBs are already where they need to be with the exception of a few which might be a bit light," he said. "With the added equity requirements, banks will try to make their capital structure more efficient through the use of hybrid tier one or tier two so as not to soak up too much further equity capital elsewhere. They use hybrid tier one or tier two so they can keep equity usage to a minimum." SILVER LINING Market participants welcomed that the additional capital surcharge was not as big as had been expected. "The fact that Basel issued a press release ahead of the consultation is helpful, as the market has been very hungry for information," said Gerald Podobnik, co-head of EMEA capital solutions at Deutsche Bank. "It gives us some principles as to what they are thinking and where they are going in terms of numbers. It takes out a lot of the fears that the capital surcharge might be a very large number. All eyes will now be on the consultation paper from the FSB in July." Opinions vary as to whether the added capital surcharge will force the banks to shrink however. "It would be too easy to say that the added capital surcharge will force the banks to shrink given that there are five different categories and it's not just the size that matters but also things like an institution's complexity, interconnectedness etc," said Podobnik. "A bank can work along those five categories and change their systemic importance." However, BoAML's Bell said that the surcharge could push the banks to shrink. "The progressive nature of the additional capital requirement will force some banks to reconsider their size, which is obviously Basel's objective," he said. "At this stage we only have a press release to go by so let's see what devil is in the detail of the full consultation paper." (Reporting by Matthew Attwood, IFR Markets)
