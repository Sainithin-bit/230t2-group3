 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The French deal for a rollover of Greek debt could be an interesting basis for discussion for German banks, sources close to German banks said on Monday. 

 "The French suggestion would be a possible compromise, which on the one hand underscores the voluntariness of a maturity prolongation and should prevent triggering a credit event, while on the other hand also granting reasonable incentives so private creditors can accept it," one of the sources said. "It is a very interesting model," another source said. The topic will be discussed with the Finance Ministry on Monday, a third source said.
