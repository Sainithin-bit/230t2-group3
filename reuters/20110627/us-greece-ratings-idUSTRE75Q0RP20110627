 LONDON  (Reuters) - As euro zone officials try to find a solution to the Greek debt crisis, it remains unclear what impact a Greek ratings downgrade to default could have on financial markets. 

 Rating agencies are playing hard ball. They would consider a Greek debt restructuring, a reprofiling and even a voluntary rollover of existing debt holdings when they mature -- currently the most widely-touted solution to the crisis -- as a default. A rollover has been championed by euro zone officials and would be unlikely to trigger the payment of default insurance taken out on Greek bonds under the rules of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), which has a final say on whether a credit event has occurred. European banks and finance officials are trying to get around rating agencies' reservations regarding a rollover, discussing a proposal to replace existing Greek debt with a different type of bond, sources told Reuters. Unless they find a compromise, Greece faces the prospect of its debt being downgraded to default. Below are some of the possible consequences were this to happen: CONTAGION It would probably send borrowing costs for other euro zone weaklings even higher for fear they too could fail to honor their debt payments. This would make it even more difficult for Greek, Irish and Portuguese banks to raise funds in money markets. They are already firmly locked out of interbank lending markets and are almost entirely dependent on the ECB for their funding. The fear is if Greece falls, Portugal will be next. Its credit default swaps curve remains sharply inverted, reflecting the high risk of a credit event in the next two years. And if Portugal is unable to pay back its debt, the Spanish banking system is likely to take a massive hit, being the largest euro zone holder of Portuguese debt with more than $80 billion, according to data from the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). A collapse in the banking system of the euro zone's fourth largest economy could put pressure on Spain to recapitalize its banks, and could push its already stretched public finances over the edge. The country is already considered too large to be bailed out by the current euro zone rescue fund. It could also have a knock-on impact on the euro zone's biggest economies -- Germany and France -- which are the biggest euro zone holders of Spanish debt. French banks had more than twice as much exposure to Spanish debt than Greek debt -- around $140 billion at the end of 2010, according to BIS data. German banks had around $180 billion of Spanish debt, nearly six times more than its holdings of Greek debt. "It's all about stopping the contagion," said Prateek Datta, credit analyst at RBS. "Greece on its own would have been very manageable, and European banks would have been able to survive losses from it. But if markets seize up and Spain gets dragged into the mix, it becomes a completely different story." COLLATERAL Greek banks currently borrow money from the ECB by using Greek bonds as a safeguard that they will pay back that money. If a ratings agency downgrades Greece's debt ratings to default or so-called "selective" default, the ECB has said it would refuse to accept Greek bonds as collateral in its lending operations. Such a scenario would cut off funding to much of Greece's financial sector, and euro zone authorities and the ECB would ultimately have to find a way to recapitalize Greek banks. As such, analysts say the ECB could end up loosening its collateral rules, as it has done in the past, to accept defaulted debt as a safeguard. It previously promised to accept Greek and Irish debt as collateral regardless of the ratings. If the ECB eventually chose to accept defaulted bonds as collateral it might incur losses. Should those losses require a recapitalization of the bank, the burden would be transferred back to euro zone states. BANKS Greek banks, followed by European peers and the ECB are deemed to be the most exposed to Greek debt. Most banks would not be forced to sell their Greek debt in case of a rating agency downgrade to default, an accountant involved in advising banks on their exposure to Greek debt said. They could choose to do so but may struggle to find buyers or may lose out, selling bonds at a much lower price than their original value. Instead, the accountant saw a greater risk from banks having to significantly write down their holding of Greek debt in case of default. "In most cases, it's unlikely that there would be a requirement to liquidate immediately on a downgrade but the question and the challenge would more be around whether or not it pushed people over a line where they concluded that a write-down on the holding was appropriate," the source said. A large number of institutions are holding Greek bonds in their banking books either at par, or original value, or without having recognized the changes of Greek debt market prices in their earnings. In the case of a default, banks may be required to adjust their Greek bond holdings closer to market value and recognize those losses. But ultimately the decision to write down those holdings lies with the banks. "The event of default that met the definitions for ISDA, I think would be highly likely to trigger the need for an impairment test but it would depend then on the actual proposed restructuring as to whether or not a write-down would be required and the extent of the write-down," the accountant said. MIXED ASSET FUNDS A downgrade to default on Greek debt by credit rating agencies is not expected to trigger any significant sell-off by mixed asset funds, since many of them would already have dumped Greek holdings as they were reviewed to junk, analysts said. Out of the 2,119 bond and mixed asset funds registered for sale in the UK, 153 have fixed-income investments in Greece, according to data from Lipper, a Thomson Reuters unit. Their exposure to Greek debt averages 0.68 percent per fund -- or 3.33 million pounds ($5.32 million) each. Tactical funds rather than long-term "buy and hold" funds were more likely to be holding Greek debt, according to Tamara Burnell, head of financial and sovereign research at M&G, which runs almost 200 billion pounds in assets. She would be "very surprised" if many investment grade funds still held onto it, she said. "We do not use ratings to invest - we do our own research on anyone we lend money to and that includes sovereigns," she said. "But even those investors who do, I think they are really more ratings-sensitive up the ratings spectrum - so a move from A to BB potentially is a very significant one, but a move from CCC to D is going to have far less impact." But if contagion were to spread to other assets, analysts fear the funds industry more broadly could be affected. Fitch estimates that during the three months that ended May 31 the 10 largest U.S. money funds had half of their $755 billion in assets in places that were potentially exposed to European banks.
