 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Indian Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee kept mum on Monday on which candidate their countries are backing to lead the International Monetary Fund. 

 But both officials told a U.S.-India economic forum in Washington they were confident the process would deliver reform to the global lender, with Geithner hailing "an open and contested process, two excellent candidates, quick resolution and ... somebody emerge who will command very broad support."
