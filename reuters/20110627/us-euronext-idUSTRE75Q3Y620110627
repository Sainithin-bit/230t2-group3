 BRUSSELS/PARIS  (Reuters) - Technical glitches plagued NYSE Euronext NYX.N again on Monday, forcing the stock market operator to halt trading on the CAC-40  .FCHI  index of French blue chips for about 45 minutes in late morning. 

 The Euronext market status website later also said the Internal Matching Service on all trading groups had been deactivated until further notice. After investigation, Euronext decided to cancel some trades on the following stocks -- Unilever ( ULVR.L ), L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ), Total ( TOTF.PA ) and LVMH ( LVMH.PA ). "The highest and lowest prices are incorrect and will be communicated via market status," it said. A Euronext spokeswoman in Amsterdam said the Internal Matching Service was expected to be available on Tuesday. "Normal continuous trading is not affected and trading is not halted," she said. Technical glitches delayed the start of trading on the Paris bourse on June 20 by an hour and briefly disrupted trading on "trading unit 2" on June 21. An exchange spokeswoman in Paris said NYSE Euronext was investigating what caused these various technical problems.
