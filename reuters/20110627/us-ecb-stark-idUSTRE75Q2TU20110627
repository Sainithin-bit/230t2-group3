 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The euro zone's economic recovery remains self-sustaining despite the region's debt crisis, senior ECB policymaker Juergen Stark said on Monday, though he reiterated the bank's fears over a Greek default. 

 Stark, one of the ECB's six Executive Board members, said the consequences of a Greek debt restructuring could eclipse the turmoil in Europe created by the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Despite the warning, he said the euro zone's economy was recovering without the aid of support measures. "We don't yet have a self sustaining economic dynamic in the U.S. but we have do have a self-sustaining economic recovery in Europe, in the euro zone. That is not altered by the problems we have in the euro zone periphery," he said at a conference organized by German newspaper Die Welt. Stark, who oversees the ECB's influential economics division, said policymakers needed to think twice before putting forward a soft debt restructuring as a way to tackle Greece's fiscal problems. Asked about a 'Plan B' for Greece, he reiterated the ECB's view that the only plan on the table at present was for the country's current fiscal programs to be implemented. On interest rates, he warned that central banks around the world needed to think about tightening monetary policy. "Monetary policy globally is still very expansionary. The situation at the height of the crisis was appropriate. It is no longer appropriate," he said. Stark also added to confusion over the position of fellow board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, who is being pressured by France and his native Italy to step down when countryman Mario Draghi takes the helm at the ECB later this year. So far, no country has ever occupied more than one of the six seats on the ECB's board. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Friday that Bini Smaghi had told him he would quit. Stark, however, suggested it may not be a done deal. "It is not written anywhere that there cannot be two members on the ECB Executive Board with the same nationality. I know that he (Bini Smaghi) has not signaled that he plans to step down and that he hasn't stepped down," Stark said.
