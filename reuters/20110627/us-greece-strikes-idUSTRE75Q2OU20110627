 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's main labor unions called on Monday for massive turnout in a 48 hour strike this week which they said could help overthrow the austerity policies imposed by international lenders as the price for a bailout. 

 ADEDY, the public sector union representing half a million civil servants and its private sector equivalent GSEE, which represents 2 million workers, have called the two-day stoppage to coincide with a vote in parliament which the government must win to avert the threat of immediate default. "The strike may prove a catalyst in overthrowing the austerity policies, helping the country to break loose from the chains of its lenders," ADEDY said in a statement on Monday. The European Union and International Monetary Fund have made approval of the painful mix of cuts, tax hikes and selloffs a condition for releasing a vital 12 billion euro loan tranche which the government needs to keep paying wages and benefits. ADEDY condemned the package, saying it would "wipe out the rights of workers and pensioners and throw the unemployed and the new generation into despair." The two unions are due to hold a joint rally at 11.00 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Tuesday with PAME, a communist workers' group holding a separate rally at the same time. They will hold a second set of rallies on Wednesday evening. Air traffic, buses, trains, postal services and hospitals are all expected to be hit, while police were also preparing to handle big demonstrations in Syntagma Square, outside parliament, which has become the focus of opposition to the austerity measures. OFFENSIVE GESTURE The rallies are expected to begin early on Tuesday with organizers planning to surround parliament on Wednesday. While Prime Minister George Panadreou's Socialist government survived a confidence motion earlier this month with 155 votes in the 300-member parliament, the protests will pile pressure on deputies who will have to explain their choice to angry voters. Furious protestors have held regular rallies outside parliament for weeks, chanting contemptuous slogans and waving their open hands at the shuttered windows, a highly offensive gesture in Greece. The popular anger inspired by the bitter EU/IMF medicine has deeply alarmed deputies, many of whom themselves doubt the measures will leave Greece's stricken economy capable of paying off a debt equivalent to 150 percent of gross domestic product. "We have stated that we cannot agree to a mistake. We are in favor of achieving the main goals -- eliminating deficits and reducing the debt," Yannis Mihelakis, spokesman of conservative New Democracy party said in a statement. "We cannot support a policy that deepens the recession and even undoes fiscal consolidation," he said.
