 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia said there were "multiple options" for its joint venture with Siemens AG, Nokia Siemens Networks, despite a report that talks to sell a controlling stake in the venture were failing. 

 "Multiple options continue to exist for NSN and these are reflective of the company's performance in terms of both innovation and financial results," Nokia told Reuters in an e-mail on Monday. "We're pleased with the turnaround that NSN is executing, and we remain focused on our plans to bolster NSN's competitiveness even further." The Wall Street Journal had reported that talks to sell a controlling stake in NSN to a consortium including private-equity firms Gores Group LLC and Platinum Equity LLC were not expected to succeed.
