 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Euro zone policymakers battling to keep a lid on the region's debt crisis must be ready to respond if Greek lawmakers block the country's new austerity measures, Germany's deputy finance minister said on Monday. 

 Joerg Asmussen said he expected the Greek parliament to vote through the 28 billion euro austerity package -- essential for clearance of the next tranche of Greece's EU/IMF bailout program -- but Europe needed to be prepared for the worst. "(A rejection) isn't Plan A, or the most likely outcome, but the euro zone and its financial sectors need to make preparations," Asmussen told a conference organized by newspaper Die Welt. European leaders are racing to agree terms on a further bailout for Greece, including a contribution from private banks which would agree to a "voluntary" rollover of their Greek debt. French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday the French government had a first draft deal of an agreement with banks in France to roll over their Greek debt holdings. Athens needs the 12 billion euro injection from the existing European Union and International Monetary Fund rescue fund to pay its bills next month and avert the euro zone's first sovereign default, which would send shockwaves through a jittery global financial system. Greek Defense Minister Panos Beglitis warned of "catastrophe" if parliament blocked the package of tax increases and spending cuts, after signs of revolt by some deputies in the ruling PASOK party. Clearance in Athens of the new savings program would enable euro zone finance ministers to reach a decision on fresh support for the debt-ridden nation at a meeting on July 3, Asmussen said. Meanwhile, Asmussen said, the euro was in danger of losing credibility. He also said Europe had now set up rescue mechanisms that prepared it for any future sovereign debt crises, and the debt crisis was not a currency crisis. "There is no euro crisis and there has never been one," he said, adding that, in budgetary terms, the euro zone was better situated than either Japan or the United States.
