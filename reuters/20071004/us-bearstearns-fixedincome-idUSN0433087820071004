 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc's BSC.N co-head of fixed-income said on Thursday that the credit markets have undergone a "massive repricing" that has largely passed and will unlikely lead to an economic recession. 

 "The market is undergoing a massive repricing," said Jeffrey Mayer, a co-head of fixed income, during a conference call with investors. "We think the distress that we saw during the summer is largely behind us." "We do not think we will enter a recessionary environment," said Mayer, who sees a "benign environment" for corporate defaults. Bear Stearns' bonds extended gains in morning trading after Bear Stearns President Alan Schwartz said earlier that marketplace liquidity is improving and the outlook is still relatively strong for investment banking. Spreads on Bear Stearns' 6.4 percent notes due 2017, which opened 7 basis points tighter at 177 basis points over Treasuries, tightened another 3 basis points after his remarks, according to MarketAxess.
