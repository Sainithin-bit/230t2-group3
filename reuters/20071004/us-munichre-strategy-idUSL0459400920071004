 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Munich Re ( MUVGn.DE ) is launching a new business strategy in the United States, the world's second-biggest reinsurer said on Thursday. 

 "The U.S. insurance/reinsurance market is not only the largest, but potentially one of the most profitable in the world," Munich Re said in a statement. "In order to maximize its position in this market, Munich Re is launching a new U.S. business strategy," it said, adding that it planned to announce details on October 9. "There is a restructuring," a Munich Re spokeswoman said. Earlier this year, Munich Re announced that Anthony Kuczinski would become chief executive of Munich Re America from January 1, 2008, taking over from John Phelan. Separately, Munich Re Chief Executive Nikolaus von Bomhard repeated the reinsurer's goal of making net profit of 3.5-3.8 billion euros ($4.9-$5.4 billion) this year and said it was well on its way to reaching the business growth goals of its "Changing Gear" program. Von Bomhard reiterated that Munich Re aimed to achieve average annual earnings per share growth of more than 10 percent in the 2007-2010 period, helped by its return of more than 8 billion euros to shareholders over the period. Since the second quarter of this year, Munich Re was more than halfway towards its goal of buying back 2 billion euros in shares by April 2008, von Bomhard said in slides prepared for a financial conference and released on its Internet site.
