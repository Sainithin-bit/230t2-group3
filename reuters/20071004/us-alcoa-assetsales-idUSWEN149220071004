 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum maker Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) said on Thursday it is close to selling both its packaging and consumer business and its automotive castings business. 

 It also plans to restructure its electrical and electronic solutions business in the Americas and Europe. As a result, Alcoa expects to record a total of $845 million in restructuring and impairment charges in the third quarter. These portfolio actions, combined with the recent sale of Alcoa's stake in Chinese aluminum maker, Chalco for $1.8 billion, will enhance its capital structure and add flexibility for growth and other initiatives to improve shareholder value, the Pittsbugh-based company said. They also allow Alcoa to focus on its core business of mining bauxite and producing alumina, which in turn is manufactured into aluminum. In a statement, the company said that it had completed a strategic review of its portfolio and decided to proceed with the sale of its Packaging and Consumer business, which includes such products as kitchen foil and wraps. Alcoa has received "strong indications from strategic buyers" for that business and plans to complete the transaction by late 2007 or early 2008, it said. The company is also near a definitive agreement to sell its Automotive Castings business and should close that transaction by the end of the year. Alcoa, which reports its third-quarter results next Tuesday, expects to record restructuring and impairment charges of $195 million for the electrical and electronic solutions business, $50 million for the automotive castings unit and $600 million for the sale of the packaging and consumer business. Analysts had said that Alcoa's sale of its stake in Chalco could help appease shareholders by giving the aluminum giant plenty of financial flexibility. Just a few months ago, Alcoa's hostile attempt to buy Canadian rival Alcan Inc AL.TO lost out to a substantially higher offer from an even larger metals company -- Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ). Industry sources had told Reuters last month that the company might plan on using cash from the sale of its near 7 percent stake in Aluminum Corp of China Ltd ( 2600.HK ) to do a share buyback or fund capital spending and restructuring.
