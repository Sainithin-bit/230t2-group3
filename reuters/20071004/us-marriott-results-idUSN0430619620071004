 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc MAR.N, the No. 2 U.S. hotel operator, on Thursday posted a decline in third-quarter profit and forecast future earnings below Wall Street expectations. 

 Marriott, which typically manages hotels instead of owning them, said net income fell to $131 million from $141 million because of lower timeshare profits as some properties sellout and due to a higher tax rate. Earnings per share were flat at 33 cents because of a lower share count in the third quarter this year compared to a year ago. On an adjusted basis, which excludes earnings from Marriott's synthetic fuel business, the company earned 31 cents per share, slightly higher than Wall Street analyst expectations of 30 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for the company, which operates hotels under brands such as Marriott, Ritz-Carlton, and Fairfield Inn, rose 12 percent to $3.04 billion, boosted by higher room rates. The company also added 50 hotels to its system of 2,942 properties. U.S. hotel companies have been enjoying a multiyear boom as robust demand and the limited construction of new hotels has allowed hoteliers to steadily raise rates. But there are concerns that the market in North America is cooling as the economy slows. As of Wednesday's close, Marriott shares have fallen 15 percent since hitting a 13-year high of $52.00 on April 18. WEAK OUTLOOK Marriott said it expected fourth-quarter earnings, excluding its synthetic fuel business, which it plans to shut down at the end of 2007, to be between 61 cents and 63 cents per share. The fourth-quarter forecast means the company expects its 2007 earnings to be between $1.88 and $1.90 per share, which is lower than a July forecast of $1.88 to $1.96. For 2008, the company forecast earnings of $2.10 to $2.25 per share. Both fourth-quarter and 2008 forecasts were below Wall Street expectations. Analysts, on average, had been expecting Marriott to earn 68 cents per share in the fourth quarter and $2.30 per share in 2008, according to Reuters Estimates.
