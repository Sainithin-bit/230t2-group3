 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said on Thursday that growth would slow in the fourth quarter but some of the tumult that racked global financial markets in August was subsiding. 

 "I think things are clearly better than they were back during that crisis period in August. It does take a while for a wound to heal and this process of healing is still at work," he told reporters after giving a speech here. Fisher, not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year, said the U.S. central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage point on Sept 18 to tackle a "freezing up of commerce" after credit markets seized. A slumping U.S. housing market provoked a wave of defaults in the subprime mortgage market for borrowers with risky credit, triggering a worldwide credit crunch as losses on investments backed by these assets spread far and wide. Equities have rebounded sharply since September's rate cut, but Fisher noted there were other parts of the credit market which remain under duress, naming asset-backed commercial paper and structured investment vehicles used by banks to boost returns. Fisher also disputed the notion that the Fed had reflated the stock market through its action last month. The rate cut was bolder than forecast in financial markets, which had been priced for a more measured quarter point reduction in the federal funds rate. "I don't think it is fair to say that the Fed has flooded the market with liquidity, which has gone straight into stocks. I don't think that is accurate," he said, noting that there is abundant liquidity in the world financial system. SLOWER GROWTH Investors believe the Fed will ease again by a quarter percentage point at its next scheduled meeting, on October 30-31, to shield the economy from the continuing fallout from tighter credit conditions following the market's summer woes. Fisher made clear that he expected growth to suffer somewhat as a result of the financial experience of the last few months, but that it had been chugging along at a pretty solid rate before the August market problems exploded. "I think we probably had a decent third quarter and I expect things to be slower than that in the fourth quarter," he told reporters, adding that third-quarter growth was probably above three percent. He declined to give an economic forecast for the final three months of the year. Fisher earlier delivered a speech to the Charlotte Economics Club in which he discussed the challenge posed by high oil prices in terms of both clouding the picture for underlying inflation and the potential impact on growth. Oil prices hit a fresh record above $80 a barrel last month, but Fisher noted the U.S. had weathered rising oil prices in the past and the recent episode was not denting the global economy. "Economic growth in other countries has not been derailed, which has kept demand for our exports at healthy levels. A weakening dollar has not hurt other countries' demand for our products, or their appetite for oil, which is priced in dollars," he said in the speech. The dollar has notched fresh record lows against the euro, and stronger earnings from exports are one of the brightest spots in the country's economic picture.
