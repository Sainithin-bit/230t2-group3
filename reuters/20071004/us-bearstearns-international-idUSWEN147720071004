 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N President Alan Schwartz said the investment bank intends to expand revenue from overseas by working with local institutions rather than building competing businesses in every market. 

 Schwartz, speaking at the firm's annual investor day, said Bear Stearns envisions an "asset-light" strategy where Bear would partner with local banks, providing global capital markets products and services on a "wholesale" basis. That strategy would expand the business without requiring the deployment of new "feet on the street" in new markets. Bear Stearns has suffered in comparison with its larger Wall Street rivals because it is still concentrated on U.S. markets, missing out on stronger growth in Europe and in Asia in recent years.
