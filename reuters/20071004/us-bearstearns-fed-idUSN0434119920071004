 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc's BSC.N global head of mortgages and asset backed securities said on Thursday the U.S. Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates by another 100 basis points to help ease the mortgage sector's current crisis. 

 Tom Marano also said he expected that further Fed rate cuts would come over the next three quarters and were likely to total from 50 to 100 basis points. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb )
