 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dollar General Inc on Thursday said it 
recalled nearly 63,000 Chinese-made Frankenstein tumblers due 
to dangerous levels of lead paint. 

  Several companies recalled Chinese-made children's items 
Thursday, including Kids II, which recalled 35,000 Baby 
Einstein Discover & Play Color Blocks due to lead paint.  This latest round of recalls comes on the heels of a summer 
in which millions of Mattel Inc MAT.N and RC2 Corp RCRC.O 
toys were pulled from shelves worldwide due to lead paint.  (Reporting by  Justin Grant )
