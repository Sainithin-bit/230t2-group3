 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stricken British mortgage lender Northern Rock NRK.L may have borrowed a further 2.9 billion pounds ($5.9 billion) from the Bank of England in the past week, according to Bank of England data. 

 The Bank of England's weekly accounts showed that its "other assets" -- the category which would include the Bank's "lender of last resort" support to Northern Rock -- rose by 2.9 billion pounds and have risen by 10.7 billion in the last three weeks. Simon Ward, economist at fund manager New Star, said this figure could be distorted by other factors, but was likely to be mainly due to lending to Northern Rock. The BoE offered emergency funding to the bank on September 14. The BoE and Northern Rock have refused to comment on how much the central bank has lent.
