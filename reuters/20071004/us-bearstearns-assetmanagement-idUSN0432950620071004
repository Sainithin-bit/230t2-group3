 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N is considering acquisitions of long-only, hedge fund and private equity managers to jump-start expansion of its money-management business, Bear Stearns Asset Management President Jeff Lane said on Thursday . 

 Lane, a former Neuberger Berman executive hired from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N three months ago, also expects to build out the investment bank's wealth-management business for high net worth people. Lane said the firm, which suffered embarrassing losses in mortgage funds earlier this year, continues to see positive fund flows. On the other hand, Lane warned that the departure of money manager James O'Shaughnessy will result in about $8 billion of the asset management division's $44 billion of assets leaving the bank. The impact on financial performance will be less severe, Lane added, since Bear Stearns has a revenue-sharing arrangement with O'Shaughnessy. O'Shaughnessy, who joined Bear in 2001, had previously disclosed he would leave the firm to open his own investing business, O'Shaughnessy Asset Management. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone )
