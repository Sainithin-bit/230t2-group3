 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc WEN.N said on Thursday sales at its company-owned hamburger restaurants open at least 15 months rose 0.2 percent in the third quarter. 

 At U.S. franchised locations, same-store sales rose 1.3 percent. Wendy's, the No. 3 burger chain behind McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) and Burger King BKC.N, has been considering a sale of the company, a recapitalization or another change in strategy as it seeks to improve sales and profits. "We are encouraged by another quarter of positive same-store sales -- our fifth in a row -- as we continue to successfully execute our strategic plan and turnaround," Chief Executive Kerrii Anderson said in a statement. During the year-earlier quarter, same-store sales at company-owned restaurants rose 4.1 percent, with 3.9 percent growth at U.S. franchised locations. Wendy's said that in the fourth quarter it will continue to promote its Super Value Menu and Combo Choices, which allows customers to mix-and-match their choice of sandwich, drink and side item. The hamburger chain began promoting the menu last month, which it said targets younger, price-sensitive consumers. Wendy's also said it finished the roll-out of its breakfast menu, which is available at 750 of its restaurants. The company reports its full third-quarter results later this month.
