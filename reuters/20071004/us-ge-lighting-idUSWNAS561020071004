 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A General Electric Co ( GE.N ) unit said on Thursday that it planned to restructure its lighting business, cutting some 900 jobs in Brazil and affecting another 500 in the United States and Mexico. 

 GE Consumer & Industrial said the cuts at the facilities in those countries are a continuation of an overall plan from the past year to cut more than 3,000 positions.
