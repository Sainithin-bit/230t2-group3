 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. commercial paper outstanding grew this week for the first time since August, suggesting that distress in the short-term debt markets is easing. 

 Signs of a tentative recovery in corporate lending were also underscored by executives at Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N, who said that marketplace liquidity is improving and the outlook is still relatively strong for investment banking. "You can just see the tension in the market ease," said Bear Stearns President Alan Schwartz, of the market's reaction to the U.S. Federal Reserve lowering the benchmark federal funds rate by a half-percentage point on September 18. U.S. and European credit spreads have tightened this week amid hopes that the worst of a global credit squeeze may be over. Credit markets improved further on Thursday as investors bet that jobs data on Friday will underscore the health of the U.S. economy. In one sign of the financial markets' recovery, U.S. commercial paper outstanding grew by $4.5 billion in the latest week to $1.860 trillion -- the market's first weekly rise since troubled subprime mortgages triggered a credit crisis in August, according to Federal Reserve data. "These data, combined with persistent declines in commercial paper rates, are clear evidence of stabilization in the commercial paper market," Tony Crescenzi, chief bond market strategist at Miller, Tabak & Co., said in a research note. Commercial paper had dropped precipitously this summer as the credit squeeze made it difficult for companies to raise funds in the short-term debt markets. Some pockets of the market are still weak. Asset-backed commercial paper continued to shrink because of mortgage-related problems. The amount outstanding fell by $6.1 billion to $906.2 billion. "Investors are not likely to have an appetite for buying any asset-backed debt tied the mortgage market for years to come," Crescenzi said. MORE CUTS? Tom Morano, Bear Stearns' global head of mortgages and asset-backed securities, said on Thursday the Fed needs to cut interest rates by another 100 basis points to help ease the mortgage sector's crisis. Other Bear Stearns officials sounded optimistic notes, however, during investor presentations. "We think the distress that we saw during the summer is largely behind us," Jeffrey Mayer, a co-head of fixed income, said during a conference call. Wall Street's No. 5 brokerage by market value, Bear Stearns had a turbulent summer with the collapse of two hedge funds and the ouster of co-president Warren Spector. The credit markets have undergone a "massive repricing" that has largely passed and is not likely to lead to an economic recession, Mayer added. The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, continues to pump liquidity into the banking system. The U.S. central bank on Thursday said it added $24 billion of temporary reserves to the banking system via a seven-day repurchase agreement. Global central banks have stepped up liquidity injections since early August to combat the credit squeeze. European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Thursday that risks to euro zone economic growth lay to the downside, partly due to financial market uncertainty. But Trichet said the ECB was ready to act to counter inflation, despite leaving interest rates on hold at 4 percent. Trichet also said he stood by the ECB's basic position that euro zone growth would be sustained around its long-term trend, despite the increased uncertainty and that inflation risks pointed to the upside.
