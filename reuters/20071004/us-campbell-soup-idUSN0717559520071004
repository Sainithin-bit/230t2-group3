 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ) said on Thursday it would realign its North American businesses to streamline its management structure. 

 The company's U.S. soup, sauces and beverages retail division -- known as Campbell USA -- its North America Foodservice and Stockpot unit and its Canadian business will now be known as North American Soup, Sauces and Beverages, and be led by Denise Morrison. Those three units had sales of about $4.5 billion last year, Campbell said in a statement. Morrison, who became the president of Campbell USA in 2005, will report to Chief Executive Douglas Conant. Campbell also said that Mark Sarvary, president of Campbell North America since 2004, would leave the company. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage )
