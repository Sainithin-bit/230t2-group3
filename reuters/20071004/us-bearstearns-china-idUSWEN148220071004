 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N isn't looking for an equity infusion, but would consider selling a stake to an investor from China or the Middle East if it was part of a transaction that created value, its chief executive said on Thursday. 

 James Cayne also told investors and analysts that he has been spending much of his time meeting with Bear Stearns prime brokerage clients to convince them to keep their investment balances with the firm. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb )
