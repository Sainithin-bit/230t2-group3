 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Shareholders agreed on Thursday to change DaimlerChrysler AG's ( DAIGn.DE ) name to simply Daimler AG, drawing the curtain on a failed $36 billion 1998 merger between Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and U.S.-based Chrysler Corp. 

 The vote at an extraordinary shareholders meeting was nearly 99 percent in favor of the change, the company said. (Reporting by Arno Schuetze, writing by Michael Shields, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
