 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc's BSC.N underlying business has not been permanently harmed by recent market turmoil, despite "a lot of bad and ugly" in the investment bank's third-quarter results, Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro said on Thursday. 

 "The revenue-generating capacity of this franchise has not been permanently impaired," Molinaro said in a presentation to analysts. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone )
