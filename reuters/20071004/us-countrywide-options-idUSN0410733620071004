 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N was ordered to give confidential information about its stock-grant practices to a pension fund that claims it gave executive stock rights at "unusually suspicious and lucrative times," the Los Angeles Times reported on its Web site. 

 A ruling issued late on Tuesday in Delaware Chancery Court, demands that Countrywide turn over "minutes, notes, presentations, slides" and other materials regarding stock options granted to Countrywide officers or executives, the article said. According to the article, Countrywide said in a statement that the suit "presented no credible evidence of wrongdoing relating to the purported manipulation of option grants." Countrywide was not immediately available for comment to Reuters. The ruling was made in response to a suit from the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees' Retirement System, a Countrywide investor, according to the report. The court also ordered Countrywide to give the retirement plan any information that Countrywide may have produced for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the New York Stock Exchange and the Department of Justice, in connection with any investigation into Countrywide's stock option grants, the Times reported.
