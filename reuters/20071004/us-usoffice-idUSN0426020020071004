 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office rent growth slowed in the third quarter, suggesting that rental growth has peaked and that some office building buyers who relied on strong increases could find it harder to repay their loans, real estate research firm Reis said. 

 The rate of rental growth in the third quarter sputtered for the first time since it began its ascent in early 2005, according to the Reis report released on Thursday. "The last quarter was the peak in the office market in terms of fundamentals gains," Reis Chief Economist Sam Chandan said. Effective rent -- the amount paid net of free months or tenant improvements -- rose 2.4 percent to $24.17 per square foot in the third quarter, more slowly than the prior quarter's 3.1 percent. The slowdown may become a burden on landlords -- who based their ability to cover their loans on rental growth increasing as it did over the past two years. The rents may not be able to cover their debt payments. "In many of the leading markets, underwriting expectations may not be met over the next year," Chandan said. ""In general, property performance is falling a little bit short of the underwriting expectations." The slip in rental growth has slowed sales during the summer, when the credit markets seized as investors demanded more payment for risk and lenders closely scrutinized buyers' rent assumptions. That could hurt private buyers, such as Harry Macklowe, whom the Wall Street Journal reported is trying to refinance the $5.1 billion worth of short-term debt used to buy seven New York properties from Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ). As real estate demand is essentially local, growth rates varied greatly in the third quarter throughout the 79 markets Reis tracks. Austin, Texas, saw the highest effective rental growth, at 5.6 percent, with New York following closely with 5.4 percent. San Jose, California; Houston, San Francisco, Boston, Seattle and Las Vegas also posted growth rates ahead of the national average. Tacoma, Washington, and Los Angeles, at 2.3 percent and 2.2 percent growth, rounded out the top 10. Most of the publicly traded real estate investment trusts focus on the strongest markets, such as New York, Boston, San Francisco and Los Angeles. SL Green Corp ( SLG.N ), Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ), Boston Properties Inc ( BXP.N ) and Brookfield Properties Corp ( BPO.TO ) should benefit from the numbers, Green Street Advisors analyst Cedrik Lachance said. Yet, as strong as those figures were, rental growth still slowed in New York, San Jose, San Francisco, Seattle, and Los Angeles, according to Reis. On the other hand, the national vacancy rate fell to its lowest level in six years, and despite the slowing demand for office space, the constrained supply is likely to provide a support for rents, Chandan said. At the end of the third quarter, the national office vacancy rate stood at 12.5 percent, down 0.2 percentage point from the second quarter. "We do face softening demand, but we do that as an industry from the fundamentals prospective with both feet on the ground," he said. "Where we do have issues and are significantly concerned is with respect to pricing and the quality of underwriting. The pressures on fundamentals are not the same."
