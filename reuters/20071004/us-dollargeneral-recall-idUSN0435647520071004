 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dollar General Inc on Thursday said it recalled nearly 63,000 Chinese-made Frankenstein tumblers due to dangerous levels of lead paint. 

 Several companies recalled Chinese-made children's items Thursday, including Kids II, which recalled 35,000 Baby Einstein Discover & Play Color Blocks due to lead paint. This latest round of recalls comes on the heels of a summer in which millions of Mattel Inc and RC2 Corp toys were pulled from shelves worldwide due to lead paint.
