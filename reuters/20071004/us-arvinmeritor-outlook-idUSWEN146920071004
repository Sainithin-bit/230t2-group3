 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Car and truck parts maker ArvinMeritor Inc ARM.N on Wednesday warned that its fiscal 2007 fourth quarter and fiscal 2008 results will be hurt by weaker than expected market conditions in North America. 

 "In North America, we are encountering a weaker than anticipated economic environment in our Commercial Vehicle Systems business group resulting from decreased freight volumes largely due to the decline in housing construction," Chief Financial Officer Jim Donlon said in a statement. "We are incurring premium freight and labor inefficiencies mainly in Europe, associated with unanticipated demand for higher production of truck parts, which is creating capacity issues for the entire supply chain," Donlon added. Fiscal fourth-quarter results will be hurt by 20 cents a share due to these market conditions, and be reduced by another 20 cents a share for one-time items, the Troy, Michigan-based company said in the statement.
