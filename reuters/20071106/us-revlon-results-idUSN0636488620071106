 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cosmetics maker Revlon Inc ( REV.N ) on Tuesday posted a narrower quarterly loss that beat Wall Street expectations, and said it expects to surpass its adjusted earnings forecast for fiscal 2007, sending its shares up nearly 6 percent. 

 The company said that it now expects to exceed $210 million in adjusted earnings -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization -- in 2007, which it had forecast earlier. Its net loss in the third quarter was $10.4 million, or 2 cents a share, compared with a loss of $100.5 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Four analysts, on average, had expected it to post a loss of 8 cents a share excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue rose 11 percent to $339.7 million; analysts had been expecting $313.6 million. Sales rose 19.7 percent in the United States and were up 1.6 percent internationally. While sales were strong in the eye makeup category, that was offset by weakness in the face, lip and nail product segments, Revlon Chief Executive David Kennedy said in a statement. The company cut its net expenses by nearly $10 million in the quarter, as it continued to focus on its ongoing restructuring plan. For 2008, the company said it will launch an extensive product lineup in its Revlon and Almay color makeup segments. The company, which has already stepped up its marketing spending, said it will continue to do so for its new products. Revlon's shares, which have traded in the range of $1.75 per share to $1.01 per share in the past year or so, were up 5.98 percent at $1.24 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
