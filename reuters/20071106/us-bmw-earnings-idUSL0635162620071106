 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - BMW ( BMWG.DE ), the world's largest premium carmaker, reported third-quarter profit that lagged forecasts on Tuesday, disappointing investors for a third straight quarter and sending its shares lower. 

 Derivative losses and rising writedowns for model launches meant earnings before tax rose only 6.3 percent to 765 million euros ($1.11 billion), missing the average estimate of 913 million euros in a Reuters poll of 20 analysts. "BMW is one of the world's only car companies to have disappointed profit expectations in the third quarter. The competitive gap between BMW and its luxury peers has never appeared wider," Morgan Stanley wrote to clients. Equity investors punished the stock, which fell nearly 5 percent at one point, and UniCredit recommended bondholders attracted by its solid finances to take an underweight stance on BMW debt due to a more "challenging earnings environment". Management voiced dissatisfaction with the results but refused to sound the alarm and focused instead on its operating result before a financial loss of over 200 million euros. "A company capable of generating earnings before interest and tax of 973 million euros is not a restructuring case," Chief Executive Norbert Reithofer told reporters, "somewhat irritated" as he put it. With substantial profit growth at Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes-Benz Cars, Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) Audi division and Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) and corresponding gains in their respective share prices BMW's underperformance stands out. Mercedes-Benz Cars earned about 1 billion euros more in nine-month operating profit than BMW's manufacturing operations, after it took drastic measures to restructure following a record 954 million euro loss in the first quarter of 2005 -- when BMW was still boasting a pretax automotive margin of 7.1 percent. The Munich carmaker's archrival now targets a 10 percent operating margin by 2010 at the latest, while BMW does not forecast it will earn that kind of return for another two years after that. BMW expressed confidence that it would meet the target for record 2007 pretax profit of more than 3.75 billion euros thanks to the over 400,000 cars it plans to sell in the fourth quarter. Its guidance implies pretax profit would have to grow by over a fifth to more than 1.07 billion euros in the final quarter alone, after averaging just 894 million per quarter. FOREX PAIN In the third quarter, analysts pointed to weaker than expected profits at BMW's core automotive division and a significantly higher loss on its "Reconciliations" line -- which eliminates revenue and profit booked twice in the accounts when BMW leases a new car. Frankfurt brokerage Equinet said the "Reconciliations" charge accounted for more than 100 million pounds of the shortfall in profits. Finance chief Michael Ganal attributed the sizeable loss at this non-operational segment to a higher leasing penetration rate along with fair value losses on U.S. interest rate derivatives used to hedge against higher debt payments. Formerly head of sales, Ganal took over as finance chief last month and signaled on Tuesday changes could be made to BMW's much-maligned policy of financially hedging its foreign exchange risk that has cost it hundreds of millions each year. "We're constantly examining how advantageous our foreign exchange strategy is, and naturally we have thought about, do think about and will think about alternative models," he said on a day when the euro marked a fresh record high to the dollar and traded close to its all-time peak against the Japanese yen. At the end of September and just over a year into the job, CEO Reithofer also unveiled the results of his strategic review designed to place BMW on a course for profitable growth well into the next decade. Despite plans to sell significantly more than 2 million cars by 2020, save some 6 billion euros in future costs and lift its core automotive division's operating margin to 8-10 percent by 2012, investors criticized Reithofer's vision as unambitious. Before Tuesday's drop, BMW shares had already fallen some 8 percent since the day Reithofer announced his long-term plans.
