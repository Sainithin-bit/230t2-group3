 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup may be broken, but to some investors, that doesn't mean it can't be fixed. 

 Citigroup shares have lost a quarter of their value since October 12, as the company has recorded billions of dollars of write-offs for mortgage-linked assets, predicted more asset value declines, and accepted the resignation of its chief executive, Chuck Prince. To some investors, the poor operating performance is a sign that Citi should think hard about dividing itself up, because getting its many parts to operate well together would take too long. "You can bring in a good operator (as chief executive), but how long is it going to take to turn around a company like that? It's not going to happen overnight, and the stock is in a freefall," said Lee Delaporte, director of research at Dreman Value Management, which has some $22 billion of assets and has sold its Citigroup holdings. Sandy Weill, who retired as Citi's chief executive in 2003 and its chairman in 2006, built up Citigroup through a series of acquisitions over a decade and a half. It is now the largest bank by assets in the United States and operates in more than 100 countries. Chuck Prince himself seemed to recognize the difficulty of turning around the bank when he referred to Citi as a "battleship" in January. The now-former chief executive spent much of the last several years trying to stitch different parts of the Citi business together, through measures such as getting U.S. retail brokers to work more closely with consumer bankers. Prince expressed cautious optimism earlier this year that the strategy was working, but any gains from efficiencies and improved cooperation have been more than overwhelmed by credit costs. Still, many investors are not interested in dividing up Weill's creation. They see the bank's woes so far as stemming from poor execution rather than being on the wrong course. Citi is not so different from many other banks globally, which have brokerage divisions, retail and commercial banks, investment banks, and private wealth management businesses. "There's nothing that Citi does that 15 other banks don't do," said one former Citi executive. A SOUR CULTURE Many investors, not to mention current and former employees, criticize Prince for having failed to create a cohesive culture at Citigroup and for doing little to improve declining morale. Marshall Front, chairman at Front Barnett Associates LLC in Chicago, said, "We need someone who is a process manager, who will take the time and make the investments that are necessary to knit this organization together." Citi has a number of strong businesses, and can generate powerful results, said Chuck Carnevale, Chief Investment Officer at Great Companies LLC. "To just break it up and throw it away is a little bit irresponsible," Carnevale said. Citigroup's management now seems inclined to agree. The new chairman, Robert Rubin, told Reuters on Sunday that Prince had the board of director's support when it came to strategy. "This is absolutely the right track," Rubin said. If Citi is on the right track, it's been a bumpy one. The bank's shares fell 4.9 percent on Monday. They have fallen more than 35 percent this year, and are trading at their lowest levels since March 2003.
