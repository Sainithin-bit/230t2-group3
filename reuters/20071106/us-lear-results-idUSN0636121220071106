 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Lear Corp ( LEA.N ) posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, supported by restructuring and new business outside North America, and raised its full-year earnings forecast. 

 Lear reported net income of $41 million, or 52 cents per share, for the third quarter, compared with a net loss of $74 million, or $1.10 per share, a year earlier. Results included $37.3 million of restructuring and $8 million of other items. Excluding those restructuring and special items, Lear earned 92 cents per share, while analysts on average expected it to earn 17 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Lear, which completed the divestiture of its interiors business earlier in 2007, said sales in its core seating and electrical businesses rose 7.8 percent to $3.57 billion. Analysts expected Lear to report sales of $3.35 billion. The company left intact its forecast for sales, excluding the interiors business, of about $15 billion in 2007 and raised its forecast for core operating earnings to $680 million for the year, from a prior range of $600 million to $640 million. Lear said it expects 2008 net sales and core operating earnings excluding restructuring to be about in line with its 2007 forecast.
