 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Emerson Electric Co ( EMR.N ) reported a rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by a weak U.S. dollar and strong results from its network power and process management units. 

 Earnings increased to $623 million, or 78 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended on September 30 from $526 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue rose 11 percent to $6.13 billion. St. Louis-based Emerson, whose products range from technology used in energy production to motors, tools and storage products, said it expected fiscal 2008 earnings to be 10 percent to 15 percent above the $2.66 per share earned in fiscal 2007.
