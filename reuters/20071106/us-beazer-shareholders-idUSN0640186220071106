 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CtW Investment Group, which represents union pension funds as shareholders, on Tuesday called on the board of Beazer Homes USA Inc ( BZH.N ) to oust Chief Executive Officer Ian J. McCarthy. 

 In a letter to the chairman of Beazer's Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee, the group, whose union clients hold about 300,000 Beazer shares, said it also wants the board to name an independent chairman and establish a legal and regulatory compliance committee. The letter was prompted by Beazer's Monday announcement that it cut 25 percent of its work force last month, is suspending its quarterly dividend and expects to take at least $230 million in charges against fourth-quarter results. "The board here has been dancing," Michael Garland, CtW director of Value Strategies, said. "They haven't really taken the aggressive board action that's going to send a message to shareholders that the board isn't going to tolerate failure. It goes to accountability to massive past failure, but most importantly getting this company back on track before it's too late." A Beazer reprehensive could not be reached for immediate comment. In addition to the severe downturn in the U.S. housing market, Beazer is weathering a regulatory scandal and an accounting mess. Its mortgage unit is the subject of a federal investigation into past lending practices. After the board commissioned a review of the matter, it found unrelated inappropriate accounting and said it would be forced to restate results of prior years.
