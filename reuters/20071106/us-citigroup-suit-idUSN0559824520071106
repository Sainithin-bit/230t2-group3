 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A beneficiary of Citigroup's employee retirement plans has sued the largest U.S. bank and certain of its officials, saying they imprudently invested the assets of the plans in the company's common stock. 

 Stephen Gray, a beneficiary of the Citigroup 401(k) plan, sued the company, Charles Prince, who resigned as CEO on Sunday, and others, saying they should have known Citigroup securities were no longer a prudent investment, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. "We believe it is without merit. We plan to defend it vigorously," Citigroup spokeswoman Shannon Bell said. The complaint alleged that such investment was imprudent due to Citigroup's "serious mismanagement and improper business practices" including making subprime loans on a "low documentation" basis and failing to adequately disclose subprime loan loss exposure to investors. "The company was seriously mismanaged and faced dire financial crisis due to such mismanagement," the complaint said. "They failed to take steps to eliminate or reduce the amount of company stock in the plans." Gray brought the suit on behalf of the those who were members of the pension plans between January 1 and November 5. Citigroup's stock fell about 30.5 percent between June 19 and November 2, the complaint said. It said the plans lost more than $1.3 billion in retirement savings since January 1. Earlier on Monday, Citigroup reduced its third-quarter earnings as its losses on subprime mortgages and other risky securities climbed. The New York commercial and investment bank said the reduction reflected the lower value of $43 billion in collateralized debt obligations. Citigroup shares closed down 4.85 percent at $35.90.
