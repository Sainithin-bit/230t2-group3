 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hospital chain Tenet Healthcare Corp ( THC.N ) posted a smaller quarterly loss on Tuesday as it took in more revenue per patient, and reported some encouraging admission trends, sending shares higher. 

 The Dallas-based company said its third-quarter net loss narrowed to $59 million, or 12 cents per share, from $89 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, a loss of 6 cents per share was a penny better than analyst expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Net operating revenue increased 7.5 percent to $2.21 billion. Tenet is trying to turn itself around following several financial scandals. Its troubles have hurt ties with doctors, leading many to flee its networks, taking their insured patients with them. Tenet shares rose 36 cents, or 11.1 percent, to $3.59 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are still off about 48 percent this year. JP Morgan analyst Andreas Dirnagl said some may view the third-quarter results as early signs of a turnaround. "We would be cautious, given that we think Tenet has a long way to go before victory can be declared," Dirnagl said in a research note. Hospital admissions for those operated by Tenet at least a year fell 0.8 percent to 135,979. Bear Stearns analyst Jason Gurda said that decline was an improvement over the 2.2 percent fall in the second quarter. In-patient revenue per admission rose 7.8 percent. Unpaid patient debt as a percentage of revenue -- a key measure for the hospital sector -- was essentially flat at 7.2 percent. Tenet last year entered into a $900 million settlement over allegations of defrauding Medicare with the U.S. government.
