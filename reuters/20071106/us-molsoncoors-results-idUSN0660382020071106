 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Molson Coors Brewing Co ( TAP.N ) TAPa.TO said on Tuesday that quarterly net profit fell slightly on one-time items and weak sales in Britain. 

 The maker of Molson Canadian and Coors Light said net income dipped nearly 1 percent to $134.7 million, or 74 cents per share, from $135.8 million, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company said income from continuing operations was 95 cents per share, beating the analysts' average forecast of 92 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose 6.9 percent to $1.69 billion, but beer sales by volume fell 0.2 percent to 11.2 million barrels, due mostly to the impact of colder-than-usual weather in the UK. The No. 2 U.S.-listed brewer behind Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) was formed by the 2005 merger of Canadian brewer Molson Inc and U.S. rival Adolph Coors Co. Last month, Molson said it had agreed to combine its U.S. operations with those of SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ).
