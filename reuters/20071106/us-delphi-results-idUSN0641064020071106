 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK reported a narrower quarterly loss on Tuesday but continued to take charges for its reorganization. 

 Delphi said it was beginning to see the benefits of reduced labor costs but it still faces considerable challenges due to substantial cuts in production at former parent General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) in North America in recent years. GM spun off Delphi in 1999, but remains Delphi's main supplier and the parts supplier's biggest customer. Increases in the cost of commodities such as copper, aluminum, silver, steel and petroleum-based resins also put pressure on the company, Delphi said in a quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Delphi reported a net loss of $1.17 billion, or $2.08 per share, for the third quarter, compared with a net loss of $1.97 billion, or $3.51 per share, a year earlier, when Delphi had $1 billion of charges for employee cuts. The latest loss included $369 million for interest expense on prepetition claims to be paid in the reorganization, $244 million of charges for worker cuts in North America, $124 million for warranty matters and $112 million for employee terminations and other costs. Revenue rose to $6.22 billion from $6.01 billion. Revenue from customers other than GM rose 5.4 percent to $3.6 billion in the quarter, representing about 58 percent of total sales. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, recently filed a proposed revised reorganization plan and said it expected to emerge from court protection in the first quarter of 2008.
