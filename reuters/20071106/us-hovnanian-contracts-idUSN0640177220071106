 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Orders and sales for new homes fell and cancellations rose at upscale U.S. home builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc ( HOV.N ) during the company's fiscal fourth quarter. 

 The company said on Tuesday that the October sales pace in most of its markets "significantly deteriorated" when compared with recent months and that set by its September promotional sale. Hovnanian's problems reflect the U.S. housing industry's protracted decline, as it was the first major builder to include October results in its preliminary accounts. Shares of Hovnanian were off nearly 4 percent in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange touching a new intraday low of $9.70. Hovnanian said preliminary results for the fiscal fourth-quarter ended October 31, showed that excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, net contracts fell 10 percent to 2,781 homes, while sales slid 19 percent to 3,969 homes. Would-be buyers canceled contracts at a rate of 40 percent, as many found themselves unable to qualify for mortgages. The cancellation rate rose from 35 percent in the prior quarter as well as the year-earlier quarter. Other home builders, such as Beazer Homes USA Inc ( BZH.N ), also blamed high cancellation rates on tighter mortgage requirements as a result of the subprime mortgage market meltdown. A glut of homes for sale and buyer concern about economic weakness have home builders scrambling to strengthen their balance sheets to weather the market decline, which began more than 18 months ago. Hovnanian, based in Red Bank, New Jersey, said its contract backlog at the end of October, excluding unconsolidated joint ventures, was 5,938 homes, down 30 percent from last year. Hovnanian said it was focusing on shoring up its balance sheet and generating cash. It said it cut debt by $390 million in the fourth quarter, retired the remaining $140 million of its $150 million 10.5 percent senior notes and reduced the amount drawn under its $1.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility by $250 million to $206 million. "While Hovnanian's debt paydown and solid fourth-quarter cash flow generation are positives, we believe the net impact of this announcement is negative, as it points to a further softening of conditions in October, which we note is an initial data point that the market continue to soften following the Sept-end quarters of most builders," JP Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut, wrote in a research note. Hovnanian's shares were trading at $10.04, down 7 cents in early afternoon trade. (Additional reporting by Neetha Mahadevan in Bangalore,  Ben Klayman  in Chicago,  Ilaina Jonas  in New York)
