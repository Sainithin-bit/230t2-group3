 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent refiner Valero Energy Corp ( VLO.N ) said on Tuesday its quarterly earnings fell 20 percent, but its shares rose on news it was considering selling its Aruba refinery. 

 That refinery, with processing capacity of 285,000 barrels per day, does not produce gasoline, the company said, and has suffered power outages that would require Valero to spend heavily to upgrade the plant. "A large capital investment is required to make this competitive in the long run, thus we have decided to look at our strategic alternatives," Chairman and Chief Executive Bill Klesse told a conference call. A sale of the Aruba plant could bring $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion, according to a Bank of America note to investors. Net income in the third quarter fell to $1.27 billion, or $2.09 a share, from $1.60 billion, or $2.55 a share, in the year-ago period. Excluding items, the company posted quarterly earnings from continuing operations of $1.40 a share. On that basis, the earnings beat the analysts' consensus forecast of $1.35 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts had sharply cut their forecast for the quarter last month from $2.01 per share after the company's October warning that its earnings would fall to between $1.30 to $1.40 per share. Revenue in the quarter rose to $22.5 billion from $21.0 billion. Valero sold its Lima, Ohio refinery to Canada's Husky Energy ( HSE.TO ) for $1.9 billion earlier this year as part of a review of its assets. The sale dropped the company's total refinery capacity to slightly below 2.2 million barrels per day, behind the No. 1 refiner ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ). The company also announced it would proceed with the expansion of its St. Charles refinery that would increase its capacity to produce ultra low sulfur diesel. Valero's shares were up 4.3 percent to $72.39 per share on the New York Stock Exchange, outpacing the 2.3 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's Energy index .GSPE. Valero had warned investors in October that its third quarter earnings would fall short of expectations as the run in crude oil prices to record levels squashed its refining margins, and it said on Tuesday the current quarter remained tough. The sharp contraction in refining margins from the record levels reached in the second quarter have eroded earnings at all the major U.S. refiners as crude oil prices rallied versus the prices in gasoline and other products. "So far in the fourth quarter, the margin environment has been difficult as prices for refined products have failed to keep pace with the increase in feedstock costs," Valero's Klesse said. But margins had improved in recent days with diesel fuel a rare bright spot, he added.
