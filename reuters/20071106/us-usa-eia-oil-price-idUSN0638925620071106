 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Tuesday sharply raised its 2008 oil price forecast to nearly $80 a barrel and said extra OPEC production may fail to stanch falling inventories. 

 The U.S. Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Department of Energy, raised its forecast for U.S. oil prices to $79.92 per barrel from $73.50 per barrel in its previous forecast. U.S. crude oil futures on Tuesday jumped more than $3 a barrel to a record $97.10, closing in on the key $100 level, as a weak U.S. dollar and tight fuel stocks kept markets on edge ahead of the winter heating season. "Rising oil consumption and the realization that additional OPEC production may not be sufficient to arrest the inventory decline are keeping markets firm," the EIA said in its monthly report. The EIA added that the primary threat to sustained oil demand growth was the possibility that high energy prices and continued turmoil in the financial markets could undermine the economy. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, source of more than a third of the world's oil, has agreed to raise production by 500,000 bpd from November 1. But the group has shrugged off calls for additional oil from the United States and other big global consumers. U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman on Monday said current prices were a "terrible problem" for consumers, adding he hoped producer group OPEC would ramp up output to ease prices. Many OPEC officials have rejected that call.  The EIA said that OPEC's 2008 output could average 31.7 million bpd, 700,000 bpd more than projected fourth-quarter levels. Supplies from non-OPEC producers like Brazil, Russia and Canada could rise by 900,000 bpd, with Russia accounting for about half that increase, the EIA said. But growth in non-OPEC supply will lag global oil consumption growth until the second half of 2008, leaving OPEC to fill the gap, EIA said. Meanwhile the EIA called for dwindling U.S. crude oil inventories. U.S. stocks at the end of the fourth quarter were pegged at 300.5 million barrels, down 14.2 million barrels from EIA's previous forecast. Likewise, the EIA cut stocks at the end of the first quarter of 2008 by 11.4 million barrels to 320.4 million barrels. U.S. stocks mirror declining inventories held by industrialized nations that form the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD. The EIA said stocks held by OECD members will end 2007 below their five-year average, and drop to the lower end of their five-year range in 2008 even with additional OPEC production. Last year, OECD stocks ended September 152 million barrels above their five-year range.
