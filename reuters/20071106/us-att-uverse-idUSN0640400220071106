 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Tuesday that it will spend more than planned on U-verse, but scaled back its outlook on how widely the high-speed Internet and video service will be available by the end of next year. 

 The top U.S. phone company said it expects total spending on the service from January 2007 through the end of 2008 to be between $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, up $500 million from its previous outlook. The new spending will be used largely to deploy the service in the southeast United States, the company said. An AT&T spokesman said it expects to make U-verse, which aims to compete with cable providers' all-in-one packages of Internet, phone and video, available to about 17 million homes by the end of 2008, with significant expansion in following years. That was down from a previous target for an expansion to 18 million homes by the end of next year. AT&T had made a similar change to its outlook in May, raising its spending forecast and trimming its expansion plan from an initial estimate of 19 million homes by end-2008. AT&T said more details will be announced at an analyst conference on December 11. Investors have been waiting for the company to outline its plans for expanding U-verse in the former BellSouth territory. AT&T bought BellSouth late last year. Shares of AT&T were down 11 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $39.93 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have risen more than 15 percent from a year ago, helped by growth in wireless and Internet subscribers. AT&T's third-quarter results showed it was installing U-verse in nearly 10,000 homes per week. Technicians currently take about seven hours for every installation. While some investors have been wary of the high spending in U-verse, many analysts have said the service was necessary to stop subscribers from switching to cable providers. U-verse is also seen to be more cost-conscious compared with Verizon Communications Inc's ( VZ.N ) Internet and video service FiOS, which is delivered over an all-fiber network. AT&T makes use of existing copper lines between homes and neighborhood "nodes".
