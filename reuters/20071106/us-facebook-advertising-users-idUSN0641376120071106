 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet social network Facebook now has 50 million users, reaching the mark two months ahead of the company's expectations, Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said on Tuesday. 

 Once a destination for college students to share experiences and plan social outings, Facebook has grown by opening its doors to the general public to set up personal pages, and to software developers to offer applications. Microsoft Corp last month took a minority investment in Facebook that valued the privately held company at $15 billion.
