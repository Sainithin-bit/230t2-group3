 DEARBORN, Michigan  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. has pledged total funding of $15.4 billion for a new trust fund that will take over its obligation to pay health care for union-represented retirees, according to documents prepared by the United Auto Workers union. 

 UAW officials met on Monday in Dearborn, Michigan to review the union's just-negotiated tentative contract on wages and benefits. A copy of the highlights of the proposed deal prepared by UAW officials was made available to Reuters. According to the document, Ford agreed to pay $2.2 billion into the retiree trust fund -- known as a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA -- before 2010. The remainder of the funding would be made after that date, according to the document.
