 (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ) said on Friday it entered into an employment agreement with Chief Executive William Lynch to continue in his post for another two years, according to a filing. 
 The largest U.S. bookstore chain said Lynch will receive the same compensation and benefits as before, but get an additional cash bonus of $1.8 million for his role in attracting investments from Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) and Pearson PLC ( PSON.L ) in forming Nook Media LLC, according to the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The agreement provides Barnes & Noble with the right to assign Lynch as chief executive of Nook, the company's e-reader and tablet business, if the company is separated. Lynch would receive a cash retention bonus of $1.5 million in that case. (SEC filing:  link.reuters.com/zur56t ) The company said in February that its Chairman Leonard Riggio planned to make an offer for the main bookstore business, but not its Nook and e-book business and its college bookstores. Barnes & Noble said it would evaluate the sale of its retail business. Barnes & Noble Inc reported a quarterly net loss in February, due to a sharp decline in sales in its Nook device and e-books business, as well as lower sales at its bookstores and college bookstore chain.
