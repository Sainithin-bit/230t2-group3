 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) is considering buying a 25 percent stake in India's Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd, a telecommunications venture controlled by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, for $3.5 billion, the Times of India newspaper reported. 
 Such a deal would represent the largest foreign direct investment in India and would value the company at $14 billion, the report said. A spokesman for AT&T declined to comment on the report. Ambani, who controls conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd ( RELI.NS ), is India's richest man. The telecommunications venture aims to break even within three years of its launch, according to the report. (Reporting By Susan Kelly; editing by Gunna Dickson)
