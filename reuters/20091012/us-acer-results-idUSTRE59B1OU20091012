 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - Acer ( 2353.TW ), the world's third-biggest PC brand, said it expected to report a third-quarter net profit of about T$3.45 billion , as PC shipments climb on the back of back-to-school demand. 

 The company also expected PC shipments in the fourth quarter to climb from the preceding three months, it said in a statement on Monday. The market was expecting a net profit of T$3.42 billion, according to a poll of 15 analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (Reporting by Kelvin Soh; Editing by Dan Lalor)
