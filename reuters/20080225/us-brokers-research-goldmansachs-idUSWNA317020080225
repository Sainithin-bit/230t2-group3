 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it expects additional writedowns of about $1 billion to $12 billion each for several U.S. large-cap brokers in the first quarter, with Citigroup ( C.N ) estimated to record the highest amount of about $12 billion. 

 Goldman expects these writedowns to be spread across residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities and leveraged loans. The combination of a slowing global economy and a continued correction in financial asset values will dampen 2008 earnings and returns for the investment banks, it said. Goldman lowered its first-quarter and 2008 estimates for its large-cap universe which includes Bear Stearns BSC.N, Lehman LEH.N, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N to reflect continued challenges in the credit markets.
