 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Shares of electronics maker Sharp Corp 
( 6753.T ) jumped 5.2 percent on Monday after a source said that 
Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) was planning to start buying TV-use liquid 
crystal display (LCD) panels from Sharp. 

  Meanwhile, shares of Pioneer Corp ( 6773.T ) jumped 4.3 
percent to 1,168 yen on an Asahi newspaper report that the 
electronics manufacturer plans to stop making 42-inch plasma 
display panels.  Such a move by Sharp, the world's No.3 LCD TV maker, and 
Sony, the second largest, would underscore the importance of 
securing enough display panels to meet fast-growing LCD TV 
demand.  "The (LCD panel) industry is finally splitting up neatly 
into two groups," said Nikko Citigroup analyst Kota Ezawa.  The deal would create a larger alliance between Sharp, Sony 
and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), which currently 
runs an LCD panel joint venture with Sony, along with Toshiba 
Corp ( 6502.T ), which said in December it would buy large LCD 
panels from Sharp.  Meanwhile, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd ( 6752.T ) 
and Hitachi Ltd ( 6501.T ) hold a large stake in joint venture 
IPS Alpha Technology, which makes large LCD panels. Matsushita 
also announced earlier this month it would spend 300 billion 
yen to build an LCD panel plant by 2010.  Still, Ezawa noted that the potential deal wasn't without 
risk for Sharp.  "By providing panels to its television competitors, Sharp 
faces the risk of its own televisions not selling well," he 
said.  For Sony, the procurement from Sharp is expected to help it 
secure enough panels without making heavy capital investment.  Sony's shares rose 2.4 percent to 5,140 yen, compared with 
the benchmark Nikkei's .225 3.1 percent gain.  Shares of Sharp ended at 2,100 yen.  On the plasma television side, whose market share has 
gradually been eaten away by LCD TVs, Pioneer will procure 
42-inch and smaller panels from Matsushita or Hitachi, the 
Asahi newspaper said on Saturday.  The company has been struggling to compete with larger 
rivals with better production efficiency such as Matsushita and 
LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ).  Goldman Sachs said in a report to clients that such a move 
would be positive for Pioneer, helping it cut losses in its 
plasma display panel segment.  Pioneer will end output of such panels at a plant in 
southern Japan by March 2009 and focus on making panels 50 
inches or larger at other plants, the Asahi said.  (Reporting by  Yoko Kubota ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
