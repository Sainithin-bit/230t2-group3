 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Any deal to rescue bond insurer Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N would likely be signed early next week rather than today or tomorrow, a person briefed on the matter said. 

 A source last week indicated a deal could come as soon as early this week, but early next week now seems more likely, a separate source said. Ambac is expected to raise $3 billion in new capital as part of the rescue. It is working with a group of banks including Allianz' ( ALVG.DE ) Dresdner Bank. Dresdner Bank's head of investment banking operations said the bank plans to support a rescue package. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by John Wallace)
