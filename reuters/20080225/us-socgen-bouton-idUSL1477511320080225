 PARIS  (Reuters) - Daniel Bouton, the head of French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) hit by a trading scandal, said in a newspaper interview published on Monday that his resignation was "no longer on the table". 

 "I stay, I am the pilot, I drive on," Bouton told Les Echos daily in an interview. Bouton said he had twice offered SocGen's board his resignation and that the board refused it. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon)
