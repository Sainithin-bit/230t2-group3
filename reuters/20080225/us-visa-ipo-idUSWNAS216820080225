 (Reuters) - Visa Inc, the world's largest credit-card network, on Monday registered its initial public offering of 406 million Class A shares at an estimated price of $37 to $42 per share. 

 The company estimated that net proceeds of the sale would come to about $15.6 billion, assuming the mid point of the offer range. In an amended filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said J.P. Morgan Securities, Goldman Sachs, Banc of America Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, HSBC Securities, and Merrill Lynch, among others, were underwriting the IPO. The San Francisco-based company said it applied for a New York Stock Exchange listing under the symbol "V." (Reporting by Shivani Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Anthony Kurian)
