 ISLAMABAD  (Reuters) - A suicide bomber killed the Pakistani army's top medical officer and seven others in Rawalpindi on Monday in the first bomb attack outside the violence-plagued northwest since last week's elections. 

 In a separate incident, suspected militants opened fire and threw a grenade into an office of British aid agency Plan International in the northwest town of Mansehra, killing four Pakistanis and wounding nine people, officials said. The chief of the army's medical corps, Lieutenant-General Mushtaq Ahmed Baig died in the Rawalpindi attack. He was the most senior military officer killed by militants to date. He died with two of his staff and five passers-by a week after largely peaceful parliamentary elections raised hopes that a civilian government might be able to stem a rising tide of violence. "The general was on his way home and his car was stopped at a traffic light. The bomber was on foot and blew himself up there," said Interior Ministry spokesman Javed Iqbal Cheema. He said the bomber was about 16 years old and also killed five civilians and wounded 12 others. The Pakistan military headquarters is in Rawalpindi, adjacent to the capital, Islamabad, and several major attacks on the military and security agencies have taken place there since mid-2007. Opposition leader Benazir Bhutto and more than 20 of her supporters were killed in a gun and suicide bomb attack as she left a rally in the city on December 27. Monday's blast was outside an office of the government's national data registration agency, on a main road crowded with mid-afternoon traffic. "I can see pieces of flesh littering the road and four damaged vehicles," a witness said, adding police and troops had cordoned off the site of the attack. AID AGENCY ATTACKED Pakistan has been hit by a wave of bomb and suicide attacks since troops stormed a radical mosque complex in Islamabad last July. Former army chief President Pervez Musharraf has blamed the attacks on al Qaeda-linked militants based in remote mountains on the Afghan border and says they are intent on destabilizing the country. Musharraf has stressed the importance of keeping up the fight against the militants and the United States and other Western allies are trying to help the Pakistani military in its battle. But many Pakistanis, while opposed to the violence, hope a new civilian government will reassess Pakistan's alliance with the United States. A spokesman for the militants on Sunday warned any incoming civilian government that they would strike even more viciously if they continued Musharraf's campaign in tribal areas on the Afghan border. In Mansehra in North West Frontier Province, Niaz Mohammad, a senior medical officer at the district's main hospital, said four bodies had been brought in after the attack on the aid agency office. Three were men and one was a woman. Police official Mazhar-ul-Haq said 12 to 14 militants entered the office of the British aid agency and herded everyone there into a room, then opened fire. They then set fire to the building and threw a grenade. "This all happened in 10 minutes and then they fled," he said. Aid agencies, operating in the area since a big earthquake in October 2005, have been attacked by militants before but Monday's attack was the first time people had been killed.
