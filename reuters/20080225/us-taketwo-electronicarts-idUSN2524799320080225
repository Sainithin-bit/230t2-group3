 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - U.S. video game giant Electronic Arts Inc's (EA) offer of $26 a share for Take-Two Interactive Software Inc undervalues the company, and shareholders are unlikely to sell at that price, an investor who owns about 5 percent of Take-Two said on Monday. 

 "We see Take-Two valued at around $33 a share," said Wiley Reed, a portfolio manager at Denver Investment Advisors LLC. He also said he expects Electronic Arts to raise its offer before the April 29 release of Take-Two's blockbuster game "Grand Theft Auto 4." EA made an unsolicited $1.9 billion offer for Take-Two public on Sunday. Take-Two rejected the offer as "inadequate" and accused EA of trying to scoop up a company in turnaround just before the publication of its next hit, 'GTA 4.' (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
