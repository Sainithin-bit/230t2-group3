 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Security company Brinks Co ( BCO.N ) said on Monday it would spin off its Home Security unit into a separate publicly traded company. 

 The spin-off is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2008, and will likely take the form of a tax-free stock distribution to Brink's Co shareholders. (Reporting by  Chelsea Emery )
