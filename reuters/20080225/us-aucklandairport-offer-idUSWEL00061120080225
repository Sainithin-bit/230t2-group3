 WELLINGTON  (Reuters) - New Zealand's Auckland International Airport Ltd ( AIA.NZ ) said investors should sell into a NZ$1.4 billion ($1.1 billion) partial takeover offer from a Canadian state fund after a sharp fall in the company's share price. 

 However, Auckland Airport, the country's main international gateway, said a majority of the board still recommended voting against the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board's NZ$3.6555 per share bid for 40 percent, saying the company is worth more in the long term. The airport company said it had amended its position on the offer after its share price fell sharply. It still trades about 20 percent below the bid price. Macquarie Equities investment director Arthur Lim said the airport's decision was sensible. "This is the only offer they've got on the table, and the value gap between the share price and the offer price has opened up very, very significantly." Lim said the offer now hangs in the balance, with retail shareholders likely to decide the fate of the airport. About 23 percent is held by two councils, both of which have said they will not sell, with another 30 percent held by institutional investors. "It's inconceivable that the institutions, who are there to look after investors, will not sell into the offer," Lim said. Shares in the airport rose as much as 3.6 percent on the announcement and last traded 1.8 percent higher at NZ$2.85. The stock reached NZ$3.27 when the offer was first announced last November, but then fell as low as NZ$2.40 last month as equity markets around the world fell. MAJORITY APPROVAL NEEDED For the partial takeover bid to succeed, it must not only buy the full 40 percent it is seeking but also get the approval of a majority of shareholders who vote. If the vote looks likely to be in favor, then shareholders should sell into the offer, chairman Tony Frankham said. "We all agree that shareholders would be unwise not to realize part of their holding at the favorable partial offer price if the partial offer receives approval to proceed," he said. However, the majority of the board believed shareholders should vote against CPPIB, because the long-term prospects for the company were solid, despite the share price decline. "Our view is that the company is likely to show better value without the Canadians," Frankham told Reuters. CPPIB's offer values Auckland Airport at 22 times 2007 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), compared with a global average compiled by CPPIB for listed airports of 12.4 times. The board's move was a significant boost to the bid which closes on March 13, said CPPIB vice president Graeme Bevans. "It's a big change, it's more than a halfway move," he said. On February 20, Auckland Airport said CPPIB's stake had reached 6.7 percent. Of the shareholders who had voted, 42.4 percent were in favor of the bid. Frankham said that while the board did not support the CPPIB offer it still wanted a cornerstone shareholder, although it was not in talks with any other prospective bidders. If the Canadian offer failed, the board would renew its search for a large shareholder to the company. "It has consumed directors and it has consumed management ... we would love to have certainty," Frankham said.
