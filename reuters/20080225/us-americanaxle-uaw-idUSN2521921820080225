 DETROIT  (Reuters) - American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings Inc ( AXL.N ) and the United Auto Workers face a final day of contract talks on Monday before the midnight expiration of the union's current contract with the parts maker, a major supplier to General Motors Corp ( GM.N ). 

 Negotiators for the auto supplier and the union met on Saturday and Sunday. Both sides declined to comment on the talks, aimed at reaching a labor deal for more than 3,000 UAW-represented workers in Michigan and New York. With the possibility of a strike or work stoppage looming, American Axle has stockpiled parts for GM, which remains the supplier's largest customer and accounts for the majority of its sales, a person familiar with the matter said. A prolonged UAW strike against American Axle could disrupt production of GM trucks and sport utility vehicles, analysts have said. Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said he expected American Axle to emerge with a contract that would save $200 million annually by slashing wage rates by almost a third. Johnson said unless the UAW agreed to sweeping wage reductions, American Axle could threaten to close its Detroit plant and ship the work on a next-generation axle for GM trucks and SUVs to a factory in Mexico. "We expect significant concessions," he said in note for clients. The UAW called brief strikes against GM and Chrysler LLC last year in a historic round of contract talks with the Detroit-based automakers that resulted in deals to sharply cut their labor costs as they attempt to return to profitability. The union has also negotiated buyouts and early retirements with the automakers intended as a way to move higher-paid workers out of those jobs, while protecting their pension and retiree health care in most cases. Analysts have said the UAW's agreements with GM, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) provide a template for cost-cutting agreements at American Axle, which pays wages and benefits on par with those at the major automakers. On Friday, UAW Vice President Jimmy Settles released a statement on the talks with American Axle saying that the union was seeking "an agreement that will help our members, our community and the company." The parts supplier's agreement with the UAW, which expires at 11:59 p.m. ET on Monday, was completed after a short work stoppage in 2004. American Axle was spun off from GM in 1994 when Chief Executive Dick Dauch bought five GM axle plants, and its wage structure still reflects terms the UAW had negotiated with the No. 1 U.S. automaker. Like other U.S. auto parts suppliers, American Axle has looked to expand production in emerging markets as it seeks cost reductions in the slumping North American market. At the same time, American Axle has been restructuring to reduce production in market segments where demand has fallen off for items such as parts intended for mid-sized SUVs. The Detroit-based company generated sales of about $3.25 billion in 2007, about 78 percent from GM. Other auto suppliers such as Delphi Corp and Dana Corp have negotiated cost cuts on wages and future benefits with the UAW during a recent round of bankruptcy reorganizations. American Axle pays its hourly workers wages and benefits totaling about $65 per hour, roughly equivalent to the top wage for the three Detroit automakers. Dauch told financial analysts in January that his goal was to bring wages down to between $20 and $38 per hour, depending on whether workers were in "commodity" production roles or skilled trades. The contract covers about 3,650 workers at facilities in Detroit and Three Rivers, Michigan; Tonawanda and Cheektowaga, New York; and a Buffalo, New York, plant idled in late 2007. Nearly 560 Buffalo workers agreed to take buyouts or other separation deals at the Buffalo plant. They are not included in the total figure. Other UAW-represented facilities at American Axle that are covered under a different agreement that does not expire on Monday.
