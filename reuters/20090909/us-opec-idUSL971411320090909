 VIENNA  (Reuters) - The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has agreed to keep existing output targets unchanged, two delegates told Reuters early on Thursday. 

 The decision was widely expected and followed a meeting that began around 10 p.m. (2000 GMT) on Wednesday. The group has kept official output targets steady since it announced late last year a record cut of 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from September 2008 production.
