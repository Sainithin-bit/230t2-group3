 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve will start to raise interest rates once the jobless rate begins to drop and the recovery has gained traction, Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said in an interview with PBS' Nightly Business Report on Wednesday. 

 Asked how much longer the Fed will stand by its zero interest rate policy, Evans said: "I think the markers for that will be when the recovery takes hold, when unemployment starts coming down when its firmly embedded in the outlook, when businesses are truly forward-looking." Evans said the U.S. economic contraction is "pretty much behind us" but that the recovery will be slow, according to a Nightly Business Report transcript made available in advance. "We're looking for what a lot of people would describe as a 'U' shaped recovery. It's not going to be a strong expansion coming out of this and that's going to be associated with the rise in unemployment," Evans said. "So it doesn't feel like a strong economy and it's not a strong economy. But it's an improving economy," he said. Evans said that while the U.S. economy still faces a number of uncertainties, he does not think it will see a second downturn, or "double-dip" recession. Evans is a voting member of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee in 2009. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
