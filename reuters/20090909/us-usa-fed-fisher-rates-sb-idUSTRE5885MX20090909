 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher on Wednesday said he has no plan in mind for the timing or velocity of U.S. interest rate hikes once the economy starts to improve. 

 Some Fed officials have suggested recently that when policy starts to reverse, the trajectory will be much faster than the languid rate increases seen in 2004 and 2005. "It depends on economic circumstances," said Fisher, who looked for growth of about 2 percent in the U.S. economy in the third and fourth quarters of 2009 but termed 2010 more of a question. Dealing with the Fed's array of unorthodox lending programs will be a huge part of the policy shift, Fisher said. "It is necessary but insufficient to talk about interest rates," he said.
