 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Talbots TLB.N rose 7.6 percent to $7.65 in premarket trading on Wednesday, after the company reported a second-quarter loss that was narrower than expected, signaling that the retailer's attempts to turn around its business through cost-cutting and better merchandising are paying off.
