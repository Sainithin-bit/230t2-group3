 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks pushed higher on Wednesday, with major indexes setting new highs for 2009 as evidence of economic recovery mounts, while a weakening U.S. dollar led investors to move into riskier assets. 

 The U.S. dollar touched new lows for 2009 against major currencies, as growing faith in recovery persuaded many investors to move money away from safe-havens. Gold bullion prices again tested the $1,000 level, before settling lower, and the benchmark S&P 500 stock index closed at its highest level in 2009. Britain's top share index  .FTSE  closed above the 5,000 level for the first time since October. The gains in world equities initially drew investors away from safe-haven government debt, while the weaker dollar helped to push up oil prices and the share price of energy companies. But most U.S. Treasury debt prices traded steady to higher, after a well-bid 10-year U.S. Treasury note sale and after the Federal Reserve expressed some doubts about economic recovery. The modestly upbeat Fed Beige Book survey said most U.S. regions reported some improvement in hard-hit residential real estate markets and an uptick in manufacturing, but hiring remained weak and retail sales were flat. "It's very clear that investors are taking on riskier positions," said William Sullivan, chief economist at JVB Financial Group of Boca Raton, Florida. "Cash is flowing into stocks, commodities, crude oil and corporate bonds and some of that cash is coming out of intermediate- and long-term Treasuries," Sullivan said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 49.88 points, or 0.53 percent, at 9,547.22. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 7.98 points, or 0.78 percent, at 1,033.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 22.62 points, or 1.11 percent, at 2,060.39. A rally in European and U.S. stocks off decade-lows in March has supported hopes for economic recovery and underpinned the appetite for risk. That has reduced demand for the dollar as a safe haven, pushing the euro to fresh highs for 2009. "The dollar trade is ultimately a risk trade. That is, as risk appetite improves, the dollar gets hurt," said Boris Schlossberg, a director for currency research at GFT Forex in New York. Renewed concerns over the dollar's long-term status as the world's reserve currency and options-related euro buying also contributed to a dollar sell-off, which started on Tuesday. Oil prices settled higher even after ministers from a meeting in Vienna of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries signaled no plans to cut oil production. and the U.S. Energy Information Administration cut its oil demand forecast. U.S. crude for October delivery settled up 21 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $71.31 a barrel. Earlier Wednesday, prices rose to a one-month high above $72, after surging more than $5 a barrel from their lows on Friday. "The dollar is weak and the stock markets are up, so we're seeing crude futures higher today," said Mark Waggoner, president of Excel Futures in Huntington Beach, California. Gold ended lower after briefly topping $1,000 an ounce earlier in the session. U.S. December gold futures settled down $2.70 at $997.10 an ounce in New York. European equities hit an 11-month closing high. Rising oil prices on the back of a falling dollar boosted energy stocks, while Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ) led the financial sector higher. In London, the benchmark FTSE 100  .FTSE  closed above the 5,000 level for the first time since October. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 1/32 in price to yield 3.48 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday. Asian stocks had drifted lower after hitting a one-year high earlier on Wednesday. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dipped 0.4 percent and gave up early gains that pushed the benchmark to a one-year peak. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  fell 0.8 percent (Reporting by  Leah Schnurr ,  Ellen Freilich ,  Vivianne Rodrigues  in New York; Emma Farge, Atul Prakash, Jessica Mortimer and Jon Hopkins in London; writing by Herbert Lash)
