 VIENNA  (Reuters) - OPEC is still concerned about high oil stocks and price fundamentals, the group's president said on Wednesday ahead of the group's meeting. 

 Jose Botelho de Vasconcelos, who is also Angola's oil minister, said OPEC's goal was to keep oil prices stable and indicated that prices at around $70-$75 per barrel would satisfy both consumers and producers. He said the group remained committed to supplying increased demand if the world economy revived and entered a period of strong and sustained growth. "If there is a big recovery in the global economy and that recovery needs more oil then OPEC's role is to produce that balance. If there is need for more oil OPEC will produce more oil," he told Reuters Television. (Reporting by  Henrique Almeida  and  Karin Strohecker )
