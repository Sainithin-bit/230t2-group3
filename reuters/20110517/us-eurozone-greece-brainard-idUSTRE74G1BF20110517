 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The Greek government is on the right path to handle the country's debt crisis and should be supported in its efforts, a top U.S. official said in a German newspaper on Tuesday. 

 "The International Monetary Fund, the EU Commission, and euro zone countries have agreed a diligent, coordinated package with the government in Athens," U.S. Treasury Under-Secretary Lael Brainard said in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. "Everything suggests that the measures introduced by the Greek government should be supported further," she added. "The Greek government is on the right path." (Reporting by  Brian Rohan )
