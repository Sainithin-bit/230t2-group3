 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Greek debt could undergo a "soft" restructuring if Athens embarks on major reforms and accelerates privatization to raise funds, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday. 

 "Greece must rapidly privatize 50 billion euros of assets so that its medium and long-term public debt becomes sustainable, because at the moment it is unsustainable," he told a Lisbon Council seminar. "If Greece makes all these efforts, then we must see if it is possible to make to a soft restructuring of Greek debt. I am strictly opposed to a major restructuring of Greek debt."
