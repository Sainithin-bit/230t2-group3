 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Talks between BP ( BP.L ), Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) and the Russian shareholders in BP's Russian venture TNK-BP TNBP.MM have failed to reach agreement, a source close to the matter said on Tuesday. 

 BP and Rosneft made a cash and stock offer to buy out the co-owners of TNK-BP, represented through the Alfa-Access-Renova (AAR) consortium. They also discussed a proposed BP-Rosneft share swap whose deadline expired on Monday night. A source close to AAR, which represents a quartet of tycoons who own half of TNK-BP, said the company would issue a statement shortly. (Reporting by Vladimir Soldatkin, Writing by Douglas Busvine)
