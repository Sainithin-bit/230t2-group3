 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - World number two truck maker Volvo said shipments of its trucks rose 49 percent in April as a surge in demand in North America and Europe made up for a drop in earthquake-hit Japan. 

 Volvo, which sells trucks under the Renault, Mack, UD Trucks and Eicher brands as well as its own name, said on Tuesday that unit shipments rose 136 percent year-on-year in North America and were up 89 percent in Europe. In Asia, deliveries dipped 7 percent from a year ago as Volvo's Japanese UD Trucks subsidiary saw a sharp fall in shipments following the country's devastating earthquake. The outcome was in line with the increase in the first three months of the year, though the company is coming up against steadily tougher comparisons from the year-ago months. The highly cyclical heavy-duty truck market has picked up strongly in recent quarters with growth spreading out of emerging markets in Asia and Latin America to more mature markets in Europe and North America. A long-awaited upturn in the United States, where the market for heavy-duty commercial vehicles suffered the deepest and most protracted fall as the global financial crisis struck, has been increasingly evident in recent months. Volvo, the second-biggest truck maker after Germany's Daimler, said demand in the North American highway truck segment had continued to improve during the month though weakness persisted for construction-related vehicles. In Europe, demand has also shot up in mainly the northern half of the region, while the government debt crisis in countries such as Greece, Portugal and Spain capped activity further south. The rosier outlook left Volvo confident enough to hike its market forecast for both North America and Europe to between 230,000 and 240,000 units this year from 220,000 units as it rolled out forecast-beating first-quarter earnings last month.
