 LONDON/MOSCOW  (Reuters) - BP and Rosneft's planned $16 billion share swap and an Arctic exploration venture collapsed on Tuesday, following opposition from BP's partners in Russian venture, TNK-BP. 

 The planned deal and an attempt by British group BP and Russian state-controlled Rosneft to buy out the billionaires who own half of TNK-BP, would have represented a major strategic shift for all the companies involved, if successful. What now for the parties involved? BP: Shrink to grow? BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley trumpeted the Rosneft deal, which was intended to give BP an interest in leases which may contain over 40 billion barrels of oil, as a sign that BP could offer growth after the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. With fields representing 500,000 barrels per day of oil and gas production sold to pay for the spill cleanup, analysts termed Dudley's strategy of divesting mature assets and seeking out new projects as "shrink to grow." While the shrinkage in BP's output and valuation is stark, its opportunities for expansion are fuzzy. Dudley himself has said his focus is on increasing returns rather than output. However, his recent deals have involved adding low margin reserves in places like China, India and Indonesia while the company's future in the U.S., which offers big reserves and fat profit margins, remains uncertain. BP sources say the company still hopes to buy out its oligarch partners in TNK-BP, with whom it has long had a fractious relationship. This would remove a key risk that has weighed on BP's shares in recent months and at other times. Sources at Rosneft say Dudley remains well respected in Russia and that his perceived commitment to the country -- despite being forced to flee it amid a spat with the TNK-BP co-owners in 2008 -- could help BP secure future opportunities. However, with so much uncertainty, BP investors are unlikely to put much store in potential Russian growth until a concrete deal is delivered. ROSNEFT:Global ambition frustrated The breakdown of talks marks a personal setback for Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, who has masterminded a growth and development strategy for Rosneft that started with the acquisition of the prime assets of bankrupted oil major Yukos. While sources close to Rosneft accused the Russian partners in TNK-BP of "sabotaging" the proposed buyout deal by setting unacceptable demands, it's unlikely Rosneft will walk away entirely. Sechin has a close personal relationship with Bob Dudley and views the equity component of the BP deal as a particularly attractive route to taking Rosneft global, while eyeing TNK-BP as the way for Rosneft to become the world's largest listed oil firm by production and reserves. Of the three parties in the discussion, Rosneft does, however, have the greatest number of options. Sources name Exxon, Chevron, Shell and Chinese firms as potential partners to explore the three Kara Sea blocks earmarked for the BP venture. The Billionaires - Staying put The four Soviet-born billionaires who own half of TNK-BP were willing to sell out their stake, in return for shares in BP and Rosneft, so that they could maintain exposure to the Russian oil industry, sources close to them said. BP still hopes to secure a deal, according to a source close to the company. However, it cannot bid alone, as the Kremlin would not allow full foreign control of Russia's third-largest oil group and Rosneft is not so keen to issue shares to the oligarchs, bankers said. That means that, for now at least, BP and AAR, as the billionaires' investment vehicle is known, will have to continue working in their uneasy but highly-profitable alliance that dates back to BP's purchase of half of TNK-BP in 2003. TNK-BP - Overseas growth plans? The key concern for TNK-BP, which produces 85 percent of its output from mature 'brownfields', is where to achieve value-enhancing growth. With the Arctic opportunity off the table for now, the company is likely to step up the search for foreign deals in addition to ones in Vietnam and Venezuela now either done or in their advanced stages. TNK-BP has set a strategic goal of raising the foreign share of its production to 30 percent over the next 20 years. The fact that BP did not want to execute the Arctic exploration project via TNK-BP, which has no offshore expertise of its own, suggests that BP is unlikely to provide TNK-BP with the means to become an offshore player in the future. WHO COULD STEP INTO BP'S SHOES? A source close to Rosneft named several possible candidates: U.S. majors ExxonMobil, Chevron, European major Royal Dutch Shell, and a Chinese player. But none are a clear win for Rosneft in the way BP was. The foreign majors covet the Arctic Kara Sea projects, attracted by the size of the reserves and their relative accessibility. But the economics are daunting: The costs could run to $100 billion or more and Russia has yet to clarify the fiscal regime for these frontier projects, leaving a big question mark over an investor's ultimate returns. A Chinese investor has always been seen as a possibility, even as a potential third partner in the Arctic project, which was to have been split on a 67/33 basis between Rosneft and BP. But although it could provide much needed financing, China lacks the engineering prowess needed to tackle the Arctic. And none of them would be interested in a share swap with Rosneft. China might in theory be interested in holding a Russian oil company's stock, but Rosneft would have little interest in such a deal. Finally, none of the majors have Bob Dudley's personal connection to Russia. For all the BP CEO's trials here, sources say, he has the respect of key players in the industry, who also admire his commitment to the country despite his hard ride.
