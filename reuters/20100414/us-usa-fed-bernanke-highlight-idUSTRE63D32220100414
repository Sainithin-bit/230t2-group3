 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from a Joint Economic Committee hearing on Wednesday with Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke testifying.

BERNANKE ON POSSIBILITY OF LINGERING UNEMPLOYMENT "Following the 2001 recession, productivity gains were quite significant which is a good thing generally, but meant that firms were relatively slow in bringing workers back. "We've seen remarkable productivity gains in the last year or so in the U.S. economy. We don't anticipate productivity growth will continue at that rate going forward. If it does, that may reduce the number of workers firms need to bring back to meet demand. "So there is a possibility -- I wouldn't consider it the leading possibility -- that unemployment will stay stubbornly high, around 10 percent, and if that were to happen that would be one of the risks...because it would affect consumer confidence." BERNANKE ON THE CHANCE FOR A DOUBLE-DIP RECESSION "I think there's a pretty broad view that we're seeing some building momentum in final demand. Consumer spending looks to be picking up. At least equipment and software investment looks healthy, the broader global economy is stronger which implies more exports. So, it looks like we're on a path to moderate recovery and that the risk of a double-dip, while certainly not negligible, is certainly less than it was a few months ago. That being said there are any number of possible things that could derail it." BERNANKE ON EU AID PLAN FOR GREECE "Well, it's a work in progress. They've made, I think, a good bit of progress. "It's politically difficult. On the one hand, the Europeans don't want to assist Greece unless they've made a good faith effort on their own to reduce their deficit and improve their own fiscal position. "At the same time, the Europeans themselves have to agree how they're going to share burdens and how they're going to set up arrangements. "I think there's a broad understanding that it's very important for them to come up with a solution and they've made a good bit of progress there. But I think there will be further discussions going forward. "The United States is not directly involved in these negotiations, but we've been informed -- I've been informed -- that they have made good progress and they are quite confident that a solution will be forthcoming." BERNANKE ON GOLDMAN SACHS' ROLE IN GREECE "We looked at the Goldman Sachs arrangement with Greece...On that, we found that there was in 2000 and in 2001 a contract between the Greek government and Goldman Sachs which, by using exchange rates that were different from the market rates, had the effect of modestly changing the reported debt and deficit ratios that Greece reported to the European Eurostat, their statistical agency. Goldman Sachs sold this position in 2005 to a Greek bank. "The effects, even though they did have the effect of distorting the numbers, were relatively modest, about 1 percentage point. The debt-to-GDP ratio changed from about 101 percent to 100 percent, so it wasn't a large effect but it was an effect." BERNANKE ON GLOBAL REGULATION "We the Federal Reserve and the other bank regulators are working very actively with other regulators around the world to strengthen the capital requirements... We're going to get assessments from the banks about how big an effect that would have. It is our intention to move forward with more conservative higher capital requirements." BERNANKE ON VOLCKER RULE PROPOSAL "I don't think Glass-Steagall by itself would solve our problems because we had commercial banks losing money on regular loans and we had investment banks losing money on speculative securities trades, so separating that wouldn't have saved Lehman Brothers and it wouldn't have protected a number of banks that had problems." BERNANKE ON WHY CHINA HASN'T REVALUED "Well, because like us, they have a variety of political considerations. They are being conservative first of all because they feel concerned about the effect of any large changes, given what they still perceive as the fragile state of the global economy. "I think that they, like we do, they have political factors, such as the influence of exporters who are interested in maintaining that strong export orientation. They have a variety of intellectual, if you will, and political rationales." BERNANKE ON WHETHER CHINA CURRENCY POLICY HURTS U.S. "I would like to qualify that and that besides floating the exchange rate, they also need to take to action such as creating a stronger safety net that would increase consumption and create a more domestic orientation toward spending. "I don't think the exchange rate by itself, in the short term, would have a major impact. Over time, it would have a major impact." BERNANKE ON WHETHER STRONGER U.S. ACTION IS NEEDED "It's an important issue and I think we should continue to press for a more flexible exchange rate. "I'm not disagreeing with your economic premise at all, but of course the relationship between the United States and China is a very complex (one) and covers many, many different issues." BERNANKE ON CREDIT SHORTAGES "We have been working very hard to get feedback and one of the problems, frankly, is that bankers tell their congressmen they're having problems but they won't tell us...so we've been having meetings all around the country at all the reserve banks with bankers, with small businesses, with community activists to try to understand what are the barriers, what can we specifically do. "Unfortunately credit is somewhat tighter and will be somewhat tighter and that is probably unavoidable, but we do want to make sure that creditworthy borrowers are able to access credit." BERNANKE ON FED NOT MONETIZING DEBT "Our holdings of Treasury securities today are about the same as they were before the crisis. We have not monetized the debt and we will not and we will, of course, continue to make sure that price stability is essential to our objectives." BERNANKE ON WHETHER UNDERVALUED YUAN WAS ONE OF THE CAUSES OF THE WORLDWIDE RECESSION "Yes, I broadly agree with that. I think most economists agree their currency is undervalued, it has been used to promote a more export-oriented economy. "I think it would be good for the Chinese to allow more flexibility in their exchange rate. It would give them more autonomy in their monetary policy so they could address inflation and bubbles within their own economy. "And I think that they should combine, it would be in their interest also to combine a more flexible exchange rate with other efforts to increase domestic demand, domestic consumption and achieve a more balanced economy. "I don't think the exchange rate is the only factor, but it is a contributing factor." BERNANKE ON A CONSUMER PROTECTION AGENCY "I'd like to understand better how it would work. My current understanding is that the agency would not be within the Fed within any kind of accountability sense. That means that being within the Fed is kind of a vague idea at this point." BERNANKE ON FED MISTAKES IN CONSUMER PROTECTION "I understand why people would be concerned given that we were late in taking some important steps. I can understand why some advocates would want to have a purely independent agency. While we have acknowledged being late on these issues, I do believe we should receive credit for a much better performance in recent years." BERNANKE ON NEED FOR FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY "I think it's fair to say that (having) deficits, structural deficits, long-term deficits anywhere between 4 and 9 percent, in that range, is not sustainable because it leads to a debt-to-GDP ratio that grows indefinitely, leads to higher interest rates...so I think it is very important that we consider how to control it. "Over the medium term we need to find a sustainable path and that would require lower deficits than we currently are projecting." BERNANKE ON CONTINUING EXTREMELY LOW INTEREST RATES "The Federal Open Market Committee has stated clearly that they currently anticipate that very low, extremely low rates will be needed for an extended period. "They have emphasized, however, that that projection, that forecast is conditional on three sets of conditions. One: very low resource utilization, high unemployment, low capacity utilization; second: subdued inflation trends low inflation, and third: stabilization expectations. So if those conditions cease to hold and we anticipate changes in the outlook then of course we will respond to that."
