 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - If the amount JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) set aside for pay in the first quarter is any indication, its investment bankers might see bonuses this year that look a lot like what they got in 2009. 

 JPMorgan allocated $2.9 billion for investment banker pay in the quarter as it reported a compensation ratio of 35 percent. In the year-ago quarter, as the banking industry began to recover from the financial crisis, JPMorgan set aside $3.3 billion, 40 percent of net revenue. Wall Street firms faced a backlash on pay in 2009 as banks set aside tens of billions of dollars to pay employees soon after taxpayers rescued the industry from collapse. As a result, Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and JPMorgan's investment bank switched gears on pay in the fourth quarter - JPMorgan reduced its compensation ratio to 11 percent for the final three months of 2009 and Goldman recorded a negative compensation expense. When JPMorgan reported its results on Wednesday, it gave a first look at how pay is shaping up to start 2010. Goldman and Morgan Stanley are both planning to report their results next week. "There should be a lot of similarity," said Todd Gershkowitz, a compensation consultant with Farient Advisors, adding that banks like JPMorgan, Goldman, and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) are paying investment bankers in "lockstep" with one another. JPMorgan's first-quarter profit beat Wall Street estimates as revenue from its investment bank far surpassed expectations. The bank reported a $3.3 billion quarterly profit. PUBLIC SCRUTINY Even with large profits, banks are smartly guarding against inflating their compensation accruals, a move that will help keep regulators at bay, Gershkowitz said. "They are playing the politics and public relations game very well right now," he said. "That's the smart thing to do. They are still under public scrutiny." JPMorgan chief Jamie Dimon acknowledged the pressure to rein in compensation accrual during a call with reporters. "For a lot of people, there's reasons for it to be lower, but we will also be competitive, you know, we will do what we have to do to compete in this business," Dimon said. Dimon said the first-quarter compensation ratio was about even with last year, but he also noted that Wall Street banks' compensation ratios might appear artificially low because firms are holding more capital against positions, which has the effect of driving down compensation accrual rates. Wall Street banks historically have set aside 45 to 50 percent of net revenue for compensation. Even though JPMorgan's compensation set aside in the first quarter was smaller than the year-ago quarter, some are still predicting that Wall Street pay will rise in 2010. Alan Johnson, a Wall Street compensation consultant, is projecting a 15 pay percent increase in 2010 as firms become increasingly confident that the financial crisis is in the past. "You continue to read the stories that the banks and stock markets have rebounded quicker than the real economy and it continues to show," Johnson said.
