 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Belarus's top negotiator in its pricing dispute with Russian gas monopoly Gazprom has flown into Moscow, a Gazprom spokesman said on Sunday. 

 "Yes, (First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir) Semashko has arrived in Moscow," Gazprom spokesman Sergei Kupriyanov told Reuters. Gazprom previously said the Belarus negotiating delegation in Moscow was not senior enough to sign an agreement.
