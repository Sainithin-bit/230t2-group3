 MINSK  (Reuters) - Belarus Energy Minister Alexander Ozerets told Reuters on Sunday there was a real chance a gas pricing dispute with Russian gas monopoly Gazprom could be resolved, avoiding supply disruptions to Europe. 

 "It's not only my hope, I think it's a real (prospect)," Ozerets said by telephone when asked if Belarus's top negotiator in the dispute, First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Semashko, would fly to Moscow on Sunday to sign a deal. Ozerets said if no deal was reached, Minsk would cut power to pump stations along the pipeline that exports Russian gas to Europe via Belarussian soil. That would effectively halt the flow of gas.
