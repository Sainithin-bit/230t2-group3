 WASHINGTON/LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers grilled leading American bankers on Wednesday on how they are using the bailout money they got last year and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner pushed a new bank bailout plan. 

 Global trade continued to crumble with a sharp fall in Chinese imports and exports in January underlining the economic damage caused by the global financial crisis. U.S. stocks opened higher with investors scooping up shares beaten down in Tuesday's selloff on disappointment over the lack of detail in the latest U.S. plan to rescue the financial system. Bank shares were among U.S. stocks mounting a recovery, led by Bank of America, which rose 9 percent. Geithner's bank plan would put $2 trillion (1.39 trillion pounds) to work mopping up bad assets and restoring credit, but it was immediately criticized for lacking detail and clarity. "I completely understand the desire for details and commitments, but we're going to do this carefully, consult carefully so we don't put ourselves in the position again where we're laying out details ahead of the care and substance necessary to get it right," he told the Senate Budget Committee. Eight bank chiefs appeared before the U.S. House Finance Committee to explain what they are doing with the billions of taxpayer dollars they received to avert collapse and get them lending again. In London, bank executives also got a dressing down on Wednesday in a parliamentary investigation into the integrity of the British banking system, which was partially nationalized in the crisis. A top UK financial regulator, James Crosby, deputy chairman of the Financial Services Authority, was forced to step down because of allegations he ignored risk warnings when he was chief executive of British bank HBOS. The U.S. Congress and the Obama administration moved closer to a deal on an $800 billion economic stimulus package to fight deepening recession in the world's largest economy, which is reeling from a slump in asset prices, scarce credit and millions of lost jobs. Congressional negotiators will meet on Wednesday afternoon to reach a compromise bill, aides said. President Barack Obama, who has said the stimulus package is essential to avert a catastrophe, wants to have a bill to sign into law by this weekend. IMPORTS, EXPORTS SLUMP China, the world's third-largest economy, has seen trade hit as big customer economies, the United States, Europe and Japan, have gone into reverse. China's January trade data showed exports fell 17.5 percent from a year earlier, a sharp acceleration from a 2.8 percent dip in December. Imports plummeted 43.1 percent, twice as much as in the previous month. The declines were sharper than expected and mirrored big falls elsewhere in Asia, suggesting to several analysts that China has yet to hit bottom. "We will not see good export and import figures in the first and second quarters due to the slowing global economy," said Zhang Shiyuan, an analyst with Southwest Securities in Beijing. Demand for crude oil has been one of the casualties of the slowdown, and on Wednesday the International Energy Agency said fuel demand this year would contract by about a million barrels a day, double its previous estimate. Interest rates, too, have been tumbling since the crisis began, with Sweden halving its principal rate to a record low 1 percent on Wednesday. A number of European Central Bank policymakers said on Wednesday that the euro zone was also likely to see rates fall soon. BRITISH LAYOFFS The Bank of England's inflation forecasts -- of just 0.5 percent even two years hence -- raised expectations of another UK rate cut next month, while BoE Governor Mervyn King said the bank was also likely to take measures to increase the money supply as a means to spur growth. The anaemic UK inflation forecasts coincided with a rise in unemployment to a 12-year high, though at just short of 2 million the number out of work was not as bad as expected. "The 2 million mark is coming up, and realistically going into 2010 it will probably be the 3 million mark that becomes more relevant," said Mark Miller, an economist at HBOS. Credit Suisse provided yet more evidence of the scale of the banking crisis with an annual loss of 8.2 billion Swiss francs ($7.1 billion), a day after rival UBS made Swiss corporate history with a loss of almost 20 billion. The bank said January had started well after a poor fourth quarter hit by trading losses and restructuring charges, though CEO Brady Dougan said it was not yet claiming to see light at the end of the tunnel. Asian stocks were hit on Wednesday by the Wall Street selloff the day before. Japanese stocks were spared by a market holiday, but the MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks fell 1.6 percent. European stocks followed suit, with the FTSEurofirst 300 down about 1 percent at midday. ($1=1.156 Swiss Franc) (Reporting by Reuters bureaus around the world; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
