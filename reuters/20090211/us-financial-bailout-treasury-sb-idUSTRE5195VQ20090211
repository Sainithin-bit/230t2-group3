 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury will develop a public-private partnership over the "next several weeks and months" to help cleanse banks' balance sheets of distressed assets, a senior government official said on Tuesday. 

 The official said this could consist of one or more entities that would pool investor capital to buy up the bad assets. The private investors would be given the incentive to participate because of long-term financing provided by the U.S. government. Another government official said about 18 to 20 banks will be subjected to stress tests administered by their supervisors, but the official said the test would not constitute a new capital standard and will not be used to determine a bank's solvency.
