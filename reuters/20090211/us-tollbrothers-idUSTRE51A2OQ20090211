 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toll Brothers ( TOL.N ) expects quarterly revenue to decline by half as prospective buyers of its more expensive homes changed their minds, the luxury builder said on Wednesday. 

 The company will generate $409.3 million in revenue from building homes, down 51 percent from a year earlier, according to preliminary results for the first quarter ended on January 31. The quarter's 157 cancellations, which totaled $115 million, hit the company's higher-end offerings and occurred mainly in New York, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Oppenheim wrote in a client note. The average price on a canceled home was $733,000, compared with the average net order price of $482,000. "We think this is particularly worrisome given the bleak outlook for high-end units in the New York area," Oppenheim said. Stripping out cancellations, Toll signed contracts on 266 homes in the quarter for $128.1 million, a dollar decline of 66 percent from a year earlier. Toll Brothers shares fell 3.4 percent to $17.95 in light trading before the market opened.
