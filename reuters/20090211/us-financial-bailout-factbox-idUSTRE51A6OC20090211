 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday unveiled a plan to soak up $500 billion to $1 trillion in bad assets from struggling banks and expand a Federal Reserve program to support up to $1 trillion in new loans. 

 Following is a look at the plan, the Obama administration's approach to tapping the second half of the government's $700 billion financial bailout fund: FUNDING FED PROGRAM: The Treasury will use $100 billion of the remaining bailout funds to help the Fed expand a program that had been set up to support consumer and small business lending. The Fed's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility will be expanded to $1 trillion from $200 billion. The program is aimed at lending to holders of AAA-rated, asset-backed securities collateralized by auto, student, credit card and small business loans to try to free up credit. The Treasury originally pledged $20 billion to cover potential losses the Fed might face. The expanded program will also support commercial mortgage-backed securities, and could be widened to cover private-label MBS and assets collateralized by corporate debt. PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP ON BAD ASSETS: Geithner outlined a public-private investment fund that would aim to take $500 billion in distressed assets -- dubbed "legacy" assets by Treasury -- off banks' books. This could later be expanded to as much as $1 trillion. This will be run in conjunction with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Fed. The program could involve the use of public financing to leverage private capital, but the Treasury provided few details on the program's mechanics. MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE RELIEF The Treasury Department said $50 billion of the remaining bailout funds would be set aside to prevent foreclosures, aimed at owner-occupied "middle class" homes by helping to reduce monthly payments. Banks that receive capital injections from the government will be required to participate in mortgage foreclosure mitigation efforts outlined by the Treasury. The Treasury reaffirmed its and the Fed's commitment to pushing down mortgage rates by buying up to $600 billion in mortgage-backed securities and debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. President Barack Obama is set to lay out a comprehensive plan to address the housing crisis in the next few weeks, Geithner said. CAPITAL INJECTIONS: Treasury will continue to tap bailout funds to make investments in banks. It had already pledged to use $250 billion from the bailout fund and did not specify a new amount on Tuesday. It will move capital infusions in private firms made by the Treasury into a separate entity called the Financial Stability Trust, which will manage government investments in financial institutions. Banks receiving government funds will be subject to tighter conditions, including demonstrating how every dollar of public assistance will allow them to expand lending. They will be subject to a "stress test" to ensure that they are strong enough to continue lending and withstand any further shocks to the economy. They will be required to commit to preventing mortgage foreclosures, restricting dividends and acquisitions of "healthy firms" and limits on executive compensation. Treasury said it also would limit firms' lobbying efforts to obtain government capital injections to ensure that decisions are made based on investment criteria. Treasury investments going forward will be made in the form of preferred shares that can be converted to common equity if needed to preserve lending.
