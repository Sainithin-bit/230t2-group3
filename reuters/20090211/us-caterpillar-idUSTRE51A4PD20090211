 BOSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) on Wednesday offered voluntary early retirement packages to about 2,000 production workers. 

 The cuts are in addition to the 22,000 layoffs the company announced last month, as it scrambles to cope with a downturn in demand for construction and mining equipment. The 84-year old company, whose equipment is a common sight on construction projects around the world, said additional buyouts or layoffs may be necessary this year, depending on business conditions. The packages would be offered to workers in Illinois, Colorado, Tennessee and Pennsylvania. Caterpillar will use a mix of workers' ages and length of service to determine who is eligible for the buyout packages. "Our intent is to provide eligible employees the opportunity to retire early as we expect significant declines in all geographic regions," said Sid Banwart, vice president of human services at the Peoria, Illinois-based company. Job cuts are spreading across the U.S. economy as companies scramble to reduce costs in the face of the worst economic downturn in decades. Just this week ailing Detroit automaker General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said it would cut its salaried global work force by 10,000, while package-delivery company FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) unveiled 900 layoffs and industrial distributor W.W. Grainger Inc ( GWW.N ) disclosed plans to cut up to 400 positions. Caterpillar has been slashing jobs at a pace not seen since the mid-1980s, when the U.S. manufacturer was losing $1 million a day and fighting to keep its doors open. Last month the company reported a 32 percent fall in fourth-quarter profit and warned this year's earnings could fall by more than more than half due to the worldwide recession.
