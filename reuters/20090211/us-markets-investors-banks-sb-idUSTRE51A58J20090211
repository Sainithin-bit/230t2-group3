 LONDON  (Reuters) - Market reaction to Timothy Geithner's $2 trillion U.S. bank bailout plan says one thing loudly about current investor thinking -- fears about banks' health still have more sway than those about the economy. 

 Equity markets fell, credit spreads widened and bond yields dropped globally after the U.S. Treasury Secretary disappointed markets by failing to give enough details about how the plan he unveiled on Tuesday would shore up wobbly U.S. banks. Almost buried by the aftershock was news that the U.S. Senate had agreed its version of an $838 billion economic stimulus plan. Delays to that bill had previously rattled investors looking at a recessionary global economy. What this says is that when push comes to shove it is banking that underpins investor fears for the future and, by extension, will be the trigger for market recovery. "For a sustained rally in the market what we need to see is financial stability," said Charlie Morris, head of absolute returns at HSBC Global Asset Management. "People are looking for that stability factor above all." Just how far they have to go came be seen from the performance of one of large investor BlackRock's offerings, its Global Capital Securities Absolute Return Fund. The fund is essentially invested in investment-grade fixed income transferable bank debt, arguably exactly the kind of paper that would be attractive if an investor saw improvement ahead in the finance industry. Its net asset value has fallen roughly 16 percent since the beginning of this year. Consider also the huge losses investors have taken on Tier 1 bank debt, the paper that has equity-like features and is the last debt instrument in the queue for repayment. It is also a gauge of investors comfort with banks. Royal Bank of Scotland Tier 1 bonds are currently bid at around 15 percent of face value -- or just 15 pence in the pound -- according to one subordinated debt analyst. ECONOMICS VS FINANCE The fear about banks eased somewhat in the latter part of last year as confidence grew that toxic assets held by banks were under control and that governments were doing what was necessary to support the financial system. At the same time, investor focus shifted to the global economy, where evidence was growing that the downturn was spreading and could be worse than initially predicted. This has now been turned on its head. It is not that the global economy has recovered, but some improvements in macroeconomic performance, along with a growing faith that government stimuli will work, have built investor confidence that the end may be coming into sight. This did allow for some recovery in riskier assets earlier in February. But banks and their losses have come back to haunt markets with a vengeance during the current earnings season. Giants such as Deutsche Bank, Citi and Bank of America have all shown that they are not out of the woods yet -- a point not missed by investors after Geithner's proposal. U.S. financial sector stocks, for example, underperformed the main S&P 500 index on Tuesday, falling 10.9 percent compared with 4.9 percent. None of this means that economic data or the economy as a whole will cease to move markets or stir investors. But it does suggest a belief that recovery can only be built on the foundation of a more secure banking system.
