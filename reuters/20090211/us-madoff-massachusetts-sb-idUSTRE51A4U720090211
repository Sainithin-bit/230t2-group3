 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Massachusetts' top securities regulator moved on Wednesday to stop Cohmad Securities Corp from doing business in the state after the company funneled millions of dollars from clients to Bernard Madoff. 

 William Galvin, Massachusetts' Secretary of the State, said his office is seeking to revoke Cohmad's securities registration after it failed to say more about its relationship with Madoff, the man accused of having run a $50 billion Ponzi scheme. Galvin's office last  year subpoenaed key Cohmad executives including Robert Jaffe, who introduced dozens of clients to Madoff, to testify. They either failed to show up or delivered incomplete answers, Galvin said. "We cannot tolerate licensed securities dealers who refuse to assist in the detection and prosecution of fraud," Galvin said in a statement. Madoff Investments made monthly payments to Cohmad that appear to add up to $67 million, Galvin's office said, noting that the figures appear to be based on the assets of clients who had been referred to Madoff by Cohmad representatives.
