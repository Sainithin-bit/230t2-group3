 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Congress and the Obama administration are close to a deal on what could be an $800 billion economic stimulus bill, Senator Max Baucus said on Wednesday. 

 "We're close. I expect to have it done by three" p.m. EST (2000 GMT), Baucus told Reuters. As chairman of the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, Baucus has been one of the negotiators on the compromise bill. (Reporting by  Susan Cornwell  and  Richard Cowan )
