 SPRINGFIELD, Virginia  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he planned to appoint an oversight board to monitor expenditures under his emerging multibillion-dollar economic recovery plan. 

 "We're going to do more than has ever been done before to make certain that every tax dollar is spent wisely and on its intended purposes," Obama said on a visit to a Virginia construction site to highlight the jobs he predicts would be created under an economic stimulus package making its way through Congress.
