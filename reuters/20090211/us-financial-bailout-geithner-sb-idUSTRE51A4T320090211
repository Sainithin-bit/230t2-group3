 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights of Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's testimony on Wednesday to the Senate Budget Committee on the U.S. government's revamped financial rescue plan: 

 SENATE BUDGET CHAIR CONRAD ON ADDITIONAL FUNDS "It is incumbent that you very soon help us understand if additional funds are going to be needed, and in what amount. Can you give us any idea today when you might have greater clarity with respect to the costs of dealing with not only the financial sectors but the housing sector?" GEITHNER RESPONSE TO CONRAD "We will do it as quickly as we can. (We) want to be careful; we need to assess the overall needs, which is the process under way with the supervisor undertaking; part of it depends on how we design these facilities to make sure we are leveraging every dollar of public capital to get the maximum benefit, and as we go through that process we'll be in a better position, and we'll do it as soon as possible..." We're going to move forward very quickly to come out with detailed design elements on these proposals I outlined yesterday. I expect to be able to do that over the next several weeks, and that will at least give you a sense of how we plan to use the existing authority we have, and that will give everyone a sense to look at what those ultimate risks will be. And that will be the ... beginning of the process for looking at whether we need to go beyond that and when." GEITHNER ON BUDGET GAP AND NEED TO SPEND MORE NOW: "We are starting with this deep fiscal hole, $1.3 trillion (deficit). I know people are skeptical. We have a will to get out of this going forward. But we have to spend more now. There is no way this will solve itself on its own. These things can only be solved by governments acting to help stimulate jobs, private investment and help get the financial system working again. The best fiscally responsible way to go forward will require necessarily additional spending and tax cuts now, if we are going to solve this." GEITHNER ON STIMULUS ALONE NOT BEING ENOUGH: "The stimulus itself would be much less powerful. You're going to have the system pushing against recovery. You're going to have a deeper, more protracted recession, unemployment would be higher. It is absolutely essential not just to do very forceful recovery programs for jobs and investment, but to do things to fix housing. It's not going to happen in weeks and months. It's going to take a sustained commitment and effort to do it. This country did not come into this crisis with an adequate set of resources and authority to help respond...It very important that we don't make that mistake again." GEITHNER ON EXECUTIVE PAY: "Over a long period of time, compensation just got completely out of whack with no appreciation of risk. We've seen judgments made as this crisis intensified that reflected frankly no judgment about the scale of the damage caused. Our obligation is to try and help protect the people who behaved responsibly through this crisis from being excessively damaged by the actions of those who were less responsible. Compensation is at the heart of that. One of the most important things we have to do is going forward, try to make sure we fix that system so the incentives are not so distorted again." GEITHNER ON TARP CONDITIONS: "My basic sense is that it is important for us to design these programs so that we create incentives for them to pay the government back to replace our resources as soon as that is feasible. I think that is a necessary thing not just to protect the taxpayer but to make sure that the government's role in the financial system is not sustained beyond the point that is necessary." GEITHNER ON CONDITIONS ON BANKS: "I don't think it's feasible for people to repay unless they have the means and the resources to repay which is another way of saying that until they are viable they won't be able to do that whatever they think about the conditions. A good test of conditions is whether they are attractive or unattractive. And I think the sign that people want to replace that public capital with private capital is a sign that the conditions are tough. They are going to have to get tougher. We've got to make sure that balance is right, but I think it's basically a healthy thing." GEITHNER ON VALUATION OF ASSETS: "A definition of financial crisis is the market is not prepared to take risks that are otherwise economic. We are not going to be able to solve that crisis unless we are prepared to take carefully designed risk the market is not prepared to take. That means that everything we do is priced against current market conditions. In some circumstances (it) will look like today, in that snapshot, that we are giving a significant subsidy to those institutions. What our obligation is, is to set the terms and conditions on these programs going forward, that again we minimize the risks on the taxpayer and ensure a fair return and achieve the most benefit we can on our overall obligation." GEITHNER ON NEED TO KEEP CONFIDENCE OF SOVEREIGN INVESTORS "We have to be very, very careful as we go forward that we improve confidence, not reduce confidence, not just here in the United States but around the world, that we are going to have the will as a country not just to solve this crisis but to bring our resources and expenditures back into balance over time. It's going to be enormously complicated because of how deep the hole is today, but I believe there will be more confidence around the world and more willingness to get through this if we are aggressive today." SOUTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM ON COST: "I just don't believe that that's enough money to fix housing and banking. I just wish you would say that, because you're going to come up here and ask us for more money. I know you will, Senator Conrad said on the floor. Let's just get on with this thing. Let's tell people some idea of what awaits them. Now when it comes to banking, how much money will you need to fix the banking, financial institution problem beyond what you have available to you today?" GEITHNER IN RESPONSE TO SEN. GRAHAM: "As I said at the beginning, I'm not prepared to make that judgment today. I'm not going to come up to you and ask you for money, when we're not prepared to support the request right." GEITHNER ON LACK OF DETAILS: "I understand the desire for details, I understand the disappointment about lack of details today. But part of the disappointment as I said at the beginning is because people were hoping that we were going to do things that in my judgment would have been too generous and not responsible with the taxpayers' money. I don't want to compound the mistakes of the last 12 months where things were rushed out before they were ready. A strategy had to be adopted because of that. If there is going to be disappointment with the level of details so that we get it right, I will live with that disappointment because it is better than the alternative." GEITHNER ON FED INDEPENDENCE: "The Federal Reserve has independent authority provided by the Congress and they (the Fed) will not commit to do things jointly with us if they believe it compromises that independence and that authority." GEITHNER ON STRESS TEST FOR BANKS: "The supervisors of your country are working together now to bring a more careful, consistent, realistic assessment of the exposures on banks and try to make careful judgments about what the losses ahead are likely to be in the kind of challenging environment we face. On the basis of that, where there are needs for additional capital, we're going to be prepared to provide that capital. "Congress does have -- and the FDIC does preside over -- a mechanism that allows for the orderly resolution of banks in our country. That process is being used today. It will be tested in the future. I think it's very important that we be careful moving forward that we are facilitating the necessary restructuring of the financial system that has to happen."
