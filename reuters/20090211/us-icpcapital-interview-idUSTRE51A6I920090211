 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors came down hard on U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, complaining that his eagerly awaited announcement of a bank rescue plan on Tuesday did not provide enough details about how it would work. 

 Yet ICP Capital Chief Executive Thomas Priore, whose asset management firm has generated gains despite the worst credit markets in decades, contends that Geithner had already made important progress when he unveiled a series of investments, guarantees and other programs Wednesday. "We have a framework to a plan," Priore said in a phone interview. "It was unrealistic to anticipate the administration would have specified the details before a final framework is outlined. Maintaining a measure of flexibility will be important to the long-term success of the plan." Treasury did not have answers to questions about how the government would value toxic assets purchased from struggling banks. Many investors showed their disappointment by sending financial services stocks down. Priore, who helps manage more than $20 billion in assets, agreed that Geithner had a lot more work ahead in fleshing out how Treasury can recapitalize hard-hit banks and cleanse the system of sour assets. Specifics surrounding the purchase could be weeks away, Priore said. Yet the real key to reviving debt markets, he said, is increasing investor access to financing. "Without certainty and access to the terms of financing, it has been virtually impossible to accurately determine prices for these assets," said Priore, whose firm manages a $1 billion long-short hedge fund and a portfolio of structured credit securities that has performed well despite the credit crunch. "I think it is constructive that we're no longer talking about a 'bad banks' or additional guarantees but, more appropriately, looking at solutions that will attract private capital to purchase these assets," he said. The proposed combination of government and private-sector investments could be the way to restore market activity, which he said would be more effective than the government cranking out more dollars. Hedge funds and investors, he added, will be more likely to purchase assets if they are confident that they can obtain financing. "Without access to financing, it's been impossible to accurately determine what price should be paid for these assets," Priore said. "That's the bottom line." Luring private investors back into the markets would restore liquidity, ramp up the pace of trading and stem the decline of asset prices. Beyond the lack of specifics, Priore gave Geithner high marks for not sugar-coating the significance of the country's problems during Tuesday's televised news conference. "He told it like it is," he said. "That's a start."
