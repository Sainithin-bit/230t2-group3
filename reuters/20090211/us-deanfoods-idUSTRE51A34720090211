 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Dean Foods Co ( DF.N ), the largest U.S. dairy company, posted an increase in quarterly profit, helped by lower costs for energy and milk. 

 Higher sales of the company's Horizon Organic milk also helped boost earnings, even as the organic milk segment as a whole showed signs of slowing, the company said. The company said profit was $66.4 million, or 42 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with $32.6 million, or 24 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Dean earned 46 cents a share. Analysts on average forecast 39 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also said it expects earnings per share of at least $1.50 for 2009, reflecting a mid-teens increase. Analysts on average forecast $1.49, according to Reuters Estimates.
