 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision urged its regulated institutions on Wednesday to halt home foreclosures until the government's $50 billion plan is implemented. 

 The request comes one day after Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner unveiled a bank rescue package that includes a program aimed at reducing monthly payments for troubled homeowners. A broader U.S. housing program to keep people in their homes is expected to be announced as soon as next week. (Reporting by  John Poirier ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
