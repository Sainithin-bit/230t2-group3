 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Congressional negotiators working on a nearly $800 billion stimulus bill will meet at 5:15 p.m. EST, leading House Democratic lawmakers said on Wednesday, after an earlier meeting was suspended. 

 House of Representatives Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters the meeting would be held but did not elaborate on whether all details had been worked out on what had earlier been described as a $789 billion deal on the stimulus plan of tax cuts and new government spending. House Democrats were insisting that $10 billion in funds be dedicated to school construction, according to one House Democratic aide. Republicans, whose support is needed for the final measure, have resisted such spending. House Rules Committee Chairwoman Louise Slaughter later said she intended to bring the stimulus bill to the House floor for a vote on Thursday.
