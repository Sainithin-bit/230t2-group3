 (Reuters) - The CEOs of the first eight companies to receive funds from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, are going to Washington on Wednesday to testify before the House Financial Services Committee, led by Representative Barney Frank. 

 They are due to give legislators an update on how they have spent the government's assistance so far. Below is a list of the eight bankers, along with the drop in their bank's share prices since mid-October, how much money each bank has received from the U.S. Treasury, and the CEO's salary in 2007. Vikram Pandit, Citigroup : Vikram Pandit replaced Charles Prince, who left the bank in November 2007. He quickly ascended to the top of Citigroup after joining in July 2007 when the bank acquired his hedge fund manager Old Lane Partners for about $800 million. Citi shares have fallen by 79 percent since October 13. Citi has so far received $45 billion from the U.S. Treasury, and $7 billion in guarantees of about $301 billion in troubled assets held be the Bank, held by deductibles. Pandit earned about $2.1 million in 2007. Ronald Logue, State Street Corp: Logue is known to make decisions quickly and was identified as a possible future CEO soon after joining the custodial bank and investment manager to head investment servicing for mutual funds 19 years ago. In 2004, an abrupt power shift paved Logue's move to CEO. State Street shares have fallen by about 45 percent since October 13. State Street has received $2 billion from the U.S. Treasury. Logue earned $20.5 million in 2007. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs: Blankfein, a former metals trader who worked his way up as a trading executive, succeeded former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson as CEO in 2006. He and other top Goldman executives were among the first to decline bonuses for 2008; on Monday, he called for stricter financial regulation while defending mark-to-market accounting standards. Goldman Sachs shares have fallen 19 percent since October 13. Blankfein earned a record $70 million in compensation in 2007. Goldman has so far received $10 billion from the U.S. Treasury. Ken Lewis, Bank of America: Lewis, Bank of America's CEO since 2001, was widely hailed for his acquisition of brokerage company Merrill Lynch last September, but is now facing the wrath of investors angry at the stock's sharp fall since that purchase. Bank of America shares have fallen 76 percent since mid-October. Bank of America has so far received $45 billion from Treasury, and recently got $4 billion in government guarantees of about $118 billion in troubled assets held by the Bank, subject to deductibles. Lewis earned $24.8 million in compensation in 2007. James Dimon, JP Morgan Chase & Co: Dimon, CEO since 2005, has been lionized for mostly steering the bank away from the kind of toxic mortgage assets that nearly felled some of its rivals. But he made some high-stakes gambles this year, snagging Bear Stearns in March 2008, then buying Washington Mutual in the fall. JP Morgan shares have fallen about 41 percent since mid-October. JP Morgan has received about $25 billion from Treasury. Dimon earned $28.8 million in compensation in 2007. Robert Kelly, Bank of New York Mellon: Kelly, a former chief financial officer at Wachovia, was CEO of Mellon Financial Corporation from February 2006 until its merger with Bank of New York in 2007. Bank of New York shares have fallen about 15 percent since mid-October. Bank of New York has received $3 billion from Treasury. Kelly earned $20.1 million in total compensation in 2007. John Stumpf, Wells Fargo & Co: Stumpf became CEO in June 2007, and prior to that, was president and chief operating officer. In 2000, he oversaw Wells Fargo's acquisition of First Security Corp and last year, spearheaded its acquisition of Wachovia. Wells Fargo shares have fallen 46 percent since mid-October. Wells Fargo has received $25 billion from Treasury. Stumpf earned $22.9 million in total compensation in 2007. John Mack, Morgan Stanley: Mack replaced the unpopular Phil Purcell as CEO in 2005. He presided over the expansion of trading and private investing, while spinning off the Discover credit card. Mack has kept the bank on its feet by securing $9 billion from Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial. Morgan Stanley has received $10 billion from Treasury. Morgan Stanley shares have risen about 2.7 percent since mid-October Mack has given up bonuses for the past two years. He earned $1.6 million in 2007.
