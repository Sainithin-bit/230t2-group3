 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Congressional negotiators have scheduled a meeting for 3 p.m. EST (2000 GMT) to go over details of a compromise economic stimulus bill, aides said on Wednesday. 

 The scheduling of the meeting was an indication that closed-door talks that went late into Tuesday were productive and that Democrats are nearly ready to send the bill -- that would cost around $800 billion -- to the full House of Representatives and Senate for final passage. President Barack Obama, who has said the stimulus package is essential to avert a deeper recession, wants to have a bill to sign into law by this weekend.
