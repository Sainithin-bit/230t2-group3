 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. AHM.N shares sank as much as 18.2 percent on Monday after the company slashed its dividend and 2007 profit forecasts, and several analysts downgraded its stock. 

 The real estate investment trust cited a lack of buyers for its loans, as well as rising delinquencies, for its lowered forecast. It joined M&T Bank Corp. ( MTB.N ) among lenders to cut profit forecasts amid signs that weakness afflicting subprime mortgages -- home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories -- may be spreading to higher-quality loans. American Home specializes in prime and near-prime loans and makes roughly 2.5 percent of all U.S. mortgages. "We suspect American Home's disappointing change in its guidance will cause investors to take a closer look at whether (it) could soon find itself in similar straits as the subprime lenders," Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Bruce Harting wrote. Melville, New York-based American Home on Good Friday projected profit of 40 cents to 60 cents per share for the first quarter, below the $1.01 average analyst forecast according to Reuters Estimates. It also projected full-year profit of $3.75 to $4.25 per share, down from its $5.40 to $5.70 forecast in January and below the $4.73 average analyst forecast. The company cut its quarterly dividend to 70 cents per share from $1.12. Harting said American Home should fare better than subprime lenders because it is still making loans profitably and suffering fewer delinquencies. Nevertheless, he downgraded the company to "equal weight" from "overweight." Citigroup Inc. downgraded it to "sell" from "hold," and Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co. cut it to "market perform" from "outperform." American Home Chief Executive Michael Strauss said the mortgage market deteriorated sharply in March, resulting in a lack of buyers for home loans and causing portfolio losses. He said margins on loan sales may not recover this year. The company also said it is setting aside more reserves because delinquencies are rising. Many of these were in "Alt-A" loans, short for "Alternative-A," which often go to borrowers who cannot provide full documentation of income or assets. American Home said it made $16.7 billion of loans from January to March, up from $15.5 billion in the 2006 fourth quarter, when its national market share was 2.48 percent. Many subprime lenders have sold their businesses or quit the industry as delinquencies and defaults have mounted. New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), the largest independent subprime lender, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 2. In morning trading, American Home shares fell $4.11, or 15.9 percent, to $21.73, after earlier falling to $21.15. They began the year at $35.12. Among other Alt-A specialists, shares fell as much as 6 percent for Impac Mortgage Holdings Inc. IMH.N and 5.6 percent for IndyMac Bancorp Inc. NDE.N.
