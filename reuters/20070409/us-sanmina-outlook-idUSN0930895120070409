 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sanmina-SCI Corp. ( SANM.O ) said on Monday quarterly earnings and revenue will be worse than expected due to weak demand in the communications and high-end computing markets, driving its stock down 5 percent. 

 Citing soft demand and excess inventories in its supply channel, the contract electronics manufacturer cut its revenue estimate for the March quarter to $2.6 billion from previous guidance of $2.65 billion to $2.75 billion. Sanmina-SCI, a leading maker of printed circuit boards and memory modules, churns out products for top technology companies like IBM ( IBM.N ), Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ), Nortel NT.TO and Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ). It said the weakness in demand was spread broadly among several customers. "Revenue is a key to our profitability, and as such you can expect our gross margin and our non-GAAP (earnings) to be unfavorably impacted for the second quarter," Jure Sola, chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call. The company said it was not in a position to give an updated forecast for earnings, but said earnings, excluding one-time items and stock options expenses, would be below its previous guidance. In January, it forecast earnings of 5 cents to 7 cents per share for the fiscal second quarter ended March 31. Wall Street analysts, on average, were looking for earnings of 6 cents a share on revenue of $2.69 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "The second quarter has historically been a seasonally weak quarter for us, but we experienced even greater weakness in demand over the last two to three weeks," Sola said in a statement. "The majority of this softness was in the communications and high-end computing end-markets, while the rest of the markets delivered to our expectations." He said he thought the weakness was short term and the business should improve in the second half. "As we go into the third quarter, we continue to see softness, but in the last few weeks we are starting to see some new orders, especially from the component side of our business, and that is usually a sign that the rest of our business will pick up," Sola said on the call. Sanmina-SCI said it expects to report a decrease in inventory of at least $90 million for the second quarter, and a rise in cash and cash equivalent of at least $100 million. The company, based in San Jose, California, is scheduled to release its second-quarter report on April 24. Sanmina-SCI shares were down 20 cents at $3.61 in morning trade on Nasdaq after hitting a session low of $3.55 earlier.
