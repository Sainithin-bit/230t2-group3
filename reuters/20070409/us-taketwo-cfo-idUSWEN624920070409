 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ( TTWO.O ) said on Monday that Chief Financial Officer Karl Winters had resigned, marking further management upheaval at the troubled video game publisher. 

 The company said in a statement that Lainie Goldstein, the current senior vice president of finance, would immediately fill the CFO position on an interim basis. It said a search for a permanent CFO is under way. Winters' departure comes after the company's board was replaced and its chief executive ousted by investors owning 46 percent of the company. The company is also in the middle of a probe into its past stock options policies. It said last week that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had issued a formal order of investigation into the matter.
