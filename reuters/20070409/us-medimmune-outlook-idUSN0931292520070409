 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O said on Monday it expects first-quarter earnings to have tripled, driven by higher-than-expected sales of its respiratory drug Synagis. 

 MedImmune, which has been the subject of takeover speculation for some time, said it expects first-quarter earnings of between 62 cents and 67 cents per share, excluding stock-based compensation. Analysts had on average expected 51 cents a share. Geoff Meacham, an analyst at JP Morgan, said MedImmune has historically had a number of problems with Synagis in connection with reimbursement and prior authorization. "As such, we suspect the first-quarter strength has more to do with inventory stocking rather than resolution of these intermediate to longer term issues," he said in a research report. The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company, one of the bigger biotechs and maker of the nasal spray flu vaccine FluMist, said it expects its first-quarter revenue to rise by 11 percent to 12 percent, with net sales growth of 9 percent to 10 percent for Synagis. MedImmune's shares rose nearly 1 percent to $36.74 on the Nasdaq. They have risen more than 20 percent over the past month, buoyed in part by takeover speculation. The company plans to release full first-quarter results on May 3.
