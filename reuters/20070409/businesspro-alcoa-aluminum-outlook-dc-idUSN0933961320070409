 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - One day before Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) kicks 
off the new earnings season with its first-quarter results, 
Bear Stearns on Monday raised its forecasts for the world's 
largest aluminum company and the industry in general. 

  The upbeat report came after another investment bank, JP 
Morgan, lowered Alcoa's first-quarter earnings estimate last 
week because of unusual costs and currency fluctuations that 
would likely offset higher aluminum prices.  A third bank, Morgan Stanley, said that, although it saw 
further volatility in Alcoa's share price, it expected the 
company to meet Wall Street forecasts in the first quarter and 
improve profitability over the short term.  In a research note, Bear Stearns analyst Anthony Rizzuto 
increased his estimate for aluminum prices for 2007 and 2008, 
citing strong consumption growth, particularly China, tighter 
Chinese government regulations, inventories near critically low 
levels and power cost increases that could lead to project 
delays.  He said he was looking for full-year 2007 and 2008 aluminum 
prices to be $1.19 per pound and $1.05 per pound, respectively, 
up from an estimate of $1.00 for each year currently.  Aluminum has averaged $1.27 per pound this year, driven by 
higher consumption growth in China and also a strike in Guinea, 
West Africa -- a source for bauxite, which is refined into 
alumina, aluminum's raw material, he wrote.  "We believe the commodity will likely remain strong in the 
near term, but could become softer later this year and next 
year," Rizzuto said in his note. "Our forecasts call for 
aluminum prices to remain well above historical averages."  Because of higher price estimates for the metal, Bear 
Stearns raised its earnings estimates and share price targets 
for Pittsburgh-based Alcoa and Canadian aluminum giant, Alcan 
Inc. AL.TO( AL.N ).  It expects Alcoa to report first-quarter earnings of 79 
cents per share on Tuesday, up from its previous estimate of 70 
cents. Bear Stearns also raised its full-year 2007 earnings 
estimate to $3.40 per share, from $2.80, and 2008 earnings to 
$3.20 from $2.90.  Analysts currently expect 76 cents in the first quarter and 
$3.15 in the full year, according to Reuters Estimates.  Alcoa's share price target was raised to $40 from $36, 
although its rating remains "outperform," said Rizzuto. For 
Alcan, Bear Stearns retains its "outperform" rating, but raised 
its share price target to $68 from $63.  It also increased Alcan's first-quarter earnings estimate 
to $1.45 from $1.40 per share, with full-year estimates rising 
to $5.95 from $4.50 for 2007 and $5.25 from $4.85 for 2008.  Bear Stearns said it continues to view Century Aluminum 
( CENX.O ) as "an attractive trading vehicle," raising its 2007 
earnings estimate to $6.50 from $5.35 per share.  Analysts expect Alcan to earn $1.50 per share in the first 
quarter and $5.69 for 2007. For Century Aluminum, they expect 
$6.60 for full-year 2007, according to Reuters Estimates.  In a research note last week, JP Morgan analyst Michael 
Gambardella lowered his first-quarter earnings estimate for 
Alcoa to 75 cents from 82 cents per share and the full-year 
2007 estimate to $3.05 from $3.12.  "We believe the strength of aluminum prices in the first 
quarter would have a meaningful positive impact on Alcoa's 
results ... but there are a number of cost issues that will 
likely erode the margin expansion expected from the higher 
metal price," Gambardella wrote.  But Morgan Stanley's Mark Liinamaa wrote in a note: "Alcoa 
is our top pick amongst North American aluminum producers.  "Alcoa's earnings have typically resulted in volatility for 
the shares over the last two years. This quarter could see more 
of the same, with our bias being towards a result that comes in 
ahead of the 77 cent consensus."  Alcoa stock closed up 28 cents at $34.87 on the New York 
Stock Exchange on Monday. Alcan was 31 cents higher at $53.51 
in New York and 57 cents at C$61.73 in Toronto. Century 
Aluminum closed 74 cents higher at $48.74 on the Nasdaq.
