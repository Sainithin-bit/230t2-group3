 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX has secured the support of privately owned Hedley Group, a shareholder of Australia's Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX, for its A$19.7 billion ($16 billion) takeover of the retail giant. 

 Hedley Group said late on Sunday that it had agreed to vote its 17.9 million Coles shares -- 1.5 percent of Coles' stock -- in support of Wesfarmers' proposed deal, lifting the Perth-based conglomerate's voting control to 12.8 percent. Hedley, a property developer, said in a statement it had agreed not to support any rival proposal. Wesfarmers emerged as a surprise contender for Coles on Tuesday after it took voting control of an 11.3 percent stake and later announced an indicative A$16.47 cash-and-scrip offer for the retailer, which put itself up for sale in February. The offer is Asia Pacific's largest private equity buyout, overtaking a A$10.5 billion bid by a private equity consortium for Qantas Airways Ltd ( QAN.AX ), market data compiler Dealogic says. Private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. said it was still in the race for Coles. ($1=1.225 Australian Dollar)
