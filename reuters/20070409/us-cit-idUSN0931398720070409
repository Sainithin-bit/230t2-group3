 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc. ( CIT.N ) said on Monday it had placed the chief executive and other top executives at its student loan unit on administrative leave, in response to a recently announced investigation by New York's attorney general. 

 CIT said the management changes at the unit, Student Loan Xpress, should help it review the unit's lending practices and policies. New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is probing the extent to which universities and their financial aid officials are receiving improper kickbacks from student loan companies in exchange for steering students to lenders. Cuomo's office said last week it is investigating grants of stock from Student Loan Xpress's holding company to financial aid officers at three major U.S. universities. Officials from New York's Columbia University, University of Southern California and the University of Texas each owned at least 1,500 shares of Education Lending Group, the holding company for Student Loan Xpress, according to a 2003 stock offering prospectus. Student Loan Xpress is a preferred lender at the three universities. CIT said Mike Shaut, CEO of CIT's Student Loan Xpress unit, is on administrative leave, as are Fabrizio Balestri, who is president of the unit, and Robert deRose, vice chairman. CIT said the Randall Chesler, president of CIT Consumer Finance, will oversee the student loan business on an interim basis.
