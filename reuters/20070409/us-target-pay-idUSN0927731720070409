 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) said in a regulatory filing on Monday that it granted its president a special long-term equity award to entice him to stay, as Chief Executive Robert Ulrich, who is 63, approaches the company's retirement age of 65. 

 In its proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Target said that unless its mandatory retirement policy were waived, Ulrich would retire in 2008. To ensure President Gregg Steinhafel, 52, stays with the retailer as it undergoes succession planning, it said it granted him a special award in June that consisted of stock options and a performance share unit award. Target said the option grant would become exercisable on the fourth anniversary of the grant date, but Steinhafel would forfeit the entire award if he voluntarily ended his employment at Target before the vesting date. It also said he would forfeit the performance share unit award, which is based on revenue and earnings per share growth targets, if he decided to leave before the end of the performance period. Target also said Ulrich received a $17.45 million compensation package for 2006 and had a $37.77 million gain from the exercise of options and vesting of stock awards, as the discount retailer's year profit rose almost 16 percent. Target said Ulrich's compensation for 2006 included a salary of $1.66 million, a $3 million bonus, $3.13 million of non-equity incentive awards, $7.12 million from stock and option awards, and $2.54 million of "other compensation." Target said most of the other compensation is related to pension plan changes. Ulrich also had a $26.08 million gain from the exercise of 642,144 options, and a gain of $11.69 million from the vesting of 196,630 shares. Compensation is based on salary, bonus, the value of stock options and other awards granted during the year, and incentives and perks. Target has been spurring sales by stocking trendy but inexpensive clothing and home decor, and its sales at stores open at least a year have been outpacing those at larger rival Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ). For its 53-week fiscal year ended February 3, earnings rose to $2.787 billion from $2.408 billion in the 52-week fiscal year before. Earnings per share increased 18.5 percent to $3.21 per share from $2.71 per share a year earlier. Target shares were up 1 cent to $61.12 in afternoon trading.
