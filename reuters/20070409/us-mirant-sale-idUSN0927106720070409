 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent power producer Mirant Corp. MIR.N said on Monday it was exploring strategic options, including selling itself, pushing up its shares by more than 8 percent. 

 Mirant, which last year dropped an unsolicited bid to buy rival NRG Energy Inc. ( NRG.N ), said it did not expect the options to include acquiring another company. Independent power producers such as Mirant sell electricity into the open market at unregulated prices. Mirant emerged from bankruptcy protection early last year and has been considered a leading takeover candidate in the power sector following a $32 billion bid by a private equity group for Texas-based TXU Corp. TXU.N. The TXU bid has raised valuations for power plant assets and fueled speculation about acquisitions in the sector. "Obviously, there is this private equity cash sloshing around," said Charles Fishman, utility analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons, who does not rate Mirant or own any shares. Strategic buyers might include Dynegy Inc. ( DYN.N ) and NRG, said Fishman, adding that even Reliant Energy Inc. RRI.N could be a possibility, though this was less likely. Integrated power merchant companies might also be interested in purchasing Mirant, Fishman said. Based on Mirant's closing share price on Monday, the company has a market capitalization of $11.3 billion. Mirant abandoned its pursuit of NRG after several investor groups, including Pirate Capital LLC, Jana Partners LLC and Omega Advisors, came out against the deal. Pirate Capital said that instead of chasing NRG, Mirant should put itself up for sale. Mirant shares closed up $3.44, or 8.5 percent, at $44.08 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. Mirant's move also boosted shares of fellow independent power producers. Shares of Dynegy rose 2.6 percent while NRG gained 3.6 percent. Reliant Energy added 3.5 percent. Citigroup raised its price target on Mirant shares to $49 from $38, rating the stock a "buy." EXTRA CASH "The peer group has responded. This puts pressure on them to create value," Fishman said. The broader Standard & Poor's Utilities index .GSPU rose 0.65 percent. Mirant -- which has 24 U.S. plants including natural gas, oil, coal and hydro -- said one option it would consider was returning excess cash to shareholders from the sale of its businesses in the Philippines and Caribbean and six natural gas-fired plants in the United States. Mirant is in the process of selling its Philippines unit for $3.4 billion, and the six U.S. plants for $1.4 billion. It expects the two transactions to close in the second quarter. The sale of the Caribbean business is expected to close in mid-2007, the Atlanta-based company said. Mirant said the sale of its Philippines business was expected to generate about $1.1 billion in taxable gains. But for tax purposes, that gain is expected to be fully offset by Mirant's operating loss in 2006, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Mirant said it would not provide earnings forecasts while it was considering strategic options. JP Morgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) will serve as financial adviser in this process.
