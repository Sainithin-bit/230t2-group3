 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marathon Oil Corp. ( MRO.N ) expects its first-quarter oil and natural gas sales to dip from a year earlier, the oil producer and refiner said on Monday. 

 It also expects its refined product sales to drop, and margins for that business to stay flat. The company said it expects to report that oil and gas sales in the quarter came to 338,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (bopped). It sold 348,000 boepd in the same period in 2006 and 357,000 boepd in the 2006 fourth quarter. Marathon expects its oil and gas production in the first quarter to be about 343,000 boepd, compared with its forecast range of 335,000 to 355,000. "It's a little light," said BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Byrne. The production estimate was "below what I was looking for," he said. "I was closer to 350,000 (boepd) for the quarter. I'll be bringing down my numbers overall." Marathon plans to report its first-quarter earnings on May 1. Analysts, on average, expect the company to post a profit of $2.12 a share, up about 5 percent from a year earlier, according to Reuters Estimates. Marathon said the prices it received for crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbons in January and February fell to $47.99 per barrel from $49.30 in the first quarter of 2006. International prices dipped nearly $6 per barrel, to $48.74 from $54.54 a year earlier. Its average domestic natural gas prices in January and February fell just under a dollar from 2006 levels, to $5.69 per thousand cubic feet. Its international natural gas prices fell more than a dollar. Marathon said it expects its refined products sales volume to fall to about 1.33 million barrels a day in the first quarter from 1.42 million last year. It expects its refining and wholesale marketing margins to be comparable to last year, underperforming market indicators. The company said that due to pipeline constraints and other factors in the quarter, its refineries were forced to pay more for crude than benchmark prices would suggest, forcing down margins. Shares of Marathon rose $1, or about 1 percent, to $103.79 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
