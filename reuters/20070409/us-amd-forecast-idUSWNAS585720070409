 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Advanced Micro Devices Inc. ( AMD.N ) said on Monday that quarterly revenue would fall short of Wall Street expectations by about 20 percent, but the microprocessor maker's shares rose after it promised to slash this year's capital spending by one-fifth. 

 "AMD is signaling that it is focusing more on nearer-term profitability as opposed to targeting market share," said JoAnne Feeney, managing director with FTN Midwest Securities. "People were concerned about that strategy," Feeney said. AMD, the No. 2 supplier of computer processors after Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), said it expects to report first-quarter revenue of about $1.23 billion, well below the $1.54 billion that was the average analyst forecast on Reuters Estimates. It cited lower prices and sales volumes, particularly among resellers -- the small, independent computer makers that have traditionally been enthusiastic buyers of AMD chips. That was further evidence that a price war between AMD and Intel was continuing, Feeney said. "What we've been hearing is that the battle between Intel and AMD has been particularly severe at the high end," Feeney said. "We expect to see evidence of a decline in prices across the board, and that's likely to hurt both AMD and Intel." Still, Intel shares rose about 3 percent, on hopes that AMD's troubles meant its recent market-share gains would be slowed or rolled back, Feeney said. In early March, AMD warned investors that it would miss its revenue target of $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion due to losing market share among small, independent PC makers. The Sunnyvale, California-based company also said it plans to reduce its planned 2007 capital expenditures by about $500 million, and that the cut would not materially hurt capacity plans for the year. The company had previously planned to spend about $2.5 billion this year to boost capacity. AMD also pledged to reduce discretionary expenses and limit hiring to critical positions. The company's stock gained 5.1 percent to $13.52 in late morning trading. It was the second quarter in a row that AMD showed signs of trouble in the price war that has eroded profits for both companies in the $30 billion processor industry. AMD is due to report financial results on April 19 and said it would provide more details of its overhaul at that time. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg  in New York)
