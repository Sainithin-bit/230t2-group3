 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet phone company Vonage Holdings Corp. ( VG.N ) said on Monday it will continue providing services to existing customers, after a judge said on Friday that it could not add new customers due to a finding that it infringed Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) patents. 

 Vonage said it believed it will succeed in its appeal and was trying to work around Verizon patents. It also said it will hold a conference call for investors on Thursday. Its shares were down around 11 percent on Monday.
