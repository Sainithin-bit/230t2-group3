 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in Vonage Holdings Corp. ( VG.N ) fell as much as 11 percent on Monday after a judge said the Internet phone company could not add new customers as it infringed on Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) patents. 

 While Vonage won an emergency stay on the ban, analysts said the patent dispute was turning into a graver setback for the company than they initially expected. The stock hit a new low of $2.88, down 83 percent from their initial public offering price less than a year ago. "The legal battle appears to worsen at every step for Vonage, and the uncertainties have become magnified," Stanford Group analyst Clayton Moran said, urging investors to avoid Vonage shares. A jury in March found Vonage had infringed on three patents owned by Verizon related to voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) technology, and said Vonage must pay $58 million, plus royalties on future sales. On Friday, a court barred Vonage from adding new customers to its VoIP service, which the company pitches as a cheaper alternative to traditional phone services. Vonage won an emergency stay on the ban from an appeals court later on Friday. The company said on Monday it would continue providing services to existing customers and believed it would succeed in its appeal. It also said it was trying to work around Verizon patents and that it would hold a conference call for investors on Thursday. "Vonage also continues to believe that this case is an attempt to do in the court room what Verizon could not succeed in doing in the marketplace -- which is to put Vonage out of business," Vonage said in a statement. Vonage shares were down 35 cents at $3.02 in mid-afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The patent setbacks have contributed to a steady decline in the shares following their initial public offering at $17 in May 2006, amid worries about competition from cable operators and other Internet firms, as well as high marketing expenses. Analysts said winning an appeal or coming up with a way to work around the patents was vital to Vonage's survival. "In our opinion, absent a functioning 'work around' or a reversal of the District Court's ruling, we cannot envision how Vonage continues operations unimpeded," Deutsche Bank analyst Greg Miller wrote in a note to clients. Stanford Group's Moran said he was more negative than positive on Vonage's outlook. He and a few other analysts have said working around the patents may be difficult since the company uses software from various third parties. "If it can't work around the patent and loses its appeals, this company will be shut down. On the other hand, you would think a work around will be possible, but in that case it will just limp along," he said, adding that some customers may be required to replace their equipment to get around the patents. He also said despite the low share price, Vonage was unlikely to attract any acquisition bids from cable and telecoms companies, as previously speculated, due to doubts over its growth prospects and brand strength.
