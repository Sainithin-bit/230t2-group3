 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Carl Icahn, who is pressing for a board seat and changes at Motorola Inc. MOT.N, has raised his stake of the struggling mobile phone maker's shares to 2.9 percent from 2.7 percent, according to a regulatory filing on Monday. 

 The billionaire investor said in January he would seek a board seat to push the No. 2 maker of mobile phones into using some of its $11.3 billion cash pile to buy back more shares. Icahn, who has agitated for change at many companies and is also seeking board seats at WCI Communities Inc. WCI.N and Temple-Inland Inc. TIN.N, has lobbied for shareholders to vote him to the board at Motorola's annual meeting on May 7. Motorola, which has lost about a third of its market value, or $22 billion, in the last five months due to a sharp fall in phone prices and stiff competition, has urged shareholders not to support Icahn.
