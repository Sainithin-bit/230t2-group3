 BEIJING  (Reuters) - A top Chinese trade official on Monday predicted a "notable change" in the country's trade data for March after an unexpected surge in the surplus in the first two months of the year. 

 The surplus in January and February combined tripled from a year earlier to $39.7 billion, handing further ammunition to U.S. critics who say the yuan  CNY=CFXS  is seriously undervalued, giving Chinese exporters an unfair advantage in global markets. Vice Commerce Minister Gao Hucheng told reporters that data for March, due in principle on Tuesday, would show that the January-February results did not herald a further jump. Asked about the outlook for the surplus in the coming months, Gao said: "I suggest you look at the March trade figures -- you will see a notable change in them. "The surplus of roughly $40 billion in January and February is not indicative of the trend for the first quarter and the rest of the year." Economists polled by Reuters forecast that the surplus for March would be $21.1 billion, down a touch from a near-record $23.8 billion in February. Minggao Shen, an economist with Citigroup in Beijing, said that it was unlikely that China would see a shift from the trend of export-led growth anytime soon. He expects the surplus to widen in March to a record $25.5 billion. "If it is a change downward and it is reduced to, say, $10 billion, that would be a big change and a big surprise to us," Shen said in response to Gao's comments. HIGH-TECH IMPORTS Beijing has introduced a range of measures in recent months to trim the surplus, including cutting export tax rebates on some products, and Gao said he was confident that they would start to show results in the upcoming months, reining in the surplus. With frustration in the U.S. Congress over its large deficit with China running high, the United States has been taking further measures to address what many there see as unfair trading practices by Beijing. Washington took a big step in that direction recently by imposing countervailing duties on coated paper imports from China, a policy shift that could expose Chinese exporters across the board to a barrage of trade complaints. Addressing the textile and garments sector, which has been a source of trade tension in the past, Gao said that the ministry had no immediate plans to reduce export tax rebates because the current annual growth of 20-25 percent was within a normal range. State media had said that Beijing was likely soon to reduce such rebates for garment exports, to 11 percent from 13 percent. "As for the next step, we have to make further studies according to changes in the market," he said. Separately, the official Xinhua news agency cited Vice Commerce Minister Wei Jianguo as saying that China would introduce more policies to boost high-tech and machinery imports, especially from countries that had a large deficit with China. Wei said China should seek to shift its exports up the value chain while importing more of what it really needs, rather than simply slashing or restricting exports.
