 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Major railroads' shares jumped on Monday after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ) raised its stake in Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. BNI.N and two other rail companies. 

 A filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 6 showed that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire had raised its stake to more than 39 million shares, or a 10.9 percent stake, in BNSF. The company bought more than 1.6 million shares in the railroad last week. BNSF's shares jumped 19 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. Warren Buffett's assistant Debbie Bosanek confirmed that apart from the BNSF share purchase, Berkshire had spent $700 million on one of the additional rail investments and slightly less on the other. Bosanek did not disclose which other railroads the company had invested in. Buffett made his name through investing in companies with strong management and businesses he has considered to be undervalued. The U.S. railroads have seen business boom in the past three years, driven in particular by rising U.S. imports and higher demand for coal from utilities looking for lower-cost alternatives to expensive natural gas. In early trading, BNSF was up $5.92 at $88.64, down from a high for the day of $89.18. Shares in No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp. ( UNP.N ) were up $5.52, or 5.35 percent, at $108.72, while CSX Corp. ( CSX.N ) was up 2.71 percent or $1.11 at $42.07 and Norfolk Southern Corp. ( NSC.N ) was up $2.01 or 3.94 percent at $52.99. This took the Standard & Poor's 500 Railroads Index .GSPRAIL to a new record high of 422.34, up from the previous record of 404.50 set on February 22., before sliding back to 414.19. Canadian Pacific Railway ( CP.TO ) was also up 2.7 percent or C$1.72 at C$65.81 while Canadian National Railway Co. ( CNR.TO ) was up C$2.23 or 4.4 percent at $53.13. Both railroads have significant operations in the United States. Regional U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern ( KSU.N ) also got a lift from the news, with its stock trading up $1.08 or 3.03 percent at $36.73. Genesee & Wyoming Inc. ( GWR.N ) a holding company for 49 shortline railroads primarily in North America, was up 93 cents or 3.47 percent at $27.70. (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
