 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Corporate earnings growth is expected to have slowed to single digits in the first quarter for the first time in more than four years, but absent a sharp slide the slowdown is unlikely to halt rising U.S. equity prices. 

 Profits, after having grown at a clip of 10 percent or more since the third quarter of 2002, are expected to slow to 5 percent in the first quarter for the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX , according to a survey by Reuters Estimates. Earnings growth has surprised on the upside in recent years but hasn't pushed stock valuations higher than their historical norm of about 15 times company's expected earnings, money managers told Reuters on Monday. "Every time the earnings come in, they surprise on the high side. The market prices itself effectively down relative to that level, which is an expression of future caution," said Milton Ezrati, senior economist and market strategist at Lord Abbott & Co., which manages about $115 billion in assets. "And so I think the market is really braced for this slowdown," said Ezrati. "There is very little to fear in this slowdown, it's really built in." Unlike the late '90s when the market had priced in accelerating earnings and actually faced a profit decline, the market is now proceeding very cautiously, he said. "It means to us the market has more upside and the durability of the expansion is much more secure than if it had been a more exciting ride in the interim," Ezrati said. Earnings estimates have been coming down to below 4 percent, according to non-Reuters' estimates. Despite the expected slowdown, U.S. stocks are unlikely to underperform the rest of the world as they have in recent years, said Bob Doll, chief investment officer at BlackRock Inc. ( BLK.N ), which has about $1.1 trillion in assets under management. "I think we're going to see a lot of earnings and economic statistics that are going to be like a checkerboard," said Doll. There will be earnings surprises on the upside and downside, with volatility in both directions, he said. "I don't know if we'll get a surprise to the downside. Certainly estimates have been coming down a lot for the first quarter," Doll told Reuters in an interview. If growth re-accelerates after a slowdown, the market will respond with some strength and P/E ratios would then expand a bit later in the year, said Todger Anderson, chairman of Denver Investment Advisors, which oversees about $8 billion in assets. If a slowdown is a "pause that refreshes, we're not going to see any meaningful P/E compression," Anderson said. "If the pause creates incremental fear and appears to be taking on an increased momentum of its own, then you could see P/Es really begin to come down a little," Anderson said. Investors and traders believe as earnings growth slows it's going to put less pressure on the economy and on inflation, and then interest rates will fall, which buttresses the market, said David Scott, chief investment officer, at Chase Investment Counsel, which has about $6 billion in assets under management. "Rates have not come down, but that's the bet," Scott said. Contrary to others interviewed on Monday, Scott said he did not believe a profit slowdown has been priced into stock prices. "I still see a lot of companies that I think have risk to much slower earnings trading at relative high valuations," he said. Scott cited the technology area as trading with "heathy earnings."
