 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Affordable Residential Communities Inc. ( ARC.N ), an owner of home parks, said on Monday it is in talks to sell nearly all its assets to hedge fund Farallon Capital Management LLC for about $1.84 billion. 

 The unsolicited interest in Affordable Residential comes as other companies involved in home sites and low-cost manufactured housing said they have noticed an uptick in business, which could be related to tightening mortgage requirements for buying traditional homes. "It's probably no coincidence that we have seen the potential for an improvement of underlying fundamentals for the manufactured home business, as evidenced by the reports from  Origen Financial ORGN.O and also Sun Communities ( SUI.N )," BMO Capital Markets analyst Paul Adornato said. "Both of those companies reported an increase in activity in the first two months in 2007, which could be related to the fact that the single-family credit market seems to be tightening," he added. Through a representative, Farallon declined to comment further. Shares of Affordable Residential rose to $12.65 before settling back to $12.34, up 2.5 percent, or 30 cents, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The Englewood, Colorado-based landlord of about 57,000 home sites in about 275 parks in 23 states said it agreed to negotiate exclusively with Farallon for a week for the sale of nearly the whole company, not including recently acquired insurance subsidiary NLASCO. Under the current proposal, Affordable Residential would get $520 million to $545 million, or $9.00 to $9.40 per share, after covering its net operating losses, expenses, taxes repayment of debt and preferred stock. TO KEEP INSURER In the fourth quarter, the most recent for which results have been disclosed, Affordable Residential posted an operating net loss attributable to common stockholders of $10.1 million. If talks result in a deal, Affordable Residential would retain ownership of NLASCO and look to make "opportunistic acquisitions" with the proceeds, the company said in a statement. Adornato said the offer appeared to be short his estimates of the value of the assets by at least $1.18 per share. In January, Affordable Residential Communities closed on its acquisition of NLASCO, which includes the National Lloyds Insurance and American Summit Insurance companies. NLASCO provides fire and homeowners insurance to owners of lower-end and manufactured homes primarily in the southern United States. Hedge fund Farallon is familiar with the problems in the single-family mortgage market. It has a stake in Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co., a lender to borrowers with checkered credit histories, and recently agreed to loan the company $230 million. Separately, Farallon recently joined with Simon Property Group ( SPG.N ) to buy mall owner Mills Corp.
