 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Biotechnology company MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O said on Monday it expects to report first-quarter earnings nearly tripled from a year earlier, helped by higher sales of its respiratory drug Synagis. 

 The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based company said it anticipates first-quarter earnings of 62 cents to 67 cents per share, up from 23 cents a year earlier. Results in both quarters exclude share-based compensation expense. Analysts on average had expected 51 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. MedImmune said its first-quarter revenue was expected to rise by 11 percent to 12 percent, with net sales growth of 9 percent to 10 percent for Synagis.
