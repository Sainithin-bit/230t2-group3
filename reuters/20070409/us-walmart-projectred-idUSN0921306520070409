 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Monday that regular strategic reviews of its businesses are simply "good governance" after a report in the Wall Street Journal said the retailer had developed a secret plan that mulled a possible spin-off of its Sam's Club operations. 

 The Wall Street Journal said Wal-Mart's "Project Red" was a highly secret plan aimed at boosting the retailer's lagging stock price, and the plan included a consideration of, among other ideas, a possible spinoff of Sam's Club, Wal-Mart's warehouse club operator. "Our senior management, our board and their advisors regularly conduct thorough, strategic reviews of all aspects of our business. That's just good governance. We look at a full range of alternatives, many of which are considered and rejected, and we will not comment specifically on any of them," Wal-Mart said in a statement. The Journal also said Wal-Mart had sued Bruce Gabbard, the security engineer it fired last month, saying Gabbard possessed "highly confidential information about Wal-Mart's strategic planning." The article said the confidential information was an "apparent reference" to Project Red, and Gabbard was part of the security team for Project Red. The report said computer hard drives that Wal-Mart believed contained information about Project Red were in the car of Gabbard's wife, and on Saturday, the hard drives were delivered to the Benton County, Arkansas prosecutor's office. A call to Gabbard's lawyer was not immediately returned. Wal-Mart fired Gabbard in March for what it said were the unauthorized recording of calls to and from a New York Times reporter and for intercepting text messages. In media reports, Gabbard, who worked at Wal-Mart for 19 years, said he recorded the calls on his own because he felt pressured to stop embarrassing leaks. But he said that most of his spying activities were sanctioned by superiors. Wal-Mart shares rose 8 cents to $48.35 in morning trading.
