 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Laidlaw International Inc. LI.N, operator of iconic bus company Greyhound Lines and yellow U.S. school buses, said on Monday its quarterly net profit fell, citing one-time costs. 

 The Naperville, Illinois-based company reported net income for its fiscal second quarter ending February 28 of $18.5 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with $34.0 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Laidlaw said the results for the quarter included $9 million of additional interest expense related to a recent share repurchase program, plus $6 million of costs related to the company's planned takeover by Britain's biggest bus company FirstGroup Plc ( FGP.L ). Wall Street analysts had expected earnings per share for the quarter of 42 cents, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates.
