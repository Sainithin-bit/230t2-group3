 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ), which built a 10.9 percent stake in Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. BNI.N, said it has acquired smaller stakes in two other rail companies. 

 The moves prompted strong gains in major North American railroad stocks, including Burlington Northern, CSX Corp. ( CSX.N ), Norfolk Southern Corp. ( NSC.N ) and Union Pacific Corp. ( UNP.N ). Debbie Bosanek, assistant to billionaire Buffett, on Monday confirmed that Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire spent $700 million on one of the additional rail investments and slightly less on the other. It was not immediately clear which other railroads Berkshire invested in. CNBC television earlier reported the investments, citing an interview with Buffett. He was not immediately available for another interview. The Standard & Poor's 500 Railroads Index .GSPRAIL, which includes the four biggest U.S. railroads, rose as much as 7.2 percent to a record. Buffett has made his name by investing in companies with strong management and businesses that he considers undervalued. It is common for shares of companies to rise when Berkshire discloses it has bought them. On Friday, Berkshire disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it owned 39,027,430 Burlington Northern shares, making it the Fort Worth, Texas-based company's largest shareholder. The market value of those shares was $3.23 billion as of April 5. The U.S. railroads have seen business boom in the past three years, driven in particular by rising U.S. imports and higher demand for coal from utilities looking for lower-cost alternatives to expensive natural gas. In late morning trading, Burlington Northern shares rose $5.93 to $88.65; CSX rose $1.06 to $42.02; Norfolk Southern rose $2.07 to $53.05, and Union Pacific rose $5.49 to $108.69. Canadian railroads also got a boost. Canadian Pacific Railway ( CP.TO ) was up 2.7 percent or C$1.72 at C$65.81 while Canadian National Railway Co. ( CNR.TO ) was up C$2.23 or 4.4 percent at $53.13. Both railroads have significant operations in the United States. Regional U.S. railroad Kansas City Southern ( KSU.N ) also got a lift from the news, with its stock trading up $1.08 or 3.03 percent at $36.73. Genesee & Wyoming Inc. ( GWR.N ) a holding company for 49 shortline railroads primarily in North America, was up 93 cents or 3.47 percent at $27.70. (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb )
