 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O, the world's 
second-largest personal computer maker, said on Monday that 
Nasdaq had informed the company it was out of compliance with 
listing requirements. 

  Dell received the letter on April 5, 2007, it said, after 
it delayed filing its annual report for fiscal 2007. It 
previously received a notice from Nasdaq related to its 
quarterly report.  Earlier, Dell said Nasdaq would stay any future action to 
delist the company's common stock, pending further review.
