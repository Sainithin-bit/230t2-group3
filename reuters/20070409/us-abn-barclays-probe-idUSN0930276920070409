 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A probe by the U.S. Justice Department into past money transfers at ABN AMRO Holding NV AAH.AS looms as a hurdle to signing a deal to sell the Dutch bank to Britain's Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ), the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 ABN is working toward trying to reach a settlement with the Justice Department but is facing time pressure while Barclays wants greater reassurance that the matter can be resolved before signing a deal to buy ABN for an estimated $80 billion within the next two weeks, the newspaper quoted people familiar with the situation as saying. Barclays does not want to inherit the risk of a criminal probe, these people said in the Journal. The exact operations under investigation by the Justice Department are not clear, the Journal said.
