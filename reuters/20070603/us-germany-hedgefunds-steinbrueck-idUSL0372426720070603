 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck reiterated his wish to see greater oversight of the hedge fund industry ahead of a key summit, but said he did not expect consensus on the matter to be reached quickly. 

 As leaders of the Group of Eight (G8) industrialized nations prepare to meet in Germany's Baltic resort of Heiligendamm on June 6-8, Steinbrueck said the government was hoping to broker an agreement that would lower the risks posed by the funds. "The government is trying to reach international consensus on potential measures that aim to limit potential systemic risks for financial stability," he wrote in a guest contribution for the weekend edition of the Boersen-Zeitung business daily. "Our aim is an international code of conduct, which the (hedge fund) industry -- also in its own interests -- applies to itself. It's also clear that we're only at the beginning of the debate and that there will not be any quick decisions." He added that enforcing binding legal regulations on hedge funds was not feasible but that this would not be necessary either if the funds submitted to indirect oversight. "To supplement the indirect approach I'd like to see market discipline strengthened by making hedge funds more transparent," said Steinbrueck, who said in May he did not expect a deal to emerge on hedge funds at the Heiligendamm summit. However, the minister also told Reuters last month he hoped the outlines of a code of conduct could be agreed by the time Germany's presidency of the G8 concludes at the end of 2007. German efforts to forge consensus on hedge fund oversight have had to contend with a cautious attitude to regulation from countries like the United States and particularly Britain.
