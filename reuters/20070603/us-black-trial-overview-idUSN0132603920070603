 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The testimony of more than two dozen witnesses and reams of documents shown to jurors at Conrad Black's fraud trial has not produced the telling piece of evidence that resoundingly implicates the one-time media mogul, attorneys observing the 11-week trial said. 

 But the prosecution, which wrapped up its case last week, constructed a solid argument that Black and three co-defendants at former Chicago-based media giant Hollinger International Inc. committed a $60 million fraud and abused company perks. "There were no smoking gun documents. But this is the case they were dealt and I think the prosecution did a very good job," said Hugh Totten, an attorney who handles white collar criminal defense cases and has attended parts of the trial in U.S. District Court. The Canadian-born Black, 62, faces 13 counts of fraud, tax evasion, obstructing justice and racketeering, charges that could send him to jail for 101 years and penalize him with millions of dollars in fines and forfeitures. One count of money laundering against Black, who built and then dismantled one of the world's largest newspaper publishing empires and became a globe-trotting celebrity and a member of Britain's House of Lords in the process, was dropped without comment by prosecutors. Two of the other co-defendants, both Canadian, are charged with illegally diverting money to themselves and to Black with the help of Hollinger's corporate counsel, an American who is also on trial. Hollinger is now called the Sun-Times Media Group. STAR WITNESS TROUBLING The prosecution's least impeachable witnesses came at the beginning and the end of its case -- with troubling star witness David Radler in the middle, court observers said. Radler, who built Hollinger International with Black over more than three decades, has pleaded guilty and agreed to testify in exchange for a lesser sentence to be served in his native Canada. His testimony placed Black behind the scheme, recounting a phone call where Black declared the two partners could divert money to themselves through so-called non-competition agreements. Prosecutors charge that Black and the others used the non-compete agreements -- assurances made to buyers of Hollinger newspaper properties that sellers would not compete against them in a given market -- to pay themselves tax-free bonuses. Defense lawyers attacked Radler's credibility, given past lies that he admitted to telling government investigators during what he referred to on the stand as his "rationalization phase." "He (Radler) was a little flaky, but he was also legitimately asking questions of his questioners," Totten said. The defense also sought to show Black and Radler operated in separate spheres, with Black focused on London's Daily Telegraph and the National Post, his Canadian creation -- both since sold. Radler, meanwhile, concentrated on the Chicago Sun-Times and hundreds of smaller newspaper properties. The closest thing the much ballyhooed trial has seen to celebrity witnesses were the high-profile members of Hollinger's former audit committee led by past Illinois Gov. James Thompson. White collar criminal defense attorney Rebekah Poston, who has followed the trial, said those witnesses did not fare well for the prosecution, and lent credence to the other side. "I found the most amazing and really the strongest witnesses for the defense ended up being the government's witnesses: the guys on the audit committee," she said. Totten added that Thompson in particular was "pummeled" by the defense for toeing whatever line Hollinger executives asked him to and for admitting to "skimming" company documents that he should have read in his role as board member. MISLEADING DISCLOSURES The directors were needed to nail down a key plank of the prosecution's case: that even when payments were disclosed in company filings, the disclosures were misleading because they said the buyers had requested the non-compete agreements. Several newspaper executives testified they did not request them of the Hollinger executives. Defense lawyers countered that Hollinger's outside lawyers and accountants either sanctioned or did not question the suspect payments. The defense also poked holes in accusations that Black siphoned company funds for a South Seas vacation, a birthday party for his wife, and a New York apartment by eliciting testimony that he worked constantly and that his lavish spending served many purposes. Another prosecution theme was Black's eloquent defense of his exalted status at the company and his contempt for restive shareholders. It was displayed through correspondence read to jurors and in audio recordings of two annual meetings. Still to come is the bulk of the defense case, which may last only a week longer, with none of the four defendants considered likely to testify. "The only way you'll see Black testify in this case is if one of the other defendants testifies," Totten said. The defense has indicated it will show that non-compete agreements are standard in the newspaper industry.
