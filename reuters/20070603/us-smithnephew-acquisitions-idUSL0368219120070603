 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Smith & Nephew Plc aims to be the world's largest medical devices firm by making more acquisitions after completing the $889 million purchase of Switzerland's Plus Orthopedics Holding AG, its outgoing CEO was quoted as saying. 

 "We have a clear objective of becoming the global leader in orthopedics," Christopher O'Donnell told the Neue Zuercher Zeitung in an interview published on Sunday. "We have at the moment 30 to 40 companies which are potential takeover targets on our radar screen," he told the newspaper. "The companies are from all over the world, including Switzerland." O'Donnell is standing down from his post at the British company at the end of June and will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer David Illingworth. Smith & Nephew ( SN.L ) said after announcing the Plus Orthopedics deal in March it had a 12 percent share of the global orthopedics reconstruction market, where implants are planned rather than being forced after an accident. The British company ranks fourth worldwide in elective joint implants behind Zimmer Holdings ( ZMH.N ), Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and Stryker Corp ( SYK.N ).
