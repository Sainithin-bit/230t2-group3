 CANBERRA  (Reuters) - Greece must honor all of its commitments in order to secure a second euro-zone bailout announced in July, French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Sunday. 

 "Greece has made some mistakes. They have to correct these mistakes. They also have to honor the commitments that they have made," he told reporters on a visit to Australia. (Reporting by  Rob Taylor ; Editing by  Mark Bendeich )
