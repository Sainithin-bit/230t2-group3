 CANBERRA  (Reuters) - French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said on Sunday he believed the Chinese currency was undervalued and would raise the issue when he visits Beijing shortly. 

 "We believe that the yuan is undervalued at present. We will certainly discuss this with the Chinese," he told reporters on his last day of a visit to Australia. He IS traveling back to France via China. (Reporting by  Rob Taylor ; Editing by  Mark Bendeich )
