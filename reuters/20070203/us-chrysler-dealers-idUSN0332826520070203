 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group Chief Executive Tom LaSorda said on Saturday the No. 3 U.S. automaker was mending strained relations with its dealers after an inventory crisis that pushed it into a $1.5 billion third-quarter loss. 


 LaSorda said the automaker had reformed its approach to vehicle orders after widespread criticism from its dealers who complained they were being forced to accept an unwanted and costly inventory of trucks and vans with unpopular features. "We've got the dealers back on our side. We'll keep them. You watch," LaSorda told reporters in Las Vegas ahead of his first meeting as CEO with representatives of Chrysler's nearly 3,800 U.S. dealers. The National Automobile Dealers Association is holding its annual convention in the desert resort city from February 3 to 6. LaSorda said a restructuring plan for Chrysler scheduled to be announced on February 14 in conjunction with fourth-quarter results for its parent company, DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, would include some "changes" to manufacturing operations. He declined to comment in detail on that plan, widely expected to include job cuts, plant closings, changes to production schedules and steps to reduce procurement costs. LaSorda said he believed Chrysler would be able to ease off the sharp production cutbacks that it put into place last year by the second quarter of this year. "The production was cut significantly in January," he said. "February it's a little less and certainly a lot less in March. And we feel we've got the momentum from there." LaSorda took charge of the automaker's troubled sales operations in December after the departure of former sales chief Joe Eberhardt, who had become a lightning rod for dealer criticism. PROFIT TARGETS SET LaSorda, an expert in low-cost manufacturing who took over as Chrysler CEO in 2005, said he intended to keep the sales role for a few more months as he looks for new sales chief. Many dealers for the Detroit-based automakers are facing mounting losses because of the drop in market share for the brands that they represent. LaSorda said he was not satisfied with the profitability levels of Chrysler's dealers and had set targets he declined to disclose for an improvement in their earnings. "We're not where we need to be," he said. "We're off significantly." Chrysler was dogged by inventory management problems in 2006, including its disclosure that it had been holding large numbers of vehicles in a "sales bank" before they had been ordered for showrooms. At one point last year, the No. 4 U.S. automaker had about 100,000 vehicles sitting in that sales bank of unassigned inventory that were not being disclosed in its monthly sales calls for analysts. Chrysler's U.S. sales slipped 7 percent in 2006, although sales outside the United States were up almost 7 percent. On a global basis, vehicle sales fell 4.5 percent. In the U.S. market, DaimlerChrysler, which includes the parent company's Mercedes brand, slipped to become the No. 4 player, behind Toyota Motor Corp., which saw its sales rise 13 percent. LaSorda said the biggest complaint he had heard from dealers was that Chrysler had to overhaul its vehicle ordering process to avoid building vehicles with unpopular combinations of features. In coming months, Chrysler is launching a new Avenger sedan, a convertible version of its latest Sebring model and a new pair of redesigned minivans, a market segment it leads. Meanwhile, LaSorda said Chrysler's four-door Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicle had become a sell-out hit since its launch last year. "We can't make enough," he said. "I can't get enough parts. It's way above our production plans."
