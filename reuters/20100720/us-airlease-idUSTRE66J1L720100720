 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - U.S. aircraft leasing company Air Lease Corp. on Tuesday said it planned to order two extra aircraft, with a "more than 50 percent chance" it could be with U.S. manufacturer Boeing.

Chief Executive Steven Udvar-Hazy told journalists at the Farnborough air show: "Yes, two more today" Air Lease earlier on Tuesday ordered 20 jets from Brazilian group Embraer for nearly 800 million at list prices.
