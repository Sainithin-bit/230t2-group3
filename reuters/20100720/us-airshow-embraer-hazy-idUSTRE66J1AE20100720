 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing pioneer Steve Udvar-Hazy struck a deal on Tuesday to buy 20 jets from Brazilian group Embraer for nearly $800 million at list prices. 

 Hazy's Air Lease Corp spent $4 billion on Monday buying planes from EADS's Airbus unit, and expectations were high he could still do substantial business with Boeing during the Farnborough Airshow this week as well. (Reporting by  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
