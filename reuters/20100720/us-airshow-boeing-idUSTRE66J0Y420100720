 FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) -- Boeing Co's decision on whether to re-engine or redesign its hot-selling narrow-body 737 is largely in the hands the customers, the head of marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes said on Tuesday. 

 "It is not easy, and it is not a consensus," Randy Tinseth told Reuters at the Farnborough Airshow in an interview. "Customer feedback has been varied," he said. Boeing has said it may decide whether to re-engine the plane later this year. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by Dan Lalor)
