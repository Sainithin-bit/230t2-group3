 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Jordan's national carrier Royal Jordanian said it had purchased three Boeing Co. 787-8 Dreamliners from the world's second largest planemaker, in an order worth around $500 million. 

 "The 787 will allow us to competitively serve North America and other destinations in our network from Amman," Hussain Dabbas, president and chief executive of Royal Jordanian told reporters. By 2015 Royal Jordanian would have 11 Dreamliners in its fleet -- seven will be purchased outright by the company while the remaining four will be leased, Dabbas said.
