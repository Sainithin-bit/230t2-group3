 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) has invested hundreds of millions of dollars to keep its C-17 production line running, in the hope that Congress will fund 15 more C-17 transport planes in a war spending bill for fiscal 2009, which begins October 1. 

 Boeing is under contract to build 190 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, and another 15 were approved in the fiscal 2008 war spending bill approved by Congress this summer, Jean Chamberlin, vice president of Boeing global mobility systems, said on Tuesday. She said Boeing had shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to keep the line running until it was able to sign a contract for those planes by the end of September. The company had also decided to spend hundreds of millions to begin buying titanium and other long lead materials needed to ensure that its Long Beach, California production plant could continue operating past 2010. "We will face shutdown if we don't get additional congressional action for FY09," Chamberlin told reporters at the annual Air Force Association meeting. An additional order for 15 more aircraft would bring the total number to be purchased by the Air Force to 220, well above the 180 the Pentagon had expected to buy. Chamberlin said she did not expect Congress to add any C-17s into the 2009 base budget, despite a move by the House Armed Services Committee to do so. She said any additional funding would likely come in a war spending bill next year after completion of a Pentagon study of airlift capability needs next summer and a separate independent report by the Institute for Defense Analyses. Those reports are due to assess whether the U.S. military needs more of the workhorse planes, given an expected increase in the size of the U.S. military and additional responsibilities around the world, including establishment of a new African Command. The reports could pave the way for the 15 additional planes in fiscal 2009, and possibly many more in years to come. Chamberlin said Boeing was continuing to press for additional C-17 purchases to replace the oldest of the larger C-5 transport planes built by Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ), a move considered but then dismissed as too expensive by Pentagon acquisition chief John Young in spring, when the C-5 program ran into massive cost overruns.
