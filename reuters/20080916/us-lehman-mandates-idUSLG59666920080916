 HONG KONG/LONDON  (Reuters) - The collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.P has set off a frenzy among rival investment banks seeking to snatch business from the fallen Wall Street firm. 

 Top dealmakers in the past few days have made trips to corporate headquarters, according to sources within the banks, hoping to poach Lehman clients for everything from merger and acquisition advisory to securities underwriting. High on their list of targets in Asia are likely to be the Chinese companies Lehman has ties to. Lehman represents top Chinese aluminum maker Chinalco, which led a $14 billion investment early this year in miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ), a minority stake it has said it may increase. "On the M&A side, the Street is going after everything they know Lehman has," said an investment banking source in Hong Kong who did not want to be named. In Europe, Lehman was working on the sale of three Eastern European television stations by Newscorp NWSa.N. It was also seeking second-round bids for the sale of Ireland's Elan Corp's ( ELN.I ) drug delivery unit by mid-September, in a mandate with Goldman Sachs. Lehman ranked ninth on $37.2 billion worth of deals in year-to-date Asia M&A league tables, according to Thomson Reuters, up from 23rd a year ago. After failing to strike a deal to sell the company or its assets, Lehman on Monday filed for bankruptcy protection, collapsing under the weight of heavy exposure to subprime mortgage securities. With operations across the globe, Lehman was once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank. "We're keeping an eye on three or four situations," said one dealmaker at a rival bank in Asia, noting that sole mandates are of particular interest. Mandates where Lehman is the sole advisor are of particular concern for clients, as deals tend to follow sensitive schedules, and finding a replacement takes time and effort. Such clients are also the most vulnerable to poaching. "It's a little delicate, as you could imagine, and there's a fine line between being helpful to clients and being vulture-like," the banker added. The banker also predicted that Lehman bankers would move to rival banks before deals do, noting that senior Lehman bankers looking for another job would be touting their pipeline of deals. "I'm sure every bank is running sheets on what deals are announced with Lehman as an adviser and where they can step in," said another Hong Kong banker. Lehman bankers were trying to keep nervous clients calm, several sources close to the situation said. "Chapter 11 effectively closes down Lehman's trading desks, even though they are not part of the filing," said Larry Grace, a commodities and energy analyst at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong and a former bankruptcy lawyer. "Other units such as M&A or asset management will continue along a bit longer on hopes of selling any or all of them." SOLE MANDATES Lehman is the lone adviser to the parent of India's Sterlite Industries for its agreement in May to buy the operating assets of bankrupt U.S. copper miner Asarco for $2.6 billion -- a deal that is still playing out in bankruptcy court. Lehman advised CITIC International Financial Holdings (CIFH) on its pending $1.3 billion agreement with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentina SA. Spain's BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) reached a deal in June to double its stakes in Chinese bank CITIC ( 0998.HK ) and CIFH ( 0183.HK ), which will be delisted as part of the deal. It is among the underwriters of two South Korean bonds currently on hold -- a 10-year sovereign bond worth roughly $1 billion and Woori Bank's 5-year $500 million bond.
