 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) Chief Executive John Chambers sought to ease Wall Street's concerns about technology spending on Tuesday, holding to the company's long-term growth target despite a weak U.S. economy and financial sector. 

 The top U.S. network equipment maker has been aiming for long-term revenue growth of 12 to 17 percent a year, but it has recently fallen below that. Cisco has forecast 8 percent growth in the current quarter and 8.5 percent growth in the next. Chambers told a financial analysts meeting that the company is sticking to its goal regardless of the recent slowdown. "We've never been more comfortable with our 12 to 17 percent growth long-term projection than we are right now," he said in his presentation, which was webcast, adding that Cisco's focus on developing new technologies is starting to pay off. Cisco shares jumped 2 percent to $22.82, rebounding along with the overall market after a report that the Federal Reserve was mulling a loan package for American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ). They had fallen earlier after the Fed left rates unchanged. Cisco shares have fallen around 27 percent from a year earlier. While Cisco is best known for selling routers and switches, it has expanded in recent years into software and new technologies such as video conferencing and data center virtualization. "Now you begin to see literally wave after wave, not just of advanced technologies, but cross-functional priorities, each of which has the potential to be a billion dollars in the reasonably short-term future of three to five years. And a number of them over a longer term have the potential to get to $10 billion," the CEO said. Chambers said Cisco would continue to broaden its technology portfolio and would make sure the various products -- including software, hardware, and services -- link together and complement each other. In August, after announcing fiscal fourth-quarter results, Chambers had said he saw a challenging environment lasting another few quarters. Because of his close connections with top policymakers like Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, as well as the direct impact Cisco faces from changes in corporate technology spending, Wall Street takes Chambers' views on the economy seriously. "While there will be up and downs in the global economies, we look at these as bumps," Chambers said, adding that Cisco would be able to navigate through such difficulties.
