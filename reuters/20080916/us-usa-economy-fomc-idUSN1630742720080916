 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve held its key benchmark U.S. interest rate steady on Tuesday, opting for the time being to soothe rattled financial markets with central bank lending facilities rather than rate cuts. 

  KEY POINTS: * The U.S. central bank's decision leaves the interbank overnight federal funds rate at 2 percent, where it has been since April.  COMMENTS: GREGORY MILLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SUNTRUST BANKS INC, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: "I wasn't surprised. I was also pleased that they did not cut the rate. I think they should not. "Under these extraordinary circumstances perhaps I wouldn't have been terribly surprised if they had. But I think the Fed, coming just after a pretty dark weekend, used this meeting and policy statement to sort of snap the market back into perspective. "The truth is for as integrated and important as the financial services industry is in this U.S. economy and in global economies in general, it's not the only thing going. We do have a number of other firms in different places, different sizes that are still getting up in the morning and going to work. And all of them, including financial services, face the problem of prices rising."  CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "We didn't expect a cut from them but to be honest I'm a little surprised that the statement isn't a little more dovish. They didn't give a whole lot of ground." "They are still expressing concern for inflation which I think at this point is a little bit like yesterday's news. With emerging economies slowing down that pressure on input costs is definitely coming off and with the banking sector under so much stress you have actually a deflationary shock domestically."  GEORGE FEIGER, CEO CONTANGO CAPITAL ADVISORS, BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA: "You could cut Fed funds rate from 2 percent to 1.5 percent, it won't cause any more lending. The banking system has no capital base to lend. So from the Fed's point of view, at the moment, there isn't much point in moving the rate from 2 to 1.5 percent or 1.75 percent. "It may be psychologically nice if they want to play day games with the stock market, but why will they want to do that? I think they don't know what else to do. I think they understand that until they rebuild the capital base of the banking system nothing good will happen."  GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: That's quite a surprise. Obviously the dollar is rallying here. It had been priced in for much of the course of today that they would cut by 25 basis points. We are getting a little bit of a push in the dollar here, $1.4050 should base the euro for now. We are going to watch equities very very closely. "The Fed seems to be taking a hands off approach. Everybody will be watching what happens with AIG. Will the Fed provide a bridge loan to them for $75 billion? Right now the lack of the Fed move on interest rates might send a bit of confidence to the markets that things are not as bad as they had thought and that once we clear this AIG problem it will be getting better. It is interesting that they say the risks remain balanced between growth and inflation, so it's going to be very interesting to see how this plays out through the rest of the day."  ANTONIO SOUSA, CHIEF STRATEGIST, DAILYFX.COM, NEW YORK: "The Fed has disappointed the market today by keeping the rates unchanged. Expectations were for a rate cut. People were talking about almost 50 basis points (rate cut)...It seems they remain very concerned about price stability, more than the markets were expecting. "The (FOMC) statement was more hawkish than expected. The Fed remains concerned about the second-round effects of high oil price that they still have."  JAMES CARON, CO-HEAD, GLOBAL RATES RESEARCH, MORGAN STANLEY, NEW YORK: "The bottom line is watch what they do, not what they say. They pumped the market up with a $140 billion liquidity injection (through overnight repos on Monday and Tuesday), and if I had to choose between that and a 50 basis point cut today, which is more symbolic -- I'd choose the $140 billion. The Fed is doing what they need to do, they are pumping the market with more liquidity, and that is the right thing."  CHARLIE SMITH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, GREENTREE, PENNSYLVANIA: "I think the Fed would have liked to have had some resolution with AIG ahead of this decision, but obviously they didn't get it, so it's steady as she goes." "The language was stronger on inflation than I would have expected, given that the CPI number that we got was so tame." "Treasury (market) moves I think you have to put in the context of what's happened in the past four or five days. The 30-year is at levels we haven't seen since the early 1960s. Any blip we get as a result of the Fed decision I don't think is going to mean that much."  BUCKY HELLWIG, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, MORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA: "It seems rather irresponsible simply because we have such stress in the system. Yesterday, fed funds traded at 6 percent. We have financial institutions in trouble and no sign of inflation. So their inflation concerns seem to be misplaced. A 25- or 50-basis-point cut would have helped calm markets. I don't think they've cut enough. The Fed needs to cut short-term rates further to create a situation where financial companies could boost their earnings. "The market has taken it pretty well, so at least that's encouraging. If this lack of a rate cut presages some sort of long guarantee from the Treasury or Fed to keep AIG from going under, it could be a net positive. But I'm still surprised."
