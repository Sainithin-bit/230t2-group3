 LONDON  (Reuters) - In structured credit markets, Lehman Brothers' LEH.P demise is likely to trigger unwinds of some products, leave investors stranded without a market or lead to months of wrangling over what many are worth. 

 "There are hundreds of issues to be resolved in the structured credit world," said a strategist specialising in structured credit, particularly now that a major player in the opaque market has stopped doing business. "In all these different markets, Lehman acted as a counterparty or an arranger or made markets or was referenced as collateral," he added. Lehman's collapse is likely to force some unwinds in the roughly $600 billion market of synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which pose one of the biggest deleveraging threats hanging over the market, analysts said. Synthetic CDOs are pools of credit default swaps (CDS) on 50, 100 or more typically investment-grade U.S. and European corporate credits. These portfolios are divided into tranches, or slices, by degree of risk and sold to investors. The riskiest slice at the bottom is exposed to the first few percent of losses from defaults in the portfolio. Mezzanine tranches take the next fixed percentage of losses and so on to the triple-A rated tranches at the top. Lehman's collapse could trigger unwinds in most CDOs in which it acted as a swap counterparty, unless investors can find another bank to take its place, usually within a timeframe of 10 to 30 days, Fitch Ratings said in a report on Tuesday. Any unwind is likely to be at a steep loss -- around 30 cents on the dollar for typical mezzanine tranches, a second strategist estimated -- because investor demand has dried up and market values have dropped. Lehman acted as swap counterparty or provided credit support for 69 synthetic CDOs rated by Fitch. INCREASING NERVOUSNESS Lehman also is included as a name in the portfolio of underlying corporate credits for 150 deals, or about a quarter of all synthetic CDOs rated by Fitch. Its bankruptcy "is expected to have a much smaller impact on these transactions as individual entities typically account for between 0.5 and 2 percent of the overall portfolio," Fitch said. Investors are starting to get nervous, however, after Lehman's collapse came on top of the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bailout and hand-in-hand with fears that others such as AIG could follow, the second strategist said. "We haven't seen unwinds yet," the second strategist said. The worry comes when defaults rise to levels that threaten losses to mezzanine tranches, which were popular among investors in 2006 and 2007, he said. "If things start to unwind, it will push spreads out even further." CDS MARKET More immediately, the focus has been on the $62 trillion credit default swaps (CDS) market. After Lehman's bankruptcy filing on Monday, CDS contracts in which it acted as a counterparty terminated automatically. Any investor who had bought protection from Lehman must return to the market to rehedge his position. Almost all but the least sophisticated investors will have required Lehman to put up collateral and adjust the amount every day to reflect the difference between the original contract price and the market price. Spreads widened so much on Monday after the filing, however, that collateral will fall short of covering the cost of rehedging. After the investor terminates the contract, therefore, he is likely to keep an outstanding claim against Lehman to be settled in the bankruptcy process, said an accountant specialising in risk management. "Counterparties rank quite highly up the bankruptcy chain, above unsecured creditors," he added. It is not easy for investors to find new counterparties in an illiquid market and to sort out the logistics of closing out trades with Lehman's administrator. For complex structured products that are less liquid, there are likely to be disputes on how to value the investor's residual exposure and collateral, and some of those disputes could end up in court, the accountant said. "They are now going to be busy for months sorting out these assets," the third credit strategist said. (Editing by David Cowell)
