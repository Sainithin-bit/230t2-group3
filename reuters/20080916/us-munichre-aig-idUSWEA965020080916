 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Munich Re ( MUVGn.DE ) is interested in a number of the assets of troubled U.S. insurance firm AIG ( AIG.N ), the German company's chief executive told a newspaper. 

 "In general a lot of the businesses are interesting for us," Chief Executive Nikolaus von Bomhard told German daily Handelsblatt in a preview of a story to be published on Wednesday. "Decisive is whether they fit with our strategy and price is right." Shares in American International Group (AIG) plumetted on Tuesday after the insurer's credit ratings were cut, heightening concerns it might file for bankruptcy. (Writing by  Noah Barkin )
