 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting American International Group's ( AIG.N ) debt with credit default swaps surged on Tuesday amid fears the insurer could be the next financial institution to fall victim to the credit crisis. 

 AIG's five-year credit default swaps rose to 52 percent upfront from 33 percent upfront at Monday's close, plus 500 basis points annually, according to data from Phoenix Partners Group. That means it now costs $5.2 million in upfront payments, plus $500,000 a year to insure $10 million of AIG debt.  This level indicates the credit derivative market is pricing in a 90-to-95 percent chance of AIG defaulting on its debt, said Tim Backshall, chief strategist at Credit Derivatives Research in Walnut Creek in California. Concerns about AIG grew after the insurer's credit ratings were cut late Monday, jeopardizing its efforts to raise the cash necessary for survival. AIG had turned to the Federal Reserve late Sunday to request $40 billion in funds after talks with buyout firms and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway broke down. The Fed hired investment bank Morgan Stanley to review options for the firm, a person familiar with the situation said on Monday. It also asked JPMorgan Chase & Co and Goldman Sachs Group Inc to explore arranging $70 billion to $75 billion in loans to support AIG, among other financing options, another person familiar with the situation said. Talks are continuing on Tuesday, according to a New York Fed official. AIG said it is considering selling assets, including its aircraft-leasing business, as well as a private equity capital infusion. Moody's Investors Service cut AIG's rating to A2 from Aa3, a two-notch downgrade. S&P lowered the rating to A-minus from AA-minus, a three-peg reduction, and Fitch Ratings reduced its standing to A from AA-minus, a two-notch cut. AIG's ratings are still investment grade, although all three agencies said more downgrades could follow. Research firm CreditSights said AIG management urgently needs to address investor concerns about the company's financial health. "Without further management clarity, we fear that the AIG franchise could become impaired by the market selloff," said analyst Rob Haines in a note. CreditSights continues to view AIG as the strongest worldwide insurance franchise, he said. "However, the company has simply become too big to effectively manage in an efficient, transparent fashion." WASHINGTON MUTUAL Washington Mutual Inc's ( WM.N ) debt protection costs remained at distressed levels on Tuesday after Standard & Poor's late on Monday cut the thrift's credit rating into junk territory. The announcement followed downgrades last week by Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings. Moody's also cut the thrift to junk, while Fitch still rates it investment grade. WaMu's credit protection costs on Tuesday fell to 53.5 percent on an upfront basis, in addition to annual premiums of 5 percent for five years, from 54.57 percent at Monday's close, according to Markit Intraday. Credit default swaps trade on an upfront basis when a company is considered distressed and sellers of protection want to be paid more at the outset of the contract due to higher perceived risk of the firm defaulting on its debt.
