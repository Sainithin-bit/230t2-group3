 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to insure the debt of Morgan Stanley fell after the investment bank reported better-than-expected earnings for the third quarter. 

 Credit default swaps on Morgan Stanley's debt dropped 35 basis points to around 710 basis points, or $710,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, after earlier jumping as high as 880 basis points, said a trader. The swaps closed on Monday at 499 basis points, according to CMA DataVision. The investment-grade credit derivative index also improved on the earnings, tightening 8 basis points to 182 basis points, according to Markit Intraday.
