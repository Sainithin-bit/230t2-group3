 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O has so far failed to see the normal comeback in customer demand during September that it traditionally sees as buyers return from summer holidays, a top executive said on Tuesday. 

 Dell Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden said the world's No. 2 computer maker had seen some softening in July and "slowness" in August, typically slow sales months, especially with customers in Europe, and in North America to a lesser extent. But what triggered Dell to warn of weakening global demand earlier on Tuesday was the absence of any sign that global computer demand had recovered by mid-September -- halfway through the company's fiscal third quarter ending in October. "This is not coming back the way we expected it to," Gladden told investors at the Bank of America investment conference taking place this week in San Francisco.
