 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) remains "very confident" it can hit its current quarter profit target, despite currency headwinds and on-going weakness in its printer business, a top executive said on Tuesday. 

 HP Chief Financial Officer Cathie Lesjak told the Bank of America annual investment conference in San Francisco that she was confident the diversified computer company could meet its operating margin targets of 5.0 percent to 5.5 percent in fiscal 2009.
