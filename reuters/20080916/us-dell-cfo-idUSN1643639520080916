 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O is seeing broad-based slowing in global technology demand but the computer maker believes it can continue to gain market share despite weaker growth, a top executive said on Tuesday. 

 Dell's Chief Financial Officer Brian Gladden told the Bank of America investment conference in San Francisco that mid-way through its third quarter the company was seeing sales demand slow. "We still intend to gain share, but it is a question now of really what the underlying market growth is," he said. Gladden said that Dell had gained market share during the first half of the fiscal year -- through July -- across all product segments and geographies, and that it expected to see further share gains, albeit in a slower-growing market.
