 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Federal Reserve policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2008 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. FOMC STATEMENT, SEPT 16: "Strains in financial markets have increased significantly and labor markets have weakened further. Economic growth appears to have slowed recently, partly reflecting a softening of household spending. Tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing contraction, and some slowing in export growth are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters. Over time, the substantial easing of monetary policy, combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity, should help to promote moderate economic growth. "Inflation has been high, spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities. The Committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year, but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain. "The downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are both of significant concern to the Committee. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability." * FED VICE CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, SEPT 11: "Partly owing to the feedback of price declines on lenders, mortgage conditions have tightened some since the late spring ... the jury is still out on whether housing prices are close to finding a bottom. "Restraint on credit supplies is likely to persist because intermediaries have some way to go to rebuild their balance sheets. The process of adjustment to a safer, more resilient financial system is going to take a while." * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, SEPT 8: "One of the things that has been very disturbing is that recently we have seen a lot of price and cost pass-through." "Short-term, I expect economic growth will be anemic. Short-term, I think it is even odds that we'll have still-greater inflationary pressures, or that they will subside." SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, SEPT 4: "The slightly negative real (federal) funds rate does not imply a highly accommodative policy stance." "My forecast is for sluggish growth in the second half of this year, with substantial downside risks -- especially emanating from the financial system." "It seems clear that inflation risks have diminished somewhat in recent months as commodity prices have come down from their highs." * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, SEPT 4: "While it seems pretty clear that economic momentum is slowing, the jury is out on whether lesser momentum will be sufficient to translate into relief on the price front." BOSTON FED PRESIDENT ERIC ROSENGREN, SEPT 3: "While the fed funds rate is low by historical standards, I would argue that one cannot capture the stance of monetary policy by only looking at this one rate, particularly during a period when the transmission of monetary policy has been impeded by problems with securitization, financial institutions, and GSEs. "The reductions in the funds rate have done little but offset some of the tightening occurring in the marketplace in response to the credit crunch conditions. Thus one can argue that much of the easing in monetary policy to date has merely offset the tightening in credit conditions created by the financial turmoil that began last summer." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT TOM HOENIG, SEPT 1: "The current stance of policy, while understandably calibrated for responding to the immediate financial crisis, will make it difficult to achieve our mandate for price stability over the longer term." "For a market economy to work best, it must to the maximum extent possible find a balance between financial stability and a stable price environment," Hoenig said, "and in doing so must be able to allow individual institutions to fail." * FED BOARD GOVERNOR RANDALL KROSZNER, SEPT 1: "Throughout the world, the challenges posed by weakening economic activity were further complicated by mounting inflationary pressures as food and energy prices soared," "It has become clear that the initial assessment that the United States had decoupled from the rest of the world was incorrect, and that, in fact, the global economy remains closely connected by both trade and financial linkages." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, AUG 27: "I am comfortable with the current policy. I believe we need to give the second half (of 2008) a little time, to see if the scenario that I personally am counting on plays out more or less according to plan. "It seems to me that we have to continue to be very vigilant about the status of the financial markets and their potential negative impact on the general economy. "With weak growth and financial market strains, I believe the most likely outcome is that both headline and core inflation will diminish over the rest of 2008 and into next year."
