 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of American International Group Inc pared losses in heavy after-hours trading on Tuesday following a New York Times report that the U.S. Federal Reserve would provide the insurer financing and take a stake in the company. 

 The stock last traded at $2.50, up from below $2 a share before the Times story. The stock closed Tuesday's regular session at $3.75 and tumbled shortly after the ending bell after Bloomberg reported that options under consideration to save AIG included conservatorship.
