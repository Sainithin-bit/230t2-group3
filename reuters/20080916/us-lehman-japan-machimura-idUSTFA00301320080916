 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The bankruptcy of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers will have only a limited effect on Japanese financial institutions, Japan's top government spokesman said on Tuesday. "We acknowledged during today's meeting that this problem will have only a limited impact on domestic financial institutions and their Japanese clients," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told his regular daily media conference.
