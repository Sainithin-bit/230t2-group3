 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Options investors could benefit from U.S. government criticism of investment firm Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) if they use a specific strategy, Barron's wrote on Sunday. 

 Investors should consider buying Goldman's January $120 puts, which recently traded at $8.75, wrote the newspaper. To fund the purchase, sell January $185 calls that traded at $8.75. The positions will return handsomely if politicians ramp up their criticism of the company's large bonuses and subprime mortgage sales, Barron's said. Shares of Goldman closed at $154.12 on Friday, down $6.75. (Reporting by  Chelsea Emery ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
