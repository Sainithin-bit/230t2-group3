 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. banks' much-vaunted issuance of their own bonds still costs them so dearly that government-backed debt issuance is likely to be banks' bread and butter for months to come. 

 By and large, banks have emerged from government stress tests looking less vulnerable than before, analysts say. As a result, financial institutions are making much fanfare about their ability to sell debt again to private investors and their push to repay bailout funds in the wake of the global credit crisis. But it is much cheaper for banks to use the government backing as a prop to sell debt at about 2 percent yields, versus 6 percent or more for their own bonds. The government-backed bank bonds are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Banks are unlikely to abandon their reliance on cheap government-subsidized borrowing any time soon, analysts say. "Their short term-stuff is guaranteed by the government; they have a subsidy to die for," so it makes little sense for banks to issue their own non-guaranteed bonds, said Don Coxe, chairman of Coxe Advisors LLC in Chicago, who advises clients of the BMO Financial Group. Banks have recently issued some of their own bonds as a public declaration of their determination to ultimately gain independence from the government, especially the strict oversight that comes with its guarantee. But this shift may take years, analysts expect. For now, banks are trying to regain investor trust that was shattered by the fall of Lehman Brothers last year and the entire financial system's brush with death. Yet bond market moves show any recovery of investor confidence in the banking system is fragile. Although U.S. bank bond yields have tightened from their extreme highs over Treasuries in the past two months, they are still historically expensive for borrowers. U.S. banks' stand-alone bond yield spreads over Treasuries have narrowed by some 250 basis points from their record wides in early March. Yet these spreads were still 630 basis points as of Monday, according to Merrill Lynch, compared with less than 100 basis points just before the credit crisis erupted in summer 2007. Even so, some banks calculate that paying a premium here and there is worth it to refurbish their image among investors and depositors. In April, for instance, JPMorgan Chase & Co sold a government-guaranteed note yielding 2.1 percent and a longer-dated note that was not government-backed for 6.3 percent. Banks want to show that markets are open for them "and often will pay a premium in the capital markets to show their debt is warmly received," said Robert Tipp, chief investment strategist with Prudential Investment Management's public fixed income group in Newark, New Jersey. Financial institutions' government-guaranteed debt issuance, which has reached about $300 billion since a temporary program started in November, will rise to about $600 billion by October as forecast by President Barack Obama's fiscal 2010 budget proposal. The FDIC program, like many of the other government conduits to inject taxpayer money into the banking system, is helping bolster banks' earnings. Even though the banking system is still burdened by losses, which the IMF recently forecast will run to $2.7 trillion in the United States alone, investors have started to buy bank bonds in the hopes banks can gradually earn their way out of a hole. For a bank aiming to make money from the difference between borrowing cheaply and lending at much higher rates, issuing government-backed debt is an attractive option banks would be loath to lose. "They will complain like hell when (the government) tries to shut that FDIC program down," said William Larkin, portfolio manager with Cabot Money Management in Boston. While banks can pay about 2 percent to borrow this way via note issues maturing in about three years, they can lend out money at more than 5 percent to homeowners taking out 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. "If banks can borrow with a yield curve this steep, it makes their lending environment ideal," said Larkin. "For a banker that has to be like a drug." (Reporting by John Parry; Editing by Dan Grebler)
