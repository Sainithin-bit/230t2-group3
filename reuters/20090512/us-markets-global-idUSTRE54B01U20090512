 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks faltered and oil edged higher on Tuesday, rising over $60 a barrel for the first time in six months, as growing optimism about the world economy was offset by a sell-off in financial and technology shares. 

 Markets were buffeted by cross currents of investor sentiment. The dollar fell to a four-month low as currency markets focused on positive news out of Europe, reviving some appetite for risk. But gold climbed, reflecting a degree of discomfort over recent rallies in stocks and crude oil. Crude oil reached $60.08 a barrel, its highest level since November, on hopes an economic recovery may prompt rising fuel demand and on buying to hedge against a weaker dollar. "We've passed the worst in the recession," said Matt Esteve, a foreign-exchange trader at Tempus Consulting in Washington. "We're not necessarily moving into growth yet, but at least the pace of deterioration has slowed." U.S. Treasury debt prices held firm, maintaining strong gains from the previous day, as traders settled into a two-week break from this year's heavy schedule of bond auctions. The Dow rebounded from earlier losses to close higher as investors snapped up energy shares like Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) and Chevron ( CVX.N ) and defensive stocks, including healthcare companies, like Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), Pfizer ( PFE.N ) and Merck ( MRK.N ). The two sectors provided the biggest boosts to the Dow. But technology companies' stocks fell, led by a 4 percent decline in Apple ( AAPL.O ), as investors also fretted over an apparent lack of incentives to drive the market higher. "Investors are looking for some type of catalyst and there isn't a visible one out there that they can invest off of right now," said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at Morgan Asset Management in Birmingham, Alabama. "The thawing of the financial markets, the end of the stress tests were clearly visible catalysts that played out well." S&P BRIEFLY DIPS BELOW 900 A pullback in stocks dragged the S&P 500 below the psychologically important support level of 900 for the first time in a week. The benchmark closed above 900 but was still lower for the session. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 50.34 points, or 0.60 percent, at 8,469.11. But the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 0.89 points, or 0.10 percent, at 908.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slid 15.32 points, or 0.88 percent, at 1,715.92. The euro extended gains against the dollar after a member of the European Central Bank Governing Council said there is no need for the ECB to expand its asset purchase program to other sorts of private debt. Weaker financial, mining and materials stocks outweighed positive drugmakers' and energy shares in the United States and Europe, with banking shares among the biggest decliners. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares slipped 0.2 percent to close at 852.62. Although there was a lack of euro-zone data, British retail sales, housing market surveys and industrial output bolstered a bullish view of the global economy, encouraging investors early in Europe to push riskier assets higher. Oil rose. U.S. crude gained 35 cents to settle at $58.85 a barrel. Oil trimmed earlier gains after the U.S. Department of Energy slashed its demand forecast for oil in 2009. London Brent crude rose 46 cents, to $57.94 a barrel. "There are institutional investors getting in, pushing up prices," said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Illinois. "The dollar is a little weak and that's also supportive for crude futures." The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.69 percent at 82.267, after earlier hitting a session low at 81.998, its lowest since early January. Late in the session, the euro rose 0.4 percent to $1.3632. Against the yen, the dollar fell 1.17 percent to 96.39. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 10/32 in price to yield 4.16 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was break-even, yielding 0.89 percent. A GOLD RUSH AS DOLLAR DROPS Gold ended 1 percent higher as a weaker dollar and a wider U.S. trade gap prompted fund buying and bolstered the status of bullion as an alternative investment. U.S. gold futures for June delivery rose $10.40 to settle at $923.90 an ounce in New York. Earlier in Asia, sentiment was hit by data showing Chinese exports in April fell more steeply than expected from a year earlier, casting fresh doubt on the prospects for recovery in the world's third-largest economy. Imports also dropped. Hopes of a recovery in China on the back of government spending had lifted Asian equity markets from lows in early March and added to hopes elsewhere that a global recession had hit bottom. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS recouped some earlier losses, falling 0.7 percent. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  slid 1.6 percent.
