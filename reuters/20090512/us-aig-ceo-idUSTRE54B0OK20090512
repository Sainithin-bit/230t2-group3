 (Reuters) - American International Group Chief Executive Edward Liddy will speak out against criticism of the insurer's employees on Wednesday and talk about the company's future plans, the Wall Street Journal said. 

 Liddy will speak to a U.S. House oversight committee and ask for a better partnership with the government, according to the paper. "Rampant, unwarranted criticism of AIG serves only to diminish the value of our businesses around the world," the paper quoted Liddy's prepared testimony. The government has stepped forward three times as AIG's benefactor, committing some $180 billion in its efforts to rescue the insurer in exchange for an 80 percent stake. The government aid includes some $85 billion in loans that the insurer is trying to repay through divestitures. Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee plan to raise questions about transparency and accountability to Liddy and trustees charged with managing the government's shares in the company, according to the paper. In his prepared testimony, Liddy will say that AIG of the future will be smaller and more efficient, and will describe the steps the company is taking to shrink itself, the paper said.
