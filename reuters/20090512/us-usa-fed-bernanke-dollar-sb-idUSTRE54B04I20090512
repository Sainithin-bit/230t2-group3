 JEKYLL ISLAND, Ga  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Monday said the dollar would retain its dominant role as the world's reserve currency, and strong U.S. economic growth would ensure the currency's exchange rate value. 

 "I think the issue at hand is whether or not the dollar will retain its value, and I think it will," Bernanke told a financial markets conference hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. "I think the dollar will be strong. I think it will be strong because the U.S. economy is strong. And it will also be strong because the Federal Reserve is committed to assuring that we have price stability," he said in response to a question after delivering a speech.
