 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Four top Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) executives, including Chief Executive Vikram Pandit, on Thursday bought 1.3 million of the bank's common shares, a person familiar with the matter said, as the stock's price fell to a 13-year low. 

 Pandit bought 750,000 common shares and 100,000 preferred shares, while institutional clients chief John Havens bought 250,000 shares, the person said. Two other executives bought a total of 300,000 common shares, the person said. The purchases are to be disclosed in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings by Friday, the person said. Citigroup shares fell as low as $8.28 on Thursday on fears a deep economic recession could hurt the banking industry, and that management at the second-largest U.S. bank by assets might not steer it effectively through the global credit crisis. The shares later recovered much of their losses, and closed down 19 cents, or 2 percent, at $9.45. They lagged the three major U.S. stock indexes and the KBW Bank Index .BKX, all of which rose more than 6 percent. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
