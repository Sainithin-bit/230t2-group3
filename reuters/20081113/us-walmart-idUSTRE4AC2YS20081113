 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) reported a slightly better-than-expected 10 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, as shoppers scoured its aisles for discounts on groceries and medicine in the face of deteriorating economic conditions. 

 But the world's largest retailer, which garners roughly 25 percent of its sales internationally, forecast fourth-quarter earnings that could miss Wall Street targets, and lowered its full-year profit view. It cited pressure from the stronger U.S. dollar, which lowers the value of its international sales. "I think investors by and large will look through that to some extent to say, 'This is beyond their control,' and look at their underlying fundamentals," said Jefferies & Co analyst Dan Binder. Wal-Mart's rising profits stand in stark contrast to competitors, whose businesses have been upended by a sharp decline in consumer spending. This week, consumer electronics retailer Circuit City Stores Inc CCTYQ.PK filed for bankruptcy, while Best Buy Co Inc ( BBY.N ) slashed its profit forecast, citing "seismic changes in consumer behavior." Wal-Mart's Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott said the retailer is gaining momentum and he is "optimistic" despite entering what some economists are forecasting will be the worst holiday sales season in nearly 20 years. "It is our time," he said on a recorded call. Wal-Mart reported net income of $3.14 billion, or 80 cents per share, for the third quarter that ended October 31, up from $2.86 billion, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. The company said earnings from continuing operations were 77 cents per share. It had previously forecast 73 cents to 76 cents, and analysts on average had been expecting 76 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Its shares rose $1.31, or 2.5 percent, to $53.93 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. WAL-MART GAINS WITH SHOPPERS Wal-Mart's sales have outpaced competitors this year as cautious consumers adopt a thrifty attitude and try to stretch their dollars by shopping in its stores, especially for necessities like groceries and toiletries. Wal-Mart has also been lowering prices, sprucing up stores and improving its merchandise selection to win shoppers during the downturn and beyond. "Our job is to take care of our customers now ... so that, when things do improve, they will have established a new shopping pattern and will stay with us," Chief Financial Officer Tom Schoewe said in an interview. Quarterly sales in its namesake U.S. stores and its Sam's Club warehouse division rose more than 6 percent to $72.78 billion. International sales rose 11.2 percent to $24.86 billion. Sales at U.S. stores open at least a year rose 3 percent overall, with increases of 2.7 percent at the company's namesake stores and 4.5 percent at the Sam's Club division. Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of its U.S. operations, said consumers were being more cautious with electronics purchases, but it is still seeing "healthy sales growth" in flat-panel TVs and GPS navigation systems. "The bottom line is they're continuing to take market share, they're continuing to operate very well all around the world," said Telsey Advisory Group analyst Joseph Feldman. CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES A HEADWIND Wal-Mart forecast fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.03 to $1.07 from continuing operations -- below analysts' expectations of $1.11 -- on U.S. same-store sales growth of 1 percent to 3 percent. Schoewe said "rapid changes" in currency exchange rates will hurt fourth-quarter results by about 6 cents per share. A weaker dollar boosts profits of U.S. multinational companies, such as Wal-Mart, when their foreign revenues are converted into greenbacks. But that benefit has been waning as the U.S. dollar rebounds. In an interview, Schoewe said his forecast was based on current exchange rates. If the dollar weakens, Wal-Mart could report better quarterly results, he said. But if the dollar were to strengthen, its results could be worse than indicated. But a stronger U.S. dollar could help Wal-Mart by lowering the price of goods it purchases overseas. "It's too early for us to be feeling a significant portion of that benefit now. But clearly, with the stronger dollar, that just makes that international purchase that much cheaper," he added. For the full year, Wal-Mart now expects earnings per share of $3.42 to $3.46 from continuing operations, compared with a previous view of $3.43 to $3.50. Wall Street expected full-year profit of $3.49 per share. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek and  Andre Grenon )
