 PITTSBURGH  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy still faces significant financial stress although the drop in prices of energy and commodities has reduced concerns about inflation expectations, a top Fed official said on Thursday. 

 "While the actions by central banks and governments in a number of countries have helped alleviate some of the financial pressures, it will take some time before financial markets return to some sense of normalcy," Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Plosser said in prepared remarks to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh. As he spoke, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell about 3.5 percent to break below 8,000 points as U.S. stocks slumped on recession fears. But by late afternoon, bargain hunting drove shares back up 7 percent to close at 8865 points. After seeing a slight contraction in real U.S. gross domestic product in the third quarter, Plosser said he anticipates a somewhat sharper decline in the fourth quarter. He added he sees economic growth for 2009, fourth-quarter to fourth-quarter, as likely to be below 2 percent. But, he added, the U.S. economy should start to pick up next year as the housing sector bottoms out and the financial crisis abates. "The decline in energy and commodity prices in recent months has reduced my own concern about rising inflation expectations -- at least in the near term," he added. But this should not be taken to mean the Fed -- the U.S. central bank -- should be complacent about its responsibility to maintain price stability, Plosser said. Plosser, a voting member of the Fed's rate-setting committee this year, is known as one of the bank's staunchest inflation hawks. He has dissented twice this year in favor of tighter policy. He said he was now less concerned about inflationary expectations and has become more comfortable with current rate levels, saying it was good news that oil prices started to fall before consumer expectations of higher prices became "unfettered". But even with inflation less of a concern, there are technical difficulties associated with taking the federal funds rate toward zero. "You have to think about what this means for policy, market functioning, how we manage reserves," he said. He also warned that it was important to shrink the Fed's balance sheet as soon as financial markets calmed down. "We have injected huge amounts of liquidity into the system. When the financial crisis ends and demand for reserves begins to go down we will have to drain those reserves, we have to take back that liquidity or we run the risk of inflation," Plosser said. "And it may not be easy." When some semblance of normality returns to the market, Plosser said he expects some type of regulatory reform will be warranted. But, he warned, "hasty reform may fail to address the problem and could impose unneeded and burdensome regulation." "Such 'quick fixes' may inadvertently hamper market competition or innovation and create conditions that may provide the foundation of the next crisis," he said. Plosser also countered those calling for permanent expansion of access to the Fed's lending facilities to a wide range of financial institutions. "I believe such expanded access to central bank credit would raise significant issues of moral hazard that would need to be addressed." He said it was unrealistic to say that expanding the Fed's regulatory and supervisory authority could prevent crises. Investors are looking to a summit of world leaders in Washington on Saturday for solutions to the current global financial crisis following moves worldwide to cut interest rates, free up seized money markets and recapitalize banks at a cost of more than $4 trillion. U.S. data on Thursday added to evidence that the world's largest economy is hemorrhaging jobs after the housing boom went bust and left a path of destruction that led to the financial markets and the broader economy. The economic backdrop will most likely necessitate more monetary policy easing, a Reuters poll showed on Monday. But, with the Fed's benchmark interest rate already at an extremely low 1 percent, it also means the government will likely have to enact hundreds of billions more dollars in fiscal stimulus to limit the economic pain.
