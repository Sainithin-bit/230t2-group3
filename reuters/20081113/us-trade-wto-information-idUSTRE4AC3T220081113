 GENEVA  (Reuters) - China has resolved its trade dispute over financial information with the United States, European Union and Canada, China's mission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) said on Thursday. 

 "The dispute has been concluded with a mutually acceptable solution among the parties," a statement from the mission said. It gave no further details. Brussels and Washington launched the dispute in March because they objected to the way Beijing regulated foreign providers of financial information, including Thomson Reuters Corp, Bloomberg and Dow Jones, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. Canada joined the dispute following the acquisition in April of Reuters Group by Thomson Corp.
