 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sumner Redstone managed to halt, at least temporarily, major drops in shares of CBS Corp ( CBS.N ) and Viacom Inc VIAb.N by repeating on Thursday his promise not to sell any more stock in either media company. 

 Redstone, the well-known media mogul, also described talks with bankers over a looming debt crunch at his privately-held National Amusements as "proceeding in a smooth and constructive manner." Redstone's attempt to reassure investors comes after CBS shares dropped about 15 percent and Viacom shares dropped about 10 percent on Wednesday. Shares of both media companies were up about 3 percent on Thursday after Redstone issued the statement. Viacom and CBS, both controlled by Redstone, have taken hits from all sides in recent weeks: Investors are concerned about profits in light of the advertising downturn, and they are equally concerned that Redstone's recent stock sales will not be his last. At issue is a covenant that requires National Amusements to maintain a certain debt-to-asset ratio, which it failed to do after shares of Viacom and CBS plunged on fears of an advertising slump. Last month, Redstone's National Amusements sold a total of about $230 million in shares of both companies to help meet debt obligations. Since then, Redstone's representatives have been in discussions with lenders about the debt situation at National Amusements, which also owns a 1,500-screen theater chain and controlling voting stakes in CBS, Viacom and Midway Games MWY.N. "I am pleased that talks with National Amusements banks and noteholders are proceeding in a smooth and constructive manner," Redstone said in a statement. "It is important to understand that the value of NAI's assets well exceeds its debt and NAI has no intention of selling any stock of either Viacom or CBS." Redstone has previously promised -- on at least three occasions -- not to sell any more stock. Shares of CBS rose 16 cents to $6.23 a share while Viacom rose 44 cents to $15.58 on the New York Stock Exchange after the statement. At the moment, National Amusements has about $1.6 billion in debt outstanding. Half of that, $800 million, will need to be repaid by year's end. The question for investors is how Redstone will find a way out of the debt crunch, and his choices have become the subject of widespread speculation. Pali Research analyst Rich Greenfield weighed in earlier this week with a research report that suggested the best strategy for Redstone would be an outright sale of Viacom. But Greenfield acknowledged that Redstone was unlikely to do so given his attachment to the company, and instead would probably look to sell Midway Games and the movie theater chain. "While Mr. Redstone has stated multiple times that he has 'no intention' of selling more CBS and/or Viacom shares and that NAI is having constructive talks with its lenders, we believe he may no longer have a choice," Greenfield said in the report, issued on Wednesday. "Assuming the theater chain can be sold, and CBS cuts its dividend, NAI would have no way of servicing its debt beyond selling CBS and/or Viacom shares," he said.
