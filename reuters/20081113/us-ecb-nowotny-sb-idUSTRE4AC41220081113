 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The euro zone economy is already in recession and European Central Bank staff may well forecast a contraction in 2009 as well, ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Thursday. 

 Asked about the wave of bad economic news since July, Nowotny told reporters: "This means for the euro zone as a whole that we are in recession. The economy has developed much worse than expected." He hoped government stimulus packages would help to restart growth next year, but said ECB staff projections could point to ongoing recession in 2009 when they are published at the start of December. "I fear that we will have at least a stagnation, if not a contraction," he said. The ECB has already cut interest rates by a full percentage point to 3.25 percent over the past six weeks, and President Jean-Claude Trichet said last week that a further cut could follow in December as inflation continues to subside. Nowotny, who heads the Austrian central bank, repeated this view and urged governments to ramp up spending or cut taxes to soften the impact of the downturn. "Inflation expectations are receding. That gives the ECB room for additional expansionary measures ... (but) monetary policy is not enough. Additional input from fiscal policy is needed," he said. "For 2009, we have some hope that there will be an upturn in the second half because of supportive government measures." GERMAN CONTRACTION Official third-quarter GDP figures due on Friday are expected to confirm the 15-country euro zone is in the first recession in the ECB's 10-year history. German GDP data on Thursday set the tone, coming in far worse than expected. The economy contracted 0.5 percent in the third quarter, making this Germany's fastest two-quarter contraction in 12 years. Yet Nowotny accused Germany of standing in the way of co-ordinated EU fiscal action to galvanize the European economy, although Berlin has already pledged to a national fiscal program it says will provide a 50 billion euro boost. "I am astonished by the hesitant sounds from German politicians. This has to change. In my view it is absolutely necessary to coordinate action," he said. Trichet has also been cautious about EU fiscal stimulus plans, saying some countries which ran big budget deficits during past years of growth could not afford to spend more in a downturn. An ECB survey released on Thursday showed external forecasters have also sharply revised down their expectations of euro zone growth. Forecasters see growth of just 0.3 percent in 2009, down from 1.3 percent earlier. The cut is the biggest downward revision of forecasts for GDP one year ahead since the survey began in 1999. Nowotny also called on the EU to double the size of its bail-out fund for eastern European member states to 50 billion euros ($62.4 billion), so that the countries did not have to turn to the International Monetary Fund for aid in a crisis. "For EU countries, the priority should be not to rely on the IMF," he said. Hungary has drawn on the first part of a joint $25.1 billion IMF, EU and World Bank loan agreed last month after it struggled to defend its currency and finance a large government debt. "Countries outside the euro zone are easy victims of speculation," Nowotny said of Hungary. (Writing by  Marc Jones  and  David Milliken ; Editing by  David Stamp )
