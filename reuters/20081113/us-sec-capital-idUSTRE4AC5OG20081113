 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission is trying not to stand in the way of companies that need to complete deals to survive the financial crisis, a top regulator said on Thursday. 

 "Our primary focus has been in facilitating capital raising and strategic transactions," John White, director of the SEC's division of corporation finance, said at a Practising Law Institute conference in New York. "We do not want to be in the way of what companies need to do," he added. He said his unit was looking at how it could be more responsive to issues companies are having with SEC restrictions that could stand in the way of or slow down deals. White said the SEC had reprioritized in this way over the summer as Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK looked for capital and suitors to rescue the firm. "We had a Lehman summer," White said. "We spent basically the whole summer jumping through hoops trying to help them." Lehman ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection on September 15 in the largest U.S. bankruptcy filing in history. White, who joined the SEC in March 2006, has said that he would leave the agency at the end of the year and return to the private sector. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
