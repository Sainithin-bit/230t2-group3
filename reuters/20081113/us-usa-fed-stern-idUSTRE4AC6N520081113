 WINONA, Minnesota  (Reuters) - Policy-makers need to tackle asset bubbles before they burst to avoid the expense of cleaning up the mess if they are not proactive, a top Fed policy-maker said on Thursday. 

 Gary Stern, president of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, said addressing price bubbles -- such as the housing boom this decade -- as they form would typically involve raising interest rates faster and further than would otherwise be the case. That would require political support because of the trade-off between lower short-term economic growth and greater longer-term stability, Stern said in remarks at Winona State University. "It is by no means easy to identify asset bubbles in a timely way," he said. "It is hard, but not impossible." Stern said the current U.S. economic downturn has echoes of the early 1990s "financial headwinds" period but that the current shock is "a good deal more severe." As was the case in the 1990s, weak growth could linger for one to three years, Stern said. Stern said he was skeptical the Fed could have foreseen the current credit crisis as it has played out, especially the carnage that the housing market collapse would create. "I certainly make no claim for having foreseen how the decline in housing prices would spill over so aggressively to the financial sector and real economy," he said. Stern, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2008, did not address the economic outlook or prospects for the Fed's next monetary policy meeting in December. Financial markets lean toward the Fed cutting its benchmark lending rate to 0.75 percent or even 0.5 percent in December from the current 1 percent. The rate has been slashed from 5.25 percent since September 2007. Instead, Stern focused on what he termed the urgent need for reforms once the worst of the storm has passed. "The Federal Reserve has responded to unprecedented times with equally unprecedented actions ... Such actions were appropriate given the challenges we faced," he said. Stern said it is "critical" that the steps taken by the Fed succeed in restoring stability. "We have seen some important progress in recent weeks in funding markets," he said. "That said, significant strains continue in some markets and among financial institutions." Stern addressed the issue of "too big to fail," or the implicit promise that if large banks and financial institutions get into trouble, the government will bail them out. "Left unchecked, the too-big-to-fail embers remaining from our emergency response will likely contribute to future financial conflagrations," Stern said. The issue "rests at the very top of the ills elected officials, policy-makers and bank supervisors must address," he said. Stern reiterated the details of a plan he first floated in August, focused on early identification of problems, more aggressive and faster corrective action and communication with market participants. "If we had grasped the net of connections of large financial firms in, say, 2006 instead of 2008, we might have taken steps to figure out how we might contain the ability of this network to spread risk," he said.
