 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) Audi ( NSUG.DE ) premium unit aims to raise sales in the United States to 200,000 vehicles by 2015 from last year's 90,000, Audi's sales and marketing boss told a German newspaper. 

 Audi also wants to double the volume in China to 200,000 vehicles a year over the long-term, Ralph Weyler added in statements published in the Friday edition of the Tagesspiegel. By 2015, the brand plans to sell 1.5 million vehicles, up from last year's 905,188 units. The Audi sales chief said he expected Audi could sell some 50,000 units of its brand new A5 mid-size coupe, which hit German showrooms on Friday in the model's first full year. His boss, Audi Chief Executive Rupert Stadler, had only spoken of selling 30,000 units of the A5 coupe per year in an interview with a German motor magazine early in April. Next year, Weyler said the brand would roll out its Q5 mid-size sport utility vehicle and a cabrio version of its A3 compact.
