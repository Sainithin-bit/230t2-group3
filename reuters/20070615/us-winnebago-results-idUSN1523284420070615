 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Winnebago Industries Inc. ( WGO.N ) on Friday posted a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit after buyers turned to motor homes that cost more to make and had lower profit margins when sold. 

 The news sent shares down 5.3 percent. Net income in the third quarter fell almost 15 percent, to $11.3 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with $13.2 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. That was far below the 49 cents on average that analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected. Revenue at the maker of motor homes rose 5.2 percent, to $231.7 million, below analysts' expectations for $248.2 million. Winnebago, based in Forest City, Iowa, said the revenue increase was due to higher sales of Class A motor homes. However, gross profit for the third quarter was hurt by an increase in sales of lower-margin motor homes in both Class A and Class C categories, as well as escalating materials and labor costs. Net income was also hurt by increased selling expenses due to the company's "Dealer Days" event being held during the third quarter instead of the fourth and higher bonuses expenses from hitting some compensation objectives. Shares of Winnebago fell to $28.99 in early electronic trading from their Thursday closing price of $30.60 on the New York Stock Exchange.
