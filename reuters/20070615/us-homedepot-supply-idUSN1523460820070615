 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Offers for Home Depot Inc.'s ( HD.N ) supply division are due on Friday, according to a source involved with the deal, with two groups of private equity firms expected to be among the remaining bidders. 

 HD Supply, which analysts say could fetch about $10 billion, was put up for sale earlier this year. Lehman Brothers LEH.N was hired to auction the business, which sells building materials, waste water and utility products to municipalities and contractors, Several groups of private equity firms showed initial interest, but have since backed away as the slowdown in the U.S. housing market has hurt HD Supply, according to sources close to the deal. The company launched the supply business in 1997 and expanded it by acquiring companies like water and sewer products supplier National Waterworks Holdings in 2005 and Hughes Supply in 2006. Home Depot paid $3.2 billion for Hughes Supply. By selling HD Supply and focusing on the retail stores, Home Depot is repudiating the policy of former CEO Robert Nardelli to expand the unit. The estimated bids of about $10 billion is somewhat lower than the price initially expected, said Carol Leveson, director of research at Gimme Credit, an independent research firm. "Given the tough outlook for the construction/remodeling markets (Home Depot) should be happy to get an offer we estimate at 10-times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and close to book value," Levenson said. Home Depot had paid more than 11 times EBITDA for Hughes Supply, Levenson said. A group consisting of Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and CCMP Capital was among the remaining parties interested in the company, but as of Friday morning it remained unclear whether they would bid, the source involved with the deal said. A team of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Bain Capital and Carlyle Group also planned to submit an offer, but had not yet done so by Friday morning, another source said. The private equity firms that have been eyeing HD Supply have a history with those assets. THLee and CCMP had sold National Waterworks to Home Depot and that business is now part of HD Supply. Meanwhile, Clayton, Dubilier & Rice had previously bid on Hughes Supply but lost out to Home Depot. Buying HD Supply would allow the private equity firm to reclaim Hughes, as well as other distribution assets. Carlyle and TH Lee declined to comment. Home Depot and the other firms could not be reached immediately for comment. Shares of Home Depot added 54 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $38.33 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
