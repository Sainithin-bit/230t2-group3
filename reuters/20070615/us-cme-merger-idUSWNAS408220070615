 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME.N said on Friday it is not currently in any discussions with the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) regarding a merger or acquisition. 

 CME said it remains focused on completing its merger with CBOT Holdings BOT.N and looks forward to its shareholder vote on July 9. Earlier on Friday, a news agency reported that NYMEX is exploring a sale for about $14.3 billion. The report on the Web site of news agency Bloomberg said NYMEX NMX.N executives have met counterparts at three potential suitors -- NYSE Euronext NYX.N NYX.PA, Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ) and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
