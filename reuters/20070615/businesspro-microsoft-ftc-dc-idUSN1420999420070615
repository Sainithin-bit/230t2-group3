 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is 
investigating Microsoft Corp's ( MSFT.O ) planned acquisition of 
aQuantive Inc AQNT.O as well as Yahoo Inc.'s ( YHOO.O ) 
proposed deal to take full control of Right Media Inc., The 
Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. 

  The newspaper, in its online edition, cited lawyers close 
to the deals as saying that the FTC is conducting antitrust 
reviews. The FTC already is looking into another online 
advertising merger, Google Inc.'s ( GOOG.O ) $3.1 billion bid for 
DoubleClick Inc.  So far, the FTC has not made "second requests" for extra 
information from either Microsoft or Yahoo, the newspaper 
reported. Those requests would suggest a closer level of 
scrutiny.  A Microsoft spokesman told the Journal that the company is 
"cooperating fully" and it looks "forward to addressing any 
questions the FTC may have."  A Yahoo spokesman told the paper that the Right Media 
purchase required regulatory clearance, but that he could not 
comment beyond that.
