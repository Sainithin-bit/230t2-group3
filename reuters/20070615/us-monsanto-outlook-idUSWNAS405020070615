 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Monsanto Co. ( MON.N ) said on Friday it is increasing its earnings outlook for fiscal 2007, due to strong results from the corn planting season in the U.S. and from the company's herbicide business. 

 The company expects fiscal 2007 ongoing earnings of $1.75 to $1.80 per share, versus a prior outlook of $1.60 to $1.65 per share. Monsanto also said that third-quarter results were expected to be about $1.00 per share on an ongoing and reported basis.
