 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A moderate rise in a key U.S. inflation gauge during May and steady manufacturing sector gains helped fire investor optimism on Friday, even though consumers' spirits were dampened by higher gasoline prices. 

 A steady rise in food and energy costs pushed overall U.S. consumer prices up 0.7 percent in May, the sharpest rise in 1-1/2 years, a government report showed on Friday. But the core measure of the Labor Department's Consumer Price Index, which removes food and energy, rose just 0.1 percent, below Wall Street's median forecast of 0.2 percent. With volatile food and energy costs out of the picture, the muted price gains reassured financial markets that inflation remains under control. That fueled a price rally in stocks and bonds as investors bet the Federal Reserve will feel no urgency about raising interest rates to keep price rises in check. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 85.76 points to close at 13,639.48 while the high tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 27.30 points to 2,626.71. Government debt securities also climbed in price as inflation fears faded, the bellwether 10-year U.S. Treasury note increasing 17/32s of a point while its yield fell to 5.15 percent from 5.23 percent on Thursday. Prices for 30-year bonds jumped 27/32s and their yield dropped to 5.26 percent from 5.31 percent. Debt securities' yields move in the opposite direction from their prices. A year-on-year rise in core CPI of 2.2 percent was the lowest since 2.1 percent in March 2006. "Excluding food and energy, inflation has clearly flattened out," said economist Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc. in Holland, Pennsylvania. RELIEF ON RATES "It's good news for the Fed. I still think they (will) worry a bit about inflationary pressures if growth were to pick up, but there is probably a bit more concern about the housing market given the rise in long-term (interest) rates over the last few weeks," said Scott Brown, chief economists at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Federal Reserve has held benchmark U.S. interest rates steady at 5.25 percent for nearly a year, though a sell-off in the U.S. bond market over the past week has pushed yields to five-year highs and renewed concerns about inflation. Bond prices and yields move inversely. The Fed reported that May industrial output was flat and that businesses were running at 81.3 percent of capacity last month, partly because utility companies cut output and auto producers turned out fewer new vehicles. Foreign interest in investing in U.S. securities remained high, according to a Treasury Department report showing a net $111.8 billion were purchased in April, up from $30.1 billion in March. Net long-term capital inflows rose to $84.1 billion in April from $51.2 billion in March. The United States needs to attract about $2 billion a day of foreign capital to cover its large budget and trade deficits. GAS PRICES PINCH One sour note came in a Reuters/University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey showing reduced optimism in June that potentially reflects growing strain on household budgets from costlier food and energy. The consumer sentiment index slipped to 83.7 in June from 88.3 in May and was far below forecasts for a reading of 88. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S. current account deficit widened in the first quarter of 2007 to $192.6 billion from a downwardly revised estimate of $187.9 billion for the final three months of 2006. Analysts surveyed before Friday's report called for a bigger first-quarter shortfall of $201 billion. The current account is the broadest measure of U.S. trade with the rest of the world. It includes trade in goods, service and capital and financial flows such as foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds to help finance the U.S. trade deficit. Elsewhere, the New York Federal Reserve Bank said New York state factory activity in June rose to its highest in a year after languishing for the prior three months. The Empire State general business conditions index jumped to 25.75 in June from 8.03 in May. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 10.8 reading for June.
