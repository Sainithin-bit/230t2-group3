 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group BG.UL said it will offer modest retirement benefits to senior executives, but its top brass will continue to be entitled to some investment perks after leaving the firm. 

 Blackstone disclosed details of retirement agreements with founding members Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman and Senior Chairman Peter Peterson in a regulatory filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. Under the agreement each executive gets to keep an office, a car and a driver for three years after they retire. They will also receive health insurance benefits after they retire as long as each pays for the premium. The details cast a clearer picture of Blackstone's policy, not to offer " golden parachutes" to employees. "We have no severance agreements with any of our professionals," Blackstone said in the Monday filing. The policy is in stark contrast to most public companies, which often continue to pay senior executives a salary for a period of time, on top of offering pension benefits, health and life insurance. "Unlike in the case of many public companies, the departure of an executive officer or other senior managing director would not trigger any contractual obligation on our part to make any special payments," Blackstone said. But Schwarzman and Peterson, who is due to retire in 2008, will continue to be entitled to invest in funds of hedge funds sponsored by Blackstone Alternative Asset Management before and during retirement without paying the fees that would normally be incurred. Schwarzman stands to earn at least $449.2 million after the investment firm's initial public offering, slated to take place in the next two weeks. Peterson, who is cashing out all but 4 percent of his stake in the company he co-founded, will be paid $1.88 billion when the firm goes public.
