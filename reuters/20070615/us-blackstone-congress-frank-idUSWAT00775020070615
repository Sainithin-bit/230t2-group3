 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on Friday asked the Securities and Exchange Commission for its views on the Blackstone Group LP BG.UL initial stock offering. 

 Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank, in a letter made available to Reuters, asked SEC Chairman Christopher Cox for the investor protection agency's perspective on "concerns about the nature, structure, and effects of the proposed IPO" that had already been raised by the AFL-CIO. The labor federation has asked the SEC to force changes to the $4 billion IPO, specifically by requiring Blackstone to register with the SEC as an investment company and follow the same regulations governing mutual funds.
