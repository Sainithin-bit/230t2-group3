 (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy Corp is in advanced talks to sell almost all of its pipeline assets for more than $4 billion to Global Infrastructure Partners, Bloomberg reported, citing sources with knowledge of the matter. 
 The second-largest U.S. natural gas producer is discussing selling all of its interests in Chesapeake Midstream Partners LP as well as other pipeline assets, Bloomberg reported. The talks could result in a deal within days although there was a risk negotiations could also fall apart, the report quoted the sources as saying. Chesapeake could not be reached for comment outside of U.S. business hours. A spokesman for Global Infrastructure Partners declined to comment on the report.
