 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Spanish Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on Wednesday there were no immediate plans to request a bailout of Spain's banks, with the results of an audit of the banking sector needed before any further steps are taken. 
 "I have absolutely not discussed any intervention in Spain's banks today," De Guindos told reporters on the sidelines of meetings in Brussels, where he plans to meet EU Competition Commission Joaquin Almunia later in the day. He said Spain was waiting for the results of an IMF report into the banking sector, due on June 11, and then further reports from independent auditors. "After that, in no more than 10, 15 days we will have the report from the independent auditors... which we are certain will be very similar to that of the International Monetary Fund," he said. "From there the Spanish government will take the decisions it has to take in terms of recapitalizing the institutions." Asked if Spain was preparing a request for EU aid, he said: "We are not preparing anything... we have a roadmap." (Reporting by  Robin Emmott , editing by Luke Baker)
