 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG's U.S. unit recalled more than 71,000 Jetta sedans due to a defect in the wiring system controlling the car horn that can cause the car to stall, a company spokeswoman said on Monday. 

 The wiring layout that controls the horn also controls the converter box, which governs the engine management system, lighting system and wipers. In "very rare" circumstances, an electrical short in the horn could cause a short in the converter box and could make the vehicle stall, VW spokeswoman Sheriece Matias said. VW said in a statement that 71,043 Jettas for the model year 2011 are affected by the recall. VW said there have been no reported injuries and accidents related to this defect. The Jettas were built between March 2010 and March 2011. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
