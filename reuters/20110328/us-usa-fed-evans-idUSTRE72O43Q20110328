 COLUMBIA, South Carolina  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank should complete its planned $600 billion in bond purchases, but probably does not need to do buy additional bonds to support the economy, a top Fed official said on Monday. 

 "The question is, would we need to add more, or would the economy be at a point where can grow on its own with that accommodation?" Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said. "Even when we stop making purchases there will still be a lot of accommodation in place," he said. If core inflation rises closer to 1.5 percent, "maybe that will be the time when I'll be more concerned about it," he said. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
