 BRATISLAVA  (Reuters) - Slovakia's A+ rating could be endangered if the current political situation worsens the consolidation of public finances and delays ongoing reforms, a Standard and Poor's (S&P) analyst was quoted as saying in daily Sme on Friday. 
 The outgoing government of Prime Minister Iveta Radicova collapsed on Tuesday after it lost a vote on boosting the euro rescue fund EFSF that was tied with a confidence vote in the government. The fall of the center-right government, which will rule until an early election in March, has put planned reforms at risk, analysts say. "In case the current political situation leads toward a lower commitment for consolidation of public finances and a considerable delay of reforms, we will consider whether the current rating reflects reality," Sme quoted S&P analyst Ana Mates as saying. The four-party Slovak coalition took power in July last year and pledged to cut the overall fiscal gap to below the European Union's official limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013. In August, S&P raised the country's outlook to positive, saying an upgrade could follow if it keeps the promised public deficit cuts, stabilizes debt levels and continue with other planned reforms.
