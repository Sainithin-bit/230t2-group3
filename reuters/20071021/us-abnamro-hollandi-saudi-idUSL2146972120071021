 RIYADH  (Reuters) - Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS has received offers for its 40 percent stake in Saudi Hollandi Bank 1040.SE, the Saudi lender's chairman, Sulaiman al-Suhaimi, said in remarks published on Sunday. 

 ABN has informed Hollandi that it had received offers to buy the stake and the offers have passed on to Saudi authorities, Asharq al-Awasat quoted Suhaimi as saying. ABN's shares could also be sold to the public via the stock market, he said, according to the paper. It did not name the bidders. Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), which agreed this month to buy ABN, is considering whether to sell the stake in Saudi Hollandi Bank 1040.SE, the Middle East Economic Digest weekly reported in its latest issue.
