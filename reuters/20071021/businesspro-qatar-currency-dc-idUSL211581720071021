 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Qatar is satisfied with the value of its 
riyal currency and sees no need to change its peg to the 
sliding U.S. dollar, the finance minister said in remarks 
published in the Gulf Times newspaper on Sunday. 

  "Why should I change the peg when 100 percent of my exports 
and products are in the U.S. dollar?" the paper quoted Youssef 
Hussein Kamal as saying in Washington.  "My products look cheaper compared with the 
non-dollar-pegged products. Otherwise, I cannot sell them," he 
said.  The riyal is at its "real value," the paper quoted him as 
saying, without being more specific.  Central Bank Governor Sheikh Abdullah bin Saud al-Thani 
said Qatar, holder of the world's third-biggest natural gas 
reserves, had no plans to revalue the riyal, according to the 
paper.  Qatar, Saudi Arabia and four other Gulf Arab states agreed 
in 2003 to peg their currencies to the dollar as a step towards 
creating a single currency by 2010.  Kuwait, which broke ranks with its neighbors and dropped 
its dollar peg in May, allowed its dinar to rise to its highest 
level in more than 19 years on Sunday after the greenback slid 
to record lows against a basket of currencies.  Kuwait has said the dollar's decline on global markets was 
driving up inflation and making some imports more expensive. 
Its inflation rate accelerated to a near 12-year high of almost 
5 percent in July.  Qatar, contending with inflation rates almost three times 
as high as Kuwait's, has consistently ruled out revaluing its 
currency.  Inflation would decline to 10 percent within a year thanks 
to measure to control rising rents and prices, Sheikh Abdullah 
told Reuters last month.
