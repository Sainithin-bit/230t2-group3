 LONDON  (Reuters) - British brewer Scottish and Newcastle (S&N) SCTN.L considers selling its Finnish holding company to block a potential joint bid from Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ) and Heineken ( HEIN.AS ), a Sunday paper said. 

 Denmark's Carlsberg and Amsterdam-based Heineken announced their joint approach for the Edinburgh-based brewer last week, with Carlsberg intending to buy S&N's interest in Russia-based brewer Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH), France and Greece. The Sunday Times said in an unsourced report that S&N is considering selling off its Finnish holding company Hartwall, which holds the group's 50 percent interest in BBH joint venture with Carlsberg. BBH is seen as the jewel in S&N's crown as it controls over 85 percent of Baltika PKBA.MM the biggest brewer in the world's third largest beer market, Russia, and provides around one third of S&N and Carlsberg's group earnings. Meanwhile, The Sunday Telegraph said in an unsourced report that S&N is considering all its defense options and looking to bring in a strategic partner, with SABMiller ( SAB.L ) and Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ) believed to have made contact with S&N to fend off the bid approach. S&N was not immediately available for comment.
