 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The global rout in equity markets may help Roche Holding AG snap up more acquisitions as its potential targets are becoming cheaper, the Swiss drugmaker's chief executive told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 "I don't want to deny that when the valuations of companies that we are interested in go down, we have a better chance of accomplishing a deal," Chief Executive Officer Severin Schwan told Reuters. Roche, whose initial $43.7 billion offer to take over the remainder of U.S. biotech group Genentech Inc has been rebuffed, has said it is looking for smaller or medium-sized pharmaceutical or diagnostics companies to strengthen its main business. The question of pricing would, however, always take a back seat to strategic considerations, Schwan said in an interview in Frankfurt. "More than anything, a deal has to make sense," he said. "I don't want to create the impression that the world will turn upside down (because of the financial crisis)." Scwhwan reiterated that Roche was well positioned to finance the Genentech deal, but declined to give more details on how the funding would be arranged and how far the negotiating process had progressed. "Given our intention to complete the deal, it is safe to assume that all the preconditions are met," the CEO said. (Editing by  Sam Cage  and Rupert Winchester)
