 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German authorities searched the offices of state development bank KfW KFW.UL on Wednesday as part of a breach of trust investigation triggered by KfW's transfer of funds to Lehman Brothers after the stricken U.S. bank had filed for insolvency, Frankfurt prosecutors said. 

 "The aim of the investigation is to determine whether the responsible parties at KfW violated their legal obligations to safeguard assets by failing to block the transfer of funds on September 15, 2008 despite knowledge of signs of liquidity problems at Lehman Brothers and against the background of an emerging international banking crisis," a statement said. It said KfW had pledged to cooperate with the probe into the transfer of 319 million euros ($420.7 million). (Reporting by  Michael Shields ) ($1=.7582 Euro)
