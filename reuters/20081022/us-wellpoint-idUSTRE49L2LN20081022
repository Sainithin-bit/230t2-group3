 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) posted a 5.4 percent drop in third-quarter profit, citing major investment losses, but its results exceeded analysts' estimates as membership rose. 

 The largest U.S. health insurer by membership also cut the top end of its 2008 profit forecast on Wednesday. Net income fell to $820.7 million, or $1.60 per share, from $868 million, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier, when the company had more shares outstanding. Excluding items, earnings of $1.58 per share topped the $1.50 expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. WellPoint reported net realized investment losses of $562.6 million before taxes, or 71 cents per share. Impairments included $229.5 million for investments in Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N and $88.5 million for investments in Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK. Health insurer stocks have been under pressure during the credit crisis as investors worry about potential sizable write-downs and the strength of the companies' balance sheets. WellPoint also reported a gain of $460.8 million, or 90 cents per share, from resolving federal and state tax matters. Revenue rose 2 percent to $15.3 billion. Enrollment exceeded 35.3 million members at September 30, up 1.5 percent from a year earlier. The Indianapolis-based company forecast full-year profit of $5.43 to $5.49 per share. It previously expected $5.42 to $5.57. WellPoint shares have fallen some 52 percent so far this year, roughly the same as the S&P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO. Late on Tuesday, rival Coventry Health Care Inc CVH.N said its third-quarter profit slumped by about half, well below analysts' estimates. It sharply cut its full-year profit forecast as it struggles with medical costs in its Medicare plans for seniors and commercial plans for employers.
