 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp ( KMB.N ) posted a lower quarterly profit and cut its full year forecast on Wednesday, hurt by higher material costs and a shift by U.S. consumers to buy cheaper private-label versions of paper towels, and its shares fell as much as 8 percent. 

 While the company is finally seeing some relief in commodity prices, it faces new pressures from exchange rates and growing fears of a global recession. "I am encouraged that commodity costs have recently started to decline," Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Falk said in a statement. "However, it could take up to six months before the lower costs are fully realized in our results." Kimberly-Clark estimated that recent changes in currency exchange rates, including currency translation at Kimberly-Clark de Mexico ( KIMBERA.MX ), Mexico's top paper products company, will cut more than 10 cents per share from fourth-quarter profit. Besides the Mexican peso, Kimberly-Clark said it is feeling pressure from currencies including the Australian dollar and the South Korean won. Kimberly-Clark's third-quarter profit fell to $413.1 million, or 99 cents per share, from $453.1 million, or $1.04 a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were $1.02 a share, 1 cent ahead of an average Wall Street forecast of $1.01 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8.2 percent to $5 billion, driven by price increases across all four of its units. Volume fell less than 1 percent. In July, the company launched its second round of price increases this year across most of its consumer brands to offset higher costs for oil and other raw materials. Kimberly-Clark has also been shutting facilities and cutting staff to save money under a 2005 plan set to end this year. HIGHER MATERIAL COSTS Kimberly-Clark said costs for materials, energy and distribution were about $250 million higher than a year ago. The company expects to earn $4.15 to $4.20 per share this year, excluding certain items, versus a previous forecast of $4.20 to $4.30. Analysts had expected $4.23 per share. Kimberly-Clark forecast fourth quarter adjusted earnings of $1.02 to $1.07 per share. Analysts had expected $1.11. Kimberly-Clark expects fourth quarter sales to rise due to price increases and some higher-end products, while volume growth "will likely be relatively weak," Falk said. The company spent $25 million more on marketing in the third quarter than a year earlier as it tries to keep consumers from switching to lower-priced products. It plans to spend more on marketing and working on its relationships with retailers. In North America, consumer tissue product sales fell 2 percent and volume fell 9 percent as the company raised prices on items like Cottonelle toilet paper and consumers switched to store brand paper towels from its Viva and Scott brands. Shares of Kimberly-Clark were down $3.83, or 8 percent, at $56.86 after falling to $56.25 in morning trade. Through Tuesday, Kimberly-Clark shares had fallen nearly 11.1 percent so far this year, while shares of larger rival Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) dropped 14.2 percent. P&G is set to report quarterly results on October 29. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl; editing by John Wallace and  Derek Caney )
