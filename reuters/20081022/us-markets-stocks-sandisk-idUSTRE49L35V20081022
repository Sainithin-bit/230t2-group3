 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of SanDisk Corp ( SNDK.O ) plunged by more than 25 percent to $11.01 before the bell on Wednesday after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ), the world's top memory chip maker, withdrew a $5.9 billion unsolicited bid for the flash memory card maker. 

 Samsung cited the U.S. company's deepening losses and uncertain outlook. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
