 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A double dose of bad news from two big U.S. drugmakers on Wednesday underscored the risks in the pharmaceutical business model, prompting a sharp share sell-off and a call from Merck's CEO for drastic change. 

 Merck & Co said it will slash 12 percent of its work force and tempered its long-range earnings outlook, and Wyeth announced a delay in its closely watched experimental Alzheimer's disease drug. The deepening economic downturn and a reversal in favorable foreign currency exchange rates is worsening the impact of patent expirations of lucrative medicines. Also, a shortage of new drugs on the immediate horizon and a tougher regulatory climate are pressuring an industry that has already been going through serious belt tightening. "If we don't change the business models we're not going to survive as an industry," Merck ( MRK.N ) CEO Richard Clark said on a conference call with analysts and investors. "Our current sales trends for key products, compounded by known industry and emerging economic factors, have led us to reassess the environment in which we expect to be operating between now and 2010," Clark said in a statement. Wyeth WYE.N reported flat third-quarter profit in line with Wall Street expectations as it was hit by generic competition for its Protonix acid reflux drug. Wyeth raised only the low end of its full-year forecast by 2 cents, but its failure to raise the forecast overall and the setback for its bapineuzumab Alzheimer's drug spooked investors, and its shares were down 11 percent. GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ), the world's second-largest drugmaker, provided a glimmer of stability, reporting that its profit before restructuring charges rose 6 percent, topping analysts' forecasts, as sales rose 7 percent for the quarter. But the British company stuck to its cautious full-year forecast for a mid-single-digit decline in earnings per share in local currencies. Financial outlooks in general are becoming less certain in the current economic turmoil. Merck and Wyeth took charges of $88 million and $69 million, respectively, related to failed financial companies, including Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK, AIG ( AIG.N ) and Washington Mutual. But Roche Holding AG's CEO ( ROG.VX ) saw a silver lining in the economic gloom, saying in an interview that the rout in global equities may help the Swiss drug maker snap up more acquisitions as potential targets become cheaper. CUTS, CUTS, CUTS Merck's third-quarter net profit fell 28 percent as sales of the cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia suffered double-digit declines. Its shares were off 7 percent. It said 6,800 employees will lose their jobs and another 400 vacancies will not be filled. Those cuts come on top of 10,400 jobs that were slashed in an earlier restructuring. Merck had 56,700 employees as of September 30. Wyeth said it still expects to cut its head count 4 percent to 6 percent this year and by 10 percent over several years. Glaxo, which had a recent round of job cuts in research and development operations, said it was reviewing U.S. operations, including the size of its sales force. "As the top line has been slowing and in some cases declining, pharmaceutical firms are reacting aggressively with job cuts," Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. Both Merck and Wyeth said results were hurt by exposure to financial institutions that succumbed to the global credit crisis. And both were helped by favorable foreign currency exchange rates, a trend that has begun to reverse. Merck said its global restructuring should result in cumulative savings of $3.8 billion to $4.2 billion from 2008 to 2013. "It's clear that companies across the board are working hard to reduce expenses," said Caris & Co analyst David Moskowitz. Merck now expects compound annual earnings per share to grow in the mid-to-high single digits between 2005 and 2010. It withdrew its long-term forecast in July over Vytorin uncertainty, along with its earlier projections for double-digit increases in profit. ADVERSE PUBLICITY Vytorin troubles began after a study, called Enhance, questioned its effectiveness. A second study also cast doubt on the drug it co-markets with Schering-Plow Corp SGP.N and suggested it might increase cancer risk. Bad publicity from the two studies have hurt sales of Vytorin and Zetia, a cholesterol drug that is a component of the Vytorin combination pill. Worldwide Vytorin sales were down 18 percent at $567 million for the quarter, while global Zetia sales were off 12 percent at $534 million. In another setback, Merck said it will have to delay the launch in Europe and other markets of its new medicine designed to raise good HDL cholesterol due to a manufacturing issue. Wyeth's bapineuzumab news may signal a more serious issue, and shares of Elan Corp ( ELN.I ) ( ELN.N ), which is co-developing the drug, fell 14.4 percent. Some European regulators have asked that late-stage trials of the drug be delayed following mixed results of midstage U.S. studies that raised safety concerns. But there were some bright spots for the drugmakers. Wyeth reported surging demand for its Enbrel rheumatoid arthritis drug, Merck said sales of its Januvia diabetes medicine doubled, and Glaxo said its top-selling asthma treatment Advair had solid growth in the quarter.
