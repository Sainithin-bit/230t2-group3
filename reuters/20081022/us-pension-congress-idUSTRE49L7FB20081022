 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government agency that insures private-sector pension plans lost $3.1 billion in the stock market over the first 11 months of the federal fiscal year, possibly endangering worker pensions, the chairman of a congressional committee said on Wednesday. 

 The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC) backs pension plans and takes over and manages failed plans. It pays benefits to the workers covered under the failed plans. On September 30, 2007, the value of PBGC's total investments was about $62.6 billion, according to its website. The PBGC has invested in mortgage-backed securities, House of Representatives labor committee Chairman George Miller, a California Democrat, said in a statement. Charles Millard, director of the PBGC, will testify before the committee on Friday "regarding the agency's financial problems that may threaten the retirement security of millions of Americans," said Miller. Miller said the agency's losses in the stock market through the end of August "were only partially offset by modest gains in other investment classes. It is likely that losses will be substantially worse after September results are reported." The losses came after the recent PBGC approval of a new policy that would allow it to shift its portfolio away from fixed-income securities and toward riskier investments. Miller said Millard rebuffed a committee subpoena in July that sought agency documents "regarding a report into the agency's mismanagement and lax governance practices." PBGC spokesman Jeffrey Speicher said the agency's portfolio is down 1.2 percent from January 1 through August 31, compared with a much steeper decline in the overall stock market. Speicher said that the agency's deficit as of September 30, 2008, the end of the fiscal year, will be released next month. He said the deficit "is expected to be significantly lower than the 2007 figure of $14 billion, due to other factors, such as increased interest rates used to calculate liabilities. We expect the new deficit figure will be about $10 billion to $12 billion." (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
