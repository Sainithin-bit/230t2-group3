 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc will host its annual developers conference starting June 7, where the company is expected to unveil the latest version of the iPhone. 

 The event will run through June 11 in San Francisco, Apple said on Wednesday. The event in previous years has featured a keynote address by Apple Chief Executive Steve Jobs. Last year, with Jobs on medical leave, marketing head Phil Schiller substituted. An Apple spokeswoman declined to say who would be delivering the keynote this year. The third-generation iPhone was unveiled at last year's conference, and went on sale less than two weeks later. Analysts expect Apple to show off the newest iPhone at this year's gathering, with a launch later this summer. The iPhone debuted in 2007 and has been a hit with consumers. Apple sold a record 8.75 million smartphones in its most recent quarter. Many expect the fourth-generation iPhone to have new features such as a front-facing camera. AT&T is the iPhone's exclusive carrier in the United States. Analysts predict that Apple will bring the device to No. 1 carrier Verizon in 2011. Apple's conference will also include its first iPad development sessions. Apple started selling the 9.7-inch touchscreen tablet earlier this month, and it saw strong early demand, selling 500,000 units in the first week. Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple fell less than 1 percent to $259.37 in midday trading on the Nasdaq. (Reporting by Gabriel Madway. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
