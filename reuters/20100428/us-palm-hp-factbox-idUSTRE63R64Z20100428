 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) struck a $1.2 billion deal on Wednesday to buy smartphone maker Palm Inc PALM.O at a 23 percent premium, allowing HP to expand into the smartphone market. 

 The world's largest computer maker is attracted to Palm's Linux-based webOS operating system. Following are the main features of that system: INFORMATION INTEGRATION The underlying principle of webOS is the concept of "information everywhere" using its Palm Synergy feature to gather data from multiple locations, from PCs to Internet-based e-mail accounts, social networking sites and corporate servers. The address book is linked so contacts that contain information from multiple sources (such as Google and Facebook) are presented in a single listing. This capability also extends to calendar and messaging functions. The messaging function enables users to track conversations in a single view and reply using SMS, MMS, e-mail or instant messaging, regardless of the format of the original message. TECHNOLOGY -- MULTI-TOUCH, MULTI-TASKING With support for multi-touch and multiple input mechanisms it is one of the closest rivals to Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone in terms of hardware flexibility and user interface. Differing from the iPhone, webOS has highly capable multi-tasking environment -- such as Nokia's ( NOK1V.HE ) N900 model -- enabling the user to multi-task with several open programs. Innovative user interface incorporates gestures to execute basic tasks -- such as throwing an application off the screen to close and a backward swipe along the gestures panel to move back through an application. WEB DEVELOPMENT TOOLS Application development is based entirely on Web standards, making it a relatively easy platform for third-party developers to create software for. This was a necessity given the challenge inherent in attracting developers to a platform with a relatively small volume potential. Sources: CCS Insight, analyst reports.
