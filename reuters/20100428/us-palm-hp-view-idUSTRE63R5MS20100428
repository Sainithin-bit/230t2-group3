 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ) struck a deal to buy Palm PALM.O for $1.2 billion, acquiring a well-known smartphone brand at a 23 percent premium while butting heads with Apple ( AAPL.O ) and Research in Motion RIM.TO in a hotly contested arena. 

 Commentary: DANIEL ERNST, ANALYST, HUDSON SQUARE RESEARCH "The growth in compute is mobile. If HP is to compete as a tech company alongside the likes of Apple, they are going to need a mobile platform. They have experimented with it in the past and they haven't done a whole lot with it. "I don't think that Apple or RIM should worry about this as much as Motorola or Nokia. Motorla is relying primarily on Google for operating system, I think thats a strategic long-term risk, and Nokia has been struggling to adapt their software to today's environment. "Samsung and LG also, they know the margins in smartphone and they too are relying on Google. They should be concerned about this as well. I honestly don't think this is going to touch what Apple and RIM are doing. They own those two markets, respectively." PHIL CUSICK, ANALYST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH "If you saw the guidance Palm just put out, it was clear they had to sell. "You go through what we've seen in terms of pricing from Verizon, who dropped prices to clear inventory and Sprint as well, I don't see why carriers would be re-ordering at those levels. "Given how quickly Palm's business was falling off and how fast their cash was going out the door, they're lucky to get what they got. "They certainly don't have to worry about cash anymore, so they don't have to worry about their supply chain, which had been a problem. If I'm a carrier thinking of bringing in a device, I'm much more comfortable with bringing Palm in with HP behind it. "It's taken what's a marginal player in handsets and put a huge company behind it. "The product has been well-received, but now with a very big organization behind them, they have more runway to get things together." LOU MISCIOSCIA, ANALYST, COLLINS STEWART "HP has been notably absent in the smartphone category obviously, where the buzz has been dominated by the iPhone. I think getting into that slice of the market makes sense, I don't think they wanted to get left out." TAVIS MCCOURT, ANALYST, MORGAN, KEEGAN & CO "Makes sense strategically for HP if they want to be in this business. "It's a little-known secret, but HP has actually been in the smartphone business for about 10 years. They use Windows mobile. This gives them their own operating system..., but it doesn't guarantee success as Palm has shown." LAWRENCE HARRIS, ANALYST, C.L. KING ASSOCIATES "Smartphones seem to be one segment where HP did not have a major role. "The smartphone market continues to grow rapidly and I think it would be at their risk to ignore it. "I would say HP looked around and said, we need to be in this space. Google is here, Apple is here. And there aren't many stand-alone Smartphone companies, even with their losses, that can come on the market for sale. "They would be one of the few companies that I think could successfully turn Palm around. The company has great brand, great international distribution. I think that will open a lot of doors. There's some work that needs to be done, frankly, at Palm." MATTHEW THORNTON, ANALYST, AVIAN SECURITIES Thornton had estimated that the most Palm would fetch was $1.5 billion. He has said a Palm acquisition would be most useful for a computer-maker aiming to get into smartphones. "HP fits that bill. They've got no position in smartphones," he said, adding that Palm will bring HP a smartphone brand and carrier relationships. "More importantly, HP will help Palm. What (Palm's) lacking right now is the capital to stay in the game. Even if Palm was having a ton of success, it would still have to grow at a measured pace. With HP you've got very deep pockets."
