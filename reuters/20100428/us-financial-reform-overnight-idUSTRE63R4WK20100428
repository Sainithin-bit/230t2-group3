 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Democrats will debate a sweeping rewrite of Wall Street rules overnight and hold a vote early Thursday in order to pressure Republicans to drop a procedural roadblock, an aide said on Wednesday. 

 Republicans will have to stay on the Senate floor through the night in order to prevent Democrats from advancing the most thorough revamp of financial regulations since the Great Depression, the aide said.
