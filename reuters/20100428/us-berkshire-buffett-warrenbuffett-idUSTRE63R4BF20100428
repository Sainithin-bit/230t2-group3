 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) will hold its annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday, is the world's third-richest person, and perhaps America's most-revered capitalist. 

 * Buffett, 79, bought Berkshire, a struggling textile mill, in 1965. The mill is gone, but Berkshire's market value is roughly $189 billion, Reuters data show. Berkshire owns roughly 80 companies, including railroad company Burlington Northern Santa Fe, auto insurer Geico, reinsurer General Re, ice cream maker Dairy Queen and utility MidAmerican Energy. It ended last year with $59 billion of stock investments in companies such as American Express Co ( AXP.N ), Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ), Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ). * According to Berkshire's latest proxy filing, as of February 28, Buffett owned 350,000 Class A shares of Berkshire, equal to 33.3 percent of shares outstanding, and 75,013,134 Class B shares, equal to 8.4 percent. He owned 24.3 percent of Berkshire in aggregate and controlled 31.3 percent of the company's voting power. * Buffett has nearly all his fortune, estimated in March at $47 billion by Forbes magazine, in Berkshire. He has said every Berkshire share he has will go to philanthropies after his death. In June 2006, he pledged 85 percent of his net worth to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family charities. He supports several charities, including Girls Inc, a social service agency, and the Glide Foundation, a San Francisco nonprofit offering programs for the poor, hungry and homeless. * Buffett was the subject of a best-selling 2008 biography, "The Snowball: Warren Buffett and the Business of Life," by former insurance analyst Alice Schroeder. The title comes from a metaphor Buffett uses to describe the accumulation in life of knowledge and understanding. Schroeder spent hundreds of hours with her subject and got access to his files, but the relationship later grew more distant. * Buffett tells shareholders he thinks of them as "owner-partners" who will retain their part-ownership in Berkshire indefinitely. He regularly speaks to students about his ideas about investing and life. * Buffett draws a $100,000 annual salary to run Berkshire. * Buffett drinks five cans of Cherry Coke a day. * Buffett has lived in the same house for a half-century, a 10-room, five-bedroom home on less than three-quarters of an acre in Omaha, near his office. The home was assessed at $727,600 in 2009, Douglas County records show. * Buffett plays the ukulele and can sing reasonably on key. He is a bridge partner of Bill Gates, the Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) chairman and a Berkshire director. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
