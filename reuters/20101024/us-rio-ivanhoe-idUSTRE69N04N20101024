 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto chief executive Tom Albanese said ongoing tensions with Canadian partner Ivanhoe Mines would not hold back the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project in Mongolia which he said could be brought on stream early. 

 Albanese said in a television interview broadcast on Sunday he hoped to see first production from the mine in 2013, and said both Rio Tinto and Ivanhoe Mines were committed to its rapid development despite their disagreements. "It's very important for Rio Tinto. It's very important for Ivanhoe. It's also very important for Mongolia. It's a first class mine being built on time," Albanese told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) programme Inside Business. "I'd like to actually see it get sped up if we can, first production by 2013. It is on track as we speak." Last week Ivanhoe Mines said it would launch a rights offering worth up to $1 billion to raise funds for the project, which finally got the go-ahead from the Mongolian government last year after years of negotiation. The rights offering is widely expected to heighten tensions with Rio Tinto. The Anglo-Australian miner is a large shareholder in Ivanhoe Mines but has launched arbitration proceedings against its Vancouver-based partner over a shareholders rights plan adopted in May. However, Albanese said both the Oyu Tolgoi mine and the Simandou project that Rio Tinto is developing in Guinea could be important parts of the company's future. "These are first tier assets on a global basis," Albanese said. "We will take the time to develop these mines, develop them carefully because I think they can be a very important part of our next generation of mines." Albanese said he hoped to see first production from Simandou "in the next five years." The Rio Tinto chief expressed confidence in Australia as a site for investment, after a major row over taxation in the sector earlier this year. Albanese said he was "quite confident" a committee set up to look at new taxation arrangements in the sector would do a "good job." An expansion in Western Australia's Pilbara region meant Rio Tinto was now set to increase its business there "by more than 50 percent just in the next five years," Albanese said. The expansion was announced after a proposed deal with BHP Billiton to substantially merge their Western Australian iron ore operations was canceled after opposition from regulators in several countries.
