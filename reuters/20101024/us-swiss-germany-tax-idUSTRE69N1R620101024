 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss Finance Minister Hans-Rudolf Merz will sign a tax deal with his German counterpart next week critical to the future of Switzerland's $2 trillion wealth management industry, Swiss news agency SDA reported on Sunday. 

 German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble will travel to Berne on Thursday to sign the new double taxation agreement, on Merz's last day at work before handing over to successor Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf, SDA said, citing the Swiss Finance Department. Schaeuble and Merz would also sign a declaration pledging to begin talks on tax matters. Merz will first travel to London on Monday to meet Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne and sign a similar declaration, SDA said. Free-market liberal Merz came under heavy fire during his tenure as Finance Minister for weakening Switzerland's cherished bank secrecy as he tried to ease pressure on the country's offshore banking industry from key trading partners. Switzerland and Germany have already agreed the outlines of a deal for a withholding tax on an estimated 200 billion euros hidden in secret Swiss accounts, Michael Ambuehl, the top Swiss negotiator for international financial affairs, was quoted as saying last week. The deal is seen yielding as much as 30 billion euros for Berlin's stretched public coffers. Some media reports suggest a withholding tax as high as 35 percent, although Swiss officials expect the tax to be set at the same level as the 25 percent Germany has for capital gains and profit from share sales. A withholding tax means the Swiss will not automatically share account information with Germany, preserving the bank privacy that has been crucial to building up Switzerland's offshore wealth management industry. Germany, along with Italy, the United States and France, has been one of the most fervent critics of Switzerland's banking secrecy laws and has paid in the past for stolen data from Swiss banks in order to try and catch tax cheats.
