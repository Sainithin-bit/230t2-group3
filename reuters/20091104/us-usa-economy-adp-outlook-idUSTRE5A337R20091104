 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. job market will likely start to grow in early 2010, as signs of economic expansion should encourage companies to hire workers, said Macroeconomic Advisers LLC chairman Joel Prakken. 

 He cautioned the labor market will remain sluggish for a protracted period with full employment unlikely to be reached until 2014. Prakken was speaking on a conference call with reporters after the release of the October ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers. Earlier, the ADP National Employment Report showed U.S. private employers shed 203,000 jobs in October, fewer than a revised 227,000 jobs lost in September.
