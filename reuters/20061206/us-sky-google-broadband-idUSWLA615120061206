 LONDON  (Reuters) - British satellite broadcaster BSkyB Plc ( BSY.L ) said on Wednesday it would tie up with Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) to deploy the Internet search giant's suite of search, advertising and video functionality on its broadband service. 

 Sky said it would launch an online user-generated video content site, its own e-mail service and a search portal. Revenue generated by click-throughs on sponsored advertising links will be shared between the two firms. Other financial terms of the agreements have not been disclosed. The user generated video content site will be seen as a rival to YouTube, which Google recently bought for $1.65 billion. BSkyB added that it was also looking at launching a product which would enable users to make calls over the Internet -- similar to that offered by Skype. "Google is committed to giving people the power to explore, create and communicate. Today's alliance with Sky brings together two of the most innovative media and technology companies," said Google Chairman and Chief Executive Eric Schmidt. The boundaries between telecoms and media firms are becoming increasingly blurred as companies look to feed the growing public appetite for something which combines TV-like content with the on-demand convenience and control offered by the Internet. Earlier this week former British telecoms monopoly BT Group ( BT.L ) launched its long-expected move into the content arena after penning a host of deals with Hollywood film studios, record companies and sports broadcasters to show their content over its new TV and video over Internet offering. Sky had problems with its fledgling on-demand film and sport download service in August. It was forced to shut down the service for three months after the software provided by Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) was cracked, enabling the digital protection to be stripped.
