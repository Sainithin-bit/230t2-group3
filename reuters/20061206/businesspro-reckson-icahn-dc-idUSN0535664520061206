 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn ended his bid for 
Reckson Associates Realty Corp. RA.N, the Wall Street Journal 
reported on its Web site on Tuesday, a move that illustrates 
the difficulty activist shareholders face in challenging 
management. 

  Reckson late Monday night said its board voted against a 
$4.3 billon takeover offer from Icahn, saying the bid wasn't 
better than an offer from rival office landlord SL Green Realty 
Corp. ( SLG.N ).  Reckson's board also reaffirmed its support of SL Green's 
roughly $4 billion cash-and-stock offer and said the company 
would proceed with a December 6 shareholder vote on SL Green's 
offer.  Icahn later said he would back out, the WSJ reported, 
citing him as saying in an interview: "The offer is pretty much 
done. It's a minor disappointment."  Real-estate developer Harry Macklowe and Mack-Cali, a 
real-estate investment trust, both dropped out of the 
partnership with Icahn over the weekend.  Now, Icahn said he is returning to his roots as a solo 
financier, bringing him full circle in his approach to 
"activist" investing, said the WSJ. Until a couple of years 
ago, when Icahn began joining forces with other investors to 
prod corporate managements to change, he largely had operated 
on his own, the paper added.
