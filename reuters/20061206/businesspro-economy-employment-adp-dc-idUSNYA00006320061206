 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers likely added 
158,000 jobs in November, according to a survey by ADP Employer 
Services released on Wednesday. 

  The median forecast for the ADP survey from economists 
polled by Reuters pointed to a reading of 125,000 new jobs for 
the November report.  Automatic Data Processing, based in Roseland, New Jersey, 
is the parent of ADP Employer Services and is a large payroll 
services company. The employment report was jointly developed 
with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC.  Macroeconomic Advisers LLC is based in St. Louis, Missouri. 
The ADP National Employment Report is released each month, two 
days prior to the government's monthly payrolls survey.  According to the latest Reuters poll of economists, the 
U.S. Labor Department's employment report on Friday is expected 
to show that 110,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were created in 
November, up from 92,000 in October.  Also on Wednesday, the second of five jobs derivatives 
auctions had traders betting U.S. employers added 85,400 jobs 
in November. The first auction on the data, on Tuesday, had an 
implied forecast of 82,000.
