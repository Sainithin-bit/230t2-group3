 LONDON  (Reuters) - Equity markets stayed generally buoyant on Wednesday, pushing MSCI's world stock index to another record high, while the dollar steadied after its recent battering on foreign exchanges. 

 Euro zone government debt was essentially flat ahead of Thursday's expected interest rate rise from the European Central Bank. The MSCI index .MSCIWD clocked up another all-time high before falling back a bit. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of leading European shares was flat. Shares in Britain's second-biggest bank, Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), were in focus after it said its 2006 profits should be "slightly ahead" of analysts' expectations. German sports car maker Porsche PSHG-p.DE was also up on "moderately confident" outlook. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  climbed 0.65 percent to its highest close in a month as Bridgestone Corp. ( 5108.T ) rose on its purchase of U.S. firm Bandag Inc. BDG.N. The market also picked up steam from data showing Japan's diffusion index of leading economic indicators rose to a preliminary 50.0 in October from a revised 25.0 in September. The Nikkei ended 105.52 points higher at 16,371.28, the highest close since November 7. The broader TOPIX index  .TOPX  rose 1.02 percent to 1,615.17. On foreign exchanges, the dollar was steady against the yen while the euro slipped slightly against the U.S. currency. The dollar was at 114.86 yen  JPY= , just off Tuesday's four-month low. The euro edged down to $1.3291  EUR= , but stayed in sight of a 20-month high of $1.3370 hit on Monday. Analysts said this marked a consolidation from the single currency's stellar gains and that a further euro rally could be just round the corner. Euro zone government bonds traded in a narrow range with 10-year yields EU10YT=RR flat at 3.675 percent. A 25 basis point interest rate hike to 3.50 percent is expected from the ECB on Thursday, but the bank's outlook going forward is less clear.
