 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chief of Boeing Co.'s ( BA.N ) commercial airplanes unit said on Wednesday the company's hot-selling 787 Dreamliner, which is crucial to Boeing's financial prospects, is on schedule for its first test flight next year and first customer delivery in 2008. 

 The new carbon and titanium wide-body plane is set to deliver operating economics "about 2 percent better" than already promised to customers, said Scott Carson, the chief of Boeing's commercial airplanes unit, in a Web cast presentation at the Credit Suisse Aerospace and Defense Conference on Wednesday. Carson, who took over as Boeing's commercial airplanes head in September after Alan Mulally left to become chief executive of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ), said assembly of the 787's main sections is set to start in January. The plane's first test flight is scheduled for next summer. Boeing has 435 firm orders for 787s, making it the most successful plane launch in the history of the industry, said Carson. He repeated previous Boeing executive comments that the planemaker is still working to take weight out of the 787 design, but he said that was "not uncommon" for new plane launches. Carson declined to comment on a recent report that German carrier Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) is set to order 20 of Boeing's new 747 passenger jumbos, worth about $5 billion at list prices. He warned that European rival Airbus, majority-owned by EADS ( EAD.PA ), would emerge "stronger than they've ever been" after a string of production delays on its flagship A380 superjumbo. "We better be ready for it," he added.
