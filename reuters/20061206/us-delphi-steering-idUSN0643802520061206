 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK said on Wednesday that it has booked $3.3 billion of new business for its steering systems division in 2006, a unit it wants to divest for its reorganization. 

 The new business is with 16 customers that Delphi declined to identify, most contracts run for about five years and more awards are expected by year-end, Delphi said. More than 30 percent of the new business was taken from other companies and the bookings reflect a more than 50 percent gain over 2005, said Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005 under pressure from high wages, production cuts by major customers and other factors. The contracts cover electric and hydraulic power steering systems, steering columns, gears, hoses and halfshafts, which help to direct power to the wheels, Delphi said. No customer represents more than half of the business and more than half the work is for vehicles made outside North America. Delphi, which General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) spun off in 1999, has outlined plans to drop numerous business lines by the end of 2007 to focus on electronics, entertainment, communications, safety and other products. The steering systems division was among several businesses Delphi named as noncore in March. Rothschild Inc. has been assisting Delphi as its primary financial adviser and investment banker for the possible sale of its steering and interiors divisions since April. The steering systems division has 64 customers, more than 9,200 employees, 22 manufacturing plants, 11 customer support centers and five regional engineering centers, Delphi said. It declined to disclose annual revenue figures for the unit. Delphi, which reported revenue of $26.9 billion in 2005, excluded international operations from its bankruptcy and hopes to emerge from court protection in the first half of 2007.
