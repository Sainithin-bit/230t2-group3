 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. financial authorities will likely 
take disciplinary action against Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ 
Financial Group (MUFG) ( 8306.T ) for slack monitoring of 
suspected money laundering, a source close to the matter said 
on Wednesday. 

  The punishment will likely be handed out some time this 
month, the source said.
