 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N is looking at opportunities to acquire companies for its consumer media group, but few fit its criteria now as valuations are too high, senior executives said on Wednesday. 

 "We're looking very carefully at online opportunities," Gordon Crovitz, a Dow Jones vice president and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, said at a Credit Suisse media conference. But, Chief Executive Rich Zannino said, "We're not that optimistic that we'll find transactions there. You look there and you see some of the valuations, it's like it's 1999 again." An ideal multiple would be 12 times next year's pro forma EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, Zannino said. He declined to say which properties might suit Dow Jones. "There are a whole bunch, but they're all priced out of sight," he told Reuters after his presentation. When asked if TheStreet.com would be a good fit, he said, "We're looking at things that have greater scale potential.... They've done a really nice job of building their business, but it hasn't scaled on the Web that much." Crovitz said the company's $528 million acquisition of financial news Web site MarketWatch in 2005 was a success in terms of increasing online advertising revenue and audience. "Our biggest frustration with the MarketWatch acquisition is that we haven't found one just like it since," he said.
