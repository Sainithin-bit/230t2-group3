 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Biovail Corp. BVF.TO BVF.N said on Wednesday it plans to triple its dividend, pay off debt and focus on drug development as it readies for copycat drugs that will challenge its main anti-depression treatment. 

 The company will also axe its U.S. sales force and cut jobs in an effort to cut costs across the organization, and will take charges because of that. The stock rose more than 10 percent, even though Biovail said the likely introduction of generic versions of its Wellbutrin XL anti-depression drug would hit 2007 results. "That (the generic drugs) will have a significant impact on us," Chief Executive Doug Squires told Reuters. "Because of that, we need to look at the company to see how can we reconfigure ourselves, while maintaining our core, and our core is drug delivery." Biovail shares closed up C$2.14, or 9.9 percent, at C$23.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, the shares rose $1.82, or 9.6 percent, to $20.72. The company said it will replace its U.S-based sales organization with supply and distribution agreements with partners to target doctors there. It plans to cut overhead and infrastructure costs and increase its research and development spending, focusing on enhanced formulations of existing products, combination products incorporating different classes of drugs, and difficult-to-manufacture generic pharmaceuticals. The cost-cutting is expected to result in severance charges, most of them in the fourth quarter of 2006. The company will eliminate its Biovail Pharmaceuticals Inc. specialty sales force and related support functions and end co-promotional efforts for its Ultram ER painkiller. Kenneth Howling, named chief financial officer on Wednesday, said the firm would cut about 200 jobs in the United States. Biovail said it expected the overhaul to lower operating costs and boost efficiencies. It also raised its annual dividend to $1.50 a share, up 200 percent, and promised a special dividend of 50 cents a share based on its strong performance in 2006. Although noting that the company's moves set it up well for the future, one analyst speculated that Biovail was trying to clean up its operations and boost its stock price ahead of either an acquisition or a takeover by a rival drug company. "This is a very positive transaction as Biovail looks to transit into another life, looks to streamline operations, clean up its balance sheet and transit into becoming much more focused on its pipeline, and spending money on its pipeline rather on distribution," said Claude Camire, senior health-care analyst at Paradigm Capital. "With this they become much more attractive to be either acquired or to make acquisitions." Biovail said it expects its 2007 profits and revenue to be lower than 2006's, reflecting the introduction of generic anti-depression drugs to challenge Wellbutrin XL. The company, which had not previously given forecasts for 2007, sees revenue of $800 million to $850 million, diluted earnings per share of $1.70 to $1.80, and cash flow from operations of $320 million to $340 million, or $2.00 to $2.12 per share. That compares with Biovail's latest 2006 forecast of earnings per share, excluding specific items, of $2.50 to $2.60, and cash flow of $460 million to $480 million. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Research had expected, on average, 2007 earnings per share of $1.60. Four companies have applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval of generic versions of Wellbutrin XL. Biovail is suing them, alleging patent infringement.
