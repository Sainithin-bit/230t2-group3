 TOKYO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bridgestone Corp., Japan's biggest tire maker, said it would pay $1.05 billion in cash for Bandag Inc., the largest U.S. supplier of retread tires, to offer a full range of services to truck fleets. 

 The deal gives Bridgestone, until now only a small player in retreaded tires, a major presence in the global retread market as cost-conscious trucking firms increasingly turn to companies that can offer both retreads and new tires. "To have built up this business model on our own would have been extremely difficult in terms of time, cost and know-how," Chief Executive Shoshi Arakawa told a news conference. Shares of Bandag, which would become a subsidiary of Bridgestone Americas, jumped 12 percent on Tuesday to $50.50, close to the purchase price of $50.75 per share. Bridgestone shares climbed 3.5 percent to end at 2,550 yen on Wednesday. Retread tires are made by removing the used tire tread and adding new rubber so that the tires can be reused. Rivals such as France's Michelin, with whom Bridgestone competes for the title of world's biggest tire maker, and third-ranked Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. offer both new tires and retread services to truck fleets. Muscatine, Iowa-based Bandag, whose 2005 sales totaled $921 million, leads the U.S. retread market with a 45 percent share and is second to Michelin in Europe with a 16 percent market share. The global retread tire market for trucks and buses is estimated at about 58 million tires, just under half the size of the market for new tires. Retread tires cost about half as much as new tires. EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION By extending the life of a tire for a customer, the deal also helps Bridgestone and Bandag fend off intensifying of competition from cheap tire imports from Chinese and South Korean makers as well as newcomers to the industry like trading houses. Bridgestone Americas will finance the purchase with bank loans. Bridgestone executives declined to provide details on Bandag's expected contribution to profit, saying they were still working on the numbers. They stressed that the company would not just be adding on a retread business but that it expected many synergies, including the promotion of Bridgestone tire sales through the Bandag dealer network. Credit Suisse analyst Toru Iwai said in a note to clients that the acquisition should contribute significantly to earnings, adding that Bandag's operating margin at 7.3 percent was higher than Bridgestone's 5.6 percent. Bandag and Bridgestone expect the deal to close late in the first quarter or early in the second quarter. Bridgestone, which has been beefing up global manufacturing capacity, and spending more on marketing and product development, said last month it expects annual capital spending of about 250 billion yen ($2.2 billion) until 2011. That does not include the Bandag deal. The company will launch a new advertising campaign in February to promote consumer tires in the Americas, using the slogan "Bridgestone or Nothing". It replaces a three-year old campaign that followed a recall of Firestone-brand tires in 2000. Bridgestone's North American tire unit last year settled a dispute with Ford Motor Co. over the tire recall, after defective tires were blamed for hundreds of deaths.
