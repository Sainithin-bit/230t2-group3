 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa said it 
is ordering Airbus and Boeing aircraft worth about $6.9 billion 
at list prices as it expands and modernizes its fleet. 

  The airline said it was ordering 20 Boeing 747-800 aircraft 
worth about $5.5 billion in total, making it the first airline 
to buy the passenger version of the plane. It was taking 
options to buy 20 more 747-800s.  Lufthansa also said it would buy seven Airbus A340-600s, of 
which it already has 14. These are worth about $1.4 billion to 
$1.5 billion, based on list prices, according to Lufthansa.  "The orders will ensure capacities for the anticipated 
growth in air traffic and also replace existing aircraft," the 
carrier said in a statement on Wednesday.  The Boeings will be delivered from 2010 and will be powered 
by General Electric GEnx-2B67 engines, while the Airbus 
aircraft will be delivered in 2008 and 2009, Lufthansa said.  Boeing so far has 44 firm orders for the freighter version 
of the 747-8 only, which was launched in November 2005. Boeing 
said earlier this year it expected to get an order for the 
passenger version by the end of the year.  The new 747-8 was launched some 35 years after the original 
jumbo jet began commercial service and will allow Boeing to 
keep a toehold in the market for aircraft with more than 400 
seats but fewer than the Airbus A380 superjumbo's 555 seats.  Lufthansa Chief Executive Wolfgang Mayrhuber had said he 
wanted to modernise the carrier's fleet of 30 390-seat Boeing 
747-400 jumbos, possibly with the larger 747-8 model, which is 
due to enter service in 2009. The carrier has already ordered 
15 A380s, which it plans to turn into its flagship aircraft.
  FLEET STRUCTURE  "The B747-8 underlines our strategy of graded 
market-specific services and capacity expansion," Mayrhuber 
said in a statement. "It fits perfectly in our intercontinental 
fleet structure and slots neatly capacity-wise between the A380 
with around 550 seats and the A340-600 with around 300 seats."  Lufthansa's supervisory board on September 20 approved the 
purchase of 30 single-aisle planes from Airbus's A320 family, 
with options to buy a possible 30 more. In addition, Lufthansa 
is buying five of the larger Airbus A330-300 model to help cope 
with delays to the A380 program.  Lufthansa, which is Europe's second-biggest airline, is 
also weighing up the fast-selling Boeing 787 Dreamliner 
mid-sized aircraft against Airbus' A350 XWB, due to come into 
service five years later.  Mayrhuber told Reuters on October 19 that there was no time 
pressure to decide between the two mid-sized aircraft, which he 
has said could replace its 28 247-seat A340-300s. A decision 
could come next year, he said.  Shares in Boeing were 0.7 percent higher at $91.32 by 1854 
GMT. EADS shares rose 1 percent to 23.12 euros in Paris on 
Wednesday.
