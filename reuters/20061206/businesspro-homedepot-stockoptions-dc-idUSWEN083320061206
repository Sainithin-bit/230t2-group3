 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc. on Wednesday said a 
review showed it had unrecorded expense of about $200 million 
from errors tied to stock options, but correcting the problem 
would have no material effect on financial statements. 

  The home improvement retailer said fixing the errors was 
expected to decrease retained earnings by the same amount.  A number of public companies are facing federal 
investigations into the possible manipulation of options 
grants.  Home Depot ( HD.N ) disclosed in June that the Securities and 
Exchange Commission had launched an inquiry into its stock 
option practices. The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District 
of New York has also requested information.  The company's independent review, covering 26 years as a 
public company and conducted by its audit committee with 
outside counsel, concluded there was no intentional wrongdoing 
by any current member of the management team or board.  But Home Depot added the investigation found that, for 
annual stock option grants and certain quarterly option grants 
from 1981 through November 2000, the stated grant date was 
earlier than the actual time the grants were approved by a 
board committee. In almost every instance during that time 
frame, the stock price on the apparent approval date was higher 
than the price on the grant date.  Atlanta-based Home Depot reported earnings of $5.8 billion 
on sales of $81.5 billion for its most recent fiscal year. The 
company last month cut its profit growth forecast for the 
current year, citing the weaker U.S. housing market.  The retailer disclosed the findings of the probe after 
markets closed. Its shares rose 55 cents, or 1.4 percent, to 
$39.92 on the New York Stock Exchange.
