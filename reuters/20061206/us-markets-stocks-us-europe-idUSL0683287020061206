 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street looked set for a flat start on Wednesday after rising solidly in the previous session on a bullish economic report and ahead of key data later in the week. 

 By 1000 GMT, U.S. stock futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were between 0.11 percent lower and 0.02 percent higher. "It looks like its pretty rangebound. We had a pretty good close yesterday," said Tom Hougaard of City Index. "We are getting quite close to the non-farm payrolls on Friday. I am sure it will be fireworks after that." U.S. November non-farm payrolls are seen as a key pointer to the strength of the U.S. economy and the likely direction of U.S. interest rates. They are forecast by a Reuters poll to show 110,000 jobs created compared with 92,000 in October. U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday after a report showed unexpected strength in the key services sector, suggesting earnings growth would weather the housing slowdown. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 47.75 points, or 0.39 percent, to end at 12,331.60. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  ended up 5.64 points, or 0.40 percent, at 1,414.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  closed 3.99 points, or 0.16 percent, higher at 2,452.38. During the session, the S&P 500 rose to 1,415.27, its highest level in a little over six years.
