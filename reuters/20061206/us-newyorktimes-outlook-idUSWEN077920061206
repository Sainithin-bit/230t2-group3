 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Times Co. said on Tuesday that its Internet revenue could grow 30 percent in 2007, and that it is trying to cut costs and is continuing to rebalance its portfolio of properties to deal with a tough media climate. 

 The Times expects revenues from its Internet-related businesses, including About.com and NYTimes.com, to bring in about $270 million in revenue in 2006. It expects Internet revenue to grow 30 percent, or more than $80 million, in 2007. The online growth forecast is a bright spot in a business that is struggling with falling circulation and weakening advertising trends. "The media marketplace has been challenging in 2006, and we expect it will continue to be next year," Chief Executive Janet Robinson said in a statement. The company did not provide forecasts for 2006 or 2007 total revenue. Analysts expect $3.31 billion in 2006 and $3.33 billion in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. The Times said it will try to strengthen its business by "continuing to rebalance our portfolio of properties and to exercise financial discipline as we allocate capital for the benefit of our shareholders." The Times said it plans to complete the sale of New York radio station WQEW for $40 million in the 2007 first quarter. It also said it plans to complete the sale of its broadcast media group in the first half of 2007. It also expects an extra $12 million in print circulation revenue from its decision to raise the newsstand price of its northeast edition of the Sunday Times and from its increase in home-delivery prices by 4 percent. The Times instituted the increases in the 2006 fourth quarter. When asked if the property review includes the Boston Globe newspaper, spokeswoman Catherine Mathis said, "On an ongoing basis, we review all our properties to make sure they are meeting their financial targets and that they continue to be a strategic fit." Former General Electric Chairman Jack Welch and Boston advertising executive Jack Connors are part of a group interested in buying the Globe. The Times Co., like other newspaper publishers, has come under pressure from shareholders unhappy with its lagging share price. New York Times shares have fallen by 7.5 percent since the beginning of the year.
