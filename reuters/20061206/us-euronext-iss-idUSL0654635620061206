 PARIS  (Reuters) - ISS, a shareholder advisory and proxy voting firm, recommended Euronext ENXT.PA shareholders vote in favor of the pan-European exchange's planned merger with New York Stock Exchange owner NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N. 

 "Based on the strategic rationale presented by the company and a very positive market reaction, we recommend that shareholders vote for this merger proposal," Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said in a document obtained by Reuters on Wednesday. ISS noted that the proposed $13 billion tie-up continued to have a negative impact on the corporate governance structure and shareholders rights of Euronext investors, however. "The negative impact includes a significant increase in board size, a blank check authorization to issue preferred stock which could have superior voting rights, shareholders no longer entitled to call special meetings, and the nomination of directors by a plurality of votes," ISS said in the document, which was released to ISS customers on Monday. Euronext, which operates the Paris, Amsterdam, Brussels and Lisbon bourses and London's Euronext.Liffe derivatives exchange, is due to hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in Amsterdam on December 19 to vote on the merger. With the exception of The Childen's Investment Fund (TCI), which owns around 10 percent of Euronext, many stakeholders in the Paris-based group have backed the deal, even if some expressed concerns about its valuation or regulatory risks. Euronext and NYSE have proposed to put their European operations under the management of a Dutch foundation to keep them beyond U.S. regulators' jurisdiction, and on Tuesday they won endorsement for the merger from European regulators. ISS said benefits of the planned transatlantic merger included the following points: "Shareholder proposals may be made by any shareholder, subject to approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission; bylaws may be amended with a majority of votes except for certain items like change in board size and board composition, which require 80 percent of votes. "And any individual may commence a class action suit on behalf of himself or herself."
