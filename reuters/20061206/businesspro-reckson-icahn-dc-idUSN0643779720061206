 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn said on Wednesday 
he ended his bid for Reckson Associates Realty Corp. RA.N, 
because he ran out of time after his partners dropped out, and 
investors balked at accepting an offer that included less cash. 

  Reckson shareholders are expected to vote later on 
Wednesday to approve a roughly $4 billion cash-and-stock offer 
from SL Green Realty Corp. ( SLG.N ).  Icahn's offer was $4.3 billion, but included convertible 
preferred issues in a company controlled by Icahn, and less 
cash than the SL Green offer.  Late Monday, Reckson said its board voted against Icahn's 
offer, and reaffirmed its support of SL Green's offer.  Icahn told Reuters: "We're obviously disappointed, because 
we thought we made a good offer."  The billionaire financier said with the shareholders voting 
on Wednesday, there was not enough time to launch a proxy 
solicitation.  Real-estate developer Harry Macklowe and Mack-Cali, a 
real-estate investment trust, both dropped out of a partnership 
with Icahn over the weekend.  Icahn's $4.3 billion solo bid included 25 percent cash and 
75 percent shares of American Real Estate Partners LP, which is 
90 percent owned by Icahn.  SL Green's offer was 70 percent in cash.  (Additional reporting by  Megan Davies )
