 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Forest Laboratories Inc.'s ( FRX.N ) Lexapro proved more effective than Eli Lilly and Co.'s ( LLY.N ) newer antidepressant Cymbalta in treating moderate to severe depression in a small head-to-head study of the two medicines, Forest said on Wednesday. 

 Lexapro also was the better tolerated of the two highly profitable drugs in the 270-patient, eight-week study that was funded by Forest. The study was intended to demonstrate Lexapro was not inferior to Cymbalta, one of the researchers said. That it appeared to be more effective came as something of a surprise. "Going in we thought Lexapro would do as well and be better tolerated," Dr. Arif Kahn, medical director of the Northwestern Clinical Research Center in Bellevue, Washington and one of the study's lead investigators, said in an interview. "This was not expected. I didn't think it would reach statistical significance," added Kahn, who prescribes both medicines for depression in his practice. Forest shares were up 54 cents, or 1 percent, at $51.01 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Lilly shares were off 22 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $54.48 also on the  NYSE. The primary goal of the study was a 50 percent improvement in patients' depression symptoms as measured by a standard depression rating system known as MADRS (Montgomery and Aasberg Depression Rating Scale). Patients aged 18 to 80 began the study with a MADRS score of 26 or greater. Sixty-eight percent of patients who received Lexapro reached the improvement goal compared with 52 percent who responded to treatment with Cymbalta. The result, which included patients who did not complete the full eight weeks of treatment, was deemed statistically significant, Kahn said. In addition, 44 percent in the Lexapro group experienced near total disappearance of depression symptoms compared with a 38 percent remission rate for Cymbalta, but that difference was not statistically significant. Lexapro belongs to a class of antidepressants called SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, that are among the most widely prescribed medicines for depression. Cymbalta belongs to a newer class called SNRIs that work on both serotonin and norepinephrine levels in the brain. Lexapro, which Forest licenses from Denmark's H. Lundbeck A/S ( LUN.CO ), had third-quarter sales of $522.7 million. Cymbalta's third-quarter sales were $348.6 million, but the newer drug is growing at a much faster pace. Analysts did not place much significance on the study, but said it would likely help Forest's sales and marketing people. "Forest in the past has been able to leverage these kind of studies into good sales," said Prudential Equity analyst Tim Anderson. "This sort of thing definitely helps them out. You have a cost advantage with the SSRIs and a study like this that Forest will market heavily." The Forest drug had a significantly lower dropout rate in the study with 87 percent completing eight weeks of treatment compared with 69 percent of Cymbalta patients. Of those who discontinued treatment early, 13 percent of the Cymbalta group stopped due to adverse events, while just 2 percent of Lexapro patients who dropped out did so due to adverse events, such as nausea, dizziness and insomnia. "Lexapro is a very good antidepressant and this study further proves it," Kahn said.
