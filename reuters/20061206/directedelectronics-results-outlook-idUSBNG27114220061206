 Dec 6 (Reuters) - Directed Electronics Inc. DEIX.O on
Wednesday cut its 2006 outlook on expectations of lower
satellite radio sales, two days after the service provider for
the radios cut year-end subscription forecasts.  Directed Electronics sells portable radio receivers that
play broadcasts from Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ),
which on Monday cut its forecasts due to the
lower-than-expected pace of holiday sales.  Sirius-branded products contributed 39 percent to Directed
Electronics' 2005 revenue.  Directed Electronics, the top loser on the Nasdaq, suffered
its sharpest-ever fall of over 14 percent and were at trading
at $11.27 in the afternoon.  The company forecast earnings of $1.04 to $1.08 a share
before items, down from $1.09 to $1.13 earlier. Sales are now
seen at $430 million to $440 million, compared with the
previous view of $440 million to $460 million.  Analysts on average were expecting earnings of $1.09 before
items and sales of $443.6 million, according to Reuters
Estimates.
