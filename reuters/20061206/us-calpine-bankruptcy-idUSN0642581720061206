 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday gave bankrupt power producer Calpine Corp. CPNLQ.PK an additional six months to file a reorganization plan, and approved the planned sale of its Aries power plant to Kelson Holdings LLC. 

 Calpine had faced a December 31 deadline to file a plan of reorganization without having to contend with rival plans prepared by its creditors or other parties. The company originally had faced an April deadline to file the plan but was given an eight-month extension by Judge Burton Lifland of U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York. The company now has until June 20, 2007 to file the reorganization proposal. Richard Cieri, a lawyer for Calpine, told the judge that the extension was necessary because of the complexity of the case, and said no objections to the request had been filed by the committee of Calpine's creditors or others. "We are making substantial progress in the reorganization," he said. Calpine is on track to deliver a business plan by the end of the month that will serve as a basis for the proposed reorganization, he said. The company has said it is about two-thirds finished with a restructuring plan that will eliminate nearly one-third of its work force and bring about $180 million in annual savings. Calpine filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2005, one of the largest U.S. corporate insolvencies in recent history. If the company does not file its reorganization by the new deadline, it could test a new U.S. bankruptcy law that aims to curtail the amount of time a company can remake itself under Chapter 11. The law sets an 18-month limit for bankrupt companies to come up with a reorganization plan. In court papers, Calpine said that even the requested extension might be "insufficient" given the complicated nature of the case, but it said it is working to complete the plan and "endeavoring to live within" the provisions of the new law. Judge Lifland on Wednesday also approved the company's plans to sell its 590-megawatt natural gas-fired Aries power plant in Missouri to Kelson Holdings for $233.6 million. Kelson, a holding company, outbid Aquila Inc., which initially had offered $158.5 million for the five-year-old facility. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close within 60 days. The judge also approved the auction procedure for Calpine to sell its 277-megawatt Goldendale power plant in Washington state. Puget Energy is expected to buy that two-year-old facility for $100 million. The auction will be held in February. Earlier this year, Calpine launched a program to sell 20 power plants, or about one-fifth of its fleet, in a bid to emerge as a leaner company focused on profitable geothermal and gas-fired generating capacity in core markets like Texas and California.
