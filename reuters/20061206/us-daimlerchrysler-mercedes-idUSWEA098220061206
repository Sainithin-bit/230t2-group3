 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Global sales at DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE premium division Mercedes Car Group rose 5.3 percent last month to 110,800 units, a record for November, the world's fifth-biggest automaker said on Wednesday. 

 Strong sales of the E- and S-Class Mercedes-Benz executive cars as well as Mercedes sport utility vehicles powered the increase, it said, citing robust sales of Mercedes-Benz cars in the United States and Germany. Mercedes-Benz brand global sales rose 9 percent on the same month last year to 101,900 units, while sales at the Smart minicar brand fell 24.2 percent to 8,900 cars, a company statement said. The division's sales in the first 11 months of 2006 rose 4.8 percent to almost 1.15 million units. DaimlerChrysler shares fell 0.6 percent to 44.07 euros by 1433 GMT, in line with the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP. An 8.4 percent rise in Mercedes-Benz sales to 1.04 million vehicles in the first 11 months offset a 21.0 percent drop in Smart sales to 105,100 cars as Smart cut back its model line-up. Mercedes Car Group has said it is on track to deliver a 7 percent profit margin next year following product renewal at Mercedes-Benz and a clampdown on costs at its struggling Smart unit. Smart has pared its model portfolio to only the quirky two-seat version with which it made its debut. Deliveries of a new version of the car start in April 2007.
