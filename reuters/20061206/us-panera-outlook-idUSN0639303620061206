 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Panera Bread Co. ( PNRA.O ) said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than expected after winter storms hurt sales in the U.S. Midwest, sending shares down 3 percent in morning trading. 

 The company said it now expects fourth-quarter earnings of 62 cents to 65 cents per share. In October, it had forecast 67 cents to 68 cents per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting 67 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. More than 40 percent of the bakery-cafe operator's restaurants are located in the storm-hit Midwest. Last week's snowstorms there were blamed for at least eight deaths, and knocked out power to hundreds of thousands of people. Panera said the storms would hurt comparable-store sales by one percentage point or more in the four-week period ending December 26. Comparable-store sales, or sales at restaurants open at least 18 months, are expected to be flat to up 2.5 percent for that period. Ashley Woodruff, an analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co., lowered her price target on Panera by $10 to $67 based on a lower 2008 earnings estimate and reduced same-store sales visibility, but she maintained her "outperform" rating. "The stock trades in line with or at a discount to peers with softer same-store sales, slower unit growth and lower returns. We think EPS estimates are now at a reasonable level and would be buyers on weakness today," Woodruff wrote in a note to clients. For the five weeks that ended November 28, Panera reported a 1.4 percent comparable-store sales increase, with company-owned locations up 1.3 percent and franchise-operated restaurants up 1.4 percent. Shares of the company were down $1.63 at $57.16 in morning trading on Nasdaq.
