 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Oshkosh Truck Corp. ( OSK.N ) said on Wednesday that it has completed its acquisition of aerial work platform producer JLG Industries Inc. and now expects net sales to be above $6 billion in fiscal 2007. 

 Oshkosh also said it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings per share to range from 35 cents to 40 cents per share, including 15 cents per share pressure from the acquisition. The Wisconsin-based company backed its prior fiscal 2007 earnings per share forecasts excluding the JLG acquisition of $3.05 to $3.15 and said it expects the acquisition to be modestly accretive for the fiscal year that ends on September 30. Oshkosh plans to provide fiscal 2007 sales and earnings forecasts that include the JLG acquisition when it reports fiscal first quarter results in the first week of February.
