 LONDON  (Reuters) - Cable firm NTL NTLI.O is expected to 
confirm on Wednesday that it has abandoned its 4.7 billion 
pound ($9.3 billion) takeover proposal for British broadcaster 
ITV ( ITV.L ), according to the Times newspaper. 

  The Times, without citing sources, said NTL's board met on 
Tuesday and decided it did not want to raise its cash and 
shares offer, which was worth 122 pence a share as of November 
9.  ITV rejected the offer, adding there was "little, if any, 
strategic logic for ITV to combine with NTL."  Sources close to the matter told Reuters at that time that 
NTL was unlikely to pursue its bid in the short term.  Pay TV firm BSkyB ( BSY.L ) made NTL's task much harder by 
buying a 17.9 percent stake in ITV, a move which prompted NTL 
to complain to competition regulators.  NTL was not immediately available for comment.
