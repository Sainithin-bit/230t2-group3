 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc. ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer, guided 2006 and 2007 earnings estimates down slightly on Wednesday, pressuring its shares. 

 MetLife said it expected to report operating earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 a share for the fourth quarter, and $5.05 to $5.30 a share for all of 2007. Both forecasts were at the lower end of analysts' expectations, averaging $1.19 a share for the fourth quarter and $5.29 for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. Insurance industry analysts use operating earnings rather than final net earnings as their main performance yardstick. The New York-based insurer also said at an investor meeting that it expected to have a 2007 return on equity of 12.1 percent to 12.7 percent. On Tuesday, Prudential Financial Inc. ( PRU.N ) , MetLife's biggest U.S. competitor, forecast a return on equity of 15 to 17 percent over the next three years. In late trading, MetLife shares were down 22 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $58.36 after falling as low as $57.57. Some analysts such as Bank of America's Tamara Kravec believe MetLife is overly cautious. "It's the company's nature to be overly conservative," Kravec said in a report released ahead of the meeting. Kravec lowered her 2007 operating estimate by 6 cents a share, but kept it at $5.45, well above MetLife's guidance. However, Stewart Johnson, an analyst at Friedman, Billing, Ramsey Group Inc., lowered his opinion on MetLife this week to "underperform" from "market perform". "Yields on their portfolios are coming down faster than rates they offer to policyholders," he said in an interview. "Met's two largest divisions, institutional and individual, as measured by operating earnings, are in a tight spot." In its meeting, MetLife forecast revenue growth of 9 to 10 percent next year. It estimated modest U.S. economic growth with no recession, and foresaw a gradual credit easing by the Federal Reserve by 75 basis points before the end of 2007. Equities prices are expected to rise by 5 percent, Chief Investment Officer Steven Kandarian said. Last month MetLife announced the sale of two New York City housing complexes, Peter Cooper Village and Stuyvesant Town, for $5.4 billion.
