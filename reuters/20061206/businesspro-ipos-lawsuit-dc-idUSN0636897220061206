 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal appeals court ruled that 
Wall Street banks accused of manipulating the prices of initial 
public offerings of technology companies during the late 1990s 
boom will not have to face a huge securities class-action 
lawsuit, The New York Times reported on its Web site on 
Wednesday. 

  The investment banks faced the prospect of making payments 
of billions of dollars to settle the accusations -- if they 
chose not to risk a trial -- involving potentially millions of 
investors, the paper reported, citing lawyers involved in the 
case.  Nearly all firms on Wall Street were touched by the 
lawsuit, it said. Described by many as the largest consolidated 
securities class-action case ever, the IPO lawsuit involved 
more than 300 individual investors, 309 issuers and 55 
underwriters, the paper said.  On Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the Federal Court of 
Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan said the federal 
judge overseeing the lawsuit had erred in granting class-action 
status to six "focus cases" out of 310 consolidated class 
actions that claimed fraud on the part of many of the nation's 
largest securities underwriters, the article said.  Securities class-action powerhouse Milberg Weiss Bershad & 
Schulman is a co-leader for the plaintiffs, the paper said.  However, the paper cited Milberg's co-founder, Melvyn 
Weiss, as saying the plaintiffs have the right to seek a review 
by the entire panel of the Second Circuit. He added that the 
ruling affected only six "focus cases" and that others could 
satisfy the standards for class-action status, the paper said.
