  NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) -- Power company Duke Energy Corp. ( DUK.N ), which
is set to spin off its natural gas division in January, on Wednesday forecast 4
percent to 6 percent earning growth and a solid capital structure for its
remaining business. Duke's Chief Executive Jim Rogers said he expects 4 percent to 6
percent ongoing diluted EPS growth through 2009, based off the
company's previously disclosed 2007 earnings per share guidance
of $1.15 for its employee incentive target.  About 85 percent of total ongoing segment EBIT will come from Duke's utility
operation, post-split.  Rogers, in a presentation to investors, said the company's three-year plan
projects about $9 billion in capital expenditures, which includes spending on a
coal plant in North Carolina, a new IGCC clean fuel plant in Indiana and a new
nuclear plant in South Carolina.  No common equity issuance will be required to support the
planned capital expenditures, according to the company.  Executives also projected a 70 percent to 75 percent dividend payout ratio,
which is expected to grow consistent with earnings.  Duke said debt to total capitalization post-split should be in the upper 30
percent range. That ratio is projected to be in the low 40 percent range by
2009.  The post-splitoff structure should be sufficient to receive
an "A" rating from Standard & Poor's, according to Duke.  Shares of Duke fell 25 cents, less than 1 percent, to $32.44 in early
trading in the New York Stock Exchange.  The Charlotte, North Carolina based Duke plans to spinoff its natural gas
business to its shareholders on January 2, 2007. The stand-alone company will be
named Spectra Energy Corp.
