 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A prolonged period of colder-than-normal winter temperatures may put a dent in heating oil supplies and drive up U.S. oil prices, but crude costs won't hit $70 a barrel in the near future, the federal Energy Information Administration said on Wednesday. 

 "However, absent oil supply disruptions, any increase in price will likely be of a smaller magnitude than that seen earlier this year, and the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil is not expected to reach $70 per barrel ... anytime soon," the EIA said in its weekly review of the oil market. The price of U.S. oil was up 42 cents at $62.85 a barrel in midday trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange after EIA data showed a draw in weekly U.S. crude oil and heating oil inventories. The EIA said higher heating oil demand that will result from much colder weather will require refiners to make more heating oil to either meet increased demand or replenish inventories. "As a result, refiners will need to run more crude oil through their refineries, thus increasing the demand for crude oil and putting upward pressure on crude oil prices," the agency said. Higher crude costs resulting from colder-than-normal temperatures will cause prices for petroleum products, like gasoline, to rise as well, the EIA said. That happened this week when the national pump price jumped a five cents to $2.30 a gallon. But the agency said the retail price for gasoline is also not expected "anytime soon" to increase to a national average of $2.50 a gallon.
