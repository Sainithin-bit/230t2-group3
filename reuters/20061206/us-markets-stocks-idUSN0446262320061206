 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Wednesday as concerns about the outlook for software maker Oracle Corp. ORCL.O hit technology shares and investors worried that stronger-than-expected job growth could delay a cut in interest rates. 

 ADP Employer Services said 158,000 private-sector jobs were added in November, above forecasts for a 110,000 gain. The closely watched report on nonfarm payrolls is due on Friday. The Labor Department's report includes government workers, while the report from ADP doesn't. "The ADP number told everybody the economy was OK, employment was fine and, presumably, the Fed would be more inclined to tighten," said Stephen Massocca, co-chief executive of San Francisco-based investment bank Pacific Growth Equities. Oracle ranked as the biggest loser in the Nasdaq 100, falling 5.2 percent, or 98 cents, to $17.88 after Lehman Brothers said investors should sell the stock because the company's quarterly database software sales may miss forecasts. This was Oracle's biggest decline in more than a year. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 6.52 points, or 0.27 percent, to close at 2,445.86. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  dropped 22.35 points, or 0.18 percent, to end at 12,309.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  finished off 1.86 points, or 0.13 percent, at 1,412.90. Earlier, the S&P 500 hit a fresh six-year high at 1,415.93. APPLE FALLS, EXXON MOBIL SLIDES The uncertainty about Oracle's prospects rippled through the technology sector and gave investors a reason to unload some stocks, including some of the biggest names. Also weighing on the Nasdaq were the shares of Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ), down 1.6 percent, or $1.44, at $89.83, and the stock of security software maker Symantec Corp. ( SYMC.O ), down 2.5 percent, or 51 cents, at $20.11. Shares of Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ), the world's biggest software company, slipped 0.5 percent, or 14 cents, to $28.99 on the Nasdaq. The stock was the fourth-biggest drag on the Nasdaq 100.NDX. The Nasdaq's biggest losers included Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ), down 2.1 percent, or 57 cents, at $26.86. The stock dropped after the Internet media company announced a management shake-up, which analysts said could increase risk for the company in the short term. Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), the world's biggest publicly traded oil company, was the biggest drag on both the Dow and the S&P 500. Its stock dropped 2.2 percent, or $1.75, at $76.31 on the New York Stock Exchange as crude oil prices fell on forecasts of warmer weather. U.S. crude oil for January delivery CLF7 fell 24 cents to settle at $62.19 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Shares of Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ) fell 0.8 percent, or 34 cents, to $44.67 on the NYSE. The drug maker's 2007 forecast disappointed some investors who had hoped for a more upbeat projection. Merck was among the biggest decliners in the Dow and the S&P 500. RATE FEARS HIT BANK STOCKS Concerns about the outlook for interest rates prompted investors to sell some financial services stocks because higher rates can raise banks' funding costs and make it more difficult for them to make money on loans. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) slipped 0.8 percent, or 37 cents, to $46.83 on the NYSE. The Philadelphia Keefe Bruyette & Woods index of bank stocks .BKX slipped 0.1 percent. But a broker's upgrade propelled the shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.( GS.N ) to a record high at $205.05 during the session. The investment bank's stock was the S&P 500's top advancer, rising 1.7 percent, or $3.39, to close at $205.00 on the NYSE. Merrill Lynch increased its price target on the stock to $222 from $200. Helping to limit the blue-chip Dow's decline was Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) Its stock rose 1.1 percent, or 37 cents, to $34.95 on the NYSE after Verizon, the No. 2 U.S. telephone company, forecast an acceleration in its share buybacks. <ID:nL06863413>. The stock of AT&T Inc. ( T.N ), the biggest U.S. telephone company and a Dow component, rose 0.3 percent, or 10 cents, to $34.78 on the NYSE. Volume was fairly active on the NYSE, where about 1.54 billion shares changed hands, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.97 billion shares were traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers by a ratio of about 9 to 7 on the NYSE, while on the Nasdaq, about eight stocks fell for every seven that rose.
