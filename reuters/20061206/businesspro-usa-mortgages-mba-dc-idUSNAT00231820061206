 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications rose 
sharply last week, fueled by a surge in home refinancing loans 
as interest rates sunk to their lowest levels in more than a 
year, an industry trade group said on Wednesday. 

  The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally 
adjusted index of mortgage application activity for the week 
ended December 1 increased 8.1 percent to 647.6 from the 
previous week's 599.  Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding 
fees, averaged 5.98 percent, down 0.15 percentage point from 
the previous week, the lowest since the week ended October 7, 
2005, when it stood at the same level. Interest rates were also 
below year-earlier levels of 6.32 percent.  The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing 
applications jumped 13.7 percent to 1,989.7.  The group's seasonally adjusted purchase index rose 4.9 
percent to 426.6, its highest since May. However, the week's 
purchase index reading was substantially below its year-ago 
level of 495.1.  The purchase index is considered a timely gauge of U.S. 
home sales.
