 LONDON  (Reuters) - Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ), Russia's No. 2 oil 
company, plans to invest $20 billion over five years to 
transform itself into a rival to the oil industry's leaders, 
its chief executive said, according to the Financial Times. 

  Sergey Bogdanchikov also forecast output would increase 
from 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) this year to more than 2 
million bpd over the coming three years and hitting 3 million 
bpd by 2015, the newspaper reported on Wednesday.  Two-thirds of Rosneft's oil-product exports were destined 
for Europe, the FT noted.  "Even today we are dependent on the European market," 
Bogdanchikov said in an interview with the newspaper.  "What will be in demand in Europe is more crude oil and 
refined products ... we are opening more terminals to reach the 
European market," he said.  Bogdanchikov said his company would look to make downstream 
acquisitions, but he did not go into detail, the FT said.  As for the $20-billion investment, the newspaper said it 
would be financed from internal resources and 70 percent would 
be earmarked for upstream operations.  Growth was seen in Rosneft's western Siberia, eastern 
Siberia and Sakhalin fields, the FT said.  The Rosneft boss said his company would expand to the scale 
of BP Plc ( BP.L ) and ExxonMobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) by the end of the 
decade. Bogdanchikov was speaking in Brussels, where he was to 
meet officials drafting the EU's energy strategy, the FT said.
