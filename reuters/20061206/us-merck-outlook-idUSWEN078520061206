 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co. on Wednesday maintained its forecast of flat earnings for 2006 and slightly higher 2007 results as the drugmaker grapples with generic competition, sending its shares down about 1.4 percent. 

 "Merck didn't say anything really surprising or out-of- whack, but some people may be disappointed the 2007 forecast didn't match some more-bullish estimates," said Mehta Partners analyst Shaojing Tong, referring to a decline in company shares. Merck ( MRK.N ), which is scheduled to meet with analysts next week to review its pipeline of experimental medicines, expects 2007 earnings per share of $2.51 to $2.59, excluding restructuring charges related to site closures and job cuts. The forecast squares with the $2.56 average of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. But Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan believes Merck issued a conservative 2007 forecast that will likely be raised during the year -- just as the drugmaker repeatedly raised its 2006 outlook. "(In 2006), Merck raised guidance three times and has handsomely executed on a strategy to, in our opinion, understate and over perform," Ryan said in a research note. Ryan stuck to her "buy" rating on the stock. Merck is counting on its new products to offset plunging sales of cholesterol fighter Zocor, its previously best-selling product whose U.S. patent lapsed last summer. It is also grappling overseas with generic forms of its Fosamax osteoporosis drug. But the drugmaker's prospects have improved with an aggressive cost-cutting program and the recent launches of three strong-selling vaccines and its promising new Januvia treatment for diabetes. It previously forecast 2006 earnings per share of $2.48 to $2.52, excluding special items. That compares with a 2005 profit of $2.51 per share. Merck's 2006 and 2007 projections do not reflect reserves for potential liability to tens of thousands of people that have filed lawsuits alleging harm from the company's Vioxx arthritis drug, which was withdrawn in 2004 after being linked to heart attacks. Chief Executive Officer Richard Clark said investors can expect Merck to return to compound annual "double-digit" earnings growth in 2010, as sales of new drugs expand and job cuts and other restructuring measures produce cumulative cost savings of $4.5 billion to $5 billion between 2006 and 2010. "Beyond 2010, we expect to deliver sustained revenue and earnings growth fueled by our growing pipeline" of experimental medicines, Clark said in a release. Clark, the former head of manufacturing at Merck, took charge of the company in May 2005 at a time when its sales and profits were reeling from the loss of Vioxx, which had annual revenue of $2.5 billion. "We expect bottom-line earnings growth to begin in 2007," excluding special items, Chief Financial Officer Judy Lewent said. Merck expects compound annual profit growth of 4 percent to 6 percent from 2005 to 2010 and plans to modestly boost annual research spending over the period, Lewent said. But she added that Merck will hold the line on marketing and administrative expenses, keeping them flat in 2010 with 2006 levels. Merck shares were down 64 cents at $44.37 in midday trading.
