 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Struggling mobile telecom gear venture Nokia Siemens Networks (NSN)NOKI.UL said on Tuesday it had agreed to sell a unit working on a niche WiMax technology to private-equity backed NewNet Communication Technologies. 
 The sale is the first for loss-making NSN since it last week announced plans to sell units and axe 17,000 jobs, nearly a quarter of its workforce. The price of the deal -- which includes the complete WiMAX product portfolio, the related employees and assets, as well as active customer and supplier contracts -- was not disclosed. NSN said in a statement the deal was expected to close next month and some 300 NSN employees would transfer to NewNet. NewNet is owned by California-based private equity firm Skyview Capital LLC. "This transaction represents a significant milestone in our strategy of building a strong global presence in the telecommunications marketplace," Alex Soltani, chairman and CEO of Skyview Capital, said in a statement. NSN, which has struggled to make a profit since being set up in 2007, was formed by Finnish cellphone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and German conglomerate Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) in the hope of building enough scale to lead an industry dominated by Swedish company Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) and, increasingly, by Chinese entrants. It has faced aggressive pricing from rivals and an economic downturn that has forced telecoms companies to cut spending. Last week NSN Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said in a letter to employees that the company would seek to exit or to put "on maintenance mode" businesses such as fixed-line VoIP, broadband access, WiMAX, narrowband, carrier Ethernet, business support systems, and communications and entertainment solutions.
