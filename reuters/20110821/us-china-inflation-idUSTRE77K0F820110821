 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China is still facing high inflation pressure, the vice-chairman of China Development and Reform Commission, China's powerful economic planning agency, told a forum in Beijing. 

 He however said the country was able to achieve balanced and relatively fast economic growth. Last week, a Chinese state think tank forecast that China's average inflation rate is likely to accelerate in the third quarter to 6.2 percent from 5.7 percent in the previous quarter, warning that food price pressures would persist.
