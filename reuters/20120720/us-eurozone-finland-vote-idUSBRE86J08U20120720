 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Finland's parliament approved a rescue package for Spanish banks, despite criticism from opposition parties who are against euro zone bailouts. 
 A total of 109 lawmakers supported the bailout, while 73 opposed it and 17 were absent from Friday's vote. Finland earlier secured a deal with Spain to receive collateral in exchange for the loans, an agreement modeled on an earlier deal with Greece.
