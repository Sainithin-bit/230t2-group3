 (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) has named Will McLane as head of corporate and investment banking for the ASEAN region and head of the financial institutions group in the Asia-Pacific region, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters. 
 McLane joins Citi from rival Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), where he worked for 15 years, most recently as head of the financial institutions group for the Asia-Pacific region. During that time, McLane worked on some of the region's most high-profile deals in the financial sector. He was involved in the $22 billion IPO of Agricultural Bank of China ( 601288.SS ) in 2010, in Singapore DBS's DBSM.I $2.8 billion rights issue, and in the $5.2 billion merger between OUB and UOB. McLane, who will relocate to Singapore from Hong Kong when he joins Citigroup, also worked on Thanachart Capital's $2.0 billion acquisition of Siam City Bank.
