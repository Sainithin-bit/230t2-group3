 GENEVA  (Reuters) - China filed an appeal with the World Trade Organization on Friday in a case brought by the United States to challenge Chinese import duties on a type of speciality steel product used in power transformers, the WTO said. 
 A WTO dispute panel handed the United States a victory last month in the case, which involves Chinese duties on potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of "grain-oriented flat-rolled electrical steel", made by AK Steel Corp ( AKS.N ) of Ohio and ATI Allegheny Ludlum ( ATI.N ) of Pennsylvania. China is appealing certain issues of law and legal interpretation, the WTO said in a statement. (Reporting by  Tom Miles )
