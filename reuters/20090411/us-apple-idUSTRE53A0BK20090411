 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - More than three months into a medical leave from Apple, Chief Executive Steve Jobs remains closely involved in key aspects of running the company, the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook runs the day-to-day operations, but Jobs has continued to work on the company's most important strategies and products from home, the newspaper said in a story on its website. He regularly reviews products and product plans, and was particularly involved in the user interface of the new iPhone operating system that Apple unveiled last month, the Journal said. Jobs, an Apple co-founder who is considered the company's creative leader, is also involved in the development of future projects, the paper said, citing people with knowledge of the company's strategy. Jobs, 54, who was treated in 2004 for a rare form of pancreatic cancer, took a medical leave in early January, saying he would return in June and would remain involved in "major strategic decisions while I am out." But he has made no public appearances or statements since then, and it has been unclear just how involved he continued to be, the Journal said. Jobs didn't respond to requests for comment, the paper said. Apple spokesman Steve Dowling told the Journal: "Steve continues to look forward to returning to Apple at the end of June." Apple stock has suffered since last summer on speculation about his condition. (Writing by  Eric Beech ; Editing by  David Fox )
