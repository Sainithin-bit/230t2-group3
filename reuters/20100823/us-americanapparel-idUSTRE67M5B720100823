 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - American Apparel Inc ( APP.A ) said the company was unsure when it could file its quarterly report with regulators, which could lead to its shares being delisted from the American Stock Exchange. 

 The Los Angeles-based hip apparel maker said Monday it received a warning letter from NYSE Amex LLC and that it had provided supplemental information to the exchange on how it plans to regain compliance by no later than November 15. "However, no assurances can be given as to when the form 10-Q will ultimately be filed," the company said in a statement. The company, which recently said it could breach a loan covenant, has been in trouble time and again over SEC probes to sexual harassment lawsuits filed against its flamboyant chief executive. The company's newly appointed auditors need sufficient time to complete their review procedures for the quarter ended June 30, it said in a statement. American Apparel's former auditor Deloitte had quit after warning of problems with the company's reporting, and as a result, the reliability of its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009. American Apparel shares closed at $0.74 Monday on the American Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Nivedita Bhattacharjee  in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair)
