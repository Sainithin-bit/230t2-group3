 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China is unlikely to raise interest rates soon and is more likely to cut than raise banks' required reserves as Beijing aims to prevent a further slowdown in economic growth, former central bank adviser Li Yang said in remarks published on Monday. 

 A string of recent economic indicators, such as slowing imports and the weak purchasing managers index, shows a slowing trend that could continue until next year, the official China Securities Journal quoted Li as saying. China's economy has throttled back a bit, with annual growth slowing to 10.3 percent in the second quarter from 11.9 percent in the first quarter, but the government has said the pullback was still within Beijing's comfort zone. "The demand for loans is not robust, the chance to raise interest rates is small, and the possibility to raise required reserves is also low; instead, the central bank may cut the reserves," he was paraphrased by the paper as saying. Li also said that consumer inflation is likely to ease, citing overcapacity in some industries and reduced pressure from imported inflation. (Reporting by Aileen Wang and  Ken Wills )
