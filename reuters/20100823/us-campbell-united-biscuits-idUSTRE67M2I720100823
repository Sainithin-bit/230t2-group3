 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ), the world's largest soup maker, is weighing a bid for Britain's United Biscuits, a source familiar with the situation said on Monday. 

 Private equity firms Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) and PAI Partners, which bought United Biscuits in 2006, are considering selling the company for more than 2 billion pounds sterling, Reuters reported in July. The Sunday Times reported that Campbell could try to buy the biscuit-making operations for 1.5 billion pounds ($2.3 billion). It is less interested in the snacks business, the paper reported. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are advising the owners on the sale, a person familiar with the matter said. Campbell, the maker of Prego pasta sauces, Pepperidge Farm baked goods and V8 juice drinks, declined to comment. Last month, its Chief Executive Douglas Conant told analysts that Campbell has a "renewed, but highly disciplined interest in acquisition candidates." "We're focused on organic growth and we're looking to complement that with smart acquisitions that take us to places where we can't naturally get ourselves within a reasonable time frame," he said at the time. Morningstar analyst Erin Swanson said she expected Campbell would look for bolt-on acquisitions in developing and emerging markets, but said "anything is possible." Conant said a criteria for any deal would be that it complements one of its core categories, which include simple meals, baked snacks and healthy beverages. Last year, Campbell bought artisan bread maker Ecce Panis for an undisclosed sum. In 2008, it sold the Godiva chocolate business. Campbell shares rose 38 cents, or 1 percent, to $37.02 on the New York Stock Exchange.
