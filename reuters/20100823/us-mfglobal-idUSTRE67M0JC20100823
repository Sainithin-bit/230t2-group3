 LONDON  (Reuters) - MF Global Holdings MF.N is poised to enter money management and investment banking, the brokerage firm's new boss was quoted as saying by the Financial Times on Monday. 

 "Soon we'll be in the money management business and ultimately under the investment banking business, all designed around where our strengths are," Jon Corzine said. "If we aren't well along that plan in three years, I would be very disappointed," he said. Corzine said MF Global could form ties with other industries such as car makers. "We have natural baseline knowledge of natural resources and commodity-based activities, and we'll use that to grow," he said. "Some of that will be determined opportunistically," he said. Earlier this month, MF Global reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, returning to profitability in the brokerage's first full quarter under new CEO Jon Corzine.
