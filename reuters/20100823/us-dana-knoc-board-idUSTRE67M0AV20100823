 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Korea National Oil Corp is awaiting shareholder responses to its hostile $2.6 billion bid for the UK's Dana Petroleum and declined to comment on whether it would consider a higher offer in return for Dana's board approval, a source said on Monday. 

 South Korea's state-run KNOC launched a hostile 1,800 pence a share offer worth 1.67 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) on Friday after it failed to win Dana's board approval for its proposal, and said it had already received nearly 50 percent of shareholder backing. "KNOC is still awaiting shareholder response and continues to believe its offer fully and fairly values Dana," a source close to the matter told Reuters. The source declined to be named because he was not authorized to talk to media. Earlier the Financial Times said in an unsourced report that the Dana board plans to use its interim results on Friday as a platform to stress its value and hoped that the attraction of a board seal of approval would lure KNOC back to the negotiating table with a higher offer. KNOC will also buy out Dana's convertible bond holders to give a total deal value of 1.87 billion pounds ($2.9 billion), which would top its purchase of Canadian group Harvest Energy last October for $1.7 billion.
