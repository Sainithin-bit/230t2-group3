 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian brewer Foster's Group FGL.AX said on Monday it was unaware of any unannounced information to explain Monday's share price surge. 

 In response to a query from the Australian Securities Exchange, Foster's noted press speculation in relation to a potential takeover bid but said it was not aware of any "unannounced information" that could impact the shares. Foster's shares rose as much as 6.5 percent Monday after Britain's Sunday Times reported that SABMiller ( SAB.L ) was considering buying its beer operations for about 7 billion pounds ($10.9 billion).
