 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two Mitsubishi Corp units said on Monday a U.S. District Court has denied a motion by General Electric Co to dismiss their lawsuit charging GE with trying to monopolize the U.S. market for variable speed wind turbines. 

 The units, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Lt and Mitsubishi Power Systems Americas Inc, said the judge did decide to stay discovery in the suit, filed the U.S. District Court's Western District of Arkansas in May. In the complaint, Mitsubishi had alleged that after it gained foothold in the United States in 2006, GE embarked on an anti-competitive scheme to drive Mitsubishi suppliers out of the market. "The judge did decide to stay discovery for the present," said Mitsubishi Power Systems Americas spokeswoman Sonia Williams. "Nevertheless, we are heartened by his suggestion that he may terminate the stay if he finds appropriate circumstances. A spokesman for GE was not immediately available. The two companies have been escalating a legal battle over wind turbine technology. In January, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that Mitsubishi Heavy did not infringe GE wind turbine patents. GE has said it will appeal. In February, GE filed a lawsuit against Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and two U.S. units, accusing them of infringing two patents used in variable speed wind turbines.
