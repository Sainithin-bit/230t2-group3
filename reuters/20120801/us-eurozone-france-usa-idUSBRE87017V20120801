 PARIS  (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande told his U.S. counterpart Barack Obama in a telephone call that European Union member states aimed to enact decisions taken at an end-June summit soon, Hollande's office said on Wednesday. 
 "The devices and means detailed (at the June 28-29 EU summit) must be put into effect as soon as possible," the president's office said in a statement. The two leaders had an "indepth" discussion on the world economy and euro zone crisis and also talked about the conflict in Syria and agreed on the urgency of a political transition to end the violence.
