 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Struggling Japanese TV maker Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ) said on Tuesday about 3,000 of its workers volunteered for early redundancy, far more than the 2,000 it aims to lay off in a bid to trim costs amid mounting losses. 
 Sharp said it will book a special loss of 25.3 billion yen ($312 million) for the October-December quarter to cover costs for the layoffs. ($1 = 81.1350 Japanese yen) (Reporting by Shinichi Saoshiro; Editing by  Michael Watson )
