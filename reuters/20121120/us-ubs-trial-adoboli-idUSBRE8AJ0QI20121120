 LONDON  (Reuters) - Former UBS trader Kweku Adoboli was convicted by a majority verdict on Tuesday of the second of two charges of fraud he faced. 
 But the jury at London's Southwark Crown Court acquitted him of four charges of false accounting. Adoboli had denied all six charges. (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon)
