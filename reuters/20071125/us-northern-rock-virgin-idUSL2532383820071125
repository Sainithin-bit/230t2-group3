 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stricken British bank Northern Rock NRK.L is set to name a consortium led by Richard Branson's Virgin Group as its preferred bidder, the BBC said on Sunday. 

 The broadcaster said on its website, without citing sources, that Northern Rock would name the Virgin team as its preferred bidder on Monday. It said the consortium's proposal included a plan to immediately repay 11 billion pounds ($22.6 billion) of the estimated 25 billion pounds the bank has borrowed from the Bank of England. Northern Rock's existing shareholders, some of whom have been arguing against a rapid sale, would retain around a third of the business under the Virgin group's plan, the BBC said. Virgin declined to comment. Northern Rock was not immediately available. (Reporting by  Mark Potter  and  Steve Slater )
