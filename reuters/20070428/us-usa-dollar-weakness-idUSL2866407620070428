 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Deputy Secretary Robert Kimmitt said he would not comment on the weakness of the U.S. dollar on Saturday after the currency slid to a record low against the euro on Friday. 

 The euro pushed over $1.3680, the highest level since the launch of the common European currency in 1999, after a report showed the U.S. economy grew by just 1.3 percent in the first quarter.
