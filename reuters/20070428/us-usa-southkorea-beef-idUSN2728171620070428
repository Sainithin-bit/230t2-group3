 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - South Korea's acceptance on Friday of a shipment of U.S. beef marked a milestone in a biting trade row, but the U.S. Agriculture Department and lawmakers challenged the Asian nation to take additional steps if it wants to see Congress approve a coveted trade agreement. 

 "The (free trade agreement) with Korea will not be ratified until Korea opens its market in accordance with international standards," said USDA spokesman Keith Williams. "South Korea must take some additional steps to ensure that its beef import standards are based on science ... recognizing the safety of U.S. beef." Williams said the shipment of 6.4 tonnes of beef had been accepted, a first in South Korea since December 2003. The news is a big step toward dissolving months of bilateral tension over beef trade. The U.S. beef industry, and lawmakers from large meat-producing states, have complained since last year about Seoul's decision to block three beef shipments that contained trace bone chips. Those exports were supposed to mark the resumption of beef trade, which was stalled for more than three years. The issue has also threatened to derail a lucrative bilateral trade deal, concluded earlier this month, which is expected to add $20 billion a year to the two countries' trade. Key lawmakers, including Sens. Max Baucus and Chuck Grassley, the top Democrat and Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, have threatened to withhold support for the deal until beef trade is resumed. "If Korea continues to block or limit imports of U.S. beef for nonscientific reasons, I guarantee that the U.S. Congress won't implement the U.S.-Korea free trade agreement," said Grassley, an Iowa Republican. An aide to Sen. Baucus called the return of U.S. beef to Seoul "a positive development," but said South Korea should now embrace international guidelines and accept bone-in beef and meat from older animals. Until mad cow disease was found in the United States in December 2003, South Korea had been the third-biggest customer for U.S. beef. EXPORTERS PLANNING MORE TRADE Dennis Buhlke, chief executive with Creekstone Farms, the company that shipped the beef accepted on Friday, said the firm was talking with four to five importers in South Korea about additional shipments. At least in the short-term, he said, Korea would be more lucrative than Japan, which now accepts some meat from animals 20 months old or younger. South Korea permits imports of meat from cattle less than 30 months on the condition that parts Seoul deemed risky, such as bones, were not included. "We'll probably be filling some orders next week because we're taking orders ... as soon as we got word the first shipment made it through," Buhlke said. Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN.N ), the world's largest chicken, beef and pork processor, said in a statement it will be resuming exports to Seoul "within the next few weeks." The United States expects the World Animal Health Organization (OIE) will next month confirm its status as a "controlled risk" country. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association said the OIE ruling should expand U.S. beef imports. "There is still more work to be done to rebuild the trading relationship between our two countries," said Gregg Doud, NCBA's chief economist.
