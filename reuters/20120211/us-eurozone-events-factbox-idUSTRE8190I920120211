GREECE: POLITICS: -- Leaders of the three parties in the Greek government reached agreement on Thursday on more austerity to secure a second bailout package from the European Union and International Monetary Fund to avoid a messy default. -- Euro zone finance ministers said Athens needed to make more cuts to convince them to release a second financial bailout package. -- But with elections looming as early as April, politicians are not eager to accept more pain for ordinary Greeks which risks plunging the economy deeper into recession. -- Euro zone officials say the full rescue package must be agreed with Greece and approved by the EU, IMF and European Central Bank by February 15 so legal paperwork can be completed before a 14.5 billion euros in government bonds mature on March 20. -- Public and private sector unions ADEDY and GSEE hold a 48-hour general strike on Friday and Saturday against the new austerity measures and have called rallies in central Athens at 0900 GMT on Friday and Saturday, plus 1500 GMT on Sunday. GOVERNMENT DEBT SUPPLY: -- Athens is expected to continue monthly auctions of 3- and 6-month T-bills in February as it needs to refinance a total of 2.6 billion euros of maturing paper.

The measures are still before parliament and must be approved by mid-March. -- The service sector reforms follow an austerity program already approved by parliament which includes the reintroduction of a housing tax, pension reform and spending cuts. -- A number of relatively successful bond auctions, and optimism over Greece avoiding imminent default, have brought Italy's 10-year bond yields down to below 5.5 percent from peaks close to 8 percent near the end of last year. POLITICS: -- Ongoing negotiations between government and unions over reform of labor market rules.
