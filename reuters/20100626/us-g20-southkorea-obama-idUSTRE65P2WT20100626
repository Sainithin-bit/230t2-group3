 TORONTO  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Saturday he would present the South Korea free-trade agreement to the U.S. Congress for approval a few months after the November congressional elections. 

 Obama, who met with South Korean President Lee Myung-Bak on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Toronto, announced a new push to complete the deal and wants to resolve remaining issues before his visit to South Korea in November for the next gathering of world economic powers.
