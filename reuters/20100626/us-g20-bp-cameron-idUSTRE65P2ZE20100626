 TORONTO  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron agreed on Saturday there was nothing to be gained from damaging BP, a British official said. 

 The official said that Cameron had raised the issue of BP, which is facing a multi-billion dollar clean-up bill for the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, in his first face-to-face meeting with Obama since taking office last month. "The PM raised BP and both agreed that there was nothing to be gained from damaging BP as a going concern," the official said. "Both agreed that BP must meet its obligations to cap the leak, clean up the damage and meet legitimate compensation costs." BP shares nosedived to a 14-year low on Friday and the company has seen $100 billion wiped off its market value since the start of the disaster, now in its 68th day.
