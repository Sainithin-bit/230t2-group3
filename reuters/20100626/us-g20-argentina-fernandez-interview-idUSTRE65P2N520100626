 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Europe's focus on cutting deficits is "absolutely wrong," Argentina President Cristina Fernandez said, citing her country's experience with austerity that she said helped lead to a massive default in 2001. 

 Speaking in an interview with Reuters on Saturday, Fernandez sounded a warning on the plans of several European nations, saying Argentina also cut salaries for public sector workers to get public accounts in order. "It all ended in an implosion and in default," she said. Fernandez is in Toronto for a meeting of the leaders of many of the world's biggest economies. The Group of 20 is trying to forge consensus on how quickly to shrink government deficits, how best to strengthen banks so they can withstand any new downturn, and how to harmonize financial regulatory reforms. Europe's simmering debt troubles have led countries like Greece and Spain to embrace painful spending cuts and are a reminder that when markets lose faith in governments' ability to rein in spending, borrowing costs soar and countries are forced into swifter, harsher fiscal fixes. But Fernandez said spending cuts in Europe would hit economic growth, reducing government revenues and hitting states' ability to pay back its debt. "This focus is absolutely wrong," she said. Before Argentina's default, the country's economy was in a recession and the government implemented a series of austerity measures to curtail public spending, including cutting state worker salaries and pension payments and raising taxes. That only deepened the country's economic malaise. The crisis eventually provoked a bruising currency devaluation and a record $100 billion debt default and left one out of four Argentines unemployed. Fernandez said Argentina's economy would grow more than 5 percent this year, and that the country felt it was not important to return to international capital markets after its recent debt swap aimed at satisfying creditors affected by the 2001 default. The G20 covers two-thirds of the world's population. It includes Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Russia, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, big European economies, the United States and Canada.
