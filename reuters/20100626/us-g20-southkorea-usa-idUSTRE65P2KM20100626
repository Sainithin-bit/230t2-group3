 TORONTO  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will announce on Saturday a new push to complete a bilateral trade agreement with South Korea, a senior U.S. official told Reuters. 

 "To create jobs and improve the economy for all Americans, the president will announce today following the bi-lateral meeting with South Korea that he is launching an initiative to complete the Korean-U.S. Free Trade Agreement," the U.S. official said. Obama will set a goal of resolving remaining issues before his visit to South Korea in November for the next G20 meeting, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
