 TORONTO/HUNTSVILLE, Ontario  (Reuters) - G8 wealthy countries said on Saturday the global economic crisis threatened to undermine 2015 global targets for halving extreme poverty around the world. 

 In a communique at the end of a two-day summit in a lake resort north of Toronto, the Group of Eight failed to acknowledge its unmet aid promises, which fell $18 billion short of a $50 billion target by 2010. Instead, the G8 trumpeted a new $5 billion initiative to reduce deaths among mothers and their newborns, which has become a growing concern in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The G8 meeting took place under a cloud of doubt about the strength of the economic recovery and the state of public finances, which has left leaders unable to offer bolder aid commitments. "A decade of policy commitments and joint efforts with our partners has brought significant progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)," the communique read. "But both developed and developing countries must do more; meanwhile, the (economic) crisis has jeopardized advancement toward meeting some of the 2015 targets," it added. It said meeting the 2015 poverty goals -- agreed on by the leaders of more than 150 nations in 2000 -- was a "shared responsibility" and urged greater efforts to ensure the targets were met in Africa. With just five years before the 2015 deadline, leaders of U.N. member states are scheduled to meet in September in New York to seek ways to achieve the targets. The first day of the G8 summit included African nations Senegal, Malawi, South Africa, Nigeria, Malawi and Egypt, also Haiti and Jamaica. They left without making statements. The G8 called on developing countries "to meet their primary responsibilities for social and economic development and good governance, in the interests of their citizens. The G8 countries said they remained committed to providing aid to the world's neediest countries, but provided no timelines. While the world as a whole is on track to meet the 2015 deadline to cut extreme poverty by 50 percent, the goals are off-track in Africa and parts of Southeast and East Asia where tens of millions of people will remain immersed in poverty because of the economic crisis, the United Nations said last week. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said meeting the MDGs was a concern to all, adding the G8 mother-and-child initiative was an important step to achieving the goals. "The world cannot thrive on imbalances, be it macroeconomic or others," he told reporters. BOOSTING GLOBAL FOOD PRODUCTION The G8 said food security remained an urgent global development challenge, which was being exacerbated by climate changes in developing countries. The United States has pushed efforts to increase agricultural production in poor countries after years of underinvestment in the sector. The G8 said aid alone would not lead to more global food security and urged more investment in poor countries. It noted that such investments should be done responsibly. It urged the World Bank and global food agencies to develop guidelines for international farmland investment, following deals in the past two years that have led to accusations that wealthier nations have been staging a land grab. The G8 nations said tackling climate change "remains top of the mind" and said they strongly supported U.N. negotiations on a new global climate treaty. "We want a comprehensive, ambitious, fair, effective, binding, post-2012 agreement involving all countries, and including the respective responsibilities of all major economies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," the G8 said. Talks to agree on a new climate treaty have been stymied by broad differences over emission targets and who should pay for poorer nations as they struggle with climate changes.
