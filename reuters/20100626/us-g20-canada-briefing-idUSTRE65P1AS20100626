 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will urge the G20 on Saturday to commit to additional steps to safeguard the fragile global recovery amid signs the group's crisis-forged unity is fraying. 

 At a working dinner to kick off a G20 summit on Saturday and Sunday, Harper will praise the group for progress in fulfilling pledges at its previous three summits, Harper's spokesman Dimitri Soudas told reporters. "The prime minister also will point out that if the G20 is to be the premier international economic forum it will need to take further steps to protect the recovery and set in motion strong, sustainable and balanced growth," he said. Canada believes the G20 could move more quickly to implement stricter rules for the banking sector to prevent another global meltdown and will repeat its call for specific fiscal targets for all members.
