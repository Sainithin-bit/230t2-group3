 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Summits are usually a perk of power, a chance for politicians to bask in the global spotlight and trumpet the benefits of their strong leadership. 

 But this weekend's meeting of the Group of 20 countries in Toronto is drawing a collection of new, weak, or simply distracted leaders whose headaches at home may outweigh the challenges they face as a group. Following are the G20 leaders and some of their problems: THE TRADITIONAL SEVEN UNITED STATES - President Barack Obama's troubles are well known. An unpopular war in Afghanistan, an expanding environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, a tough congressional election season coming up and falling approval ratings as he struggles to combat high unemployment. For Obama, as for many of the others in Toronto, this year's G20 sojourn may provide a break before the real work begins again. BRITAIN - New Prime Minister David Cameron squeezed out a narrow victory on May 6 in polls which produced Britain's first coalition government since the 1970's, an unlikely unlikely alliance between the Cameron's center-right Conservatives and the smaller center-left Liberal Democrats. The challenge is to make this odd-couple partnership work, particularly as it seeks to push through Britain's harshest budget in decades with massive spending cuts and tax hikes. FRANCE - President Nicolas Sarkozy arrives in Toronto amid sharpening labor anger at home over his government's austerity plans. Sarkozy, who hopes to win reelection in 2012, is betting that a show of strength will consolidate his position, but the glum national mood has soured further following France's ignominious exit from the soccer World Cup without winning a single match. GERMANY - Chancellor Angela Merkel only began her second term in October last year, but her popularity has slumped to its lowest levels since she was elected in 2005. Her coalition government is under fire for ineffectiveness and critics accuse her of aggravating the euro crisis by dithering over a rescue package for Greece. She came to the summit as a standard-bearer for Europe's drive to fiscal austerity. But that approach has run into criticism from the United States which says it is too early to stop the pro-growth spending that helped prevent the financial crisis from turning into a worldwide recession. ITALY - There are few more problem-plagued leaders than Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, whose popularity recently sank to 42.5 percent, the lowest level since he took office in 2008. The effervescent Berlusconi enraged opponents by announcing a 25-billion-euro austerity package to stave off a Greek-style debt crisis, while a widening bribery scandal has forced his industry minister to resign. Berlusconi, whose comments on topics from sex to religion often spark controversy, recently quoted fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in a lament on what he said was his lack of real power -- saying that "everyone and anyone can criticize me and perhaps even insult me." JAPAN - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan is another fresh face in the G20 crowd, having recently become Japan's fifth premier in just three years. Kan took over after predecessor Yukio Hatoyama quit after eight months in office during which his ratings nosedived, and people are watching to see if Kan will prove any more long-lived. Kan says he may pitch a sales tax to fix the country's desperate finances, but doubts remain over his "Third Way" prescription of higher taxes and focused spending as a cure for two decades of economic stagnation. CANADA - Summit host Prime Minister Stephen Harper had hoped the G20 meeting in Toronto, following the Vancouver Winter Olympics, would cement his image as a leader who earned his country a starring role in world affairs. But opposition criticism of summit costs and tensions over G20 protests have threatened to overshadow Harper's moment in the sun, leaving his minority Conservative government fighting charges of scandal and overspending as it seeks to determine when to call the next elections. EMERGING POWERS RUSSIA - Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is emerging from the shadow of his predecessor, Vladimir Putin. But many observers say Putin -- now prime minister -- still calls the shots, undercutting Medvedev's gravitas at events like a G20 summit. He did share the stage with Obama to sign a deal cutting nuclear weapons, and the United States backs Russia's bid to join the World Trade Organization, both impressive political wins. But the Medvedev-Putin rivalry remains a question mark. The two men have said they have not yet decided who will run for president in 2012 -- but they are talking about it. CHINA - Chinese President Hu Jintao may have believed that China's decision before the G20 summit to relax the peg of the yuan against the U.S. dollar would blunt international accusations that Beijing artificially undervalues its currency. But with only marginal appreciation of the yuan in recent days, critics are again pointing the finger at China as an unfair player in global trade. Hu is also under pressure to take a stronger line on China's long-time communist ally North Korea, a step Beijing has avoided amid uncertainties over how Pyongyang's isolated leadership may react.
