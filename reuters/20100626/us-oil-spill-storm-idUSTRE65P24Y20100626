 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Tropical Storm Alex does not currently threaten oil siphoning efforts at BP Plc.'s blown-out Macondo well in the northern Gulf of Mexico, the top U.S. oil spill official said on Saturday. 

 BP could be forced to suspend containment efforts if the storm causes gale-force winds at the site off the Louisiana coast, Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen told reporters on a conference call. "We understand it's moving westerly at this time and does not threaten the site," Allen said. "Where it's at right now, we don't have any indication that we would reach gale-force winds at the well-bore as the storm passes." Current forecasts project Alex will emerge in the southern Gulf of Mexico late Sunday and make landfall as a minimal hurricane by early Thursday morning somewhere between Brownsville, Texas, and Tuxpan de Rodriguez Cano, Mexico, which is 100 miles south of Tampico, Mexico. If an evacuation was necessary, it would take five days to remove the containment cap from the well's failed blowout protector and raise the pipe to the drillship where the oil is being received, he said. It would be 14 days before the cap could be put back in place following an evacuation, Allen said, because of the time needed to move the drillship clear of a storm's path and return it to the spill site. U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu and U.S. Interior Secretary Kenneth Salazar are scheduled to meet on Wednesday to review final plans for a new containment system that could boost collection of crude oil gushing from the well to 80,000 barrels per day by mid-July, he said. On Friday, the current system collected over 24,000 barrels and is expected to reach a 53,000 barrel per day capacity in the coming week as another collection system is added at the Macondo site, Allen said.
