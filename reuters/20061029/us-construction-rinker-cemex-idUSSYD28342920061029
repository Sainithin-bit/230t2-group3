 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Rinker Group RIN.AX said on Monday a US$12 billion takeover bid from the world's third-ranked cement maker, Cemex, materially undervalued it and shareholders should take no action. 

 Mexico-based Cemex CEMEXCPO.MX ( CX.N ), which operates in 50 countries, offered $13 per share cash. The unsolicited bid also includes taking on $860 million of Rinker Group Ltd.'s debt. The bid, which represents a premium of more than 20 percent to Rinker's closing price on Thursday -- before talk of a takeover began to lift the stock -- comes as a slumping housing sector helped slow U.S. economic growth to its weakest in over three years. "The proposed offer is opportunistic and materially undervalues the company," Rinker Chairman John Morschel said in a statement to the Australian Stock Exchange on Monday. Rinker shares are due to open at 11:00 a.m. (0000 GMT). The deal would increase Cemex's dominance in U.S. cement as 80 percent of Rinker's earnings come from the United States, open the door in Australia and give it a foothold in China, where Rinker has four plants. Analysts said that Cemex, or perhaps other potential bidders for Rinker such as larger rival global cement companies Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ) and Holcim ( HOLN.VX ), or perhaps CRH Plc ( CRH.I ), would have to raise the offer to be successful. "Rinker is deserving of a premium multiple. Cemex will obviously need to raise its offer to appease Rinker shareholders," said a report from Robert Norfleet, analyst at Davenport Equity Research. "Being bought is the likely outcome of this ordeal. That withstanding, we understand (Rinker) management's ... reluctance as this offer comes at a time when conditions in Rinker's markets are difficult with multiples having compressed in the face of a challenging operating environment," he said. The Cemex bid price values Rinker at an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple of 9.2 times, based on earnings reported for the 2006 fiscal year. The bid announcement drove Rinker's New-York traded ADRs up 33.15 percent to close at $71.10, putting them at about a 9 percent premium to the Cemex bid price, and suggesting the market expects a higher offer. Rinker's ADRs represent 5 ordinary Rinker shares. The Australian shares had already jumped 5.8 percent to close at A$14.70 earlier on Friday. The stock traded as high as A$21.44 in April. Cemex said it expects around $130 million cost synergies a year, before tax, by the third year following the acquisition of Rinker, a figure Norfleet said was "extremely conservative." Rinker has appointed UBS as its financial advisers. ($1=A$1.30)
