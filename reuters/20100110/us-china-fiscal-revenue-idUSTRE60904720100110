 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's 2009 fiscal revenue was expected to have increased by 11.7 percent to 6.8477 trillion yuan ($1.0 trillion), Finance Minister Xie Xuren was reported as saying by Xinhua on Sunday. 

 That was well ahead of the government's target of an 8 percent increase to 6.623 trillion yuan. Xinhua did not report China's overall expenditures for 2009, but the above-target revenues suggest that the country may have run a deficit smaller than the 950 billion yuan shortfall it had budgeted for.
