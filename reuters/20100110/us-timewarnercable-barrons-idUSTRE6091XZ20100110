 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable ( TWC.N ) is one of the most compelling investments in the cable industry, Barron's said on Sunday, with its shares poised to rally about 30 percent in the next year as its earnings improve. 

 Shares of the largest pure-play cable operator, which closed on Friday at $41.51, could get a boost if the board, as expected, declares a stock dividend or stock-buyback plan, or both, Barron's said. They could even reach $55 or higher in the next year, it added. The business newspaper said Time Warner is well-positioned to manage the challenges of softer advertising and slowing subscriber growth, as well as growing competition from the Internet. It could also benefit from the company's recent settlement with News Corp ( NWSA.O ) over programing fees, Barron's said. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
