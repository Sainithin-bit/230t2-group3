 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The head of Citigroup Inc in Japan is returning to New York after overseeing the sale of assets in Japan to help it repay the U.S. government for its bailout during the financial crisis, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 In an article posted on its website, the Journal said the executive, Douglas Peterson, will be succeeded by Darren Buckley, head of Citibank Japan Ltd. Officials at Citigroup were not immediately available to comment. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
