 SEOUL  (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc, the world's No. 2 TV brand, said on Sunday it aimed to increase its global market share in LCD TVs to 15 percent this year from 11 percent last year by boosting unit sales by 54 percent. 

 South Korea-based LG confirmed its 2010 sales target for liquid crystal display (LCD) TVs at 25 million units, as announced in September, and added the goal included 7 million high-end models featuring light emitting diode (LED) backlights. LG, which competes with bigger home rival Samsung Electronics and Japanese makers such as Sony Corp and Sharp Corp, sold 16.2 million LCD TVs in 2009. LG also kept its goal to sell 4 million plasma TVs in 2010 with a focus on larger sets. Samsung, the world's biggest TV maker, also unveiled on Thursday an ambitious sales goal for this year, at 35 million LCD TVs and 4 million plasma TVs. While the growth is slowing in plasma TVs due to tough competition with LCD models, the market for plasma TVs larger than 50 inches is expected to grow 15 percent this year, according to LG. For Blu-ray players, LG aims to sell 2.5 million units in 2010, up from one million sold in 2009. (Reporting by Rhee So-eui; Editing by  Alex Richardson )
