 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) multibillion-dollar acquisition of the Smith Barney wealth management business was supposed to help it soften the blow of weak trading quarters, but the firm is just as likely as rival Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) to report dismal third-quarter results. 

 Debt and equity underwriting profits for both banks are expected to be underwhelming in their quarterly reports later this month, and institutional trading volume was likely low. Analysts have been lowering their earnings estimates for the investment banks in recent weeks. Both firms are likely to see big declines in profits. (For a graphic previewing the firms' earnings, see:  link.reuters.com/zer47p ) The fact that both banks are suffering equally may call into question some of the rationale for Morgan Stanley's buying a controlling stake in Citigroup Inc's ( C.N ) Smith Barney wealth management business, analysts said. That 2009 deal cost Morgan Stanley about $3.1 billion, plus additional payments in the future as Morgan Stanley buys the rest of Citigroup's stake in the joint venture. At the time of the transaction, Morgan Stanley said it was looking to diversify as a cushion against hard times and regulatory changes. The thinking was, if institutional businesses are hit, retail ones may perform better because they tend to have a more consistent flow of client assets and fees. But it may be that having both institutional and retail trading is less of a boon than hoped as retail investors also shied away from markets. "You do have to give it some time to settle out, but I don't think they are there yet," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager with Greenwood Capital Management, which owns Morgan Stanley shares and Goldman debt. "Investors are impatient." Morgan Stanley, which declined to comment, is still working to combine the two businesses, and the weak economy does not help, analysts said. "In this environment, how much progress are you going to make?" said Roger Freeman, an analyst with Barclays Capital. "The volumes are too low to bring it all together." Morgan Stanley was hardly alone in its struggles. Goldman, which was working its way back from settling fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, had a difficult quarter as well. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S are predicting earnings per share of $2.51 for Goldman, compared to $5.25 a year earlier. Morgan Stanley was expected to report earnings of 16 cents per share compared to gains of 38 cents a year ago. Analysts with the best track records expect Morgan Stanley to earn 19 cents per share in the quarter, and Goldman to make $2.27. Morgan Stanley shares were trading at $25.10 on Thursday afternoon, down 14 percent for the year, while Goldman shares were selling for $150.41, down 10 percent for the year. Potential difficulties with wealth management may already be built into Morgan Stanley's share price, which trade at around 0.85 times their accounting value, or book value. Goldman's shares trade at about 1.2 times their book value. Some investors believe that differential is too high. WEALTH BET Morgan Stanley remade itself after the financial crisis in a way that Goldman did not. Morgan Stanley now gets as much as 40 percent of its revenue from wealth management, while Goldman is still largely dependent on its investment banking operations. Both institutional and wealth businesses were likely hurt by U.S. stock trading volume, which fell 27 percent from the second quarter, and 19 percent from last year, according to Sandler O'Neill data. It was the most depressed quarter for volume since just before the 2008 financial crisis rocked markets. "Trading volumes across the board were painfully slow during June, July and August," said Richard Handler, chief executive at Jefferies JEF.N, an investment bank serving mainly small and medium-sized companies. The bank reported a 47 percent decline in profits for the quarter ended August 31. In prior times, if customers were not trading much, a bank could profit by using its own money. But the Volcker Rule, part of the U.S. financial reform bill, is putting a stop to that. The rule bars banks from using more than 3 percent of their capital for trading for their accounts, or for investments in hedge funds or for private equity funds. Even though regulators have not yet hammered out the specifics of how the Volcker rule will work, banks are reluctant to make big proprietary trading bets, analysts said. One small bright spot in the quarter: there were more merger deals. Global M&A was up by more than a third from a year ago after a busy August bolstered the numbers. Goldman claimed the top spot globally and Morgan Stanley was third. But extra revenue from advising mergers is often not enough to offset weakness in other businesses. Underwriting revenue is unlikely to give much of a boost to results. In the third quarter, Goldman's global equity underwriting proceeds rose 21 percent from a year ago, but its global debt underwriting proceeds fell 15 percent. Morgan Stanley's equity underwriting proceeds were down 24 percent from a year ago, but its debt underwriting proceeds were up 28 percent. "Nobody had this slow environment in their model," said Anton Schutz, president of Mendon Capital Advisors. "It really surprised a lot of people how dead this quarter was."
