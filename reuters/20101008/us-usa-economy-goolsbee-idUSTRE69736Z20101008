 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Austan Goolsbee said on Friday the U.S. economy must grow faster to generate more jobs, and President Barack Obama's aid package for small business lending would do just that. 

 "We need to have faster growth and more employment growth in the private sector," Goolsbee told Reuters Insider following the release of the government's September employment report. The U.S. economy lost 95,000 jobs in September, much worse than economists had expected, although the private sector did manage to eke out 64,000 new positions. The president's small business bill, backed by industry groups, would set up a $30 billion fund that the government would invest in independent community banks to encourage lending to small firms.
