 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Some Bank of Japan policy board members warned about the adverse effects of expanding its cheap fund-supply tool, minutes from an August 30 emergency meeting showed on Friday, suggesting the central bank may be reluctant to enlarge the scheme as part of any further monetary easing. 

 The minutes also showed that some members said the BOJ needed to act pre-emptively in case downside risks materialized in the U.S. and European economies. At the August 30 meeting, the BOJ boosted the size of its fixed-rate fund supply operation to 30 trillion yen ($364.3 billion) from 20 trillion yen, bowing to government pressure for action to protect a fragile recovery by curbing the yen's rise. The decision was by an 8-1 vote, with board member Miyako Suda dissenting. "Some members noted the possibility that the expansion of the fixed-rate operation might undermine the proper functioning of the market and reduce the bank's ability to control the overnight call rate," the minutes said. The BOJ earlier this week surprised markets by cutting rates and vowing to buy 5 trillion yen worth of assets to provide fresh economic stimulus. It did not boost the size of the fixed-rate loan tool as some analysts had speculated. Suda said that easing effects from expanding the fund-supply tool should be limited, the minutes also showed, but some members argued that there was still room for interest rates to go down. The Bank of Japan's steps and yen-selling intervention last month by the government has done little to halt the yen's advance, with the dollar hitting a new 15-year low against the yen on rising expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will take aggressive easing steps. Some analysts say the BOJ may eventually revert to a full-blown quantitative easing, though such a move could add to growing global tensions over competitive currency devaluation and easing by central banks. How to nip a currency war in the bud will top the agenda for world leaders at the Group of Seven and IMF meetings starting on Friday. Underscoring the BOJ's concerns about the yen's gains, many members said at the September 6-7 monetary policy meeting they need to pay attention to the rising yen's impact in pushing down consumer prices, minutes from the meeting showed. The BOJ stood pat on monetary policy but vowed timely action when needed at the meeting. (Reporting by Rie Ishiguro; Editing by Edmund Klamann and  Nathan Layne )
