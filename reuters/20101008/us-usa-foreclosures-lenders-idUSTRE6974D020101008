 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp on Friday became the first U.S. bank to suspend foreclosures nationwide because of a controversy about the accuracy of legal documents submitted by mortgage lenders in home seizure cases. 

 The following is a list of lenders that have suspended some foreclosure proceedings: * Bank of America said it halted foreclosures and sales of foreclosed properties in all 50 U.S. states. The bank had halted some proceedings in 23 states where judges must approve foreclosures: Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wisconsin. * Ally Financial Inc's GMAC Mortgage last month said it had suspended some evictions in those 23 states where court approval for foreclosures is required. * JPMorgan Chase & Co said last month that it is delaying current foreclosure proceedings in 23 states while it conducts a review of its procedures. * The New York Times said on Thursday that PNC Financial Services Group Inc had declared a moratorium on the sale of foreclosed properties, suspending them for at least the next 30 days. The newspaper cited a memo to a title insurer from the bank. A PNC spokesman told Reuters that the bank was reviewing its mortgage servicing procedures but declined to elaborate.
