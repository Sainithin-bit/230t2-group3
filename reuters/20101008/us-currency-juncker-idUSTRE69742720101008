 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The issuers of the world's major currencies should make sure there are no "currency wars," because such conflict would have no winners, the chairman of euro zone finance ministers Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday. 

 "The main currencies (countries) should make sure that there is no room for a currency war," Juncker told Reuters in an interview. "It would only have losers. I cannot see any kind of winners in a currency war," he said ahead of a meeting of Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers, who are likely to discuss the latest developments on currency markets. Juncker said the G7 was losing importance as a forum for currency discussions to the G20 group of the world's biggest developing and developed economies, but neither forum seemed ideal to discuss exchange rates. "In the G20 framework there are too many people and too many interests to be able to find a currency arrangement," Juncker said. He noted there could be no meaningful discussion of economic and exchange rates issues without China, which is on its way to become the world's second biggest economy after the United States. "The ideal forum would be G7 plus China," Juncker said. Juncker, who is Luxembourg prime minister and chairs monthly meetings of the finance ministers of the 16 countries using the euro, in which the European Central Bank also participates, said there was no need for a new global currency arrangement. "I don't think so, we are in a totally different situation then we were with the Plaza Accord," Juncker said referring to the 1985 agreement between the governments of France, West Germany, Japan, the United States, and Britain, to depreciate the U.S. dollar in relation to the Japanese yen and German Deutsche Mark by intervening in currency markets. "There is a need for the representatives of the three or four major currencies to be in an ongoing discussion, I don't think the time is ripe for definite settlements," he said, adding the four major currencies were the U.S. dollar, the euro, the Japanese yen and Chinese yuan. Juncker reiterated that the Chinese yuan was significantly undervalued and said that also the dollar did not reflect the fundamentals of the U.S. economy. He said earlier on Friday that the euro was too strong at $1.4 in the first clear verbal intervention against the rising common currency since the strong gains of the euro in 2008. Many other countries around the world, seeking to help their exporters as they struggle to strengthen economic recovery, have intervened through words or deeds to weaken their units. China has been keeping its renminbi currency undervalued in a managed float, Japan intervened in currency markets to weaken the yen, and Switzerland, South Korea, Thailand and Colombia also moved to prevent their currencies from rising. Brazil doubled the tax on foreign purchases of its treasuries to stem the inflow of foreign capital boosting its real currency. Possibilities of further quantitative easing in the United States have depressed the dollar. But the euro zone has so far been relatively quiet about the euro's exchange rate. Juncker explained this was because exchange rates should not be discussed publicly. "The exchange rate is a shared matter between the Eurogroup and the ECB but the ECB does not have an exchange rate policy as such," he said. "I don't think the exchange rate is a matter for public debate. It would add to the nervousness of the markets and they are highly excited anyway. We have to discuss it intimately amongst the main people in charge of the major currencies," he said. (Reporting by Jan Strupczewski, Editing by Andrea Ricci)
