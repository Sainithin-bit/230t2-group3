 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials could wait until December before making any decision to ease monetary policy further if they feel they need more clarity on the outlook, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said on Friday. 

 "We did hit this soft patch in the economy but it's not so soft that it's obvious that you have to do a lot right now," Bullard told CNBC. "It's still possible to make the case that the economy will improve naturally."
