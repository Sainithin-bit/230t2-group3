 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager William Ackman is placing a big bet that Americans will start shopping again by taking large stakes in shares of retailer JC Penney Co Inc ( JCP.N ) and consumer goods manufacturer Fortune Brands Inc FO.N. 

 Ackman's firm, Pershing Square Capital, known for big investments in retailer Target Corp ( TGT.N ) and shopping mall operator General Growth Properties Inc ( GGP.N ), said it now owns roughly 39 million shares of common stock in JC Penney, according to a regulatory filing. Separately, the $7 billion hedge fund said in a regulatory filing that it had taken a 10.9 percent stake in Fortune Brands, which owns brands such as Jim Beam whiskey and Titleist golf balls and home supply brands such as MasterBrand Cabinets and faucet manufacturer Moen. After Friday's trading -- Penney and Fortune Brands shares both rose -- Ackman's stake in the two companies was now worth about $2 billion. In September, Ackman's flagship fund rose 3.4 percent after fees, leaving it up 6.5 percent for the year, a person familiar with the numbers said. In moving into JC Penney and Fortune Brands it would appear Ackman is targeting stocks he sees as undervalued and able to benefit from an economic recovery. In recent years, the 44-year-old investor with roots in a New York real estate dynasty has emerged as one of the hedge fund industry's most successful so-called activist managers, who often agitate for structural changes at companies that are underperforming their competitors. "In the case of JC Penney, they have some real estate space that is attractive," said Joe Kinahan, TD Ameritrade's chief derivatives strategist. "In Fortune Brands, it may be a play in that there are some strong individual brands under their corporate logo that may be worth more individually than as a sum of the total." The news of Ackman's two new activist stakes came as he was putting the finishing touches on another investment, which has proved to be one of his most successful. Mall operator General Growth Properties Inc ( GGP.N ) announced on Friday that Ackman will be the chairman of Howard Hughes Corp, a spinoff of the bankrupt company that will hold a portfolio of real estate assets. The spinoff will occur when General Growth emerges from bankruptcy next month. The General Growth deal has generated a profit of about $1 billion for New York-based Pershing, said a person familiar with the fund, as well as investors in the hedge fund. At JC Penney, Ackman, now the retailer's biggest investor, has already told the Plano, Texas-based company that he plans to look hard at the company's assets and financial conditions. Pershing Square declined to comment, while J.C. Penney and Fortune Brands could not be reached for comment. Ackman, who has a penchant for going after companies that own lots of real estate, has ventured into so-called Big Box retail shops before. Only last year, Ackman lost a bitter and expensive fight to join Target's board after he failed to convince management to adopt his real estate plan. JC Penney shares closed trading in New York up 2.7 percent at $32.49, having surged 60 percent in the last month, while rival Target was flat and Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) rose 1.9 percent. Fortune Brands climbed 7.4 percent to end at $55.85. At JC Penney, where Ackman began building the JC Penney stake in mid-August, he appears to also be building up an alliance with Vornado Realty Trust. Vornado declined to comment. Pershing Square took a break from buying JC Penney in early September and then resumed buying at the end of the month before finishing on Thursday. Most of those shares were accumulated when the retailer's stock was selling around $20. In the filing, Pershing Square said it also entered into over-the-counter derivatives contracts known as total return swaps, which are linked to the performance of an additional 602,600 common shares of JC Penney. Swaps were purchased from Credit Suisse Group CRP.N and Societe Generale. Ackman appears more willing than many other investors to step into companies where situations appear dire. For example he plunged into General Growth's stock as the mall operator was careening toward bankruptcy. Skeptics thought it was a mistake because most equity holders emerge with nothing when a company files for bankruptcy. But after looking at General Growth's balance sheet, Ackman correctly forecast stockholders would do well in a bankruptcy because the company had far more assets than debts and was merely suffering from a liquidity crisis. Now he is making an investment in JC Penney, a company that that has lost some market share to rivals such as department store Macy's Inc ( M.N ) and Kohl's and was slower to see sales start to recover from the recession than either of those chains. Penney's shoppers also tend to have a lower household income than those at Macy's and are more likely to turn to discount chains and dollar stores when budgets are tight.
