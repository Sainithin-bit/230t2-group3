 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Following are key quotes from global financial leaders on Friday at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings. 

 JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER YOSHIHIKO NODA ON CURRENCY "As I have always been saying, excessive volatility and disorderly currency moves are harmful for the economy and financial markets. Japan's stance is to take decisive action in the market when necessary. "I would like to explain (to G7 counterparts) that Japan does not intend to conduct long-term, massive intervention aimed at a certain (yen) level. ASKED ABOUT YEN'S RENEWED SURGE AFTER U.S. PAYROLLS "We are watching markets with grave interest. There's no change to our stance of taking decisive action, including intervention, when necessary." ARE CURRENT YEN MOVES EXCESSIVE? "That's something I would like to think about carefully." OLLI REHN, COMMISSIONER OF ECONOMIC AND MONETARY AFFAIRS FOR THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION, AT IIF CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON ON CURRENCY TALKS IN BRUSSELS: "In our discussions, we welcomed China's decision of the 19th of June to enhance exchange rate flexibility, although we noted, quite politely, that its potential has not been sufficiently exploited. The EU emphasized the importance of an orderly and broad-based appreciation of the renminbi in relation to China's main trading partners. That is not the only solution, but it is an essential part of the solution if we seriously want to rebalance global growth. It indeed should be our main objective" at the IMF meetings in Washington. ECB PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET ON AVOIDING TRADE WARS: "We must keep the spirit of cooperation that we had during the crisis... we must avoid the beggar thy neighbor policies that I see looming." GERMAN DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER JOERG ASMUSSEN AT A DISCUSSION AT THE PETERSON INSTITUTE IN WASHINGTON ON IMF REFORM: "We strike for a comprehensive reform-package." "I thing we are making progress, but we will probably need some more time." "We of course fully support what we have agreed in Pittsburgh, a shift of quota let's say by five to six percent." "We would say 24 seats strike the right balance between effectiveness and exclusivity." SOUTH AFRICAN FINANCE MINISTER PRAVIN GORDHAN ON CURRENCY EFFECTS OF U.S. QUANTITATIVE EASING: "Quantitative easing is about boosting the American economy. But what's happening is that money is finding its way to South Africa and other countries. It's massively appreciating our currency. That, then, forces us to do fiscal consolidation even faster in order to bring interest rates down. And so if you watch that cycle, it can have lots of undesired consequences." "The consequences of quantitative easing needs to be seen in a global context. It must be done in a coordinated way. The impact on certain developing countries and their currencies must be taken into account. A lower dollar and a lower euro is fine for all of you, but it's not fine for us. You are making us uncompetitive and we are the people sitting on the 25 percent unemployment and we need to work our way out of it." ON IMF QUOTA REFORMS: "The key objective of this exercise should be a recognition of the fact that we are trying to correct an historical imbalances in the governance of the institutions." "In line with that objective, we need to see the developed countries who have now been advantaged for 50 years and who are, in this context, the haves, to give up that which they have to give up in order to ensure that the have nots have better reputation...." "...it's important that the balance is not distorted considerations of self-interest only, but to ensure that we reach the larger objective at the end of the day." SIERRA LEONE CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR SAMURA MATHEW WILSON KAMARA on behalf of the African governors "We appreciate IMF's commitment for the protection of the quota shares of the poorest countries." "However, having lost quota shares across the board during the second round -- the 2008 Quota and Voice reforms -- by an average of 6-10 percent, another round of even deeper losses in quota shares would be detrimental to the prospects of our countries accessing Fund resources that they depend on to meet their financing needs." UK FINANCE MINISTER GEORGE OSBORNE ON CURRENCY: "On currencies, very specifically, I think we do need to move toward market-oriented exchange rates that reflect fundamentals, and I think the G20 and the IMF have a role in...helping to make that come about and addressing other imbalances." ASKED ABOUT PROSPECT OF A CURRENCY WAR "I haven't heard the colorful phrase you are using. But it is obviously a topic of discussion, but I've not heard yet any strong language. I've just heard a genuine desire to try and achieve some global coordination on this." INDONESIAN FINANCE MINISTER AGUS MARTOWARDOJO: ON LOCAL ECONOMY "For 2011, we are expecting 6.4 percent economic growth or higher....The inflation rate is stable and currently stands at 5.8 percent year-on-year, and we are expecting below this next year. We are also expecting the rupiah exchange rate to remain stable over the coming year." ON CURRENCY "Indonesia does not wish to see any escalations of tensions that could lead to a great (currency) war or anything that leads to protectionism. We believe that intraregional and interregional peace is crucial to sustaining growth. Indonesia supports a free-trade agenda and we will work against protectionism and to make our economy conducive to investment." EX-WHITE HOUSE ECONOMIC ADVISER CHRISTINA ROMER ON QUANTITATIVE EASING: "There's a lot of questions about quantitative easing and how it works and how communications policies work, but they need to be tried because this is still a crisis." CHINA'S CENTRAL BANK GOVERNOR ZHOU XIAOCHUAN IN TELEVISED BBC DEBATE: ON CURRENCY REFORM: "I think the difference is that for China we view it as gradualism, a gradual way, rather than shock therapy." "We still think China needs a market-based exchange rate regime with a reference to a package of the currencies ..." ON CHINESE INFLATION, BUBBLE RISKS: "We need to carry on our exchange rate reform." "In China, we know that the stimulus package was quite successful for dealing with the crisis but it may create some extent of inflation and also asset bubbles. I think that's for (the) central bank to worry about." IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN ON JOBS AND CAPITAL FLOWS: "Growth may not be enough if it's growth without jobs. In the coming decades 450 million people are going to enter the labor market, so we really face the risk of a lost generation." "It is understandable that some individual countries facing huge capital inflows want to resist this kind of volatility and source of instability and possible bubbles. So I am not blaming countries which try with one shot to limit the influence of their capital inflows, but it cannot be a long-lasting solution." ON THE NEED FOR FISCAL SUSTAINABLITY: "In the medium-term, all countries especially developed countries with high levels of debt have to go back to fiscal sustainability."
