 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Friday that excessive moves in currencies could not be overlooked. 

 "From the viewpoint of economic and monetary stability, we cannot overlook excessive currency moves," Kan told a plenary session in parliament's upper house. He also said he welcomed the Bank of Japan's monetary easing steps unveiled this week. The Japanese yen held near its 15-year peak against the dollar on Friday ahead of Group of Seven (G7) and IMF meetings later in the week. (Reporting by  Yoko Kubota )
