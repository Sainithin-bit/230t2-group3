 BLADENSBURG, Maryland  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Friday that private sector job growth is moving the economy in the right direction, but the government needs to explore ways to help state and local governments keep workers who provide vital services. 

 "These continuing layoffs of state and local government ... would have been even worse without the federal help that we've provided to states in the last 20 months," Obama said while visiting a family-owned small business in Maryland. (Reporting by  Patricia Zengerle , editing by Ross Colvin)
