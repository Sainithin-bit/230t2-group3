 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's loose monetary policy is in danger of "becoming ineffective," Mohamed El-Erian, the co-chief investment officer at bond fund PIMCO, said on Thursday. 

 The Fed, with a dual mandate of prompting full employment and price stability, has cut interest rates to the bone and bought $1.7 billion of assets to lower borrowing costs further. Markets expect the Fed to embark upon a new program of asset buying as early as its next meeting on November 2-3. "We're getting to the point where monetary policy is becoming ineffective," El-Erian said at an event sponsored by the Financial Times. El-Erian helps oversee more than $1.1 trillion in assets, mostly in fixed-income instruments. "We have a Fed that seems to be unwilling to stay on the sidelines," he said. El-Erian said the biggest story in the last 18 months is that fiscal and monetary responses have fallen short of policy expectations. Still, he doesn't think the Fed should raise interest rates. "When you have a fragile patient, you have to be careful," he said. El-Erian said he sees a 55 percent probability of the U.S. economy continuing to have sluggish growth, a 30 percent chance of a double-dip recession and a 15 percent chance that the economy will perform surprisingly well. Robert Rubin, co-chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, speaking on the same panel, said the probability is high that there will be slow and bumpy growth. A major new stimulus, however, would be counter-productive, as it would adversely affect business confidence and create uncertainty, said Rubin, a former U.S. Treasury secretary. For the U.S. economy to recover, it must get back on a sound fiscal path, have public investment and reform, Rubin said. (Editing by Dan Grebler)
