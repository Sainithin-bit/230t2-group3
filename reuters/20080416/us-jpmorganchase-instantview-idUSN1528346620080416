 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the third-largest U.S. bank, on Wednesday said first-quarter profit fell, hurt by write-downs for loans used to fund leveraged buyouts and by an increase in credit reserves. 

 Profit for the New York-based company fell to $2.37 billion, or 68 cents per share, from $4.79 billion, or $1.34, a year earlier. The net profit lagged analysts' estimates of 71 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Market reaction: JPMorgan Chase shares rose 2.1 percent in pre-market electronic trading to $43 a share. The following are reactions from industry analysts and other experts: RICK MECKLER, PRESIDENT LIBERTYVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "It's not as if there's great news coming out, but relative to what we've seen over the last six months there don't seem to be nearly the massive downside surprises, write-offs. So the news does provide the investor with some sense of stability and optimism. The market does look forward. "People who were expecting the financials to drop further aren't getting the type of negative news that can lead to a new round of sell-offs." RICHARD HUNTER, HEAD OF UK EQUITIES AT HARGREAVES LANSDOWN, LONDON "JPMorgan will help and of course on top of that we have Merrill and Citi to go. Given what we've seen over the last few months and the nervousness around anything bank-related, if we can come to the end of this week with a fairly clean bill of health, that will give markets a bit of a kick-start. In terms of nervousness, it's going to need some good numbers from a number of big U.S. banks -- and by the sounds of it JPMorgan might have made its contribution. All eyes on Merrill now. Hopefully the beginning of the end." PETER DIXON, ECONOMIST AT COMMERZBANK, LONDON "It's probably not a million miles from expectations. In terms of what it means for financials I think it just tells us there is more pain to come, it's going to leak out over the course of the next couple of weeks. Financials will continue to make write-downs and we can anticipate if U.S. firms are making write-offs, European firms will follow, although to a far lesser degree. By the end of the reporting season, we'll be a long way towards the full amount of write-offs which financial institutions will have to make. We're going to be knocking in the region of $300 billion by the end of the reporting season and under those circumstances, - how much downside are financial stocks going to put on equities going forward? The answer is probably a lot less than they have over the last six to nine months." MARTIN SLANEY, HEAD OF DERIVATIVES AT GFT GLOBAL MARKETS, LONDON "Overall it is a good set of figures. We were expecting around $0.68, $0.69 per share ... The forecast is a slight disappointment but overall given the current turmoil in the broader market, you've got to be happy with these figures. We are going to see this providing support to the market today." JONATHAN MONK, SENIOR PORTFOLIO STRATEGIST AT AERION FUND MANAGEMENT IN LONDON "The headline numbers look okay. The stock's trading at book value and is giving us a reasonable yield. JPMorgan is one of the winners in this credit crisis as it's one of the few banks with the liquidity to buy other banks."
