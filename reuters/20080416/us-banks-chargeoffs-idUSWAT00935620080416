 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan said on Wednesday that too many banks with distressed commercial real estate loan portfolios have been slow to aggressively identify and take action on their problem loans. 

 The agency is concerned about the reluctance of some banks to deal realistically with distressed commercial real estate loans on their books, Dugan said in remarks prepared for delivery to a financial group. "Right now, too many community bankers are having too hard a time coming to grips with the problems that have emerged in their commercial real estate portfolios," said Dugan, whose office regulates national banks.
