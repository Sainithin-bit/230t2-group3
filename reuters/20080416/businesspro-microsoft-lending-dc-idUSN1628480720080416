 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) plans to raise 
the amount it lends to small-business customers by as much as 
60 percent, as they find it increasingly tough to finance 
high-tech buys amid the global credit crunch, the Wall Street 
Journal reported on Tuesday. 

  But the plan, which comes at a time where the global credit 
market crisis has led to tighter lending conditions, makes the 
proposition risky for Microsoft.  The company has said that the number of defaulting loans 
will probably increase, the newspaper said.  Microsoft said that in 2008, it expects to issue $1.25 
billion in loans -- about 2 percent of its expected fiscal 2008 
revenue -- up from the $780 million it lent last year, adding 
that the move may help bolster the sales channel.  Microsoft offers loans between $100,000 and $500,000, which 
is a "sweet spot for small businesses," general manager of 
Microsoft Financing Brian Madison told the Journal.  Microsoft was not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman , Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
