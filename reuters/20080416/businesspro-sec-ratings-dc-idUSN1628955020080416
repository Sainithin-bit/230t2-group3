 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sen. Charles Schumer met the SEC 
chairman to urge the regulatory agency to step up its scrutiny 
of conflicts of interest that may have played a role in bond 
rating companies' misses on the U.S. housing market, the Wall 
Street Journal said on Wednesday. 

  Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox 
arranged the meeting to inform Sen. Schumer, a New York 
Democrat, on its progress in mulling new rules to better 
monitor rating companies, the Journal said, citing a person 
familiar with the matter.  During the meeting, Sen. Schumer asked the SEC to find out 
if Moody's Corp ( MCO.N ) changed ratings analysts on specific 
deals at Wall Street bond issuers' request, the report said.  Moody's was not immediately available for comment.  Rating companies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's have 
been criticized by regulators for fuelling the U.S. housing 
market boom and subsequent downfall by assigning overly 
optimistic ratings to risky securities and downgrading them 
soon after.  Since the subprime meltdown, the SEC has been scrutinizing 
credit raters' role in the financial crisis and whether they 
were influenced by companies and underwriters.  The SEC was not immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  David Holmes )
