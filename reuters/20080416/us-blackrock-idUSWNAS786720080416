 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Money manager BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) reported a higher first-quarter profit on Wednesday as assets under management grew, but earnings fell short of Wall Street estimates, hurt by market turmoil. 

 The largest publicly traded U.S. asset management company, however, was cautiously optimistic about its prospects for the rest of 2008, citing its diversified business and a record pipeline of new business. Shares of BlackRock, which has benefited from the credit crisis by winning new mandates to restructure stricken portfolios while itself steering clear of most risky investments, fell after the results even as other money managers enjoyed sharp gains in a strong overall market. But analysts saw signs of strength for BlackRock in the year ahead and some forecast trouble for other money managers when they report earnings next week. "BlackRock's numbers are almost a high watermark for the less diversified firms and the firms that have had more troubles. Their results most likely are only going to be worse," said Andrew Richards, an analyst at research firm Morningstar. First-quarter profit was down from the 2007 fourth quarter, but BlackRock said its new business pipeline stood at a record $105.8 billion as of April 14. Net income was $242 million, or $1.82 per share, up from $195.4 million, or $1.48 per share, in the year-ago first quarter. Excluding costs related to compensation expenses, the company earned $1.90 a share. Analysts' average earnings forecast was $2.00 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. BlackRock said the first-quarter earnings included a non-operating loss of 12 cents a share, net of controlling interest, due to losses it suffered in seed capital investments made in hedge funds and real estate. PERFORMANCE FEES BlackRock earned $2.43 a share in the 2007 fourth quarter. Assets under management, the main driver of revenue and profits at money management companies, rose to $1.364 trillion as of the end of March, up 18 percent from a year earlier, driven by acquisitions. In 2006 BlackRock acquired Merrill Lynch & Co's MER.Nfunds unit for $9.5 billion, the biggest purchase yet in the U.S. fund industry. And last year it bought the fund of funds business of Quellos Group LLC for $1.7 billion. Performance fees earned on its hedge funds tumbled to $42 million in the first quarter from $153 million in the fourth quarter. The firm said this was mainly "due to fewer performance fee contracts with performance measurement periods that concluded in the first quarter." The market turmoil caused BlackRock's investment net asset values to decline by $27.4 billion net of foreign exchange effect in the first quarter, the firm said. But this was offset by net new business of $35.2 billion, with net inflows mainly in its cash management business, it said. "Solid quarter but clearly the bar just got too high for (BlackRock)," Douglas Sipkin, analyst at Wachovia Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients. "The combination of weaker performance fees and weak non-investment income was too much to overcome to maintain the same level of outperformance." But Sipkin added that he was heartened by the firm's $106 billion business backlog. "Our core business is very strong and we are responding to these global markets that are experiencing some severe strains and difficulties," BlackRock Chairman and Chief Executive Laurence Fink said in an earnings conference call. BlackRock, which is managing a $30-billion portfolio for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tied to the Fed's rescue of investment bank Bear Stearns BSC.N by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), is in talks with "many other institutions" to provide solutions to the "impaired" assets they own, Fink said. Fink said the company was also in the running for two fixed income mandates worth more than $20 billion combined. BlackRock began as a bonds shop 20 years ago under co-founder Fink, but it has diversified over the years into equities and alternative investments and competes with Legg Mason ( LM.N ) and AllianceBernstein ( AB.N ), among others. Merrill is BlackRock's biggest shareholder with a 49 percent stake. PNC Financial Services Group ( PNC.N ) owns 34 percent of the firm. BlackRock has a market value of about $24 billion. BlackRock shares fell 1.55 percent to $202.00 early Wednesday afternoon, against a 1.04 percent rise for the Standard & Poor's asset management and custody banks index .15GSPAMCB. The shares are down 6.2 percent in 2008 versus the index's 13.5 percent drop. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek, John Wallace,  Richard Chang )
