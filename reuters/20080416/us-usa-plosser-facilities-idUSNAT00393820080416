 BLUE BELL, Pennsylvania  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's efforts to revive financial markets with special credit facilities are helping but it is too early to say it has all worked, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said on Wednesday. 

 Plosser, speaking to journalists after delivering a speech on education and prosperity, also said inflation was a worry. "Inflation is a concern, I've been saying that for some time," Plosser said. The Fed, which has cut rates aggressively to shore up the weakening economy, must be careful not to aggravate boom-bust cycles, said Plosser. He added that monetary policy that is too accommodative for too long can stoke inflation pressures. (Reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ; writing by  Burton Frierson , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
