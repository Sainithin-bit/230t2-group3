 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ) sees "solid opportunities" for acquisitions, especially in software and technology services, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on Wednesday. 

 "We're looking for acquisitions where we can put in intellectual-property scale," Loughridge told Reuters in an interview after International Business Machines Corp reported better-than-expected first-quarter results. "We're not buying resources or snap-on divisions" to increase revenue, "but intellectual-property that we can rapidly scale for our rapidly growing set of geographies," he added. "Generally, most intellectual property that's rapidly scalable is in fact in software." Loughridge declined to name companies that IBM may try to acquire.
