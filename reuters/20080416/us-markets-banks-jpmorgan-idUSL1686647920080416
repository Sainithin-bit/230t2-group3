 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Shares in European banks, hit hard by subprime-related writedowns, are likely to fall further and look set to underperform banks' fixed-income securities, JPMorgan said on Wednesday. 

 The industry is facing a period of adjustment that will lead to smaller balance sheets, increased credit losses and lower earnings," the U.S. investment bank said in a European credit research note focused on the financial sector. Some "secondary banks" might go under, likely causing problems in the wider sector, JPMorgan said. "The equity market appears to have set itself up for more disappointment," it said. "... The current rally is likely to be very similar to October last year and, therefore, likely to be relatively short lived." The DJ Stoxx European bank index .SX7P rose 20 percent between March 17 and April 2. It has given up some gains since and was trading 13 percent above the mid-March trough -- a 43-month low -- on Wednesday at 1045 GMT (6:45 a.m. EDT). In October, the index jumped almost 7.5 percent in just over a week but shed all those gains before the end of the month. "The equity market has gotten too optimistic over the short-term rally in spreads. Banks fund in cash, not CDS," JPMorgan said, pointing to credit default swaps (CDS), which are derivatives that price the risk of an issuer not repaying debts. The benchmark iTraxx Crossover CDS index  has fallen by almost 100 basis points from a record-high set in early March, a move seen by some market watchers as a sign of recovery in credit markets, on which banks rely for funding. But CDS indices spreads are not representative of bank funding levels, JPMorgan said, adding that "deep-seated problems" remained. FUNDING SQUEEZE "It is difficult to see how further losses and the intractable problem of repeated issuance against a vast backlog of prior deals and ABS (asset backed securities) will not cause the market to shut down again." "We see the real problems as being attritional, increased loss frequency and higher severity combined with a funding squeeze," JPMorgan said, citing as long-term problems continued failures and unwinding of banks' structured investment vehicles, commercial real estate, and banks' inability to finance ABS products outside of the central banks' lending facilities. For banks, equity capital covers only a small part of the balance sheet, with the vast majority of funding carried out through the issuance of various fixed-income securities. As the cost of equity has risen by between 150 and 200 basis points in the past 12 months, banks are under even greater pressure to seek debt rather than equity funding, JPMorgan said. But it voiced concern about investor appetite for credit issued by second-tier banks and those further below. "A common phenomenon in distressed markets is that investors remain most comfortable with companies they know best. This does not bode well for the national banking sectors that are effectively net importers of capital." JPMorgan said it expects greater state intervention and regulation. "This would likely be positive for credit investors to the detriment of equity investors as higher regulation will likely lead to more capital and liquidity requirements and reduced profitability." "Hence, we think equities will continue to underperform relative to bonds," JPMorgan said. (Reporting by  Peter Starck ; Editing by Paul Bolding)
