 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Johnson Controls Inc ( JCI.N ) said on Wednesday quarterly earnings rose 27 percent as revenue increased across its building controls, batteries and automotive parts businesses. 

 Johnson Controls, whose shares rose more than 4 percent, also backed its fiscal-year outlook for earnings and raised its revenue forecast even as the U.S. auto industry undergoes a sharp downturn. "We see the solid quarter and the reaffirmed guidance as positive given the difficult environment," Goldman Sachs analyst Patrick Archambault said in a note to clients. Calyon Securities analyst Mark Warnsman said in a note the results demonstrated the company's ability to largely avoid or offset a weak commercial real estate market, lower U.S. auto production and higher lead prices. Net income rose to $289 million, or 48 cents per share, in its second quarter from $228 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 10.8 percent to $9.41 billion. The earnings-per-share result exceeded the average analyst forecast by a penny and revenue exceeded the average forecast of $9.36 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Milwaukee-based Johnson Controls made acquisitions in its building controls and batteries businesses in recent years to reduce the impact from the struggles of U.S.-based carmakers in North America. It also restructured its auto parts business. Revenue from the auto interiors and seating business rose 2 percent to $4.6 billion in the quarter. Increased revenue in Europe and Asia/Pacific more than offset a drop in North America related to industry light vehicle production declines. Operating income at the auto unit rose 28 percent to $155 million due to price increases and cost cuts from restructurings, it said. Operating income in North America rose to $25 million from a $1 million loss a year earlier despite lower industry production. The company's diversity of business and diverse customer base in the automotive sector has set Johnson Controls apart from other suppliers that have struggled in recent years. Sales at its building controls business rose 11 percent to $3.3 billion and income rose 29 percent to $177 million due to global demand for products and services in nonresidential buildings to reduce energy use and greenhouse gases. Johnson Controls is not immune to the downturn in the U.S. auto sector or the U.S. housing sector though most of its building controls unit focuses on education, health care and government buildings, offices and service contracts. "While JCI's diversification likely cushions the impact of a commercial real estate slowdown, we believe that many investor concerns will not be firmly answered until 2009, leaving a multiple overhang on the stock," Lehman analyst Brian Johnson said in a note to clients. Battery unit sales rose 47 percent to $1.5 billion, mainly because of higher prices related to the pass-through of rising lead prices. Income rose 30 percent to $121 million. Johnson Controls forecast double-digit earnings and sales growth at the start of its fiscal year in October, long before most automakers and analysts began to cut U.S. auto industry 2008 sales and production outlooks, and economists began to forecast the United States as at or heading toward a recession. The company backed its fiscal-year earnings forecast of $2.45 to $2.50 per share from continuing operations and raised its revenue forecast by $1 billion to about $39 billion. Analysts expect fiscal-year earnings of $2.47 per share on revenue of $38.39 billion. Johnson Controls forecast third-quarter earnings per share of 74 cents to 76 cents from continuing operations and excluding the impact of a prolonged labor strike at a North American auto parts supplier. Analysts expect 75 cents. Johnson Controls shares were up $1.37, or 4.2 percent, at $34 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
