 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin told Congress on Wednesday that stimulus package checks taxpayers are due to receive soon should lift economic growth later in the year, but said the Fed has room to further cut interest rates if the economy needs another boost. 

 "I think it's worthwhile to see exactly how well the packages that have been passed work," Mishkin told the Senate Small Business panel. "The stimulus package is not going to kick in for a couple of months. We're hopeful that in fact it will help the economy get through this period of slow growth," he said in response to questions from lawmakers. "When we see what happens there, then we'll have a little bit better idea of what we might need to do in the future," he added. The Fed has cut interest rates by 3 percentage points to 2.25 percent since September and has acted to provide ready access to liquid funds for banks and financial institutions as a sharp housing downturn and a severe credit shortfall have pushed the economy toward a recession, with spillover effects around the world. Mishkin told lawmakers the U.S. central bank has room to lower interest rates if needed by the economy. "Clearly you can't get interest rates below zero ... but we actually have interest rates now at 2-1/4 percent and clearly there is some room to lower them if it's needed," Mishkin told the Senate Small Business Committee when asked if the Fed faced limits on how much it could do with monetary policy. "Furthermore, we are continually looking at steps to make the markets function better and I think we've been quite creative in terms of the steps we've taken so far, but in fact we will continue to look at the steps that we can take to in fact make the functioning of the financial markets get back to a more normal situation," he added. The U.S. central bank is expected to cut benchmark borrowing costs again at its April 29-30 meeting, perhaps by as much as a half-percentage point. Still, central bank officials have cautioned recently that Fed interest rate cuts work with a lag on the economy and that they are also nervously eyeing elevated inflation. For all of the central bank's efforts to boost economic activity and release snags to credit, market participants had a role to play in stability by coming clean about losses and bad assets and moving on, Mishkin said. "What the Federal Reserve can do, is ... by restoring confidence in what will happen to the economy in the future, (is) help make it easier for the market to do its job," he said. "But the reality is that financial markets have to figure out what the value of assets are, where the losses are," he added. Mishkin said small businesses will find it harder and costlier to borrow money as financial market turmoil persists. "Market stresses are likely to continue to weigh on lending activity in the near future," he told the panel. The Fed governor said that although the Fed's rate cuts and liquidity measures had helped stabilize financial markets, markets remain under considerable stress. While the vast majority of U.S. banks remain well capitalized, which should support lending, credit conditions have clearly tightened for small businesses since last fall, Mishkin said. "Credit appears to be generally available but at a higher cost," he said. However, a lingering concern is that declining real estate values may make it harder for small businesses to borrow and may chill the willingness of banks to make loans, Mishkin said.
