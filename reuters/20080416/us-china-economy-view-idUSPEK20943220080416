 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's annual GDP growth eased to 10.6 percent in the first quarter from 11.2 percent in the last three months of 2007 under the impact of domestic tightening steps, fierce winter weather and weakening export demand. 

 However, growth remained in double figures, where it has been since 2003. And with consumer inflation still at an elevated 8.3 percent in the year to March, economists say Beijing will be wary of relaxing policy despite a darkening global outlook.  **************************************************************** KEY POINTS: -- Economists had expected GDP to rise 10.0 percent. COMMENTARY: GRACE NG, ECONOMIST WITH JPMORGAN IN HONG KONG, IN A NOTE TO  CLIENTS: "Looking ahead, we have fine-tuned our 2008 full-year GDP growth forecast to 10.5 percent (previous forecast: 10.3 percent), compared with the upwardly revised 11.9 percent growth in 2007. "On the inflation front, we now look for headline CPI inflation to average at about 5.8 percent for the full year. We hold on to the forecast that there would be three interest rate hikes this year, but the rate moves would most likely be implemented during 2H08 "On the currency, we look for the CNY to reach 6.3 against the USD by the end of the year." KELVIN LAU, ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK IN HONG KONG: "The headline GDP number was slightly on the strong side and given that we had the snowstorm and tightening measures in the first quarter this will give reason for the government to continue with its tightening bias. "Industrial production rebounded to the December/January level, so that could be another factor to support tightening to try and achieve slower growth in this sector. "Retail sales growth in March was a decent number, 21.5 percent, and back to pre-snowstorm growth rates. "This does underpin a positive story that even though exports might slow and investment might slow due to tightening measures, consumption will be able to take up some of the slack." YIPING HUANG, CHIEF ASIA ECONOMIST WITH CITIGROUP IN HONG  KONG: "The GDP number is a little bit higher than what we expected. We expected 10 percent. But I think the story remains the same -- the economy is slowing as a result of weakening external demand, and that's likely to continue. "But inflation remains a challenge; it remains at a very high level. "In the short term they will probably want to continue to tighten, for instance monetary policy. But we don't expect a lot of outright rate hikes -- it's more like controlling the liquidity, managing the reserve requirement and so on. "It's a lot more about managing inflation expectations, when it's mainly contributed by food prices. It's much more important to prevent the spread of inflation. "But I suspect that within several months, the growth risks might overtake the inflation risks." "We also need to be aware of the downside risks, as we're already seeing that in terms of growth. When that comes through more forcefully, the government may actually shift the policy bias quickly. "We see their fiscal policy is already neutral, or what they call prudent, policy. I suspect it can change quickly to, for instance, an expansionary fiscal policy if needed." ZHANG SHIYUAN, ANALYST WITH SOUTHWEST SECURITIES IN BEIJING: "First-quarter GDP growth is better than expected. Economic growth in the second quarter will mainly depend on how the property market performs. "Retail sales have maintained fast growth and that will continue; however, export growth will slow down in the second quarter mainly due to weakening demand from the United States. As you can see, many companies have already felt the pinch. "Pressure for an interest rate increase is rising, mainly due to high investment and the PPI, not because of CPI. "The CPI will drop in April, probably below 8 percent. "I'm afraid that grain prices will edge up in the months to come, as global supply is tight and domestic consumers may resort to panic purchasing in expectation of high prices even though China's grain output seems not to have been affected by the bad weather." LIN SONGLI, ANALYST WITH GUOSEN SECURITIES IN BEIJING: "The 10.6 percent GDP growth was slightly higher than expected because the market was quite concerned about a dramatic economic downturn. "Consumer inflation has eased, and CPI growth rate in coming months will continue to drop. However, inflationary pressure will remain great, and the full-year CPI is expected to be 6 percent. "It's almost impossible now for the central bank to raise interest rates in the short term. In fact, the real policy aim has shifted to preventing an economic hard landing instead of avoiding economic overheating."

MARKET REACTION: -- The yuan was trading at 6.9961 per dollar at 3:10 a.m. EDT, compared with 6.9973 before the figures were released. -- The Shanghai stock exchange closed down 1.69 percent, compared with a drop of 0.06 percent before the data. BACKGROUND: -- Since 1978, China has averaged GDP growth of close to 10 percent a year, making it the world's fourth-largest economy; economists expect it to leapfrog third-placed Germany this year. -- Investment and exports have driven the expansion in recent years, prompting concerted government efforts to rebalance the economy by spurring consumption and penalizing low-end exporters as well as resource-intensive, polluting industries. -- To cap inflation and prevent overheating, Beijing raised interest rates six times in 2007 and has already lifted banks' required reserves twice in 2008 after 10 increases last year. The central bank has also resorted to direct orders to banks to curb lending, which have succeeded in slowing money and credit growth. -- Plentiful cheap money is at the heart of the imbalances preoccupying policy makers. Many economists say China needs to let the yuan rise even more quickly than it has in recent months to address the balance-of-payments excesses that are inundating the economy with cash and helping to stoke inflation.
