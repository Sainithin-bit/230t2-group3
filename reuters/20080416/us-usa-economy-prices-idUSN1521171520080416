 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in March, slightly less than expected as cheaper clothing helped hold down overall prices despite a modest rebound in energy prices, a Labor Department report on Wednesday showed. 

 The rise in March prices was less than the 0.4 percent gain that Wall Street economists had forecast. Prices were flat in February. So-called core consumer prices that exclude food and energy were up 0.2 percent - in line with expectations - after also being unchanged in February. U.S. stock futures edged up on the better-than-anticipated prices data as investors bet there was more room for the Federal Reserve to keep cutting interest rates to try to spur a slowing economy. The dollar lost ground on the prospect of more rate cuts. Energy prices gained 1.9 percent in March after declining 0.5 percent in February. Costlier energy has been a major factor in rising concern about potential inflation, but it did not show through strongly in the March data. Prices for apparel dropped for a second straight month, down 1.3 percent after falling 0.3 percent in February. The department said the March decline was the largest since September 1998, possibly a sign that retailers are being forced to cut prices to lure hard-pressed consumers into stores. Housing costs were up 0.4 percent in March after gaining 0.2 percent in February. But food and beverage prices rose by a smaller 0.2 percent last month after a 0.4 percent February pickup. The department said that in the first quarter this year, overall consumer prices rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.1 percent, down from the 4.1 percent rise posted for all of 2007. Core prices in the first quarter gained at a 2 percent rate, under the 2.4 percent rise for all of 2007. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville , editing by Joanne Morrison)
