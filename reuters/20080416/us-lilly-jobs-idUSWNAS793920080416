 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) said on Wednesday it will cut as many as 500 jobs as it streamlines manufacturing operations in its hometown of Indianapolis. 

 The voluntary exit program is expected to mainly affect workers in manufacturing, along with a small portion in selected areas of research and development. The drugmaker said it will take a yet-to-be-determined charge in the second quarter. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
