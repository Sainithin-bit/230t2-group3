 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday despite a weakening U.S. economy, helped by strong revenue from technology services and consulting, sending its shares higher. 

 First-quarter net income rose 26 percent to $2.32 billion, or $1.65 per share, from $1.84 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 11 percent to $24.5 billion from $22 billion. Currency gains contributed seven percentage points to revenue growth. Analysts, on average, expected profit of $1.45 per share and revenue of $23.7 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. IBM, the world's largest technology-services company, said in February that strong fourth-quarter growth in services contracts lasting a year or less was paying off. IBM said those benefits gave it more confidence in its U.S. business, even as other technology companies were seeing weaker spending amid concern over the U.S. economy. IBM shares, seen as a safe haven by many investors, have added almost 10 percent this year compared with the Dow Jones Industrial index's  .DJI  6.8 percent decline and the Nasdaq Composite Index's  .IXIC  14 percent drop through Tuesday. IBM trades at about 14 times expected 2008 earnings per share compared with about 13 for competitor Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ). (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
