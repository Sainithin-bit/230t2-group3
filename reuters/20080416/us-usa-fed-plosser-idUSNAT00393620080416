 BLUE BELL, Pennsylvania  (Reuters) - Inflation is a concern in the United States even though the economy has slowed so much that it "feels pretty bad" regardless of whether a recession is declared, a top Federal Reserve official said on Wednesday. 

 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser said growth prospects were weak and the slowdown would have consequences for everything from jobs to production. Despite the weakness, Plosser said inflation is still a worry, posing risks for the Fed, which has sought to shore up the economy with aggressive interest rate cuts. "Inflation is a concern, I've been saying that for some time," said Plosser, speaking to journalists after delivering a speech on education and prosperity. The Fed, which has cut rates aggressively to shore up the weakening economy, must be careful not to aggravate boom-bust cycles, said Plosser. He added that monetary policy that is too accommodative for too long can stoke inflation pressures. Plosser was one of two policy-makers who voted against the Fed's aggressive 75-basis-point rate cut on March 18, for fear of fueling inflation. Along with Dallas Fed chief Richard Fisher, he preferred a smaller reduction. Plosser's remarks on Wednesday came on a day when data showed annual inflation remained at an elevated rate of 4.0 percent in March and the price of oil hit a record high, topping $115 a barrel. "In terms of the price of crude oil, it is extraordinarily high," Plosser said. "It seems to defy gravity in some respect. It keeps going up." This is unlikely to help broader sentiment on the economy, which many analysts say is headed for recession, if not already there. Plosser said he did not know whether the current downturn would be determined to be a recession, but in some respects that might not matter. "It may not be a recession but it feels pretty bad," he added. Other data released on Wednesday showed U.S. home building skidded to a 17-year low last month, the latest reminder that the current economic troubles trace their origins back to the bursting of the housing bubble.

Plosser said the economic environment shows the need for improved financial literacy since many homeowners fell prey to abusive lending practices in the recent subprime mortgage debacle while others borrowed more than they could afford. "In making these choices, they were sometimes misled by abusive lending practices that rendered the terms and conditions of the loan agreements they signed far from transparent," Plosser said in his speech.
