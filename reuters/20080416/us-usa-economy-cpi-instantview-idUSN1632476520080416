 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer prices rose 0.3 percent in March, slightly less than expected as cheaper clothing helped hold down overall prices despite a modest rebound in energy prices, a Labor Department report on Wednesday showed.
    

 U.S. home building projects started in March fell by 11.9 percent to a lower-than-expected annual rate while building permit activity, a sign of future construction plans, was off 5.8 percent, a government report on Wednesday said.
    KEY POINTS: CPI: * The rise in March prices was less than the 0.4 percent gain that Wall Street economists had forecast. * Prices were flat in February. So-called core consumer prices that exclude food and energy were up 0.2 percent - in line with expectations - after also being unchanged in February. * Energy prices gained 1.9 percent in March after declining 0.5 percent in February. * Costlier energy has been a major factor in rising concern about potential inflation, but it did not show through strongly in the March data. HOUSING: * The Commerce Department said housing starts set an annual pace of 947,000 units in March, lower than the 1.02 million expected by economists. * The February starts figure was revised upwards to 1.075 million from the 1.065 million originally reported. * Building permits fell by 5.8 percent to an annual rate of 927,000, the slowest pace since a 916,000 rate set in April 1991. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast March permits at 970,000 after the 984,000 rate of February.  COMMENTS:  MIKE POND, TREASURY AND INFLATION-LINKED STRATEGIST, BARCLAYS  CAPITAL IN NEW YORK: "There really hasn't been a huge (bond market) reaction here. We didn't get any big surprises. Short TIPS break evens are up between 1 and 3 basis points since the release. "Nominal Treasuries have had a little bit of a turnaround from a sell-off to a bit of a rally here because this is a relatively subdued report on the core side. It doesn't create any concern from the Fed's perspective at the core inflation level. "The Fed don't appear concerned about the core at this point because they expect slower growth to eventually bring inflation down. "We don't think that's the case. We think inflation pressures in the United States are coming from strong global demand for food and energy."  STEPHEN MALYON, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL,  TORONTO: CPI: "The CPI was bang on expectations, I suppose the market is likely to focus on the housing starts number. The traders might actually be a little bit relieved that CPI came in as expected following yesterday's upside surprise in the producer price index. HOUSING: "The market has in some way become comfortable with weak housing numbers. However, a recovery in the housing market is a necessary precondition for the broader economy to eventually strengthen. Even though you might be comfortable or familiar with housing market weakness that does not necessarily equate to being comfortable with accelerating housing market weakness. These housing starts suggest that the pace of decline is intensifying, which is the last thing the U.S. economy needs right now."  RICHARD DEKASER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIONAL CITY CORP.,  CLEVELAND: HOUSING STARTS: "It's a dismal report. It's a lot weaker than I had expected. It challenges the proposition that construction has scraped bottom. March was an agreeable month weather-wise. Capital market turmoil could push this activity off to the side. Pessimism in the housing market continues to push down starts." CPI: "The core rate came in below consensus because there is over-estimation on the energy front. We had strong seasonals for gasoline in the month of March. Besides energy, it's a relatively benign and non-threatening report. On the other hand, it's becoming increasing difficult to  shrug off rising energy costs due to price volatility. In spite of a benign core reading, the overall increase will persuade the Fed to be less aggressive in easing rates."  T.J. MARTA, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW  YORK: "With foreclosures rising, inventory overhang is likely to continue to depress housing starts and could force it lower in coming months."  ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE CORP, BOSTON: "I think if you ask the average person out there, they'd say they're seeing a lot more inflation than that in their everyday lives. I don't know much the market really should put faith in these figures. There are so many assumptions I think are questionable these days. "On the face of it, it's a little bit of a positive number. But I have this fear, and I bet a lot of other people do, that one of these days we're going to suddenly see a big CPI number, that will catch up with all the inflation that people are feeling and seeing and paying for in their everyday lives. This may not be getting captured here. "If the market wants to take this verbatim, then it should be good for the markets today. But I don't think this number, even on the face of it, can change the Fed from cutting more."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare losses. * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar extends looses, euro hits new record high against dollar. * STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures add to gains. * RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures steady at lower levels.
