 ZURICH  (Reuters) - The world's top bank regulator launched a crackdown on Wednesday in response to the global credit crunch, saying it aimed to raise the costs of complex debt securities and risky practices. 

 The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision spelled out new regulations, saying it would attempt to close the gaps in the global rules framework that were exposed by billions of dollars of shock losses in the financial crisis. The committee, which unites the world's biggest banking regulators, will propose higher capital charges for handling asset backed securities, close loopholes that let banks harbor risks out of regulatory sight and raise costs for holding volatile trading positions. The moves will undoubtedly raise the cost of banking, including issuing and owning structured, asset backed securities, but also for trading overall. "Banking will become less profitable but sounder because profits many times do not go hand in hand with soundness," said Luis Maglanoc, global head of credit research at bank Unicredit. The committee also aims to direct banks towards safer sources of liquidity to keep their day-to-day operations flowing after several banks, including Northern Rock ( NRKx.L ) in Britain and Bear Stearns BSC.N in the United States, suffered crises that threatened to derail the global financial system. "Supervisors cannot predict the next crisis but they can carry forward the lessons from recent events to promote a more resilient banking system that can weather shocks," said Basel Committee Chairman Nout Wellink in a statement. Leading G7 governments have pushed for tighter regulations after hundreds of billions of dollars in bank losses that have tightened credit conditions for businesses and individuals and threaten to push the U.S. economy into a recession. Over the weekend, the Financial Stability Forum, an umbrella group of central banks and bank supervisors, urged greater regulation in a clear rebuff to banks. Banks have lobbied hard for regulators to take a light approach, saying they aim to put their own houses in order first. Analysts said the moves would force the banking industry into sound practices where they were unwilling before. It would also close loopholes that had let banks perform regulatory arbitrage, which means structuring or holding risky investments in ways that put them below the radar screen of regulators. "You just can't rely on the banks to do it themselves," Maglanoc said. "There are things the regulators really have to do (and) one of those things is stricter capital requirements." NOT ALONE Britain's financial watchdog, the Financial Services Authority, is also reviewing its liquidity regime and has said banks need to carry out tougher tests to ensure they can withstand shocks and draw up better contingency plans. It has also highlighted the regulation of liquidity as one of its failings in the Northern Rock debacle and a priority for reform. The UK bank remained solvent after August's crisis, but was unable to fund its lending. In a discussion paper late last year, the FSA said banks should update regulators more regularly on their liquidity position and should also test their liquidity "insurance", including what assets they hold as treasury and whether promises from other banks can really be called upon. The FSA is due to issue its next statement on liquidity next month, including industry comments on its proposals, ahead of a full consultation paper this summer. A spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the Basel proposals. The Basel Committee's members include Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and United States.
