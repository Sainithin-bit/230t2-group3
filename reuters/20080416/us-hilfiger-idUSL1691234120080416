 LONDON  (Reuters) - Fashion company Tommy Hilfiger, owned by private equity firm Apax Partners APAX.UL, will look again at a flotation at the end of 2009, its Chief Executive Fred Gehring said on Wednesday. 

 The brand, spanning women's, men's and children's wear to watches and accessories, in January shelved plans for a listing on the Amsterdam stock exchange blaming volatile market conditions. At that time, media reports quoting company sources valued the company at 2 billion euros ($3.2 billion) to 3 billion. Gehring, speaking to Reuters at the launch party for a new Tommy Hilfiger branded fashion and music website, said given market volatility plans to list were still "on a very high shelf". The company would look again "at the end of 2009", he said. (Reporting by  Rachel Sanderson ; Editing by  David Holmes )
