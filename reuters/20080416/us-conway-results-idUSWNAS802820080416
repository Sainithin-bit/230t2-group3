 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Trucking and logistics company Con-way Inc ( CNW.N ) said on Wednesday that its quarterly net profit was down, citing poor weather conditions and a lackluster business climate. 

 The San Mateo, California-based company reported first-quarter net income from continuing operations of $22.5 million or 47 cents per share, down from $24.9 million or 51 cents per share a year earlier. (Reporting by  Nick Carey  and  David Bailey )
