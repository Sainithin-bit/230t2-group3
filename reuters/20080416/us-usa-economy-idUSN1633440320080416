 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Home building skidded to a 17-year low last month while consumer prices rose slightly less than expected, leaving policy-makers room to cut benchmark interest rates further to ward off a housing-led slowdown. 

 The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that housing starts dropped 11.9 percent in March to an annual rate of 947,000 units, the slowest pace since March 1991 and well below the 1.02 million economists had expected. Separately, the Labor Department said consumer prices rose 0.3 percent last month, below the 0.4 percent forecast, after a flat reading in February. Stripping out food and energy, core prices, which also held steady in February, rose an even milder 0.2 percent, restrained by a big drop in the cost of clothing. The data underlined strains that U.S. consumers face, squeezed by rising prices at the gasoline pump and in food stores, only partly offset by cheaper clothes, while prices they get for their homes fall and house-building declines. "These housing starts suggest that the pace of decline is intensifying, which is the last thing the U.S. economy needs right now," said Stephen Malyon, senior currency strategist at Scotia Capital in Toronto. U.S. stock prices shot higher and U.S. government bond prices moved lower as investors saw the price data as leaving more room for the Federal Reserve -- U.S. central bank -- to keep cutting interest rates to try to spur a slowing economy. The dollar lost ground on the prospect of more rate cuts, with the euro reaching a record high. In afternoon trade, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was ahead 160 points and the Nasdaq composite index  .IXIC  was up nearly 50 points, aided by favorable results from Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and other blue chips. A third report on Wednesday, from the Fed, showed industrial output unexpectedly rose in March as higher production by utilities offset weakness in manufacturing. The plunge in new-home building was eye-catching, however. "Construction activity is falling off a cliff," said real estate analyst Mike Larson of Weiss Research in Jupiter, Florida. The fall in clothing prices implies that retailers are being forced to cut prices to try to lure hard-pressed consumers, whose budgets are stretched by soaring gasoline prices and food costs, into stores. The Fed has lowered benchmark borrowing costs by three percentage points since mid-September, trying to ward off spreading weakness from the deep housing downturn and a related drying up of credit. The data also pointed to a continuing deterioration in the housing sector as building permits fell 5.8 percent to the lowest since April 1991, when the economy was in recession. ENERGY PRICE PRESSURES The report on consumer prices showed rising energy prices continuing to exert upward pressure on overall inflation. Energy prices shot up 1.9 percent in March. The cost of gasoline, which hit record highs last month, rose 1.3 percent. Financial markets saw the consumer price data as providing greater scope for the Fed to lower interest rates but analysts cautioned it did not mean price pressures were easing. "Let's not kid ourselves, inflation is not tame," said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisors Inc in Holland, Pennsylvania. Prices fell for specific items like cars and computers that are bought infrequently while gasoline and food prices steadily rise. The Fed's anecdotal Beige Book summary of regional economic conditions reflected similar concerns. It found conditions were weakening across much of the nation while inflationary pressures were building. Apparel prices slid 1.3 percent, helping restrain both overall and core inflation, but a range of other costs moved higher. The housing-cost gauge moved up 0.4 percent, reflecting a sharp gain in utility costs. A measure of owner-occupied housing costs not affected by energy rose 0.2 percent. FACTORY ACTIVITY SLUGGISH Separately, the Fed said output at the nation's mines, factories and utilities rose 0.3 percent in March after a downwardly revised drop of 0.7 percent in February. Wall Street economists had forecast a 0.1 percent decline after February's previously reported 0.5 percent fall. Utility output climbed 1.9 percent after a 3.6 percent drop in February, while manufacturing production rose 0.1 percent after a 0.5 percent fall. "Factory output was held down by a large decline in the output of motor vehicles and parts. A shortage ... that resulted from a strike at a parts manufacturer idled a number of motor vehicle assembly plants," the Fed said in the report, referring to the seven-week-old walkout at American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings ( AXL.N ). The strike, which has partly or completely idled some 30 U.S. auto plants, lay behind a 5.4 percent fall in motor vehicle output. Excluding motor vehicles, factory production rose 0.4 percent. The capacity utilization rate, a gauge of how busy the industry is, edged higher to 80.5 percent from 80.3 percent, still well below levels that would be considered inflationary.
