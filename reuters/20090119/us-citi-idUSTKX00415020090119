 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup said it is still committed to its Japanese brokerage, Nikko Cordial Securities, denying media reports that the U.S. bank is actively looking to sell off its Japanese securities business. 

 "Citi remains committed to maximizing the value of (Nikko Cordial) over the next few years," a Tokyo-based spokesman for the U.S. bank said. Separately, a spokesman for Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Japan's largest bank, said it was not in talks to buy the securities firm, also denying some media reports. (Reporting by David Dolan.)
