 PARIS  (Reuters) - French President Nicolas Sarkozy said on Monday the government would not offer any more assistance to companies in the current financial crisis unless the beneficiaries made firm commitments in return. 

 Speaking to union and employer representatives, Sarkozy said that if the state were to make taxpayers' money available to support businesses, "the factories have to stay in France." (Reporting by Emmanuel Jarry; Writing by  James Mackenzie )
