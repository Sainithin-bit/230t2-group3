 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese authorities have spent 800 billion to 900 billion yen ($11.7 billion) in the foreign exchange market to stem the yen's rise, news agency Jiji reported on Thursday, quoting a market source. 

 After some verbal warnings earlier this week Japan intervened in the currency market for the first time since March after the yen inched closer to a record high against the dollar on Monday. The record amount Japan spent for intervention is the 2.1 trillion yen it used in September.
