 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States did not support Japan's move overnight to intervene in currency markets to tame the yen's rise, a U.S. official said on Thursday. 

 The official declined to elaborate on the statement and did not comment on a call by Japanese Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano for talks on currency moves among policymakers from the Group of Seven or Group of 20 economies. Japanese authorities on Thursday intervened in the currency market for the first time since March as the yen threatened to reach a record high against the dollar. Unlike the last time Japan stepped into the foreign exchange market in March, when it intervened jointly with other G7 countries in response to a massive earthquake, the latest intervention was a solo effort.
