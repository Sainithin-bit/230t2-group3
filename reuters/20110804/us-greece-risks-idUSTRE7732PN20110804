 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's Socialist government faces tough months ahead as it struggles to implement unpopular austerity reforms, keep disgruntled lawmakers on board and convince an angry public that the belt-tightening is necessary. 

 It received welcome breathing space when the European Union agreed to a new bailout in July, but a dwindling majority in parliament and an escalating crisis in the euro zone further complicate the situation, with the possibility of autumn snap elections. Thousands of anti-austerity protesters who rallied for weeks outside parliament chanting "Thieves, Thieves!" have now left the square as summer temperatures soar but have warned they will be back in September, while a weeks-long taxi strike serves as a reminder of widespread discontent. Following are the main political risks ahead: UNRULY LAWMAKERS, TOUGH REFORMS The EU and the International Monetary Fund, who saved Greece from bankruptcy last year through a 110-billion-euro bailout, have criticized it for being too slow to implement reforms. They say it must step up its efforts -- in particular to tackle tax evasion and sell state assets -- if it is to keep getting aid. But the government will have its work cut out to conform, with street protests likely to return in September and a narrow majority in parliament, where some ruling party lawmakers are uneasy about key measures including privatizations. The government struggled in June to persuade its MPs to back a deeply unpopular package of tax hikes, spending cuts and privatizations required by the EU and the IMF to keep funding Greece. Its majority in the 300-seat parliament dropped to 154 seats after one deputy was expelled for voting against the plan. In a reshuffle decided in June to quell discontent among the ruling party ranks, Prime Minister George Papandreou appointed Evangelos Venizelos as his new finance minister. He is a party heavyweight whom analysts say may help convince lawmakers to toe the line. What to watch: - Will the government manage to implement reforms fully? A strike started in July by taxi drivers against the liberalization of their profession, which is hurting the vital tourism sector at the height of the season, is one of the most immediate challenges. - What will EU and IMF inspectors say when they come at the end of August? Will Greece get a sixth, 8-billion-euro tranche of aid in September? Inspectors are expected to arrive in Athens around August 22, with mission chiefs coming a few days later. - Will there be more cases of rebellion among ruling party ranks? How will that affect reforms? - Will the ruling Socialists' poll ratings continue to drop? The conservative opposition had a 4-percentage point lead after the legislative passage of the new five-year austerity measures, an opinion poll showed in July. - Will the conservative opposition leader keep rejecting government policies despite an insistence by the European Union and IMF on cross-party consensus? - Will unemployment keep rising, making it harder for Greeks to tolerate the austerity medicine? Upcoming macroeconomic data includes: Aug 5: July inflation; Aug 9: June industrial output; Aug 11: May unemployment; Aug 12: GDP Q2 flash estimate. SOCIAL UNREST Analysts say the government may not survive the autumn if it fails to show reform efforts are bearing fruit and if it does not crack down thoroughly on tax evasion, putting culprits behind bars. Increasingly angry with politicians they blame for dragging their country into a severe debt crisis and recession, Greeks have picketed their homes and even pelted them with yoghurt. Papandreou announced that a referendum will be held this autumn on electoral and political changes, including the responsibilities of ministers and lawmakers -- who now benefit from a very generous statute of limitations. This is likely to develop into a de facto test of support for the government. What to watch: - How long the taxi strike will continue and whether labor unions call for more job walk-outs at the end of August, when people come back from holidays. Many analysts expect a tense autumn and all eyes will be on the September 10-11 Thessaloniki trade fair, where political and business leaders gather every year and which usually attracts street protests. - Protesters have said they would rally again in September in front of parliament, where they gathered every evening from May to July to shout their anger at politicians, following the example of protesters in Spain. Will they attract big crowds? How will the government react? - Will protests turn violent again? The evening rallies in front of parliament were mostly peaceful but as lawmakers debated the new austerity package in June, riot police fought stone-throwing youths with teargas and batons, a sign that violence can flare up at any moment. - Will guerrilla attacks resume? The so-called Conspiracy of Fire Cells sent parcel bombs to embassies last November. RESTRUCTURING TALK European governments have agreed to offer Athens a new bailout with cheaper loans, and banks are set to shoulder part of the effort, with the objective of keeping Greece afloat and avoid further contagion in the rest of the euro zone. But Italy and Spain came under attack on financial markets in early August as investors doubted the euro zone could overcome its debt crisis with the latest package of measures agreed at an emergency summit in July. What to watch: -- Progress in talks with banks on private sector participation in a debt roll-over plan and any action from rating agencies. -- How the crisis develops in the rest of the euro zone and the impact it has on Greece. Will Spain and Italy be in a position to contribute to the 8 billion euros Greece expects to get from its partners in September?
