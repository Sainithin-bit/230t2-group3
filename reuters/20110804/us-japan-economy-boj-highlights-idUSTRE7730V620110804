 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan eased monetary policy by boosting its asset buying scheme on Thursday at a rate review that was cut short by one day in the wake of Tokyo's solo intervention to weaken the yen. 

 The nine-member board made the decision by a unanimous vote. The central bank maintained its benchmark policy rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent. Following are highlights of the BOJ's decision to buy more assets: -- The BOJ increased the size of its asset buying program introduced in October last year to 15 trillion yen ($195 billion) from 10 trillion yen. -- This is the BOJ's direct, short-term monetary policy tool with which it tries to push down one- to two-year bond yields and risk premiums by purchasing government bonds and private debt such as corporate bonds, commercial paper and trust funds investing in property and stocks. -- It also increased the size of a cheap loan program offering fixed-rate funds via its market operations, in place since December 2009, to 35 trillion yen from 30 trillion yen. -- The size of the fund that combines asset buying and market operations backed by collateral was, as a result of these two moves, raised to 50 trillion yen from 40 trillion yen. -- The BOJ plans to complete the purchases by the end of next year, instead of June next year as previously pledged. -- In the asset-buying program, the BOJ increased purchase targets to the following (previous figures in parentheses): Government bonds and bills 8.5 trillion yen (5 trillion yen) Commercial paper and corporate bonds 5 trillion yen (4 trillion yen) Exchange-traded funds (ETF) 1.4 trillion yen (900 billion yen) Real estate investment trusts (REIT) 110 billion yen (100 billion yen) ($1 = 76.890 Japanese Yen) (Reporting by  Leika Kihara  and Rie Ishiguro; Editing by  Michael Watson )
