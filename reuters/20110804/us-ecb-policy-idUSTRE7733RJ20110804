 LONDON  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said on Thursday it would offer a round of six-month financing to banks in response to the euro zone debt crisis, while traders said it had resumed buying government bonds of weak states from the secondary market. 

 Following are analysts and traders' comments after the ECB's news conference. MARIE DIRON, SENIOR ECONOMIC ADVISER TO ERNST & YOUNG "The ECB seems largely undeterred by recent developments and keeps pointing to further rate increases in interest rates. Unless developments turn much more negative, the ECB has signaled that it will likely raise interest rates in October. We think that this tightening of monetary policy is unhelpful, at best. It will add to the burden of peripheral countries and dampen fragile growth in the core Eurozone countries. "The ad-hoc provision of extra liquidity announced today is helpful in the short term but it is not enough to stem the current crisis. As expected, the ECB has rejected to announce a step up in its bond purchase program to help relieve tensions on the Spanish and Italian bond markets. Within a few months, the EFSF will be able to take over from the ECB and purchase bonds, but Spain and Italy may not have that much time. Trichet was careful to highlight that the bond purchase program was active, surely to leave the door open to purchases in the future. But by being so reluctant to embrace this policy the ECB is undermining its effectiveness since financial markets cannot rely on the ECB acting as a lender of last resort to governments. "The ECB continues to qualify risks to the growth outlook as balanced. This strikes us as a very optimistic assessment. CARSTEN BRZESKI, ECONOMIST AT ING FINANCIAL MARKETS "The perhaps most exciting piece of information from today's press conference was on the ECB's bond purchasing program. Trichet had the expected comment that the program had never been ended and that it had always been transparent to shortly later hint at possible market action. "Indeed, in an attempt to show that the program was still alive, the ECB apparently intervened in peripheral bond markets during the press conference. However, the question remains whether the ECB's bond purchasing is sufficient to substantially lower bond yields in peripheral countries. "In this regard, the track record of the ECB's bond purchasing program so far is anything but promising. As long as it remains a half-hearted mission under the protective shell of monetary policy transmission, it will probably not be enough." (Compiled by Andrew Torchia and Patrick Graham)
