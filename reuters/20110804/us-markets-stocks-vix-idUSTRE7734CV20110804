 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The CBOE Volatility Index VIX jumped on Thursday as Wall Street tumbled after a labor market report showed U.S. weekly jobless claims edged down by only a small amount. 

 The index, widely regarded as Wall Street's so-called fear gauge, was up 12.8 percent at 26.37, the highest since March. (Reporting by  Angela Moon , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
