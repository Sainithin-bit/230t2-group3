 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AMR Corp's AMR.N American Airlines on Friday forecast lower mainline traffic and revenue in the third quarter, and its shares gave up some of the strong gains recorded Thursday. 

 The carrier also said it would shrink its mainline capacity 9.7 percent in September from August. AMR shares were among the top drags on the Arca Airline Index  .XAL , which fell 3 percent after 11 straight days of gains. Analysts said American's numbers were not off-base from their estimates and that the shares were down largely due to profit-taking. "There's been quite a rally with investors into airline stocks," spurred by stable oil prices and signs of an economic rebound, said S&P analyst Jim Corridore. AMR shares soared 20 percent on Thursday after the company said it had raised $2.9 billion in troubled credit markets and would shift flying to more profitable routes. The shares were down 5.2 percent to $8.34 in Friday morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $7.91 earlier in the session. In a securities filing on Friday, American projected September mainline passenger traffic will slide 16.4 percent and costs will rise slightly from August levels. Third-quarter mainline costs are expected to be about 12.28 cents per available seat mile, it said. For the full year, it expects mainline CASM of 12.06 cents. Mainline unit revenue could slide as much as 15.5 percent in the quarter, it said. Fuel costs will average $2.07 per gallon in the third quarter and $1.99 for the full year, it said. American hedged 33 percent of its fuel consumption in the third quarter and has hedged 36 percent for the full year. "Revenue and costs were pretty much in line with what we were looking for," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Hunter Keay. The carrier, like many others, has been focusing efforts on raising liquidity to shore up its balance sheet. American now expects to end the third quarter with a cash balance of least $3.7 billion, including $1.2 billion in cash related to financing it announced Thursday.
