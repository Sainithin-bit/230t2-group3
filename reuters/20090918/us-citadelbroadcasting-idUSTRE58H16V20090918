 (Reuters) - Citadel Broadcasting Corp CTDB.OB offered a deal to exchange a major part of its debt for equity to senior lenders owed $2 billion, including JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), GE Capital and ING Groep NV ( ING.AS ), the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the negotiations. 

 On Wednesday, Citadel faced a deadline to make a $2 million interest payment, but the status remained unclear, the paper added. Discussions have slowed in recent days in part as some lenders have been caught off-guard by Federal Communications Commission rules intended to limit concentrated holdings of media firms, the people told the paper. Citadel could not be immediately reached for a comment by Reuters. In June, Citadel, which operates the ABC Radio Network, hired Lazard Freres as an advisor to evaluate options, including a possible refinancing and restructuring of its capital structure.
