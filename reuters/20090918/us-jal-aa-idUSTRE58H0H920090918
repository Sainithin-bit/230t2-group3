 TOKYO  (Reuters) - American Airlines plans to team up with British Airways BAY.L and Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) to make a joint alliance offer to Japan Airlines 9205.T, two sources with direct knowledge of the talks said. 

 The offer will include an investment from American Airlines and may or may not include an investment from British Airways and Qantas, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the negotiations are not public. American is keen to thwart a rival offer from Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ), which is also in talks to invest in Japan Airlines, sources have told Reuters.
