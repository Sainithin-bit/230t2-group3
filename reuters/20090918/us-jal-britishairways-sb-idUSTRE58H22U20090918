 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways is attempting to persuade cash-strapped Japan Airlines to remain part of the Oneworld Alliance rather than team up with U.S. rival Delta Air Lines, a BA spokeswoman said. 

 Two sources told Reuters earlier on Friday that BA and Oneworld partners American Airlines and Qantas could offer Japan (JAL) fresh capital and expanded business ties to fight off similar plans from Delta. "There is huge value for JAL in being in Oneworld. We are working with American Airlines and other Oneworld carriers to demonstrate that to them," the BA spokesman told Reuters. She declined to comment on whether BA would put up new capital for Japan. (Reporting by  John Bowker )
