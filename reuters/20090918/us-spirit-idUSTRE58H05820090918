 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government fined Spirit Airlines $375,000 on Thursday for allegedly violating consumer protection rules, including those covering passengers who have been bumped from their flights, officials said. 

 The Transportation Department said privately held Spirit did not offer bumped passengers compensation or the proper notification that they were entitled to compensation. Spirit also failed to resolve baggage claims within a reasonable time and violated regulations that require fare advertisements to state the full price, regulators said. Spirit said in a statement that it had "addressed all of the core issues" involved in the Transportation Department case, including the addition of a new reservations system.
