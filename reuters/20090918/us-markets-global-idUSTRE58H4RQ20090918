 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on corporate profit hopes, but global equities faltered and crude oil slipped toward $72 a barrel on Friday, as the U.S. dollar rebounded from a one-year low on waning risk appetite. 

 Oil fell as dealers took profits from a 5 percent rally earlier in the week and the dollar rose as investors trimmed their positions ahead of holidays in Japan and Singapore next week. Analysts said a lack of conviction that the global economic downturn was indeed ending had dragged down oil and some equity markets on expectations that fuel demand could stay weak. World equities came under pressure after scaling an 11-month peak as investors took stock of recent hefty gains. The MSCI all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.2 percent after touching a high last seen in early October. But Wall Street rebounded from earlier losses as investors bet the recovery will be strong enough to sustain corporate profits. Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ) and major homebuilders advanced on positive brokerage comments. For the week, all three major U.S. stock gauges rose more than 2 percent. "On a short-term basis the market is due for a pause, but the underlying tone of the market and the economy is positive at present," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial in Westport, Connecticut. Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) jumped 3.2 percent to $57.32 after a Citigroup upgrade to "buy" on news P&G is ready to cut prices to regain market share. P&G was the top boost to the 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average. The Dow  .DJI  closed up 36.28 points, or 0.37 percent, at 9,820.20. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 2.81 points, or 0.26 percent, at 1,068.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 6.11 points, or 0.29 percent, at 2,132.86. Analysts said the trend for broad dollar weakness was likely to persist. The dollar has sold off sharply this month as investors shifted into riskier assets on increasing signs of a global recovery. The prospect of low U.S. yields and concerns about the U.S. fiscal deficit have fueled dollar selling. "Today overall has been a retracement day and a profit-taking day," said Andrew Busch, a global FX strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago. "(But) I don't see anything on the horizon just yet that would take us out of this sell-the-U.S.-dollar mode." U.S. crude for October delivery fell 43 cents to settle at $72.04 a barrel, while London Brent fell 23 cents to $71.32. U.S. Treasury debt prices slipped as dealers cut prices to clear out inventory before underwriting the auction of $112 billion in new notes next week. Bond losses widened in thin afternoon trade as participants left for the weekend and for religious observance. Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year holiday, begins Friday evening. U.S. government debt sagged on the prospect of heavy supply. Benchmark 10-year notes fell 26/32 in price to yield 3.49 percent. "People looked ahead to next week's supply and there is still some talk that the Fed will tighten monetary policy sooner than some people thought and that there is a greater divergence of opinion on the FOMC than most people thought," said Cary Leahey, economist at Decision Economics in New York. Gold ended lower on profit taking, capping a volatile week in which the metal set an all-time high of $1,030.80 an ounce as a steadily falling dollar boosted investment demand. U.S. December gold futures settled down $3.20 at $1,010.30 an ounce in New York. European shares pulled back from an 11-month high set on Thursday as commodity stocks slipped, but Britain's leading share index logged a sixth straight session of gains, supported by an early rise on Wall Street. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  of top European shares closed 0.5 percent lower at 1,006.50. The FTSE 100  .FTSE  in London closed up 0.2 percent at 5,172.89, another 12-month closing high. Asian stocks retreated from 13-month highs as a conflicting picture about the strength of a U.S. economic recovery stopped investors from extending this week's rally. The Nikkei index  .N225  fell 0.7 percent, breaking a three-day rally, while the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dipped 0.6 percent.
