 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Overstock.com Inc ( OSTK.O ) said on Thursday the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission had notified it of another investigation into the Internet retailer's history of financial restatements. 

 Overstock, an online seller of excess inventories of clothing, home products and other goods, said in a statement it intends to fully cooperate with regulators. In 2008, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigators completed a two-year probe into the company, taking no action against it or its officers. The SEC had sent the company a subpoena in 2006, asking for information related to accounting policies, targets, projections, estimates and restatements. Overstock said the latest scrutiny involved the restatement of financials in 2006 and 2008, as well as "other matters". Overstock President Jonathan Johnson told Reuters the earlier SEC investigation was more comprehensive, and in the latest probe, the agency planned to take a second look at restatements from 2006. Johnson said those restatements related to the way the company accounted for expenses on inbound freight, and that the restatements ended up improving earnings. In its latest investigation, the SEC requested documents related to the restatements, for billings to Overstock's partners in the fourth quarter of 2008, and for details of a software system tied to accounting for refunds and credits, the company said. "We are disappointed, given the extensive public disclosures Overstock has previously made, that the SEC, given all of the challenges it faces, has apparently chosen to expend time and resources on another investigation of Overstock," Overstock.com Chief Executive Patrick Byrne said. Byrne has been a vocal critic of Wall Street, especially the practice of naked short selling -- a type of trading that has been blamed for contributing to the free-fall in financial stocks.
