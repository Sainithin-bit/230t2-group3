 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Small cap stocks turned out another strong year in 2006, out-performing both mid-cap and large-cap stocks, despite predictions that the small-cap rally was ending. 

 While the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  set the most-watched record highs this year, small-cap stocks -- typically defined as stocks with market capitalizations between $300 million and $2 billion -- quietly made double-digit gains. "Investors, for whatever reason, either for the year as a whole or since the middle of July, have been willing to take more risk, buy more volatile and more risky stocks," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at Johnson Illington Advisors in Albany, New York. "The market has rewarded investors in small-caps to a greater extent than investments in large-caps." The Russell 2000 index of small-cap companies .RUT jumped nearly 17 percent for the year, outperforming the large-cap Dow and Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  as well as the S&P MidCap 400 index .SPMID. Small-caps have now outperformed large-caps for the last six years. The S&P 500 rose 13.6 percent for the year, while the S&P MidCap was up almost 9 percent for the year. LARGE-CAP GAINS EYED But the Dow, which hit all-time highs this year and climbed more than 16 percent for the year, may be a sign that the market for large-cap stocks is turning around. "I think the period of huge out-sized gains from small caps versus large caps is moderating," said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at Dudack Research Group in New York. "There is a slow migration into the large-cap market. Part of it is because they are doing better. The Dow is at all-time highs and the other indices are not. That tends to attract more money, but the value is actually there as well. In the past month, mega-cap stocks like General Electric ( GE.N ), Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) have hit multi-year highs, indicating to some analysts that investor focus may be shifting. "That may mean that investors see that the risks in 2007 are getting higher," Johnson said. "When investors start to migrate or walk toward the bunkers, and start to shift from small-cap to large-cap it's a sign they're becoming less optimistic." Many analysts expect corporate earnings growth to slow from the double-digit pace seen over the past several years, and some analysts said they are seeking companies with the best exposure to international markets -- which means large-caps. "I think we'll be more reliant on emerging-market economies to support earnings, so I want to be in mega-cap, multinational companies that will be able to do business in a place like China, rather than something dependent on the local or national market," said Peter Dunay, investment strategist at Leeb Capital Management in New York. Large-cap stocks, which represent many of America's household names, may also be preferred next year because they offer more stability as well as big dividend payments, in the face of a slowing economy. "In 2007 we finally think large caps should get more respect and do better," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at New York brokerage Spencer Clarke. "Historically, when the economy slows, corporate earnings decline and markets face greater uncertainty, large caps tend to do better than small caps." (Additional reporting by Jennifer Coogan)
