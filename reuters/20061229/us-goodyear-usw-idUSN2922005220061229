 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Union workers at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N have voted to end a three-month-old strike, ratifying a contract that will save the biggest U.S. tire maker as much as $610 million by cutting production and health-care costs, both sides said on Friday. 

 More than 10,000 United Steelworkers (USWA) members voted on the contract, approving it by a margin of more than two-to-one, the union said in a statement. All striking workers are set to return to work starting on January 2, ending a walkout that began October 5. The new three-year contract establishes a company-financed trust fund of more than $1 billion that will secure medical and prescription drug benefits for current and future retirees, the union said. The company also agreed to invest $550 million in union-represented plants. "It took a strike, but we achieved a fair and equitable contract that protects quality health care for active and retired members," USWA Executive Vice President Ron Hoover said in a statement. "And by winning major capital investment expenditures, it secures our jobs for the future." Goodyear said that the trust fund will reduce a significant portion of its costs related to its retirees. The company said its $1 billion upfront contribution will consist of at least $700 million in cash, with the balance in additional cash or common stock. Under provisions of the three-year contract, which covers workers at 12 tire and engineered products plants, Goodyear will save up to $610 million in costs, and $300 million a year in ongoing savings, the company said in a statement. "Reaching agreement on a contract that competitively positions Goodyear for the future is a huge achievement for everyone involved in the negotiation process," Goodyear Chief Executive Robert Keegan said in a statement. Goodyear expects savings to total $70 million in 2007, $240 million in 2008 and $300 million in 2009. J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel, who reiterated his "overweight" rating on Goodyear's stock, said the contract savings were sharply higher than he had expected. "The '09 savings run-rate is roughly twice our prior expectations, with most of the upside coming from 'increased productivity,' reflecting the benefit of lower wages for new hires and incentives designed to increase productivity of existing workers," he said in a research note. Goodyear and the union reached a tentative agreement last week to end the strike by 15,000 union workers in the United States and Canada, and announced the deal early Friday morning. Last month, the company said it was losing up to $35 million a week due to the strike. The Akron, Ohio-based company said under the deal it can pay lower wages and benefits for new hires during the first three years of employment. Goodyear will close its plant in Tyler, Texas, after December 31, 2007, instead of immediately, as it had wanted. This will eliminate 9 million units of high-cost tire capacity and yield about $50 million in annual savings. When the plant closes, the company said it will have eliminated 14 million units of high-cost tire capacity out of a targeted 15 million to 20 million. Goodyear also said it has agreed to profit-sharing of up to $25 million in 2009, and up to $30 million in 2010. Workers at four Goodyear union facilities in Canada were voting Thursday and Friday, and no results were immediately available. The Goodyear union members in Canada are covered by a separate agreement from the 12 U.S. facilities. Goodyear shares were up $1.23, or 6.2 percent, at $21.24 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
