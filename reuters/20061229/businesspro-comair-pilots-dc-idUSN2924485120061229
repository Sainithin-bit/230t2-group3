 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK unit Comair 
and its pilots agreed to a deal that would give the two sides 
until February 2 to negotiate a new contract, the bankrupt 
carrier and its pilots' union said on Friday. 

  The two sides had tentatively agreed on Thursday to a 
bigger extension, but Comair's creditors balked at the length, 
said Paul Denke, spokesman for the Comair unit of the Air Line 
Pilots Association.  The deal gives both sides time to reach a permanent 
solution and avoid a costly labor dispute.  Comair, the Cincinnati-based regional carrier, was planning 
to impose terms on its pilots on December 30, with the approval 
of the bankruptcy court. But fearing a strike, the company had 
asked the court to grant an injunction preventing union-backed 
work disruptions.  Comair is seeking annual savings of $15.8 million from its 
pilots.
