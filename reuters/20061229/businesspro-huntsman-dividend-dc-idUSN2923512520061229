 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chemicals maker Huntsman Corp. ( HUN.N ) 
said on Friday it expects to declare its first quarterly 
dividend and announce the sale of a North American business 
early in 2007. 

  Citing "a much stronger" balance sheet looking ahead, it 
said "we anticipate declaring (its) first quarterly dividend on 
common shares in early 2007."  Huntsman said it was nearing a deal on the sale of its 
North American polymers and base chemicals businesses.  "Having received greater than anticipated interest from 
potential buyers, we now plan on making an announcement in the 
next few weeks," Peter R. Huntsman, Huntsman president and 
chief executive, said in a statement.  Huntsman, which has trimmed debt as it moved to focus on 
higher-margin businesses, also said it has completed the sale 
of its U.K.-based European commodities business to Saudi Basic 
Industries 2010.SE for total proceeds of $810 million.  The company has reduced debt by $2.6 billion over the past 
two years, helped by its initial public offering in 2005 and 
the sales of its U.S. business that produced butadiene and the 
gasoline additive MTBE.
