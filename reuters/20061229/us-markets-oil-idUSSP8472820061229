 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose above $61 a barrel on Friday as nervous traders boosted positions ahead of a rare four-day break in U.S. open outcry futures trade. 

 The New York Mercantile Exchange said on Friday it will close floor trading on Tuesday, January 2, to honor former President Gerald Ford, who died earlier in the week. New York oil futures settled 52 cents higher at $61.05 a barrel, a penny above the close on the last day of trading in 2005. Friday's settle was far below this year's peak of over $78 in mid-July. Brent rose 19 cents to $60.86. NYMEX said electronic markets will be open on Tuesday, but traders were jittery about an extended trade break especially with the constant threat of violence in the Middle East. "The late rally was due to concern about (NYMEX) trading being shut for three days and a fourth day of limited trading," said Bill O'Grady, an analyst at A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. In morning trade before NYMEX announced the closure, U.S. futures fell below $60 for the first time since early November on mild weather. U.S. crude had climbed by a modest 19 cents on Thursday when traders largely ignored U.S. data that showed a much bigger than expected fall in commercial crude stocks. Analysts said the figures were a temporary distortion following fog-related shipping delays. The impact of the fall was also softened by continued mild weather that has reduced demand for heating fuel. Many forecasters are predicting the unseasonable weather will continue until spring. RANGE-BOUND Oil prices have been range-bound since mid-September and some analysts say they could be trapped at around the $60 level that ministers from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have said they favor. A Reuters poll of more than 30 analysts forecasts an average U.S. price of $63.48 for 2007. One bullish factor is political risk in oil-producing nations, including in Nigeria, where unrest could worsen in the run-up to presidential elections in April, and in Iran, which is locked in a dispute with the West over its nuclear program. Some analysts say this could lure in fresh investment-class money in the new year. But others say signs of a slowing U.S. economy and increasing non-OPEC supplies could persuade investors to look elsewhere. Some investors have been bruised by a more than 20 percent fall in oil prices since U.S. crude climbed to a record of $78.40 in July this year. This year's average price of just over $66 a barrel was higher than the 2005 mean of $56.70.
