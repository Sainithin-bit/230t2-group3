 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq stock market said it would be closed on January 2 to mark the death of former U.S. President Gerald Ford after the date was deemed a national day of mourning. 

 President George W. Bush on Thursday declared January 2 a national day of mourning for Ford, who died this week, meaning all federal offices will close on Tuesday. Ford, the 38th U.S. President, served from 1999-200 on the board of NASD, a private-sector regulator of America's securities industry that once owned the Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ). "His leadership and invaluable service during his time on the NASD board contributed to what the NASDAQ is today," said Nasdaq President and Chief Executive Bob Greifeld. The New York Stock Exchange would announce Friday morning whether it would follow suit, spokesman Richard Adamonis said. The exchanges have historically closed on a national day of mourning for a U.S. president, such as in June 2004 after the death of President Ronald Reagan. With New Year's Day a holiday on Monday, the NASDAQ will be commemorating Ford in an already shortened week, which had caused some speculation that exchanges would be reluctant to close for a second day.
