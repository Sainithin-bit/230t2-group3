 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK said on Friday that it lost $49 million in November, a better performance than a year ago, leaving it on track to exit from bankruptcy as a stand-alone company in the spring. 

 Delta recently rebuffed an $8.3 billion offer from US Airways Group Inc., ( LCC.N ) and said its own reorganization plan values the company at $9.4 billion to $12 billion. Delta's $49 million loss in November compares with a November 2005 loss of $181 million.
