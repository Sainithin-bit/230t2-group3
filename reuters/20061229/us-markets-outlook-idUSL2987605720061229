 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investors are set for a flood of economic data as 2007 kicks, with a key U.S. jobs report hogging attention after recent reports have showed the world's biggest economy on a firmer footing than had been thought. 

 Further insight on the latest thinking from the U.S. Federal Reserve will also be sought as minutes from its last monetary policy meeting are released on Wednesday. In Europe, expectations are high for strong manufacturing data which would harden expectations for the European Central Bank to press on with further interest rate rises from the current 3.5 percent. Slovenia becomes the 13th euro zone state on Monday and Mitja Gaspari, who will represent the country on the ECB's Governing Council, will give a news conference that day. U.S. home sales, consumer confidence and the Chicago manufacturing index all topped market forecasts this week, helping the dollar stabilize as expectations for a U.S. rate cut from 5.25 percent early next year were trimmed. While forecasts for slowing U.S. growth and monetary loosening remain in place, analysts said views of a "hard landing" scenario were beginning to fade. Tullett Prebon G7 market economist Lena Komileva said there could be room for upward revisions to forecasts on next Friday's U.S. non-farm payrolls from the current consensus that has 110,000 jobs added in December, compared with 132,000 the previous month. "The latest batch of U.S. economic figures have defied the notion that a hard landing will materialize," she said. "There is room for projections for the non-farm payrolls to be revised up in light of the positive underlying trend in jobless claims and the strong surprise in the U.S. consumer sentiment survey." Other notable figures due out in the United States next week include the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index on Tuesday and the ADP employment report on Wednesday -- often taken as a precursor to the non-farm payrolls release. Retail sentiment will be measured with U.S. durable goods data for November on Thursday, while the ISM's non-manufacturing index for December is also due on January 4 along with pending home sales. EURO ZONE PMI EYED In the euro zone, markets are positioned for a rate rise to 3.75 percent in the first three months of 2007, but further hikes could be on the cards if data continue to come in strong. The euro zone manufacturing PMI, due on Tuesday, is expected to rise to 56.8 in December from 56.6, whilst a companion survey on Thursday is forecast to show slightly faster growth in the bloc's dominant services sector. The European Commission's December industrial sentiment gauge, released on Friday, is seen holding steady at 6.0, with the business climate index also unchanged, at 1.54. "Generally speaking business sentiment seems to be holding up a lot better than had been expected given the rate hikes we've already had, and the exchange rate as well. We'll see business confidence continuing to push the ECB toward hiking rates," said Adam Cole, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The week also features the flash estimate for euro zone December inflation on Thursday. In Britain, the focus will be on housing market surveys for further confirmation that the property market has weathered two rate rises from the Bank of England, leaving room for another hike in early 2007. Evidence of UK Christmas consumer spending will also be pored over with clothing retailer Next giving a trading update on Thursday and weekly sales figures from department store chain John Lewis also due. Japan is in for a quiet week, with markets shut for the first three days and only open for half of Thursday.
