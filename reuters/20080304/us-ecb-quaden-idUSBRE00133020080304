 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Guy Quaden called on Tuesday on U.S. authorities to reaffirm their strong-dollar policy, saying inflation was a big concern within the euro zone. 

 "Things are becoming exaggerated... It's up to the relevant authorities to assume their responsibilities and particularly for U.S. authorities, who repeat that they are in favor of a strong dollar but who should reaffirm their words," he told Belgian radio.
