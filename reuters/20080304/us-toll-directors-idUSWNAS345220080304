 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Four independent directors of luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ) are backing the company's nominees to the board and a CEO cash bonus plan that is opposed by two shareholder advisory companies, according to a regulatory filing. 

 "Despite the current extremely difficult economic conditions, the company has continued to perform well versus our competitors, and has earned the respect of the analyst community for its strong balance sheet," the independent directors said in a letter to shareholders. On Monday, advisory companies Proxy Governance Inc and ISS Governance Services urged Toll investors to vote "no" to a cash bonus plan for Chief Executive Officer Robert Toll, citing poor stock performance because of the U.S. housing market downturn.
