 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office Depot Inc ( ODP.N ) on Tuesday introduced technology support services for customers, a growing source of revenue for retailers that purvey complicated consumer electronics. 

 Following in the footsteps of Best Buy Co Inc's ( BBY.N ) "Geek Squad" and Circuit City Stores Inc's CC.N "firedog" service, the No. 2 office supplies retailer said its "Tech Depot Services" are available in customers' homes or offices. Also, 85 Office Depot locations in Florida are offering Tech Depot Services in its stores. "We're in the midst of a national roll-out," said company spokesman Jason Shockley. "Eight-five stores out of the 1,200 are up and running right now..., and we're continuing expansion throughout the year." The introduction of the service comes a week after Office Depot posted a sharp drop in quarterly profit, hurt by higher expenses and lower sales in North America. In an effort to boost profits, retailers such as Office Depot are trying to get consumers to pay extra for help installing, using or fixing their new electronic equipment. Office Depot had been offering Geek Squad computer repair services in a few of its stores. But Shockley said Office Depot had ended the Geek Squad test and instead decided "to move forward with our own solution." He declined to elaborate further on its decision to end the Geek Squad test. Tech Depot Services will provide a variety of services including computer repairs, wireless network installation, and software and TV installation. The services will either be performed at an Office Depot store, remotely through an Internet connection, or at a customer's home or office. (Reporting by Nicole Maestri; Editing by  Derek Caney )
