 GENEVA  (Reuters) - The president of General Motors Europe ( GM.N ) believes the overall European market could show no growth at all this year, but the picture varied greatly between countries, he said on Tuesday. 

 "Germany is recovering, Spain and Britain are down, but Russia is booming," Carl-Peter Forster told reporters during a briefing at the motor show here, adding "we hope to sell more this year". He said there were many uncertainties, and the year had only just started. "Will the U.S market go down? Will there be a recession in the U.S. and will that spill over to Europe? I know what we want, and that is to do better," he said. Forster said that Opel, the German brand of GM in Europe, which sells as Vauxhall in Britain, had an operating margin of some 2 percent in 2007 and GM wanted to boost that. But he said low profitability was not confined to Opel but was an industry-wide problem among volume carmakers in Europe due to price pressure as Asian manufacturers exported cheap cars to the continent. "The steel industry has consolidated too much," he said, blaming a sharp increase in steel prices for part of the industry's woes. The higher steel price has caused extra costs of 500 million euros at GM Europe. Regulation such as on environmental issues was also an obstacle to higher earnings. "The whole CO2 situation is not really profit enhancing," he said. Forster declined to say what kind of margin he was aiming at for Opel, but he said earnings could be improved by increasing common parts for models, boosting quality, rationalizing production, focusing research spending and reducing purchasing cost. The Saab brand in Sweden could also help boost earnings, and GM is considering whether to launch a small model for Saab. Other makers such as PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) or Renault ( RENA.PA ) have set themselves margin targets of 5.5 to 6 percent by 2010 or 6 percent by 2009, respectively. "Those are nice intentions, but they still need to be realized. I'd call it very brave to set targets like that," he said. In Russia, sales are rising fast, and GM is set to sell 300,000 to 400,000 vehicles there in 2008. Forster said Opel sales made up about a third of total GM sales in Russia -- which include Chevrolet -- and that proportion was higher than expected. "Opel is perceived as a good German brand," he said, and Russia could become a bigger market than Spain and eventually even bigger than Germany. Asked whether this could lead to a reduction in Opel production and jobs in western Europe, he said this was not the case. "We will always be exporting Opels to Russia," he said, while some large volume models might be made also in plants in Russia, Ukraine or Uzbekistan. "Russia is a dynamic market, and you have to grow with the market, so you need local production and sourcing," he said. "We are also having strategic talks with GAZ ... but I cannot say anything about that now," he said. GAZ ( GAZA.RTS ), of Gorky, makes Volga cars. GM has a joint venture with AvtoVAZ ( AVAZ.MM ) in which Renault ( RENA.PA ) acquired a 25 percent stake. Asked to comment on the recent appointment of GM Finance Director Fritz Henderson to chief operating officer, Forster said this would free up time for chief executive Rick Wagoner to focus on such issues as emerging markets or alternative fuel. "Rick has not taken holidays for three years," he said. (Editing by Will Waterman)
