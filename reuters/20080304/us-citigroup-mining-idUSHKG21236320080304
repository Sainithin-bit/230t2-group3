 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Citigroup has relocated an investment banker to Hong Kong from the United States in order to build its dealmaking capability in the Asian metals and mining sector, according to an internal memo. 

 Darin Baur, who joined the bank in 2000, has since 2006 been a director in its Chicago investment banking team, the memo said. He reports to Alexander Molyneux, head of Asia metals and mining. Soaring commodity prices have fuelled a wave of consolidation activity in the mining sector, headlined by BHP Billiton's hostile bid for rival Rio Tinto Plc.
