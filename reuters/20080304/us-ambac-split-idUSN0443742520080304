 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N, the second biggest U.S. bond insurer, has decided against splitting in two as part of a $2 billion to $3 billion recapitalization, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing insiders. 

 The FT said under a recent proposal Ambac would have split its operations into a triple-A-rated municipal bond insurance business and a structured finance business with potentially lower ratings. Eight banks led by Citigroup ( C.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ), are preparing to inject around $2 billion or more into Ambac. Ambac was not immediately available for comment.
