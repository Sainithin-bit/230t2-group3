 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) is considering whether to sell the next generation of its Mercedes-Benz compact cars in the United States, Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told reporters on Tuesday. 

 He said a final decision had not yet been made and would depend in part on the dollar/euro exchange rate, but that Mercedes was tending to view the U.S. market as a good one for smaller cars. The next generation of A-Class and B-Class compact cars would be broader than the current offering and could include models aimed at U.S. customers, he said. (Reporting by  Hendrik Sackmann )
