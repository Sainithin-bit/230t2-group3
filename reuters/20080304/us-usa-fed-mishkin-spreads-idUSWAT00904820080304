 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Widening credit spreads act like a tightening of monetary policy, counteracting interest rate cuts, U.S. Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin said on Tuesday. 

 "When you get a widening of credit spreads, that effectively is a tightening of the stance of monetary policy," Mishkin said at an economics conference. (Reporting by  Emily Kaiser , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
