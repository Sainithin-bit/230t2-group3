 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada injected C$740 million ($740 million) into markets on Tuesday to lower the overnight interest rate toward the central bank's target and improve liquidity. 

 The bank operates through Special Purchase and Resale Agreements, buying securities with the agreement to sell them back the next business day. Of late it has usually not been injecting any funds through SPRAs, though on Monday it put C$706 million in overnight. ($1=$1.00 Canadian) (Reporting by  Randall Palmer ; Editing by Peter Galloway)
