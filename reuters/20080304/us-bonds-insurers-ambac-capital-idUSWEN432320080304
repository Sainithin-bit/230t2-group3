 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bond insurer Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N is unlikely to announce any capital raising deal on Tuesday, a person briefed on the matter said. 

 The second largest U.S. bond insurer is looking to raise capital to maintain top credit ratings at its main unit. Talks on finding a solution are continuing, but will not likely be concluded on Tuesday, the person briefed on the matter said. Paul Burke, head of fixed-income investor relations at Ambac, declined to discuss the timing of any possible deal, but repeated the company's earlier statements that it is actively working to raise capital.
