 CUPERTINO, California  (Reuters) - Computer and iPod maker Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) on Tuesday said that its annual meeting had passed a resolution in favor of an annual advisory vote by shareholders on executive compensation. 

 The proposal had been opposed by the board of directors. It urged the board to put up to shareholders a nonbinding resolution each year regarding pay of top executives. (Reporting by  Scott Hillis , editing by Peter Henderson)
