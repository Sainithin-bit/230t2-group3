 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. banking system faces difficulties from a housing downturn that is causing asset write-downs and losses, but these should not threaten banks' viability, Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said on Tuesday. 

 "The U.S. banking system is facing some challenges, but remains in sound overall condition, having entered the period of recent financial turmoil with solid capital and strong earnings," Kohn said in prepared testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. "The problems in the mortgage and housing markets have been highly unusual and clearly some banking organizations have failed to manage their exposures well and have suffered losses as a result. But in general these losses should not threaten their viability," Kohn said. Kohn did not address Fed monetary policy in his prepared testimony. Bank holding companies regulated by the Fed still earned combined net income of more than $90 billion in 2007 despite overall losses of $8 billion in the fourth quarter, and their non-performing asset ratio remained below the level reached earlier in this decade, Kohn said. The 50 largest bank holding companies posted an overall loss exceeding $9 billion in the fourth quarter, incorporating $31 billion in asset writedowns and loan loss provisions that exceeded charge-offs by $14 billion, he added. Non-performing assets have more than doubled to $67 billion during 2007 and financial market pressures have hampered banks' ability to securitize their assets, Kohn said. But Kohn noted that large banking firms have maintained regulatory capital ratios above minimum regulatory requirements and have raised more than $50 billion in new capital in recent months. "Looking ahead, bank holding companies will continue to face challenging market conditions and persistent pressure on earnings," Kohn said. "More asset writedowns are likely as the market continues to adjust risk premiums and valuations change. Adverse trends in loan quality will almost certainly continue and will require close monitoring by banking institutions and supervisory agencies alike."
