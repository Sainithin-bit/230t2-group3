 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc JTX.N, the second-largest U.S. tax preparer, on Tuesday said quarterly profit fell 34 percent, hurt by what it called a disappointing start to the U.S. tax filing season. 

 Net income in the fiscal third quarter ended Jan 31 fell to $18.2 million, or 61 cents per share, from $27.5 million, or 83 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 15 percent to $97.6 million. Analysts on average expected profit of 99 cents per share on revenue of $119.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates. The company is based in Parsippany, New Jersey.
