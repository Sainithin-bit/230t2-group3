 LONDON  (Reuters) - Financial markets expect no change in European Central Bank interest rates on Thursday, but they are betting that slowing economic growth will trump inflation concerns and prompt a cut in the middle of the year. 

 Euro Overnight Index Average rates point to the ECB cutting rates by a quarter percentage point from the current 4.0 percent at its June meeting. Overnight Index Swaps indicate a first policy easing of the cycle at the Governing Council's July meeting, market participants said on Tuesday. Both EONIA and OIS suggest the ECB will make three cuts of a quarter point to bring benchmark borrowing costs to 3.25 percent by the end of the year. Several signs of mounting price pressures are likely to keep the ECB talking tough on inflation in the near term, including at its March policy meeting on Thursday. But the toll on growth from tight credit markets, financial market volatility and spillover from U.S. economic weakness should soon prompt the ECB's first rate cut in five years. "It's quite clear we'll see no rate change on Thursday, but the most important thing is what the growth projection for the current year will be," said Kornelius Purps, fixed income analyst at Unicredit in Frankfurt. "They're talking on inflation but acting on growth." The ECB's current forecast for euro zone growth this year is 1.5-2.5 percent, giving a mid-point of 2.0 percent. Its 2008 annual inflation forecast is 2-3 percent, that is around 2.5 percent and some way above its target of close to but below 2 percent. Purps reckons a downward revision to the growth forecast to 1.8 percent would be neutral for rates markets and the short end of the bond market. However, 1.7 percent or below would be bullish while 1.9 percent would be bearish. EONIA contracts indicate a negligible 2 percent chance of a quarter point rate cut this week, a one-in-five chance of a cut in April and around 16 basis points' worth of easing by May. They are fully discounting a move at the June meeting, traders said. EONIA points to 49 basis points of easing by the September meeting and 79 basis points of easing by the end of the year. DOVES TO TAME HAWKS? The ECB last moved rates in June last year, raising its refinancing rate to a six-year high of 4.0 percent. Since the last monthly policy meeting in February, traders have swung from discounting the refi rate ending the year at 3.5 percent to as low as 3.0 percent. ECB hawks such as Governing Council member Axel Weber have said markets are underestimating the bank's commitment to keeping a lid on price pressures and anchoring inflation expectations. However, policymakers have been forced to recognize the deteriorating growth outlook resulting from financial market volatility, seized up money markets and clear signs that the U.S. economy may be in recession. "It's been so choppy. A week after the last ECB meeting we had four cuts (of 25 basis points each) priced in for the end of the year, then we had two, now we're back to three," said a money markets trader in Dublin. EONIA contracts point to a refi rate of 3.21 percent at the end of the year, the trader said, while Purps at Unicredit said the OIS market pointed to end-year rates around 3.16 percent. Market participants said OIS and EONIA contracts offered a more accurate guide to expectations of where the ECB's refi rate will be in the next few months than indications offered by London interbank offered rates, or Libor. That's because the global credit crisis has frozen up interbank money markets. Banks are extremely reluctant to lend funds to each other, which means the cost of accessing these funds has risen. The cash premium in Libor markets, therefore, has distorted the implied interest rates in these contracts, particularly at the short end of the money market curve. Basic calculations by Reuters show that the back end of the 2008 Libor strip points to 50 basis points of easing this year being fully priced in, with the market attaching around an 80 percent probability of another cut to 3.25 percent.
