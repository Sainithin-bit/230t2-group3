 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Slower euro zone economic growth this year will help ease inflation pressures, European Central Bank Governing Council member Athanasios Orphanides said on Tuesday. 

 But Orphanides said inflation was a concern at a euro zone level as well as in Cyprus, noting high oil prices. "We expect some slowdown in the economy compared to the growth rate of last year," he said on the sidelines of a meeting with new Greek-Cypriot President Demetris Christofias. "Growth in the euro zone last year was higher than the growth potential of the economy, so some relaxation helps to contain the inflationary trends we have." The ECB is expected to leave interest rates at 4 percent on Thursday but downgrade staff forecasts for growth, possibly paving the way for looser policy later in the year. Orphanides declined comment on the euro-dollar exchange rate. (Reporting by  Michele Kambas , writing by Krista Hughes, editing by Mike Peacock)
