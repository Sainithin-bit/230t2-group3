 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Guy Quaden said on Tuesday that the strength of the euro against the dollar was mainly due to the strength of the European economy. 

 "For the first time in a long time, economic growth is higher in Europe than in the U.S., and from this point of view that is rather good news," he said. (Reporting by Julien Ponthus and  Mark John )
