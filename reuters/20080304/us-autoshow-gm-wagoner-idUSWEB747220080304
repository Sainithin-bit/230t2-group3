 GENEVA  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on Tuesday that U.S. auto sales have been weak in the first two months of the year but have not approached the extremes of some forecasts. 

 "I think it is fair to say that it has been a little better than some of the doomsday people are thinking," Wagoner told reporters on the sidelines of the Geneva auto show. He said GM, the largest U.S. car maker, had not made any radical changes to its spending plans and was ready to react should the market weaken or fail to recover. GM on Monday reported a 16 percent decline in U.S. sales in February and trimmed its second-quarter production plans. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; editing by John Wallace)
