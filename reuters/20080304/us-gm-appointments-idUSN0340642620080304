 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Monday its board had approved the promotion of Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson to the newly created post of president and chief operating officer. 

 The move established Henderson, 49, as No. 2 to GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner in overseeing the day-to-day operations of the No. 1 U.S. automaker as it tries to rebound from three straight years of net losses. Ray Young, 46, who had been a GM group vice president for finance, was appointed to take over as CFO. Henderson, Young and GM's vice chairman and global product development chief, Bob Lutz, will report to Wagoner, the company said. Henderson took over as CFO in 2006 and has been one of the architects of a turnaround plan to revive profits after the company posted combined net losses of over $50 billion over the past three years. Henderson was one of the central GM executives in negotiating a complex labor deal with the United Auto Workers Union that will transfer retiree health care obligations to a trust fund aligned with the union. Detroit-based GM has a history of promoting from within the ranks of its financial managers for its top jobs. Wagoner, 54, began his career with GM in the company treasurer's office and served as CFO from 1992 to 1994. In announcing Henderson's appointment, Wagoner praised his contribution in leading GM's operations in Latin America, Asia and Europe before he become chief financial officer. In recent years, GM has relied on overseas growth, particularly in emerging markets such as China and Russia, to offset some of the impact of a slump in its home market. "Fritz Henderson is the right person to assume this role," Wagoner said in a statement. "He's had a broad range of experience in leading three of our four regions ... and he's made a tremendous contribution in each role." GM also said it had promoted Tom Stephens, 59, to an executive vice president role focused on its powertrain development efforts and quality improvements. The automaker said that move partly reflected the importance it now attaches to developing technology for the next generation of hybrid and electric vehicles. In one of its highest-profile development efforts in that area, GM is racing to become the first major automaker to offer a rechargeable hybrid vehicle in the Chevrolet Volt, slated for release in 2010.
