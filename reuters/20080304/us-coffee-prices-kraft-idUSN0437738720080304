 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N raised list prices on some of its Maxwell House and Yuban coffees, citing climbing green coffee prices, spokeswoman Bridget MacConnell said on Tuesday. 

 The price hike will be 20 cents per 11- to 13-ounce cans on select Maxwell House and Yuban coffees, effective immediately, MacConnell said. Select instant coffee was increased by 3 cents per ounce, she said. MacConnell said the increase was due to the significant increase in the cost of green coffee. The increase followed Procter & Gamble's ( PG.N ) hike in Dunkin' Donuts and some Folgers coffees prices, due to higher green coffee prices, on Monday. Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA also increased the list prices of its well-known coffee brands like Chock Full o'Nuts on the same day. (Reporting by  Marcy Nicholson ; Editing by  Walter Bagley )
