 GENEVA  (Reuters) - India's Tata Group said on Tuesday it was important for the group's auto arm to crack the U.S. market. 

 "(It's) important ...because it is the world's biggest car market," Chairman Ratan Tata told reporters at the Geneva auto show. He said Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ) had no current plans to bring its tiny, $2,500 Nano car to Europe but added that he hoped a high-end version of it would one day enter the competitive market. Tata Motors ranks third in India's fast-growing market but has yet to test its cheap, small vehicles in developed regions such as North America and Europe. Interest in the brand has risen since it delivered the 100,000 rupee "people's car" at the Delhi auto show this January despite much initial skepticism. The car will go on sale in India later this year. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Jason Neely )
