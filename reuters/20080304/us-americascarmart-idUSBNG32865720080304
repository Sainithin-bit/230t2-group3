 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Automotive retailer America's Car-Mart Inc ( CRMT.O ) posted a quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates as the company closed underperforming branches and beefed up its advertising initiatives, sending its shares up as much as 14 percent. 

 An improved competitive environment, more advertising initiatives and the company's move to focus on its performing and profitable branches while doing away with underperforming ones helped drive sales, Daniel Furtado of Jefferies & Co Inc said. For the third quarter, the company posted a profit of $3.4 million, or 28 cents a share. It broke even in the year-ago quarter. Excluding a charge related to the closure of a facility but including stock options expenses, the company earned 30 cents a share, while analysts on average were expecting earnings of 26 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenues rose about 20 percent to $71.1 million. Analysts were expecting $67.5 million. Furtado, who has a "buy" rating on the stock, expects America's Car-Mart to perform better than its peers like AmeriCredit Corp ACF.N, Consumer Portfolio Services Inc ( CPSS.O ), Nicholas Financial ( NICK.O ) and United PanAm Financial Corp UPFC.O. America's Car-Mart is a smaller company and doesn't rely on capital markets or the asset-backed securities market like its peers for growth, Furtado said. The company is able to internally fund its growth and is therefore not impacted much by the current credit crunch, he said. America's Car-Mart, which has been mulling the closure of locations which are draining its resources, said it is closing two locations in Texas. The company has already shut its Wichita, Kansas, facility. But the company is also planning to open four new stores in its fiscal year ending April 30, 2009. OLD BEATS NEW Finance receivables rose more than 4 percent to $198 million due to higher vehicle sales volumes and prices during the third quarter. Furtado said volumes declines are expected in both the used and the new car markets as concerns about the possibility of a recession hitting the United States mount. But he said, "I would expect the used car market to be more resilient in this economic environment because everybody who comes under stress financially and has to get a new car will probably focus on a used car than splurge on a new one." Retail unit sales were up 17.1 percent during the third quarter, with 7,031 vehicles compared with 6,002 a year ago. Furtado said America's Car-Mart was trying to decrease risks associated with loans given to customers by reducing loan terms and increasing downpayments. Shares of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based company rose to a high of $12.59, before falling back to trade up almost 9 percent at $11.97 in afternoon trade Tuesday on Nasdaq.
