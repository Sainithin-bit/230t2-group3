 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Online search site Ask.com will eliminate about 40 jobs, or 8 percent of its work force, and is reevaluating its product and marketing lineup, new Chief Executive Jim Safka said on Tuesday. 

 In an interview with Reuters, Safka said he had taken a close look at who uses Ask, which sees nearly 45 million visitors per month, and what they seek on the service. The company found that about 65 percent of its user base are women, with a high concentration of users in their late 30s in the U.S. Midwest and Southeast. That contrasts with the wider search market, where women account for closer to 48 percent of users. "If we can do a better job of understanding who these customers are and answering their questions, we will grow," Safka said. He was due to outline the strategy to staff on Tuesday. "What this means is everything we do will be put through this strategic filter," he said, referring to future products and distribution outlets, from the Web to mobile phones. Ask.com is part of IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ). (Reporting by  Michele Gershberg ; editing by John Wallace)
