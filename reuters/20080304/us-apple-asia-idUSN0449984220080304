 CUPERTINO, California  (Reuters) - Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) expects to start selling its iPhone communications device in Asia this year, but would not say specifically when it will enter the key market of China, Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook told the annual meeting on Tuesday. 

 "We will enter Asia with the iPhone in 2008... we will one day enter China, we're not saying when, and we will one day enter India," Cook said. Chief Executive Steve Jobs added that Apple expected to hit its 2008 sales target of 10 million iPhones, a figure which some analysts have questioned in the face of a weaker U.S. economy. Jobs also was asked if the company planned to start a dividend or stock buybacks. "At this time, we have no plans to do either," he told shareholders.
