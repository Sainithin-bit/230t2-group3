 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The huge U.S. current account deficit widened in the third quarter to a record $225.6 billion, as gushing oil prices and strong demand for Chinese and other foreign goods pushed imports higher, a U.S. Commerce Department report showed on Monday. 

 The quarterly shortfall surpassed the previous record of $223.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005, but was largely in line with expectations before the report. The gap, on an annual basis, topped $900 billion for the first time, but some analysts saw signs it was receding already. "We think that the deficit has peaked," said Nigel Gault, chief U.S. economist with Global Insight. "Lower oil prices, robust export growth and some cooling in import growth should bring the deficit down, beginning in the fourth quarter." Meanwhile, a second report showed home builders remained glum about current sales, but hopeful of better market conditions by the middle of next year. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market index fell 1 point to 32, but held above the 15-year low of 30 reached in September. Any reading below 50 means most builders view market conditions as poor. However, lower mortgage rates have made many home builders less gloomy about the next six months. An index measuring sales expectations rose for the third consecutive month, to 48 from 45, to its highest level since June. GAP UP ON OIL More than half of the increase in the third-quarter current account deficit came from higher oil prices. Strong worldwide demand and tensions in the Middle East propelled average U.S. oil import prices to a record $66.12 per barrel in August, before they began to slide. The current account, the broadest measure of U.S. trade with the rest of the world, includes trade in goods, services and investment flows. The huge U.S. deficit is viewed as one of the major risks to the world economy, along with surpluses in Asian and oil-exporting countries. Sherry Cooper, chief economist with BMO Capital Markets, called the U.S. shortfall a "$900 billion gorilla" looming over the U.S. economy. The third-quarter gap, as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product, was the second highest on record at 6.8 percent, up from 6.6 percent in the second quarter. "The expected modest improvement in the current account deficit is not that encouraging since the overall shortfall will remain very large (both in dollar terms and as a share of GDP), keeping external financing risks elevated," Cooper said. The dollar weakened slightly in early trading after the report, but later made up lost ground despite the huge gap renewing concerns about the ability of the United States to attract enough foreign capital to finance its spending. The goods deficit -- the largest portion of the current account deficit -- increased to $218.6 billion in the third quarter from $210.6 billion in the second. U.S. goods exports increased to $262.1 billion from $252.8 billion, with gains in all major commodity areas. But that was overshadowed by goods imports, which increased to $480.7 billion from $463.4 billion, driven by increases in petroleum, the weak performance of U.S. automakers and demand for Chinese and other foreign goods, analysts said. "The deficit on petroleum and automotive products and with China totaled $170.8 billion or 78 percent of the $218.6 billion deficit on goods and services," said Peter Morici, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Business. The U.S. deficit on income earned from investments increased to $3.8 billion in the third quarter, from $2.2 billion in the second, in what Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics, called an "ominous sign of what happens when you run big deficits for long periods." "The is U.S. is now a hefty net external debtor and the income flows will continue to deteriorate," as the United States relies on foreign governments and other external sources to finance its current account gap, he said.
