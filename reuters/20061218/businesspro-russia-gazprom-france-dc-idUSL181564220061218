 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian and French gas companies Gazprom 
( GAZP.MM ) and Gaz de France GAZ.PA will sign several major 
deals on Tuesday, guaranteeing the Russian firm access to more 
end users in Europe, industry sources said on Monday. 

  Under the deal Gaz de France will agree extend all three of 
its long-term contracts to buy Russian gas to 2030 and will 
commit to buying new volumes via a new pipeline from Russia to 
Germany, which is being built by Gazprom and German firms.  Gazprom will in turn secure Gaz de France's approval to 
sell up 1-2 billion cubic meters a year of gas directly to 
French consumers as part of its declared strategic goal of 
reaching more end users in Europe to boost revenues.
