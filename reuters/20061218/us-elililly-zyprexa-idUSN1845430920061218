 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drug company Eli Lilly ( LLY.N ) has encouraged primary care physicians to use Zyprexa, a powerful drug for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, in patients who did not have either condition, the New York Times reported on its Web site on Monday, citing internal Lilly marketing materials. 

 The paper cited a Lilly executive saying she could not comment on specific documents but that the company had never promoted Zyprexa for off-label uses and that it always showed the marketing materials used by its sales representatives to the Food and Drug Administration, as required by law. "We have extensive training for sales reps to assure that they provide information to the doctors that's within the scope of the prescribing information approved by the F.D.A.," the paper cited Anne Nobles, Lilly's vice president for corporate affairs, saying in an interview. Lilly was not immediately available for comment.
