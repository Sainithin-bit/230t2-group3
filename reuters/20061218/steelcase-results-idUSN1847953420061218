 NEW YORK  Dec 18 (Reuters) - Steelcase Inc. ( SCS.N ), the
world's largest furniture maker, reported a 72 percent increase
in quarterly profit on Monday, topping Wall Street forecasts,
helped by strength in its international segment.  Third-quarter net income rose to $32.8 million, or 22 cents
a share, from $19.1 million, or 13 cents a share, a year
earlier.  Also in the quarter the company reduced its year-to-date
effective tax rate to 36.4 percent, which meant the rate for
the quarter decreased to 33.5 percent. When Steelcase reported
its second-quarter earnings on Sept. 20, the company predicted
an effective tax rate of about 37 percent.  Revenue rose to $802 million from $750.7 million.  Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had expected earnings
of 19 cents a share on revenue of $811.4 million.  The Grand Rapids, Michigan-based company said it expects
fourth-quarter earnings of 14 cents to 19 cents per share.
Analysts expected 19 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.  Steelcase shares were down 13 cents, or 0.7 percent, at
$17.97 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
