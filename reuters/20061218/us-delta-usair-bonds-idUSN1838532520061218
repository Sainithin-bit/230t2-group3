 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bond investors are betting that bankrupt Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK is worth more than the offer made by US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ). 

 Delta's bonds traded at around 67 cents on the dollar on Friday, traders said. With a claims pool estimated to be between $14 billion and $16 billion, current bond prices imply a valuation for the No. 3 U.S. carrier of $9.4 billion to $10.7 billion. Even at the low end, it's higher than US Airways' cash-and-stock bid currently valued at around $8.4 billion and suggests investors are anticipating a sweeter offer. At least one alternative for creditors is in the works: Delta's stand-alone plan. "It would be hard for Delta's management to make a case if they can't suggest a higher valuation," said Philip Baggaley, airlines analyst with credit rating agency Standard & Poor's. Delta, as expected, intends to present a stand-alone plan that values it higher than the US Airways' offer. Citing people familiar with the matter, the Wall Street Journal on Monday reported that Delta's plan, which could be filed as early as Tuesday, values the company at $10 billion to $12 billion. The Atlanta-based airline has repeatedly said it intends to emerge from bankruptcy as an independent carrier. The company has also said it will submit the plan to creditors by mid-December. Delta's plan, which will likely be more reliant on equity than cash, will establish a new mark that could force US Airways to raise its bid or encourage another airline to enter the fray. "Management has the burden of demonstrating that there is more value in a stand-alone emergence than that of a US Air or competing bid for Delta," said one Delta bond holder. Given Delta's resistance to US Airways' offer, the No. 7 U.S. carrier needs creditors to pressure Delta into opening its books in order to allow US Airways to perform due diligence, a condition of its offer. But Delta's official creditors' committee is likely to sit tight until they have a chance to review Delta's stand-alone plan and any competing bids that may follow. The committee - a key group in the airline's future - hasn't taken a position since US Airways made its proposal on November 15.
