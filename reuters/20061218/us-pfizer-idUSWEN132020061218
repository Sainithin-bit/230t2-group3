 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) on Monday boosted its quarterly dividend 21 percent after the surprise failure of its most important experimental drug that caused a sell-off in its shares, and gave its chief executive additional duties as chairman. 

 The world's largest drugmaker, which increased its first-quarter dividend to 29 cents from 24 cents, said Jeffrey Kindler would assume the additional duties of chairman beginning on Tuesday. Pfizer in late July chose Kindler, then the company's general counsel, to replace CEO Hank McKinnell, whom Wall Street had criticized for the company's poor performance during his five years at the helm. McKinnell initially was to remain chairman until he retired in February, more than a year before his earlier planned departure. But the company, in a change of heart, on Monday said McKinnell will remain on the board until February, but shed his role as chairman. Company shares fell almost 11 percent on December 4 after Pfizer halted development of torcetrapib, a drug meant to raise "good" cholesterol, due to deaths in clinical trials. Analysts predicted Pfizer would shore up shaken investor confidence by raising its dividend and accelerating cost cutting. "Substantially raising our dividend is an important step in meeting one of our key objectives: enhancing the total return for our shareholders," Kindler said in a release late on Monday. Pfizer, whose shares had fallen 40 percent since McKinnell became CEO in 2001, had been counting on torcetrapib to garner annual sales of $10 billion or more soon after its cholesterol fighter Lipitor loses patent protection in 2010. With the savior drug now scrapped and few other big drugs on the horizon despite the company's annual $7 billion research budget, analysts have said Pfizer will need to buy other drugmakers, or their products, to remain competitive once Lipitor sales dry up.
