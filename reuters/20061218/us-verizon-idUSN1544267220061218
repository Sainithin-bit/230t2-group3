 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. telephone carrier Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) is set to sign an agreement as early as Monday with five Asian telecoms companies to build the first high-speed, transpacific undersea cable system directly linking the United States and China, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday. 

 Some of the world's biggest telecoms companies are racing to tap China and other rapidly growing Asian markets by building faster pipelines for the surging volumes of Internet and phone traffic produced by multinational corporations and the region's consumers, the paper said. Citing the company, the WSJ said the planned $500 million project would offer an alternative to the single low-capacity cable that now provides the only direct link between mainland China and the U.S. Verizon's partners in the proposed roughly 11,200-mile cable system, called Transpacific Express, include China Telecommunications Corp., parent of China Telecom Corp. Ltd. ( 0728.HK ), and China Network Communications Group Corp, the paper said. Other participants are China United Telecommunications Corp. Ltd. ( 600050.SS ); South Korea's KT Corp. ( 030200.KS ); and Taiwan's Chunghwa Telecom Co. Ltd. ( 2412.TW ) ( CHT.N ), it said. Verizon could not be immediately reached for comment. Meanwhile, AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) is in talks with Telekom Malaysia Bhd and Singaporean carrier Starhub Ltd. ( STAR.SI ) to build a cable line linking Southeast Asia and the United States, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. The consortium could invest $400 million to $500 million if the deal is completed, the paper said, citing a person familiar with the matter.
