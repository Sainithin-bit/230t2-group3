 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Monday, with the Nasdaq off 1 percent, as worries about the sustainability of technology companies' profits offset earlier gains after at least $82 billion in corporate takeovers were announced. 

 Shares of Web search leader Google Inc. suffered the biggest tumble in a month, falling 3.4 percent to $463.80, after The Wall Street Journal said earnings growth at the Web search company may stall. "The market has been doing extremely well and we had the big up day in the middle of last week so we are consolidating that gain on light volume," said Michael Malone, a trading analyst with Cowen & Co. in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 7.21 points, or 0.06 percent, at 12,438.31. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 4.92 points, or 0.34 percent, at 1,422.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 24.02 points, or 0.98 percent, at 2,433.18. Shares of Apple Computer Inc. were the biggest drag on the Nasdaq, falling 2.8 percent to $85.23. Falling oil prices also hit energy shares as traders worried mild U.S. weather was curbing demand for heating oil. Shares of Exxon were down 2.3 percent to $75.50, while crude for January delivery fell $1.22 to settle at $62.21 a barrel. The CBOE Oil Index was down 2.6 percent. Among Monday's mega-deals, pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Inc. offered to buy rival Caremark RX for about $26 billion. The offer threatened to disrupt a deal brokered last month with drugstore chain CVS Corp. Caremark shares jumped 10.5 percent to $55.57, while CVS shares fell 1.8 percent to $29.96, both on the NYSE.
