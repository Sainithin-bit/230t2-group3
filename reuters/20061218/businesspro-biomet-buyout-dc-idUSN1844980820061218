 NEW YORK/LONOON  (Reuters) - Private equity firms have been 
moving into prime position to buy orthopedics maker Biomet Inc. 
BMET.O, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on 
Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

  An auction for the company is in its final days, the paper 
said, and could come to a head before year-end. A contender 
remains British orthopedics maker Smith & Nephew Plc ( SN.L ), 
the paper said, but it added that the buyout firms were seen as 
leading candidates at the final hour.  Smith & Nephew (S&N) shares jumped 5 percent in early 
London trading on speculation it would not be drawn into 
overpaying for Biomet and that it might become a bid target 
itself.  S&N declined to comment. Biomet could not immediately be 
reached for comment.  Analyst Martin Hall at brokerage Eden said the world's big 
three orthopedics makers -- Zimmer ( ZMH.N ), Johnson & Johnson 
( JNJ.N ) and Stryker ( SYK.N ) -- could all be potential bidders 
for S&N.  "If one of the others, or private equity firms, go for 
Biomet, I think there's a greater chance one of the big three 
(Zimmer, Stryker or Johnson & Johnson) would move in to break 
up Smith & Nephew," he said.  At 0910 GMT, S&N shares were up 4 percent at 502 pence, the 
biggest rise on the UK's benchmark FTSE 100 index  .FTSE .  Biomet said in April it had hired Morgan Stanley to explore 
strategic options, a week after long-time Chief Executive 
Officer and company founder Dane Miller abruptly resigned.  Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters earlier 
this month that S&N planned to bid about $11 billion for 
Biomet.  S&N Chief Executive Chris O'Donnell has said in the past he 
saw disadvantages to S&N being smaller than its major U.S. 
rivals and economies of scale could help improve margins.  But he has also cautioned that achieving cost savings in 
sales forces would not be easy, given the specialist nature of 
the products being sold.  Biomet has a market share of about $10.3 billion based on 
its closing share price on Friday of $41.98.  (Additional reporting by  Mark Potter  in London)
