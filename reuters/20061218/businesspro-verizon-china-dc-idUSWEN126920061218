 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Business ( VZ.N ) said on Monday 
it had signed a $500 million deal with a consortium that 
includes China Telecom ( 0728.HK ) and China Netcom ( 0906.HK ) to 
build an undersea optical cable system directly linking the 
U.S. mainland and China. 

  The construction and maintenance agreement is for a cable 
that will increase by 60 times overall existing direct-link 
capacity, Verizon said.  The consortium also includes China Unicom ( 0762.HK ), Korea 
Telecom 045760.KQ and Chunghwa Telecom ( 2412.TW ).  Construction, which will extend more than 18,000 
kilometers, is set to begin in the first quarter of 2007, with 
completion expected in the third quarter of 2008.
