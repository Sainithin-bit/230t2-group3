 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp. ORCL.O on Monday 
posted a higher quarterly profit, helped by revenue gains from 
new business software licenses fueled by acquisitions of former 
rivals like Siebel Systems and PeopleSoft. 

  Net income for the fiscal second quarter rose to $967 
million, or 18 cents per share, from $798 million, or 15 cents 
per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 26 percent to $4.2 billion.  Excluding items, the company posted a per-share profit of 
22 cents. Analysts on average were expecting the world's 
biggest database software maker to post a per-share profit 
before items of 22 cents on revenue of $4.16 billion, according 
to Reuters Estimates.  The results come as investors in the past six months have 
pushed up Oracle shares on increased confidence in its decision 
to spend about $20 billion buying up rivals over the past three 
years to push into the market for business applications as its 
core database software market matures.  Oracle shares have gained about 32 percent since June 15, 
when it first told investors of stronger-than-expected software 
license revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter. At the same time 
shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange of major rival SAP 
AG ( SAPG.DE ) of Germany have gained about 3 percent.
