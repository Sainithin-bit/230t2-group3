 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Orthopedic device maker Biomet Inc. BMET.O said on Monday it will be acquired by a private equity consortium for about $10.9 billion, ending talks with rival implant maker Smith & Nephew Plc. ( SN.L ). 

 News of the deal comes as the company also revealed it is embroiled in a probe over the timing of stock options grants. The consortium buying Biomet includes affiliates of the Blackstone Group BG.UL, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and TPG TPG.UL. The deal would mark the second-largest acquisition of a health-care company by a private equity group, behind the $21 billion leveraged buyout of hospital chain HCA, according to research firm Dealogic. Under terms of the agreement, Biomet shareholders will receive $44 per share. The deal is expected to close before October 31, 2007, the company said. Analysts said the potential delay of the deal's closing until October, likely due to the options probe, was weighing on the stock. Biomet shares were off 76 cents at $41.24 in midday trading on Nasdaq. A private-equity purchase will allow Biomet to retain its independence while buying time to sell or turn around underperforming business lines, analysts said. "We think there would have been a culture clash if Biomet had merged with a rival. So we think that maybe one of the reasons the board decided to go that way," Morningstar analyst Julie Stralow said. Biomet, which put itself on the auction block eight months ago, had also held talks with rival device maker Smith & Nephew Plc ( SN.L ) about a possible combination. Smith & Nephew on Monday said it had terminated those discussions. Biomet separately said it would delay reporting quarterly results as it reviews its stock options practices from 1996 to the present. The company said its board of directors created a special committee to investigate the issue after two shareholder lawsuits were filed alleging improper backdating of options grants. Warsaw, Indiana-based Biomet also said fiscal second-quarter net sales rose 5 percent to $520.3 million, at the low end of Wall Street expectations. Biomet in April said it hired Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) to help it explore strategic alternatives, a week after longtime Chief Executive and founder Dane Miller abruptly resigned. In a statement on Monday, Biomet said Miller may become an investor in the private company. The device maker also competes with Stryker Corp. ( SYK.N ), Johnson & Johnson's ( JNJ.N ) DePuy unit and Zimmer Holdings Inc. ( ZMH.N ) in the artificial hip and knee market. The deal could prompt the divestiture of noncore assets such as Biomet's dental or spinal products businesses, JPMorgan analyst Michael Weinstein said in a note to clients. The spine and trauma businesses in particular have been a drag on the company's results. "If Biomet can close half the profit gap with Zimmer, while at the same time lowering its tax rate, a deal even at $44 a share should generate a reasonable return," Weinstein said. The orthopedic industry has struggled with weaker pricing power in the past year, but aging and active baby boomers are expected to continue to drive demand for replacement joints. Merrill Lynch analyst Katherine Owen said fears the that investment group may launch a significant cost-cutting program could lead to some loss of market share for Biomet, but Miller's involvement could help mitigate those concerns. Biomet's board of directors has approved the merger agreement. The deal is subject to approval by Biomet shareholders and regulators.
