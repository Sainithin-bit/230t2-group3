 (Reuters) - Exelixis Inc. ( EXEL.O ) said it agreed to a 
collaboration with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. ( BMY.N ) to 
discover, develop and market new cancer therapies. 

  Under the deal, Bristol-Myers Squibb will pay Exelixis $60 
million in cash upfront, the biotechnology company said in a 
statement.  Exelixis will also receive $20 million for each of up to 
three different Investigational New Drug candidates selected by 
Bristol-Myers.  Exelixis said it will be responsible for the identification 
and pre-clinical development of small molecule drug candidates 
directed against mutually selected targets.  The companies plan to equally share development costs, 
profits and co-promotion activities in the U.S., Exelixis said 
and added it will also receive royalties on product sales 
outside of the U.S.  However, it added, for each program selected by 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Exelixis may opt out of the 
co-development or co-promotion in the U.S., in which case it 
would receive milestones and royalties in lieu of a U.S. profit 
share.  (Reporting by Sankalp Saini in Bangalore)
