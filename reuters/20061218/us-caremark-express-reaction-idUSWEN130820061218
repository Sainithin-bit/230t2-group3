 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pharmacy benefit manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N said on Monday it would review the unsolicited takeover proposal offered by rival Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), but that it continues to be bound by the terms of its earlier deal with drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ). 

 Earlier on Monday, Express Scripts said it offered to buy Caremark for about $26 billion, which Express said represented a 15 percent premium over CVS's offer. "Caremark's Board of Directors will review the terms of the proposal submitted by Express Scripts in a manner consistent with its obligations under the CVS merger agreement and applicable Delaware law," Caremark said in a statement.
