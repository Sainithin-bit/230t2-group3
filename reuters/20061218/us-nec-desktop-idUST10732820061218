 TOKYO  (Reuters) - NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ) said on Monday there had been two cases of power units inside its Japanese desktop computers catching fire, but no one was injured. 

 Japanese electronic conglomerate NEC said an outside manufacturer provided the power supply unit part that caught fire, but declined to name the supplier. The desktop in question is its Valuestar model, manufactured in Japan between November 2003 and June 2004. NEC said it had shipped 14,600 units of the model in Japan. Continued use of the desktops could cause a coil inside the power unit to spark and smoke, NEC said. The company said it would replace the power supply unit free of charge. NEC said it was calculating the cost of the replacement. The NEC cases come after several incidents of laptop batteries made by Japanese electronics makers Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) catching fire, triggering recalls and hurting profit. Prior to the announcement, NEC's share price closed up 0.7 percent at 572 yen, in line with the electrical machinery subindex .IELEC.T.
