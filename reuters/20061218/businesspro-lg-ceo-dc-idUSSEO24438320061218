 SEOUL  (Reuters) - LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) replaced 
on Monday its chief executive and other senior officials in a 
management reshuffle that analysts say is aimed at bringing in 
momentum to its stalled handset and display businesses. 

  The moves come as LG reported disappointing handset sales 
this year and struggles with falling flat-panel prices. 
Analysts are worried that fourth-quarter earnings could worsen 
from the third due to weak panel prices and the stronger won 
currency.  Nam Yong, former vice chairman of LG Corp. ( 003550.KS ) and 
CEO of LG Telecom Co. Ltd. 032640.KQ, will become LG 
Electronics' new CEO and vice chairman, the company said in a 
statement.  Nam replaces Kim Ssang-su, who had headed the country's top 
home appliance maker since 2003.  LG Electronics also promoted James Jeong, former head of 
corporate finance at the company, to replace chief financial 
officer Kwon Young-soo.  It also appointed Skott Ahn and Simon Kang as the new heads 
of its mobile communications and display businesses, 
respectively.  Media reports said on Monday Kwon was set to take the chief 
executive role at LG Electronics' loss-making flat-screen 
venture, LG.Philips LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ). LG.Philips could 
not confirm the reports.  "It appears the selection of Nam, former LG Telecom CEO, 
reflects pressure from the market to improve LG's handset 
business," said Kevin Lee, an analyst at Woori Securities.  However, many still remain skeptical about the reshuffle's 
impact on the company.  "We don't think one CEO will change the picture. If he had 
experience in running a global company, we'd be more 
confident," said Thomas Choi, head of research at PCA Asset 
Management.  LG was the world's fourth-biggest handset maker in 2005 but 
slid to the No. 5 spot in the third quarter, hit by fierce 
competition for price and design with Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and 
Motorola Inc. MOT.N.  It was the largest plasma display panel (PDP) maker in the 
third quarter, overtaking 2005's No.1 Samsung SDI Co. 
( 006400.KS ), but is facing dropping panel prices and tough 
competition from liquid crystal display (LCD) technology.  Shares in LG, also the world's biggest home-use air 
conditioner maker, rose 0.91 percent to 55,200 won by 0540 GMT, 
against the wider market's  .KS11  0.54 percent gain.
