 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Realogy Corp. ( H.N ), the former 
Cendant Corp. real estate company known for its Coldwell Banker 
franchise, said on Sunday that it would be sold for about $6.65 
billion to private equity firm Apollo Group. 

  Realogy was spun off from Cendant in August as part of that 
company's decision to break itself up into four companies. 
Cendant has since changed its name to Avis Budget Group Inc. 
CAR.N  The company said that the deal was worth about $9 billion, 
including debt of $1.6 billion. It also said that it was taking 
on other liabilities of $750 million.  Realogy said it would pay $30 per share, or an 18 percent 
premium over Friday's market close of $25.50, and a premium of 
26 percent over Realogy's average closing share price since its 
spin-off from Cendant on August 1.  Realogy also owns Century 21 and Sotheby's International 
Realty.  The company said it expects Chief Executive Henry Silverman 
to stay on through his current contract or December 31, 2007, 
after which he will be replaced by President Richard Smith.  Silverman is not an equity participant with Apollo in the 
acquisition, the company said.
