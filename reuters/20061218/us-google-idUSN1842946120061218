 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet search company Google Inc.'s ( GOOG.O ) earnings growth, which for the most part has been smooth and spectacular until now, may soon hit a speed bump, The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday. 

 Interest income -- the money the Internet search engine makes by parking its more than $10 billion cash hoard in interest-bearing investments like government securities -- isn't likely to grow at the same rate as last year, the Journal reported. Interest income jumped beginning in last year's fourth quarter after Google's cash stockpile grew when the company raised billions of dollars in two major stock offerings. Google was not immediately available for comment.
