 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc., working to beat back an $8.4 billion merger bid from US Airways Group Inc., is expected as soon as Tuesday to file a sweeping bankruptcy reorganization plan, The Wall Street Journal said on its Web site, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The paper said the plan values Delta DALRQ.PK at $10 billion to $12 billion. The range, representing the Atlanta airline's estimated market value after emerging from bankruptcy, is down from the $12 billion to $14 billion range the airline was calculating a few weeks ago, the paper said. US Airways ( LCC.N ) in November proposed a deal to buy Delta, which is restructuring under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection process and still plans to emerge next year as a stand-alone airline. Delta was not immediately available for comment.
