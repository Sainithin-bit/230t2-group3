 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Talks on finding investors to safeguard 
German influence in European aerospace firm EADS ( EAD.PA ) could 
push into early 2007, German government spokesman Thomas Steg 
said on Monday. 

  Steg also said that the potential investors were examining 
the contractual details to possible changes in the Airbus 
parent's shareholder structure.  "The investor groups are busy examining the contractual 
details," Steg told a government news conference.  "Whether things will be wrapped up this week, I can't say 
for sure. It could be that it will happen at the start of next 
year."  The talks center on what will happen to part of a stake in 
the company held by carmaker DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE.  DaimlerChrysler owns 22.5 percent of EADS shares and has 
signaled it intends to sell 7.5 percent. Berlin is eager to 
retain German influence in EADS, the parent of the troubled 
Toulouse, France-based aircraft maker Airbus, when 
DaimlerChrysler cuts its stake.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Berlin wants to 
keep German-French parity in the group.
