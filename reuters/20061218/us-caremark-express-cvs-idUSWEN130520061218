 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) said on Monday it has not had a chance to review Express Scripts Inc.'s ( ESRX.O ) bid for Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N but remains confident in its own offer to buy Caremark. 

 "We believe the prospects for completing that transaction are excellent and we remain confident in the long-term strategic value of our combination as well as the benefit to shareholders of CVS and Caremark," the drugstore chain said in a statement.
