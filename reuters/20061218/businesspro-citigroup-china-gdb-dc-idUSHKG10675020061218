 BEIJING  (Reuters) - A consortium led by Citigroup Inc. 
( C.N ) has won final regulatory approval for its $3.1 billion 
purchase of 85.6 percent of Guangdong Development Bank (GDB), 
the China Banking Regulatory Commission said on Monday, paving 
the way for a restructuring of the troubled southern China 
lender. 

  The CBRC's stamp of approval was the final chapter in a 
year-and-a-half battle for control of GDB between Citigroup and 
France's Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), which had assembled its 
own bidding team.  Citigroup, China Life Insurance Co. ( 2628.HK ) and China's 
State Grid Corp. are each taking 20 percent of GDB, while 
International Business Machines ( IBM.N ) will own 4.74 percent 
and China's CITIC Investment and Puhua Investment will take 
12.85 percent and 8 percent, respectively.  A Citigroup spokesman declined immediate comment.  According to the agreement on the Guangdong bank's 
restructuring plan, Citigroup's consortium is scheduled to 
complete the transaction on Monday, the CBRC said.  Citigroup and its investor team now face the challenging 
task of cleaning up GDB, which lost its president last week 
when Zhang Guanghua resigned to become designated CEO at rival 
China Merchants Bank Co. ( 3968.HK ) ( 600036.SS ), according to 
sources.  The Chinese lender has more than 500 branches and a strong 
position in Guangdong, China's richest province, but it had 
more than $6 billion in bad loans at the end of last year, 
according to sources.  That would give GDB a non-performing loan ratio of 25 
percent in a country where the average is 8 percent.  But China's booming economic growth has foreign lenders 
paying top dollar for banking assets, particularly as the 
market opens to foreign competition under Beijing's World Trade 
Organization obligations.  Citigroup, which is also in talks to increase its stake in 
Shanghai Pudong Development Bank ( 600000.SS ) to the maximum 
allowable 19.9 percent from below 5 percent, has applied to 
Beijing for local incorporation under the new rules.  (Additional reporting by Brian Kelleher in Hong Kong)
