 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Satellite company Loral Space & 
Communications Inc. ( LORL.O ), in partnership with a Canadian 
pension fund, is expected to announce a deal to acquire the 
Telesat satellite unit of BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ), Canada's biggest 
telecoms company, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web 
site. 

  Citing people familiar with the details, the paper said the 
deal was expected to be worth more than 3 billion Canadian 
dollars (US$2.6 billion).  As part of the transaction, Loral will contribute cash as 
well as all of its own satellite assets to form a new company, 
based in Canada, that will own and operate the combined 
satellite fleet, the paper said.  The paper said it was unclear which pension fund was 
participating in the deal.  Loral was not immediately available for comment.
