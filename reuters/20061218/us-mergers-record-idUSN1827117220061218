 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The value of global mergers and acquisitions, already at record levels for 2006, raced toward the end of the year with at least $82 billion in proposed deals announced on Sunday and Monday. 

 The latest proposed transactions will take the value of global mergers for 2006 to an all-time high of over $3.8 trillion, according to research firm Dealogic. The previous high was $3.332 trillion in 2000. Among the bigger deals, Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) agreed to acquire the oil and gas activities of Norsk Hydro ( NHY.OL ) for $30 billion, and U.S. pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ) offered to buy rival Caremark RX CMX.N for $26 billion. The global mergers boom has been driven by low interest rates, gains in stock markets, and liberal credit markets. Also fueling M&A has been private equity funds, also known as financial sponsors. At least three of the latest transactions involved private equity groups. Orthopedic device maker Biomet Inc. BMET.O agreed to be acquired by a private equity consortium for $10.9 billion. Real estate firm Realogy Corp. ( H.N ) agreed to be bought by private equity firm Apollo Group for $6.65 billion plus debt and other liabilities. And roofing products maker ElkCorp ELK.N agreed to be taken private by buyout firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL in a $1 billion deal. BOOM TO CONTINUE One expert said the merger boom should continue. "I don't see any reason why it should calm down," said Brian Sterling, co-head of investment banking at Sandler O'Neill & Partners. "The same drivers of transactions -- the state of the economy, the state of the industries, and all the macro and micro trends related to them -- don't look like they are going to change through year-end. "We expect volume of activity to continue." High-yield bond investors have also helped boost M&A activity by snapping up new debt issues at a record pace this year, allowing private equity firms to finance some of the largest buyouts in history. Dealogic said earlier this month the volume of mergers and acquisitions by private equity firms and other financial sponsors so far this year hit a record at over $626 billion, up about 90 percent from a year earlier. Further, private equity firms have raised about $300 billion in new funding worldwide this year, according to research by Private Equity Intelligence. This year's biggest deals include AT&T Inc.'s ( T.N ) proposed acquisition of BellSouth Corp. BLS.N for roughly $80 billion in the United States, and the roughly $47 billion offer by German utility E.ON EONG.DE for Spanish rival Endesa ( ELE.MC ).
