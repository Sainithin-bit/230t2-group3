 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Toll Holdings Ltd.'s ( TOL.AX ) Pacific 
National unit has won a A$1 billion ($780 million), seven-year 
contract to transport steel for Bluescope Steel Ltd. ( BSL.AX ) 
and OneSteel Ltd. OST.AX, sending Toll's shares up 2.5 
percent. 

  Pacific National said on Monday the new contract is 
Australia's largest rail freight contract, and said it built on 
existing partnerships with the two companies.  The contract would remain with Toll under a plan it 
announced last week to spin off A$8 billion worth of 
infrastructure assets, including Pacific National's rail 
freight network, into a separately listed company, while 
keeping its logistics business.  Toll shares rose 2.5 percent to a high of A$18.44, 
outperforming a 0.2 percent rise in the broader market.  ($1=A$1.28)
