 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp. ORCL.O on Monday posted a 21 percent rise in second-quarter profit, but sales of new software application licenses were weaker than Wall Street's forecast, sending its shares down 3 percent. 

 Larry Ellison, chief executive of the world's biggest database software maker, cited an inability to close deals in the quarter as a reason for the shortfall, rather than a broad slowdown in technology spending due to a stuttering economy. "Our analysis really was on the execution side of things," he told analysts on a conference call. "We think those deals are going to be coming back in Q3 and maybe a few in Q4." Oracle also issued a profit forecast for the current third quarter in line with analysts' estimates, and said margins would improve. Net income for the fiscal second quarter rose to $967 million, or 18 cents per share, from $798 million, or 15 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 26 percent to $4.2 billion. Excluding items, Oracle posted a per-share profit of 22 cents, in line with forecasts from analysts, who had forecast $4.16 billion in revenue, based on Reuters Estimates. Kim Caughey, who helps manage some $1 billion in assets at Fort Pitt Capital Group, said she was expecting the company to have signed more big deals during a quarter when businesses typically use up their technology budget for the year. "They were a little light on new software licenses for applications," she said. "I was expecting a little bit more from budget flush at the end of the year." Oracle shares fell 3 percent to $17.41 in extended trade from a Nasdaq close of $17.91, following losses this week on concern that the company's core database business would fall short of Wall Street forecasts. Despite the recent share price decline, Oracle stock has soared in recent months as investors gained confidence about the company's aggressive acquisition strategy. The company has spent some $20 billion buying rivals like Siebel Systems and PeopleSoft over the past three years to push into the business applications market as its core database software market matures. Since June 15, when Oracle first told investors of stronger-than-expected software license revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, Oracle shares have jumped about 32 percent. In the same period, shares of German rival SAP AG ( SAPG.DE ) traded on the New York Stock Exchange have gained about 3 percent. Ellison is betting Oracle will win more customers for its databases as it gains traction in the SAP-dominated market for business software applications, which help companies automate everything from human resources to accounting to payroll. Brendan Barnacle, an analyst at Pacific Crest Equities, said the results showed weakness in Oracle's database business in the Americas -- something a number of Wall Street analysts had predicted a week ago, which helped push down the stock. "This is completely consistent with that," he said. "We have seen the stock trade off in anticipation of that." Oracle Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz said database revenue growth in the Americas slowed considerably from a 19 percent rise last quarter, but that the business would rebound in the second half of the year. Sales of database products -- which make up the bulk of the company's revenue -- climbed 9.5 percent to $867 million and were in line with the average Wall Street estimate. Revenue from new software application licenses rose 28 percent to $340 million, at the low end of estimates. "It wasn't a very big-deal quarter at all," Catz told reporters on a conference call. "This was a real sort of meat and potatoes quarter for us." For the third quarter, she forecast earnings per share of 22 cents excluding special items, in line with Wall Street. Revenue from new software licenses in the third quarter is expected to rise between 16 percent and 22 percent from a year earlier, Catz told analysts on a conference call, adding that a weak dollar would continue to help lift results.
