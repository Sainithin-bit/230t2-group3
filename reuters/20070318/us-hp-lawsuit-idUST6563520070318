 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese TV supplier byd:sign Corp. has filed a lawsuit against Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) at a Texas court, claiming HP had obstructed byd:sign's flat TV sales in the United States, the Nikkei business daily said on Sunday. 


 Although the unlisted supplier of flat TVs has not made clear how much it is asking in compensation, the amount is likely to be as much as $100 million, the newspaper said. Byd:sign is claiming that HP's lawsuit in 2005 against the Tokyo-based company, in which the world's largest personal computer maker said a former HP employee working at byd:sign had leaked confidential information, has damaged its credibility in the United States, the paper said. Officials at byd:sign and HP's Japanese unit were not immediately available for comment. Byd:sign was established in 2003 by Katsumi Iizuka, a former president of Dell Inc.'s DELL.O Japan operations.
