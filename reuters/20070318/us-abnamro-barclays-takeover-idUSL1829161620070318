 LONDON  (Reuters) - Amsterdam-based ABN AMRO Holding NV AAH.AS has received M&A-related approaches from several rival banks in recent weeks after activist shareholders publicly pushed for a sale or breakup of the Dutch bank, sources familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 


 Banks including Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ), Dutch rival ING ( ING.AS ), Spain's BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) and France's BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) have all expressed interest -- directly or through advisers -- in either exploring a full merger with ABN AMRO or buying some of its large non-Dutch businesses, the sources said. ABN AMRO owns large retail banks in North America, Brazil and Italy and the activist investors, which include British hedge fund TCI, have said it should consider a sale or breakup to boost shareholder returns. Any talks being held by ABN AMRO with other banks are at a very early and uncertain stage, the sources added. "The whole world has approached ABN AMRO since TCI's statement," said one of the sources. Another source said ABN has reached no decision on how to proceed and a quick deal before a shareholder meeting being held next month is unlikely unless the bank is made a hugely compelling offer in the meantime by one of its suitors. Spokespeople for Barclays, which has, ABN AMRO and BBVA declined to comment. Barclays has approached ABN AMRO AAH.AS with a merger plan that would create a global bank worth 80 billion pounds ($155 billion), the sources added, confirming earlier UK newspaper reports. The Sunday Times said Barclays was "keen to act as a white knight to save ABN from its current problems." UP FOR SALE? Many industry analysts and bankers regard ABN as being ripe for a sale or breakup. However sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month that ABN AMRO was also considering other options such as selling stakes in foreign investments and boosting existing restructuring plans to return more cash to shareholders. TCI, which was part of a group of activist investors that torpedoed Deutsche Boerse'S ( DB1Gn.DE ) takeover bid for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) in 2005, in February said ABN was significantly undervalued and called on it to merge, sell or spin off some of its assets or potentially the whole business. Other investors have also put pressure on ABN's management for change and British hedge fund Toscafund last month called for it to be taken over after five poor years of performance. A showdown between ABN AMRO's management and these investors is possible at the bank's annual shareholder meeting in April. Barclays, Britain's third-biggest bank, has made no secret of its plans to expand internationally and in 2006 half its profits came from overseas, up from a quarter in 2004. In October 2005 Barclays President Bob Diamond told Reuters the bank wanted to be one of the top five banks globally, prompting analysts to suggest it could make some big overseas acquisitions. John Varley, chief executive, last month said acquisitions were an option to drive growth. "Our natural instinct is to grow organically but we don't rule out acquisitions," he said. He plans to open 350 branches overseas this year to add to Barclays' international footprint of more than 1,500 branches. Barclays last month unveiled a 35 percent jump in 2006 pretax profit to 7.1 billion pounds, the fastest growth of any of the major UK banks. Industry analysts have said a combination of ABN and Barclays would make good strategic sense, but so would a deal with many of the big European banks. ABN's international operations also make it attractive to other suitors. BNP, having bought Banca Nazionale del Lavoro in Italy last year, may take opportunities to expand in Italy's rapidly consolidating banking market, where ABN owns Banca Antonveneta. And BBVA, which had failed to buy BNL in 2005, could also want ABN's operations in the United States, where the Spanish giant own businesses in the South, and Brazil, which would complement BBVA's operations in other Latin American countries. Analysts have said Royal Bank of Scotland may also be interested in ABN's U.S. unit. Any tie-up, which would be the biggest ever cross-border banking deal in Europe, would also be hard to implement. In addition to its strong retail presence in several countries -- including the United States, where Barclays is trying to build up its investment banking business -- ABN's retail-focused fund management arm could fit well with Barclays Global Investors, which mainly has institutional clients. It is less clear how ABN's investment bank business, which includes UK corporate broker Hoare Govett, would fit with Barclays Capital, which has built a strong position in debt capital markets in recent years under Diamond.
