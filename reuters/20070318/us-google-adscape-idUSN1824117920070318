 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc. purchased video game advertising firm Adscape to expand into in-game advertising, the Internet search leader said on its Web site on Friday. 


 Financial details were not furnished. In February, technology site Red Herring reported the value of the expected deal at around $23 million, citing unnamed sources. Video game analysts in February said Google's entrance into the nascent field of advertising inside ever more elaborate video games could give the field a big boost. "As more and more people spend time playing video games, we think we can create opportunities for advertisers to reach their target audiences while maintaining a high quality, engaging user experience," Google said on its site. Microsoft last year paid $200 million to buy in-game ad company Massive Inc., which has secured deals with game publishers UbiSoft Entertainment SA, THQ Inc. and Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. "We think this rich environment is a perfect medium to deliver relevant, targeted advertising that ultimately benefits the user, the video game publisher and the advertiser," Google said.
