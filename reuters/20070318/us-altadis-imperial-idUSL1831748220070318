 LONDON/MADRID  (Reuters) - Britain's Imperial Tobacco Plc ( IMT.L ) said on Sunday it would continue "friendly" efforts to buy rival Altadis ALT.MCALDS.PA after the Franco-Spanish company rejected its 45 euros per share approach. 


 Imperial, which makes Lambert and Butler and Embassy cigarettes, offered 11.5 billion euros ($15.3 billion) for Altadis on Thursday and began a possible bidding war in the consolidating tobacco industry. Altadis, known for its Gauloises brand, turned down the Imperial offer as too low and sees 53 euros per share -- the price Japan Tobacco Inc ( 2914.T ) paid for British tobacco firm Gallaher Group Plc GLH.L -- as an adequate value, said a person familiar with the company. Imperial declined to comment on a report by Spain's Europa press agency that the company's Chief Executive Gareth Davis will next week tell Altadis he is prepared to sweeten his bid. "We've seen the Altadis announcement. We will be discussing it and look forward to progressing further friendly dialogue," said Imperial spokesman Alex Parsons. Imperial's informal approach on Altadis was considered a potentially hostile bid by members of the Franco-Spanish company's board, Spanish press reported on Sunday. Hostile bids are difficult to execute in the tightly regulated sector and have not been attempted in recent years. Shares in Imperial Tobacco rose strongly on Friday after its approach sparked talk U.S. giant Altria ( MO.N ), which makes Marlboro, might launch its own bid for the UK company, or team up with Altadis to do so. Analysts said British American Tobacco ( BATS.L ) might also launch a higher offer for Altadis after the Imperial approach represented a roughly 3 percent premium over the Franco-Spanish firm's market value at the close on Friday at 43.75 euros. Alternatively, Altadis might make its own bid for Imperial, some industry watchers said. Altadis on Saturday said it was reviewing its best options after its board unanimously rejected the Imperial bid on grounds it did not reflect the strategic value of the company. Around 50 percent of Altadis shares are in the hands of British and North American funds, among them Fidelity and Franklin Resources, as well as Morgan Stanley. Another 20 percent belongs to institutions in Spain and France while minority shareholders hold just 10 percent of the company. Franklin has said it would support Imperial's bid for Altadis if there were no other alternative. A combination of Imperial and Altadis would bring together the fourth and fifth largest tobacco groups in the world, but still leave it behind Altria, BAT and Japan Tobacco.
