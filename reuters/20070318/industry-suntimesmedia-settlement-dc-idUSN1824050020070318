 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sun-Times Media Group Inc. said on 
Sunday it has reached a settlement with its former president, 
David Radler, a defendant in a suit that accuses former 
executives of pilfering millions of dollars. 


  The company, formerly known as Hollinger International, 
also reached a settlement with publishing companies Horizon 
Publishing Co. and Bradford Publishing Co.  Sun-Times will receive $63.4 million in "new cash" from 
Radler and the other companies to settle the company's claims 
and potential additional claims related to recent findings into 
backdated stock options.
