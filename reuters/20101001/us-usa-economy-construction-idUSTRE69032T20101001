 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Construction spending rose unexpectedly in August as public construction rebounded, but investment in private projects fell to its lowest in more than 12 years, a government report showed on Friday. 

 The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.4 percent to an annual rate of $811.8 billion. July's construction outlays were revised to show a bigger 1.4 percent drop instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent fall. Economists polled by Reuters forecast construction spending falling 0.4 percent in August. Spending on public projects rebounded 2.5 percent after dropping 1.1 percent in July. State and local government spending on construction projects increased 2.7 percent in August after slipping 0.2 percent the prior month. Investment in private construction fell 0.9 percent to $498.2 billion, the lowest level since January 1998, extending July's 1.6 percent decline. Spending on private home building dipped 0.3 percent after falling 3.5 percent, suggesting the housing market was starting to stabilize after sharp declines in the wake of the end of a tax credit for home buyers. Private nonresidential spending fell 1.4 percent in August to the lowest level since August 2005, after rising 0.2 percent the prior month. This suggests that such structures, which include offices, power plants and factories, will be a drag on third-quarter gross domestic product.
