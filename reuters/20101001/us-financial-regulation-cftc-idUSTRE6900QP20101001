 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. futures regulator, in the roll-out on Friday of its first new rules under the sweeping financial reform law, proposed to limit the control of banks and other firms in the clearinghouses that will soon manage most trade in risky swaps. 

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission's proposal is an early test of how hard the agency intends to crack down on the previously unregulated market for swaps, the speculative investments blamed for accelerating the 2008-09 financial crisis. The clearinghouses that handle trades in the $615 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market are heavily controlled by big banks. And the plan to increase competition in the market -- one of up to 80 rules the CFTC will draft over the next year -- could unsettle Wall Street firms battling to keep their share of the lucrative trades. The financial reform law requires that most swaps trades be routed through clearinghouses, and in anticipation of that requirement banks had already begun to clear an increasing share of their swaps. CFTC commissioners voted 4-1 on Friday to advance the plan for comment for 30 days, despite concerns that it could curb investment in new clearinghouses and trading platforms. Jill Sommers, a Republican commissioner who cast the one dissenting vote, said the restrictions on ownership stakes and voting control by banks risk doing more harm than good and would "stifle competition." But CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said the rules are needed to open up an "exclusive club" of swaps clearinghouses to new players. "I, for one, think they've been too exclusive, sometime even frankly possibly hiding behind risk management to keep start-up swap dealers and smaller swap dealers out of the club," Gensler said. The plan's proposed restrictions on ownership stakes by banks and other firms attracted some immediate caution within the industry. CME Group Inc, the giant U.S. exchange and clearinghouse operator, said the CFTC should be wary of "unintended consequences" such as discouraging clearing and adding costs. "This is definitely a slippery slope when it comes to ownership numbers and caps," said Paul Zubulake, senior analyst at Aite Group, a research and consultancy firm. "This could just create mass confusion, being told how your company is being structured," he said. CAPS ON OWNERSHIP Swaps are bets on the direction of currencies, interest rates, debt or commodity prices that companies use to hedge their risk. Credit default swaps were blamed for accelerating the financial crisis when dealers like insurer AIG found themselves on the wrong side of contracts during the slide. The CFTC rules are part of a broad overhaul, enshrined into law in July, of how U.S. financial markets are policed and how risks to the system can be identified and contained before they erupt into another crisis. Requiring that most swaps trade be routed through clearinghouses is designed to spread the risk of a default among many players, instead of having risk concentrated between two players in a bilateral contract. Clearinghouses also set margin requirements that are designed to decrease risk by providing a cushion against potential losses. The CFTC's proposals come ahead of related regulations still expected from the Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulators. Some elements will hinge on decisions made by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council, slated to hold its first meeting on Friday. The CFTC's ownership limits on clearinghouses go beyond reforms planned by European regulators, who do not propose similar restrictions, Commissioner Scott O'Malia said. Under the CFTC plan, there would be a 20 percent cap on voting stakes for members of clearinghouses, exchanges and swap execution facilities, to be phased in within two years. Banks, non-bank financial firms, swap dealers and major swap participants would not be allowed to collectively own more than 40 percent of a clearinghouse, under the plan. The plan does not, however, limit ownership of non-voting shares of swaps trading and clearing venues by banks. Chris Hehmeyer, chief executive of HTG Capital Partners, a Chicago-based proprietary trading firm, and vice chairman of the National Futures Association, said big players shouldn't completely control clearinghouses, but the 40 percent aggregate cap might be too restrictive. "I would tend to think they can find some middle ground," Hehmeyer said. Once the CFTC considers comments to determine whether to revise the proposal, it will face a final vote from commissioners, currently slated for January. The agency must allow for competition while protecting markets from undue risk, said Commissioner Bart Chilton. "The government shouldn't be a control freak, and I'm not suggesting this proposal is," Chilton said. CUSHION AGAINST DEFAULT Beyond CME, other clearinghouse operators that may be affected by the rules include IntercontinentalExchange Inc and Options Clearing Corp. In addition, NYSE Euronext and the Depository Trust Clearing Corp are in the process of applying to open a new clearinghouse called New York Portfolio Clearing. The CFTC also proposed clearinghouses have a financial cushion in case of a major default by a clearing member. Most would be compelled to have enough reserves to meet obligations if their largest clearing member defaulted. Clearinghouses deemed to be "systemically important" must be able to handle the default of its two largest clearing members, as well as meet other financial requirements, the CFTC said.
