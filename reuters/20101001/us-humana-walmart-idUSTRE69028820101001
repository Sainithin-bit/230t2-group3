 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer Humana Inc ( HUM.N ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) will team up to offer a U.S. Medicare prescription drug coverage plan next year that will have the lowest premiums in the country, the companies said on Friday. 

 The Humana Walmart-Preferred Rx Plan will cost $14.80 per month in premiums for prescription drug coverage in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., the companies said in a joint press release. The monthly premium is less than half the average premium for Medicare prescription drug plans this year, the companies said. Other features of the plan include co-payments for generic drugs as low as $2 when using preferred pharmacies such as Walmart and Sam's Club, and no co-pays for some generic prescriptions filled through Humana's mail-delivery service. About 18 million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in plans that offer prescription drug coverage only, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation think-tank. Humana is one of the largest providers of plans under Medicare, the U.S. government health coverage program for seniors. The Louisville, Kentucky-based insurer expects the low-price plan will help it expand membership in its Medicare stand-alone prescription drug plans, as well as expand its mail-order prescription volumes. Wal-Mart expects to expand its prescription volumes through the co-branded plan, according to Humana. The low-priced plan may spark concern on Wall Street that Humana is overly sacrificing profit margins to gain membership. Humana said it expects the co-branded plan's profit margin "will contribute" to its overall target of a 5 percent pretax operating margin. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ; editing by John Wallace)
