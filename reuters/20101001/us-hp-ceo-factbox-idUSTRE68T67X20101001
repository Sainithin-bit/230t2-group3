 NEW YORK (Reuters)-- Hewlett-Packard Co announced that Leo Apotheker, 57, would be its new chief executive. Here's a look at Apotheker's past. 

 * Apotheker was born September 18, 1953 in Aachen, Germany to parents who were Holocaust survivors. * He was initially named co-chief executive of German software company SAP with Henning Kagermann in April 2008 and continued when his counterpart retired in 2009. * He was the first executive unable to write software code promoted to SAP's top spot. His background is in sales, management and strategy. * He led SAP's $7.5 billion acquisition of business intelligence maker Business Objects, agreed in 2007 and completed in 2008. It was SAP's first major acquisition. * Some analysts have said SAP lacked a clear, cohesive strategy under Apotheker. * Under Apotheker's reign, SAP had its first round of major job cuts -- some 3000 staff -- in January 2009. * Apotheker suddenly stepped down as SAP's CEO in February 2010 amid investor dissatisfaction. * Apotheker graduated in International Relations and Economics from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. * Before joining SAP, he served as a managing partner at ABP Partners, a consulting firm that focused on the restructuring of ailing software companies. * Fluent in five languages -- Dutch, English, French, German, and Hebrew -- Apotheker has lived in Germany, Israel, France and Belgium.
