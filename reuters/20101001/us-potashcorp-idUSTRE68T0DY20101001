 WINNIPEG  (Reuters) - A far-reaching, independent report on the economic impact of a Potash Corp ( POT.TO ) takeover will set the tone for a Canadian political response to BHP Billiton's $39 billion hostile bid or any other offer that surfaces. 

 The report, due on Monday, will consider three possible scenarios, including a Chinese-led bid for the world's largest fertilizer supplier, its author said on Friday. But while the report's findings are expected to be influential, a final decision on whether a bid represents a "net benefit to Canada," as required under the Investment Canada Act, is still weeks away. Glen Hodgson, chief economist at the Conference Board of Canada, said in an interview that his report considered the impact of an industry-led takeover such as BHP's initiative; a move by a potash-consuming nation such as China; and a takeover by an investment board or sovereign fund. But the 50-to-100-page report makes no recommendations. "We certainly point to the implications and offer a few thoughts on adjustments that could be made," he said. Potash Corp, based in Saskatchewan, has rejected BHP's bid as inadequate and said other parties interested in putting forward alternative proposals have approached it. The company is the No. 1 global supplier of a commodity needed to help feed the growing populations of China, India and other nations. Saskatchewan will release the report on Monday, and then take days, perhaps weeks, to finish its presentation to federal officials, a provincial government source said. Influenced by the province, Ottawa could veto any deal it believes would not have a net benefit for Canada. Chinese chemical maker Sinochem ( 600500.SS ) has approached several parties, including Russian fertilizer maker Uralkali ( URKA.MM ), to try to assemble an offer, sources have said, apparently with little success so far. "Sinochem in China would be a very, very good example of the kind of organization that could be working probably in the interest of consumers, and we try to work through these conceptual scenarios," Hodgson said. As China is the world's top potash consumer, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall has said he worries China would seek to weaken prices of the crop nutrient if it bought the company. The provincial government as recently as Wednesday repeated concerns that a successful bid by Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP could slash royalty and corporate tax revenues. The province's submission to Ottawa is likely to red-flag concerns about BHP skirting the Canpotex marketing cartel and thereby weakening both potash prices and royalties. Saskatchewan's concerns about the deal are in sync with a cautious public, said University of Regina professor Thomas McIntosh. Wall's right-of-center government is in the awkward position of potentially opposing a takeover bid while looking to boost foreign investment elsewhere, which makes an independent report a political help, McIntosh said. "It actually has the potential to really set the tone and the framework of the debate," he said. "I think that's what they're hoping for. That the report is clear enough that it gives them the ability to say, 'if the company is to be sold, these are the conditions.'" In Canada's House of Commons, a Conservative government member of Parliament said its review of the takeover will be "rigorous." The opposition had compared the deal to an unpopular, earlier takeover by nickel miner Vale ( VALE5.SA ) BHP also faces opposition in court. It said on Friday it expected to lodge a motion within days to challenge a Potash Corp lawsuit to fend off the $39 billion hostile bid. BHP said its lawyers were finalizing details of the dismissal motion, which could be filed as early as Friday. "Sometime in the next few days is right," a BHP spokeswoman said when asked about the timing. Potash filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Chicago last week, alleging that BHP misrepresented material facts related to its bid. BHP has said it planned to "vigorously" contest the lawsuit. ($1 = C$1.03) (Additional reporting by  Michael Smith ,  Louise Egan  and  David Ljunggren ; Editing by Frank McGurty and  Janet Guttsman )
