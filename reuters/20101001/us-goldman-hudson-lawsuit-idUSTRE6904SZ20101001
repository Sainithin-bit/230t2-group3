 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A fund manager who invested in a Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) subprime mortgage-linked security called Hudson Mezzanine sued the firm for fraud over the product, which is the subject of several investigations. 

 A lawsuit filed in federal court in New York on Friday compares the structure and disclosures for Hudson collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) to Abacus 2007-AC1, the mortgage deal that cost the firm $550 million in July when it settled a civil fraud case brought by securities regulators. Dodona I LLC, a hedge fund formed by Alan Brody in 2007 to invest in pieces of CDOs, seeks unspecified damages and class action status on behalf of investors in two Goldman offerings -- Hudson Mezzanine Funding 2006-1 Ltd and Hudson Mezzanine Funding 2006-1 Corp -- the lawsuit said. "In a classic case of 'heads we win, tails you lose,' the defendants failed to disclose to investors both that the CDOs were structured by defendants such that they were doomed to lose value" and that Goldman "would profit enormously from proprietary short positions when the CDOs did lose value," the complaint said. Goldman spokesman Michael DuVally said, "this suit is without merit and we'll contest it vigorously." Goldman has been the subject of several regulatory proceedings and investigations in the United States and Britain following huge losses in the Hudson CDO securities and similarly toxic financial instruments. Goldman constructed the $2 billion so-called synthetic CDO in late 2006 and was the sole counterparty, the complaint said. More than 70 percent of Hudson Mezzanine had AAA ratings, but 18 months later it was downgraded to junk status. The lawsuit argues that the losses from investing in Hudson CDOs were not caused by the general decline in the value of real estate or any other sector of the economy, but directly as a result of the alleged misconduct of Goldman. Dodona I said it bought $4 million of the Hudson CDO securities on February 6, 2007 and January 24, 2007. It said it bought the securities at 95 cents on the dollar or 100 cents on the dollar. It sold them at a huge loss on October 9, 2007 -- just 2.5 cents on the dollar. In April, a U.S. Senate subcommittee said its investigation of toxic assets that contributed to the financial crisis had concluded Goldman profited from shorting subprime mortgage-related assets, in some cases to the detriment of its clients. The committee cited Hudson, Abacus, Timberwolf and Anderson CDOs. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission served civil fraud charges in April against Goldman over Abacus and one of its employees, Fabrice Tourre. The firm settled in July and the individual case continues. In June, an Australian hedge fund, Basis Yield Alpha Fund, sued Goldman to recoup the $56 million it lost on the Timberwolf CDO. The case is Dodona I, LLC v Goldman Sachs et al, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-7497. (Reporting by Grant McCool. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
