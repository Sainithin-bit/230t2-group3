 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending rose slightly more than expected in August, but inflation remained subdued, leaving the door open for the Federal Reserve to launch a fresh round of monetary policy easing. 

 More action by the U.S. Federal Reserve to boost growth will likely be warranted unless the economic outlook improves, a top Federal Reserve official said on Friday. William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said current conditions of high unemployment and low inflation are "wholly unacceptable". DATA KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said on Friday spending increased 0.4 percent after rising by the same margin in July. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of U.S. economic activity, rising 0.3 percent in August. * The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of consumer inflation -- the personal consumption expenditures price index, excluding food and energy -- rose only 0.1 percent for a fourth straight month. * In the 12 months through August, the core PCE index increased 1.4 percent for the third consecutive month. COMMENTS: TOM SIMONS, MONEY-MARKET ECONOMIST, JEFFERIES & CO., NEW YORK: "I would say (the Dudley speech) is extremely dovish. it's also very important. "The tone of his speech says to me that if it were up to him exclusively he would be buying assets today, essentially. This is the most significantly dovish speech we've heard from a Fed official in this recent debate. "Also significant is he assigns a number to what a purchase program might be and what it might do. Beforehand, we heard Fed officials say that buying assets would eventually lower mortgage rates...but none of them were confident enough to actually assign a number. "The speech definitely significantly raises the chances that we get some kind of stimulus on November 3, but I don't think it's going to be all at one time and I think it's still data dependent. "The problem right now is we had two sort of conflicting events. We had a solid piece of data in the personal income and spending report and we had the dovishness in this speech. The one thing I can say about Dudley is this is not out of character for him... there is the sort of baked in the cake expectation from him. But I think the Dudley speech is far more important." JOHN CANALLY, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "The data this week were on the borderline between a slow slog and a double-dip recession for the most part, where the Fed has to do more for growth. More quantitative easing is on the way. "The morning's data come right within expectations. But the Fed have to looking further out. It may see the track of growth being too slow. It may be too close for comfort for them in terms of deflation. I don't know whether they will do it (QE) in November or December. "The market is reacting to bad news as almost good news because that means the Fed has to do something. This should be good for stocks and gold. We are looking at re-inflation trades. Bonds are on the edge of quantitative easing. They should not react as much as they did with the first round of quantitative easing." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The numbers this morning are a sign the economy is holding together, reducing the likelihood we'll see quantitative easing. Dudley is saying under current conditions, the Fed might want to ease. But the market feels that if economic news starts to come in better than expected, that reduces the likelihood the Fed will take action." PAUL NOLTE, MANAGING DIRECTOR, DEARBORN PARTNERS, CHICAGO: "All the data was pretty well in line with expectations, but the income data could be a very early indication that incomes are starting to recovery a little bit, which of course would be a good thing. "Traders are paying attention to this, but the ISM number will be the real driver for trading. There have been some indications outside of the Chicago purchasing manager's index that manufacturing is a little on the weak side. I'm expecting it to tick down a little, but remain above 50, so still expanding." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "The reasonably good statistics, particularly on the spending side are not going to provide the dollar with support in the face of policy paralysis in Washington and pending quantitative easing. "Right now the dollar weakness is across the board so we hit any technical or specific strength in a currency and it will just be exacerbated. The yen will follow the same path of dollar weakness and yen strength. It is already back to intervention levels."
