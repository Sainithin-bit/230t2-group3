 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission on Friday proposed caps on voting ownership in clearinghouses and venues for trading swaps as the regulator introduced the first in a series of rules designed to clamp down on the once-unregulated over-the-counter market. 

 The CFTC, in its first extensive roll-out of measures to implement the Wall Street reform bill, proposed three rules, including a 20-percent cap on voting stakes in clearinghouses, exchanges and swap execution facilities. Banks, nonblack financial firms, swap dealers and major swap participants would not be allowed to collectively own more than 40 percent of a clearinghouse, the CFTC said in its plan, which will be finalized by January. But the agency did not limit ownership of nonvoting shares of swaps trading and clearing venues by banks, which currently dominate trade. The regulator said it would give existing companies two years, or two board elections, to comply with the new rules. "We're not necessarily looking for grandfathering but we're allowing a long transition period for existing (clearinghouses exchanges and swap execution facilities) to come into compliance," a CFTC staff member told reporters in a briefing. The CFTC also proposed clearinghouses have a financial cushion in case of a major default by a clearing member. Most would be compelled to have enough reserves to be able to meet financial obligations if their largest clearing member defaulted. Those clearinghouses deemed to be "systemically important" must be able to handle the default of its two largest clearing members, as well as meet other financial requirements, the CFTC said. The agency will accept public comments on the rules for at least 30 days before finalizing them. It also said swaps entered into before the Dodd-Frank bill was enacted in July would need to be reported to a swap depository, or the agency until permanent reporting rules are put into place.
