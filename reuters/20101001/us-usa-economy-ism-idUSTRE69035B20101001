 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Growth in the manufacturing sector slowed in September, according to the Institute for Supply Management, as the economic recovery continues in fits and starts. 

 CONSTRUCTION SPENDING: U.S. construction spending rose unexpectedly in August as public construction rebounded, but investment in private projects fell to its lowest in more than 12 years, a government report showed on Friday. THOMSON REUTERS/U OF MICHIGAN CONSUMER SENTIMENT: U.S. consumer sentiment improved more than expected in September, but was still stuck at its weakest level in more than a year due to economic worries among upper-income families, a survey released on Friday showed. KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management on Friday said its index fell to 54.4 in September from 56.3 in August. A reading above 50 suggests growth in manufacturing nationwide. * The Commerce Department said construction spending rose 0.4 percent to an annual rate of $811.8 billion. July's construction outlays were revised to show a bigger 1.4 percent drop instead of the previously reported 1.0 percent fall. Economists polled by Reuters forecast construction spending falling 0.4 percent in August. * While manufacturing has expanded every month since August 2009, the pace of growth has slowed in recent months amid signs a broader U.S. recovery was running out of steam. * The index's new orders component fell for a fourth straight month, to 51.1 from 53.1. Prices paid, however, jumped to 70.5 from 61.5. COMMENTS: RONALD SIMPSON, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, ACTION ECONOMICS, TAMPA, FLORIDA: "ISM was little under expectations, but still not a horrible number. As a result, we see the dollar firming against the euro currently. In the bigger picture, especially after (William) Dudley this morning saying QE will be likely if the economy doesn't change course and based on how much the dollar has been beaten up lately ever since the FOMC meeting, the market is looking at the data a little more carefully than it had been. "The only chance to keep the dollar supported for the near term is if the numbers start looking better and they have for the last week or two. A lot of the future for the dollar is going to depend on the data. If the data stays decent, the market will start to price out quantitative easing. It's going to take a little bit of time now." TODD SCHOENBERGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, LANDCOLT TRADING INC., AUSTIN: "I see a lot of twisted economic news over the last several weeks. We are getting some okay numbers. The overall economic data are actually showing recovery so why do we need QE2? "But the Fed has only provided statements that the market should expect QE2. The only question is how much. That is the catalyst for the advancement for stocks and bonds." CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS: "The market had a head-fake from the Chicago PMI. The last time you had a slow-growing economy during 2002 and 2003, the ISM fell to 45. "That drop is being foreshadowed in today's report in the difference between the index component readings on orders and inventories. If you track the headline number against this gap it suggests the overall index will fall another 7 points. It fell two points today and the market looks for further declines. The market is looking for a big decline in the ISM. And since ISM is the single best predictor of the federal funds rate, if the ISM is going to fall another 7 points the Fed is sure to ease. That reinforces the point that (New York Federal Reserve Bank President William) Dudley said earlier today that the economy doesn't have to deteriorate at all from here for the Fed to ease." SEAN INCREMONA, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "ISM was pretty much in line with expectations but I'm not really impressed with the breakdown. New orders slowed for the fourth consecutive month and weakness in the production and employment components. Overall, on net it does not look very promising. "The UMich revision was higher than expected but a shade below what we were expecting -- we think that reflects how equities bottomed in September and then came back." BRIAN BATTLE, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING, PERFORMANCE TRUST CAPITAL PARTNERS, CHICAGO "The data should take the wind out of the camp thinking there's no inflation to worry about, but the data is going to be unreliable on a month-to-month basis since the recovery is so uneven. It's going to be very volatile and there's a lot of uncertainty about the labor market and government policy. "The construction spending number is background noise, and while the sentiment number was good, a change of 1 point isn't a trend. If you graph the number over the past few months, it could signal that we have a little downdraft going here. It is very difficult to be an investor right now because signals are being crossed." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "ISM was a little bit disappointing after we had the better than expected Chicago PMI yesterday and it is going to continue to weigh on the dollar. The most we can expect to see would be some pullback in the yen crosses." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes trimmed gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices added to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar cut losses against the euro but fell against the yen.
