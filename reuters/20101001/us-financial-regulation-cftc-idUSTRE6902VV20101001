 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Commodity Futures Trading Commission proposed its first three of dozens of new rules on Friday that will police the $615 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. 

 The agency is working on rules in 30 topic areas, and some analysts estimate it will eventually propose as many as 80 detailed regulations -- the first drafts of which the CFTC has said it plans to unveil by the end of the year. Here are details of the new rules proposed on Friday. GOVERNANCE, LIMITS ON OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL * Goal: prevent conflicts of interest at clearinghouses, exchanges and swap execution facilities (SEFs), such as determining who or what products can clear and trade. * No restrictions on nonvoting equity. * Exchanges and SEF members cannot own or control more than 20 percent of any class of voting equity. * Clearinghouses can apply for a waiver from the CFTC. * Otherwise, clearinghouses have two choices for limits. * First option for clearinghouses includes an aggregate limit: members cannot own or control more than 20 percent of any class of voting equity -- and no more than 40 percent of voting equity collectively owned or controlled by banks, nonbank financial companies supervised by the Fed Reserve, swap dealers, and major swap participants. * Second option for clearinghouses: five percent limit on voting equity and five percent limit on voting rights by members, banks, nonbank financial companies supervised by the Fed Reserve, swap dealers, and major swap participants. * Boards of directors must have at least 35 percent but no less than two public directors. * Parent companies exercising direct control over the day-to-day business of clearinghouses, exchanges or SEFs would have to comply with the same rules for board composition. * New detailed rules for composition of board committees, and for the involvement of public directors on nominating, disciplinary, membership, risk management and regulatory oversight committees. * Proposal will be open for comment for at least 30 days. * Rules to be finalized by Jan 14. * Parts of the proposal would become effective 60 days after being finalized, while others would take effect in September * Existing clearinghouses, exchanges and SEFs could have two years to phase in rules. FINANCIAL RESOURCES FOR CLEARINGHOUSES * Goal: ensure clearinghouses have enough reserves if a member can't meet its obligations. * All clearinghouses would need to maintain enough default resources to be able to meet financial obligations even if largest clearing member were to default. * A clearinghouse deemed "systemically important" by regulators would need to maintain default resources to withstand defaults by the two largest clearing members. * Default resources include margins of defaulting clearing member, clearinghouse capital, guaranty fund deposits, default insurance, and potential assessments for additional guaranty fund contributions. * Clearinghouses would also need to maintain capital to cover operating costs for at least one year, including six months' worth of cash, liquid securities and line of credit. * "Stress testing" of resources required quarterly. * Proposal will be open for comment for at least 30 days. REPORTING OF SWAPS DONE BEFORE DODD-FRANK * Requires unexpired swap contracts inked before law signed to be reported to a swaps data repository or to the CFTC. * Must report value and price of transaction, date and time it was done, whether it was cleared, and other details. * Reporting must happen within 60 days of a swap data repository becoming registered by the CFTC, or by a compliance date to be detailed at a later date. * Rule is final, but CFTC will accept public comments, and could tweak the details.
