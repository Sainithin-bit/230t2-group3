 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Market regulators say a massive sale of futures contracts by Waddell & Reed exacerbated the market's plunge on May 6, in what has become known as the "flash crash." 

 KEY POINTS: * The crash resulted in high volatility in markets and a liquidity crisis. * The May 6 crash sent the Dow Jones industrial average down some 700 points in a matter of minutes before sharply recovering -- an unprecedented breakdown that exposed deep flaws in the electronic marketplace now dominated by high-frequency trading. * Citing an internal exchange document, Reuters on May 14 reported that Waddell & Reed sold a large order of e-minis during the plunge. [ID:nN14198678] * The report cites a "liquidity crisis" in the S&P's E-Mini futures contract, a trade executed by Waddell & Reed. A sell program of 75,000 E-Mini contracts were executed in a 20-minute period, much faster than normal for a program of that size. COMMENTS: JEFF RUBIN, MARKET STRATEGIST AT BIRINYI ASSOCIATES IN WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT: "The real issue is what changes will come out from this. They found - reading some of the headlines - a big, large trade causes the market to go down. What are they going to do to prevent this, what will be the changes that will come from this? That is really more important than what the report is finding right now. "They can do lots of things. Since May 6 we've been discussing the issue that they put in these 10 percent (single stock) circuit breakers. And they are still getting triggered and there are still stocks trading at 1 cent when they were trading at $75 a second or two before. "Why can't you make a rule that no trade can happen more than 5 percent from the last sale, or 3 percent or something that has to do with liquidity or the price of the stock. So someone goes out there to sell - whether it's futures or what have you - and there happens to be no bid at the time it can't trade at zero. "Let's say the lowest (a stock) could trade from $100 - just an arbitrary point and I don't know if this is the right number - is $97, which is 3 percent; and the next trade can be 3 percent below $97. So a stock can still go down in a matter of seconds but at least you're not getting someone selling a million shares of stock at the market and the market happens to be nothing. "It would also stop the 'fat finger' trades where someone goes in to try to sell 10,000 shares and adds two extra zeros onto it, which can cause havoc in the short term. "It's ruining the individual investors' appetite for equities and you see that from the continued outflow from mutual funds. People get disenchanted when they see stocks that trade at zero. "Let's try to correct what's broken in this market. There clearly is something broken and investors continue to be disheartened." KURT BRUNNER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SWARTHMORE GROUP, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA: "They blamed it on Waddell and now it's a matter of have we done enough to fix it? "From what I read there were enough to handle the trades for a period of time, but there just weren't enough people to pick up the other side and all hell broke loose, as we all know. "You have all these levels of sophistication but are there enough safeguards in place that can alleviate unintended consequences? That's where there's still going to be some concern and caution. I don't believe that just because this report is out it makes everybody feel good. "No system is completely fool-proof. The regulators have set up some safeguards and tried to make things better. That's what you have to do, you have to keep trying to improve." GIRI CHERUKURI, HEAD TRADER AT OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: On the circuit breakers: "I think it's a step toward restoring confidence, but I think it's still a work in progress on what the best way is to make sure we have liquidity all of the time. "It's one fix right now, and it'll take time to see how it works out. The thing is there can be legitimate reasons for a stock to move dramatically in a short period of time, so I think you want to allow that to happen when it's legitimate, but when it's not, you want some type of alert to know what's going on." MICHAEL JAMES, SENIOR TRADER, REGIONAL INVESTMENT BANK WEDBUSH MORGAN, LOS ANGELES: "I think most people within the business are not necessarily surprised by any of the specific revelations in the report. "I don't think anything from the report is going to be encouraging for people to feel better about the market structure or cause (further) concerns about the market structure. "I don't think anything from the report is going to change the perception of the average retail investor about the functioning of the equity marketplace. I think what needs to happen is for there to be more concrete resolution to ensure greater liquidity and safeguards against a potential drop of the magnitude we saw in May. "Unless those are more focused on, retail investors that are staying away from the market are going to continue to stay away. More needs to be done by the government regulatory bodies to greater publicize the safeguards that have been put in place and that will be put in place in the near future." RANDY FREDERICK, DIRECTOR OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, SCHWAB CENTER FOR FINANCIAL RESEARCH, TEXAS, AUSTIN: "It makes it more clear, more transparent in terms of understanding what happened and that's always a positive. But what retail investors are really looking for is what will prevent it from happening again. This is the biggest key." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING IN WASHINGTON: "Not that the market is going to move after this report. But it is certainly a possibility that down the line we will have some increased oversight in trading as a result of this report. The truth is when it comes to the U.S., there are so many questions out there on trading regulation, taxes, benefits, growth that for me this is just another 'sell the U.S., sell the dollar' event." SAL ARNUK, CO-MANAGER OF TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY: "The report is about 104 pages long, so we're still reading and digesting it. The first 10 pages are a summary of what happened, and it looks like the SEC breaks down with a liquidity crisis in the e-mini futures, and then a second wave crisis in equities. "On first glance, we're noting that it seems to say high-frequency traders were in general net sellers in the 'in' stocks, and many OTC market makers, who normally internalize a significant portion of the orders that come in, all turned and routed (elsewhere). Instead of taking positions themselves, they flooded the public market, creating a rush of orders. "Everyone needs to digest, and not only feel comfortable that regulators know what happened but that they're protecting everyone. When that happens, the retail investor will come back, and I'll be very long that day."
