 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's top court on Friday ruled in favor of billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Industries ( RELI.BO ) in a gas-pricing dispute with younger brother Anil's Reliance Natural Resources ( RENR.BO ), making the price fixed by the government as binding. 

 The ruling closes a chapter on a high-profile battle that could set the tone for the country's policy on gas pricing. The case involves terms of a deal under which Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries ( RELI.BO ) was to supply Anil Ambani's Reliance Natural ( RENR.BO ) with 28 million standard cubic meters a day (mmscmd) of gas for 17 years at a rate below the government price. Analysts have raised concerns the dispute is putting off foreign investors, with government interference in the pricing and marketing of gas raising investment risk in a politically sensitive resource.
