 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Leaders of euro zone countries on Friday approved a deal to provide financial aid to Greece, European Union sources said. 

 "It's done," one EU source said when asked if the aid package, expected to total 110 billion euros ($147.6 billion), had been agreed by the 16 leaders at a summit in Brussels.
