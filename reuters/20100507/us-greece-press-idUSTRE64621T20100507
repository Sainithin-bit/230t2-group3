 (Reuters) - Below are editorial comments from Greek newspapers on Friday after parliament approved a three-year 30 billion euro ($40.25 billion) package of austerity measures against a backdrop of street protests. 

 KATHIMERINI (center-right) "The politics of credibility. Yesterday was a day of responsibility for the political world. Members of parliament were called to decide between a particularly unpopular economic stabilization program and default. As usual, the Left chose to totally deny reality, claiming there is another way to get the country out of the dead end. The main political opposition also followed the road of equivocation. "In politics, what is immediately pleasant is not always responsible. What is most precious is credibility." ELEFTHEROTYPIA (center-left) "Cockfights and reality. After the tragic incident on Wednesday that resulted in three deaths, public opinion was expecting a debate of substance in parliament, a constructive discussion that would give birth to hopes of overcoming the crisis through a national effort. In particular, it expected politicians to assume their responsibilities and admit mistakes and omissions with courage. "Instead, the public watched the usual party fighting that does not help build even a basic consensus to save the country. "The public and the angry people in the streets are not interested in interparty conflict and expulsions. They want political leaders to acknowledge the errors of the past and agree on a full mobilization for exiting the crisis." TO VIMA (center-left) "A first step. Parliament passed the package agreed with the EU and the IMF, confirming the government's determination to rescue the country. It is a valuable first step in a difficult political and social environment but it's not enough. From now on it will take continuity, consistency and a mega-effort, otherwise we will hit a dead-end." ELEFTHEROS TYPOS (right) "Slow death contract. The memorandum the government signed with the EU Commission and the IMF may be promoted as an agreement that saves the country but it is a death contract for the economy. Surely, no one can ignore the fact that it secures loans (not grants) of 110 billion euros to help the country cover its needs in the next 24 months. "But salvation will not come from loans, it must come from the real economy. The terms agreed with the technocrats of the IMF are destructive as a money-collection logic prevails while growth initiatives are lacking. "The deep recession will recycle the problem. Thousands of companies will close, unemployment will shoot higher and the deficit will widen. It is not certain that the slow death many were fearing before the support mechanism will be avoided after its activation. Growth, the oxygen for the economy, is what is missing from the IMF's therapy." (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by  Janet Lawrence )
