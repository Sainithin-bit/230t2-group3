 HONG KONG/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX Group Inc issued the names of hundreds of stocks for which it is canceling trades following Thursday's sudden stock market plunge. 

 Soon after 2:30 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1,000 points in its largest ever intraday points drop, which may have involved a trading error. U.S. stock indices plunged by an average 9 percent in the last two hours of trading before clawing back some of the losses. Nasdaq OMX said it would cancel trades with price deviations of more than 60 percent between 2:40 p.m. and 3 p.m. from their 2:40 p.m. levels, and the New York Stock Exchange said it would similarly cancel trades on its all-electronic NYSE Arca platform that deviated over 60 percent from their last print at 2:40 p.m. between 2:40 and 3 p.m. Nasdaq said its decision was made in conjunction with other exchanges and said it could not be appealed.
