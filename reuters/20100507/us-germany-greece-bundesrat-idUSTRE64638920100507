 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German upper house of parliament on Friday approved a law to free up Germany's contribution to a multi-billion euro rescue package for Greece, despite widespread public opposition to the measure. 

 The bill means Germany could contribute up to 22.4 billion euros ($28.5 billion) to a 110 billion euro, 3-year rescue plan agreed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and euro zone members. German President Horst Koehler, a former IMF managing director, must now sign the bill into law. (Writing by  Dave Graham )
