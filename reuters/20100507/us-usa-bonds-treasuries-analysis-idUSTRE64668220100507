 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - It took a Greek fiscal debacle threatening to blow up Europe's common currency experiment, but global investors have finally rediscovered their love of U.S. government bonds. 

 Treasuries were once seen as the safest of safe havens, but analysts recently have been beating up them on given worries over massive government borrowing and the Federal Reserve's experiment printing money to bail out a shaky banking system. The debt crisis in Greece appears to have changed that, exposing flaws in a multinational euro currency system that was slow to react to a crisis. As a result, investors have been steaming into the safe harbor of the U.S. Treasury market. In doing so, they have set aside considerable worries over the U.S. national debt as well as the recently held belief that the sun was setting on the dollar's era of preeminence. "It goes back to where do you want to hide and where is the safe haven. The more you cut through this it's still the dollar and Treasuries," said Bill Schultz, chief investment officer at McQueen, Ball & Associates in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Indeed, the United States -- home of the subprime mortgage crisis that brought down the global economy -- is once again embraced as a good place to put money in bad times. Things looked differently earlier this year when Pacific Investment Management Co, the world's biggest bond fund, said it was cutting its U.S. exposure over deficit concerns, with its founder, Bill Gross, urging investors to be "vigilant." DIRE SCENES Dire scenes in Greece have shed a different light. Three people died this week in violent street protests in Athens against austere budget measures aimed at securing a bailout by euro zone countries and the International Monetary Fund. Jittery investors yanked money out of risky assets such as stocks and poured them into U.S. Treasuries. The frenzied bond buying sent benchmark U.S. 10-year yields to five-month lows as investors shed Greek debt as well as bonds issued by other fiscally troubled euro zone nations such as Portugal and Spain. U.S. Treasuries have not been the only safe haven. Prices of German Bunds have also risen as they are seen as a bulwark against European uncertainty, but Treasuries have outperformed them over the last month. Analysts say the Greek crisis could temper the appetite of big global bond buyers, such as overseas central banks, from diversifying too much out of dollar-denominated assets. Diversification appeared to be a real threat to the dollar, and by implication Treasuries, in 2008 when the euro hit record highs above $1.60. Back then some analysts considered a replacement to the greenback as the world's reserve currency to be inevitable, though not necessarily immediate. The current troubles of the euro, which has fallen well below $1.30, suggest engineers of the new reserve currency need to go back to the drawing board. "The U.S. is still the safe-haven parking place and I think it will continue to be," said Marty Mitchell, head of government bond trading at Stifel Nicolaus in Baltimore. "Rhetoric about developing a reserve currency, ... that's really talk at this point. The here and now is the situation in Greece and right now safety flows are moving into Treasuries because there is no other place to go for safety reasons." NOT SO DIFFERENT However, none of this should diminish the worries about the burgeoning of the U.S. national debt over the last two years. It was only a year ago that debt fears led financial markets to question, if only briefly, the longevity of the United States' prized AAA credit rating. The U.S. budget deficit is expected to hit about 11 percent of gross domestic product this fiscal year, which is not terribly far from levels that got Greece into trouble. Investors loading up on Treasuries seem willing to overlook that for now as most governments are struggling with deficits. However, they also appear to be taking Washington at its word that it will turn back the tide of red ink as the economy recovers from the worst recession since the Great Depression. "Obviously the U.S. does face similar sovereign risk issues that Europe is going through but those risks are much further down the road so for now the U.S. is the safe haven for investors," said Michael Pond, Treasury and Inflation-linked strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. "For the past several years foreign central banks have been diversifying away from the dollar. If that were to continue over time and U.S. fiscal measures were to worsen problems going on in Europe now could be faced in the U.S. five to 10 years from now." (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
