 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of existing home sales in July fell slightly to a 5.75 million unit annual rate and the supply of unsold single-family homes hit its highest since 1991, the National Association of Realtors said in a report on Monday.  

  KEY POINTS: -The inventory of homes for sale rose 5.1 percent to 4.59 million, representing 9.6 months worth of supply at the current sales pace. -Median home prices fell 0.6 percent from a year ago to $228,900.  COMMENTS:  MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA: "This shows that the housing downturn continues to intensify. It shows no sign of abating. Given the turmoil in the financial market from lending problems, the housing problem will continue in the months ahead. It's a large amount of unsold homes, and it's really weighing on the market. Many potential sellers can no longer pull their homes off the market, and they have to cut prices in order to sell. With the housing downturn intensifying, consumers will become more cautious with the decline in household wealth and greater difficulties to borrow. This will have broader effect on the economy well into next year."  MICHAEL DARDA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MKM PARTNERS LLC, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It looked like a decent number because we came in slightly above expectations. I can't imagine us having a market decline on this kind of data. It just didn't deviate that much from expectations. All things told, I think the market performance is pretty good. We're down, but this isn't a disaster. We're going to have to wait and see as we move past August to see what kind of impact the credit turmoil is having."  BETH MALLOY, BOND MARKET ANALYST, RESEARCH COMPANY, BRIEFING.COM, CHICAGO: "The bar has been set so low for these kind of numbers, they almost can't be as bad as the Treasury market wants them to be. The numbers were pretty flat except for the inventories. Everybody is expecting that to continue to increase, so I don't expect much of a bond market reaction."  MARKET REACTION: - Stocks add to losses.
