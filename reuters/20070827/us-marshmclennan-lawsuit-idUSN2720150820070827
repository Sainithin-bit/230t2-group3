 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The state of Ohio has filed an anti-trust lawsuit accusing Marsh & McLennan Cos, the world's largest insurer, AIG ( AIG.N ) and three other insurers and their subsidiaries of price fixing and other anti-competitive behavior, Attorney General Marc Dann said on Monday. 

 The lawsuit, filed on Friday in Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, accused the companies of participating in an "unlawful conspiracy to allocate customers, divide markets and restrain competition" for casualty insurance policies for businesses in Ohio between January of 2001 and late 2004. Commercial casualty insurance includes workers compensation insurance, which protects companies from liabilities from worker injuries. The lawsuit follows a three-year investigation by Dann. Marsh & McLennan ( MMC.N ) is accused in the lawsuit of orchestrating a secret conspiracy to artificially inflate prices while feigning competition. The other defendants are ACE Ltd ( ACE.N ), The Chubb Corporation ( CB.N ), and the Hartford Financial Services Group Inc ( HIG.N ). Zurich American Insurance Co, a subsidiary of Swiss insurance company Zurich Financial Services Group ( ZURN.VX ), entered a $7 million settlement with the state in October of 2006 as part of the same investigation. Dann said in a statement that Zurich and other insurers were cooperating with state prosecutors to build a case against the defendant companies. The lawsuit seeks to ban the companies from engaging in the alleged anti-competitive scheme, to force them to disgorge any profits from it and to assess damages. Marsh & McLennan paid $850 million in fines and restitution to settle allegations of bid rigging in a 2005 lawsuit brought by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer.
