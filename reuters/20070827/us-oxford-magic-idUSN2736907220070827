 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Profit margins at Oxford Industries Inc.'s ( OXM.N ) Tommy Bahama brand of tropics- inspired clothing are expected to keep rising thanks to increasing sales of a new women's line, expanded men's products and international growth, the brand's chief operating officer said on Monday. 

 There are some 70 Tommy Bahama stores in the United States and Canada, including about 10 that have restaurants. The brand also sells its clothes at department stores such as Macy's ( M.N ) and Nordstrom ( JWN.N ). Excluding Tommy Bahama stores with restaurants, which carry lower margins due to labor costs, the brand's operating margins are probably about 20 percent, Doug Wood, the brand's COO, said in an interview at the Magic Marketplace apparel trade show. "I believe (margins) will continue to move up," Wood said. "As a brand, we're still in the teenage years." Operating margins measure a company's operating profit compared with revenue and are an important measure of profitability. High operating profit margins can mean a company is controlling costs, or that sales are increasing faster than operating costs. "The key point is on the margins," said BB&T analyst Eric Tracy. "You've got a Tommy business in the high teens operating margins which we believe can be north of 20 percent particularly as they grow their own retail." Tommy Bahama, known for tropical short-sleeved silk shirts aimed at men 45 to 65 years old, has been trying to capture a younger customer with more retro-influenced button-down shirts. One in an argyle pattern included details such as daiquiri glasses. "Today we have to reconnect with that 35- to 45-year-old customer," said Don Kerkes, president of the Tommy Bahama men's group. The line's sub-brand of more casual pieces, Tommy Bahama Relax, is the fastest growing segment within men's and is geared toward 35- to 50-year-olds, Kerkes said. Tommy Bahama has also spent the last year and a half developing its women's line, with price points between $140 and $500. Some of the brand's existing retail customers are inappropriate for the line due to their focus on menswear, so new accounts have to be developed. "It's essentially building a women's company within a man's company," said Lynn Koplin, president of Tommy Bahama's women's line. Growth rates for the line could be in the high-single to low-double digits, Koplin said. The women's line will eventually be 30 percent of the brand's total sales, up from 15 percent now. The colorful pieces, half prints and half solids, also include swimwear, which Koplin said had made "major, major strides at retail." The line is now carried at Sak's Fifth Avenue's flagship store. Tommy Bahama's licensing business currently reaps $7 million to $8 million annually for the company, according to Wood. "I think that's scratching the surface," he said. In addition, the company is expanding overseas and already has locations in Australia and Dubai. "That's a revenue stream we're just starting with," Wood said of international growth. Oxford makes private-label clothing for retailers such as Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) and Nordstrom and is also the owner of hip, retro brand Ben Sherman. The company also holds licenses for brands such as Nautica, Tommy Hilfiger and Oscar de la Renta. Top customers for Oxford clothing include Macy's, Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ), Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), Target Corp ( TGT.N ), Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc EBHI.O and Men's Wearhouse Inc ( MW.N ).
