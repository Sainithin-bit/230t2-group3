 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.N and Australia's ASX Ltd ( ASX.AX ) may be interested in buying part of Nasdaq Stock Market Inc's 31 percent stake in London Stock Exchange Plc ( LSE.L ), a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 Singapore's state-owned Temasek Holdings TEM.UL may also be interested in buying some portion of the stake, the person said. Other parties, including private equity firms, have expressed interest as well, the person added. Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ), the largest U.S. electronic stock exchange, said last week it was considering a sale of its roughly $1.6 billion stake in the LSE to focus on buying Nordic exchange operator OMX OMX.ST. At the time, Nasdaq said its bankers were already in touch with interested parties, and that it would not sell its LSE stake to a single buyer. NYSE Euronext spokeswoman Richard Adamonis said the exchange does not comment on rumors or speculation. An official at ASX, Asia-Pacific's second-largest listed stock exchange, was not immediately available. Stock exchanges around the world have been looking at tie-ups to offer customers a broader range of products and lower their technology costs. NYSE Group, which run the New York Stock Exchange, bought European exchange operator Euronext for $14.6 billion in April to form NYSE Euronext. Concerns that NYSE Euronext will acquire another company have depressed the exchange operator's shares. Nasdaq still does not intend to sell its entire 31 percent LSE stake to one buyer, but may sell 29.9 percent to a single party and the remaining shares in the market, the person said. Under UK rules, an investor who buys more than 30 percent of a company has to automatically make a bid for all of it. If the price is not right, Nasdaq may choose not to sell its LSE stake at all, the person said. "At this point, there is no front-runner," the person said, adding that talks were just beginning. Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld said last week a premium was justified for its LSE stake. Nasdaq wants to use the proceeds from its LSE sale to pay down debt and buy back shares, which would effectively raise the value of its cash-and-share bid for OMX and give it a boost in the fast-consolidating global stock exchange sector. Nasdaq, eager to expand overseas, is locked in a $4 billion bidding war with Borse Dubai for OMX, which owns exchanges in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and the Baltic states. GLOBAL EXCHANGES Temasek's interest comes amid growing protectionism in Europe and the United States toward sovereign wealth funds making aggressive overseas investments in search of higher returns. Government-owned investment vehicles such as Temasek and its sister agency, Government of Singapore Investment Corp, control about $2 trillion -- roughly the size of France's economy -- and are expected to grow to $12 trillion by 2015. British newspaper The Sunday Times reported earlier that a deal between Nasdaq and Temasek could lead to a full takeover of the LSE by the Singaporean investment group. Another British Sunday newspaper, The Observer, said Nasdaq was seeking to sell up to half its LSE stake to Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ). The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Nasdaq may sell its LSE stake to Borse Dubai and make a joint bid with the Gulf exchange for OMX. It also said Nasdaq, which originally agreed to buy OMX for $3.7 billion, was expected to launch a higher bid closer to $4 billion. Temasek and Borse Dubai officials were not immediately available for comment, while Nasdaq and Deutsche Boerse officials declined to comment.
