 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Restaurant company Dunkin' Brands Inc. said on Monday that all menu offerings in its Dunkin' Donuts restaurants will have zero grams of artery clogging trans fat by October 15 this year. 

 The company also said all ice cream products at its Baskin-Robbins chain will have zero grams trans fat by January 1, 2008. Privately held Dunkin' Donuts, which has tested over 28 alternative oils since 2003, said it has already tried trans fat free doughnuts in about 400 restaurants throughout the United States, over a period of four months. It already serves doughnuts with zero grams trans fat in Philadelphia and New York City. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration allows companies to label products with less than half a gram of trans fat as having zero grams. The FDA advises consuming food that is low in trans fat, since it increases low-density lipoprotein, or so-called bad cholesterol in food that blocks arteries.
