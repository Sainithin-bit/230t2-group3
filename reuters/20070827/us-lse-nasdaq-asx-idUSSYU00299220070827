 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - ASX Ltd ( ASX.AX ), Asia-Pacific's second-biggest listed stock exchange, said on Tuesday there was no basis to support market speculation that it was intending to buy Nasdaq Inc's ( NDAQ.O ) 31 percent stake in London Stock Exchange Plc ( LSE.L ) at this stage. 

 "Should that position change, ASX will inform the market," ASX spokesman said. Earlier, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters that ASX may be interested in buying part of Nasdaq's stake in the LSE. Nasdaq, the largest U.S. electronic stock exchange, said last week it was considering a sale of its roughly $1.6 billion (A$1.9 billion) stake in LSE to focus on buying Nordic exchange operator OMX OMX.ST.
