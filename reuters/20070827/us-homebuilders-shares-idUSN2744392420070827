 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of home builders fell on Monday, after reports showed that sales of existing homes continued to slide and the weak U.S. housing market was weighing heavy on the minds of investors. 

 Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) shares were off 95 cents, or 3 percent, at $28.94 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Beazer Homes USA Inc's ( BZH.N ) shares fell nearly 5 percent, or 49 cents, to $9.69. Centex Corp ( CTX.N ) shares were off 4 percent, or $1.28, at $30.71. Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ) stock fell nearly 3 percent, or 66 cents, to $22.43. D.R. Horton Inc's ( DHI.N ) shares were down nearly 3 percent, or 47 cents, at $15.54. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, a yardstick that measures home-builder performance, was off 3.1 percent. Early Monday, the National Association of Realtors said the pace of U.S. existing home sales fell 0.2 percent in July from June, and the supply of unsold single-family homes hit its highest mark since 1991. Existing homes traditionally have comprised about 85 percent of the market and set the tone of sales of new homes. "We think the overall inventory will exceed 10.0 months in August, with single-family months' supply approaching the prior peak of 9.8 months set in '89, as inventory levels continue to rise and the sales pace slows further," Bank of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim wrote in a research note. Also Monday morning, a survey showed that investor confidence in the U.S. economy deteriorated in August to its lowest level in a year, citing the deteriorating housing market and concerns over high energy prices. The UBS/Gallup Index of Investor Optimism fell for a third straight month to 73 in August, down 14 points from 87 in July. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas )
