 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NBC Universal is holding discussions to buy Sparrowhawk Media, which owns the international operations of the Hallmark Channel, for around $350 million, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 Sparrowhawk, a private equity group backed by Providence Equity Partners and 3i, purchased the international arm of the Hallmark Channel in 2005 for about $242 million. Hallmark's international channel broadcasts across about 150 countries, meaning it would be a fit for NBC Universal's efforts to expand internationally. NBC is majority-owned by General Electric ( GE.N ). Sparrowhawk also runs Movies 24 and children's channel Kids Co. The deal was first reported in the Sunday Telegraph. NBC declined to comment. Sparrowhawk could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Paul Thomasch )
