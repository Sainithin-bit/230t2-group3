 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays ( BARC.L ) is in a strong position in its talks on an $80 billion takeover of Dutch rival ABN AMRO AAH.AS and feedback from its investors had been encouraging, its president said on Tuesday. 

 "We are in a strong position," said Bob Diamond, head of Barclays' investment banking and a key figure in the talks. "We feel terrific that we have a period of exclusivity, and we have a lot of work to do," he said. Barclays and ABN last week outlined a framework to create a bank listed in London, headquartered in Amsterdam and with its two top jobs split. Analysts said that leaves price as the key issue to be resolved. "We are very focused on value but it's early days," Diamond told reporters on the sideline of a conference in London. Diamond, who also heads Barclays's wealth management and asset management arms, said talks he and Barclays Chief Executive John Varley had held with investors in New York last week had gone well. "John and I had terrific meetings with investors in the U.S. and (Finance Director) Naguib (Kheraj) had a number of meetings with investors here and we're definitely pleased," he said. He declined to comment on their feedback or on any details of the ABN talks, but added: "If you look at the action of equity prices I would say we're pretty happy." By 1130 GMT, Barclays shares were down 2.4 percent at 724 pence, but are up 6 percent since the talks were announced. Shares in ABN were down 0.1 percent at 32.71 euros, near lifetime highs. The shares have jumped 20 percent since it said it was in talks. ABN AGENDA If Barclays seals the deal it would be the world's biggest ever bank takeover and create a bank with a market value of over $175 billion. The discussions were prompted by British hedge fund TCI, which last month urged ABN AMRO to break up or sell itself. ABN will on Wednesday announce the agenda for its annual shareholders meeting scheduled for April 26, which has fueled some speculation among investors that the bank may present details of a merger for a shareholder vote. TCI requested shareholder votes on five issues: breaking up, selling or merging the bank's businesses; returning any proceeds to shareholders; selling the entire bank; to report back on the initiatives; and cease major acquisitions for six months. Analysts say other banks could gatecrash the talks for ABN, including Citigroup ( C.N ), HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and Santander ( SAN.MC ), and there is a risk that Barclays itself may become a target amid broader consolidation in the industry toward bigger, global banks. Asked whether Barclays would be a bid target if it did not succeed in getting ABN, Diamond said: "We are very confident that this is a good opportunity for us and we're confident either way." On the threat of a counterbidder, he added: "There's bound to be a lot of talk, but we don't want to get engaged in that." Analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note on Tuesday they expect Barclays and ABN to announce a deal "as walking away isn't the best option for either party". Goldman estimated Barclays would offer 35 euros per ABN share, including 5 euros in cash, "in order to seal the merger and reduce the potential for a counterbid". It said cost savings could reach 2.6 billion euros. (Additional reporting by  Reed Stevenson  in Amsterdam)
