 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Spice seller McCormick & Co. Inc. ( MKC.N ) said on Tuesday that quarterly profit more than tripled, as a restructuring program yielded cost savings and sales increased overall. 

 Net income rose to $44.2 million, or 33 cents per share, up from $14.4 million, or 11 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. This quarter's net results included a 4-cent restructuring charge. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the Sparks, Maryland-based company to earn 31 cents per share before the charges. The company expects 2007 earnings to be up 8 percent to 10 percent on a comparable basis, excluding the impact of restructuring charges. Including items, earnings per share will be close to the upper end of the $1.67 to $1.71 projected range, the company said. Analysts were expecting earnings per share of $1.89 for the full year, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales for the first quarter rose 7 percent to $652 million, helped by the popularity of new products, convenience items and its Simply Asia Foods line, acquired in mid-2006. This compared with analysts' average forecast of $643 million, according to Reuters Estimates.
