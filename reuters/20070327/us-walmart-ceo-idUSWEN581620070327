 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott said the world's largest retailer is adopting a cautious stance, considering that rising fuel prices could mean this year will not be easy. 

 "With fuel pries going up, it feels like it's going to be a challenging year," he said on Tuesday during a television interview on Fox News. "I wouldn't say worried is the right word. But I think we're cautious thinking through what it means. Fuel prices have an impact on our basic customer," he added. Wal-Mart is considered a barometer of the health of the U.S. retail sector. More than 127 million customers visit a Wal-Mart store or a Sam's Club location in America every week, and Wal-Mart has 1.3 million employees in the United States. Scott's interview came late on Tuesday after U.S. stocks fell following a weak consumer confidence report, which fueled concerns the housing slowdown may spread into the broader economy and hurt profits. The Conference Board, a private research group, said its index of consumer sentiment declined in March amid rising gasoline prices and turmoil in financial markets. Wal-Mart has been struggling to revive sales at its U.S. store base, which have been hurt by lackluster shopper response to its efforts to sell trendy clothing and a disruptive store remodeling program. Its shares closed down 35 cents, or about 0.7 percent, at $47.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.
