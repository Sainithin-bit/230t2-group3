 ROME/MADRID  (Reuters) - Enel ( ENEI.MI ) could take legal action against Caja Madrid after the savings bank sided with E.ON in a multibillion euro battle to control Spain's Endesa, a source close to the Italian utility said on Tuesday. 

 Late on Monday, Caja Madrid did a deal to sell E.ON EONG.DE its 9.9 percent stake in Endesa ( ELE.MC ) in two years but to keep its voting rights until then, potentially giving E.ON a louder voice at Endesa than Enel and its ally Acciona ( ANA.MC ). Analysts said the bidding war for Endesa, Caja Madrid's decision and threats of lawsuits from all sides could lead to a split-up of Spain's largest utility or a drawn out legal battle. E.ON raised its bid for a third time on Monday to 40 euros a share, valuing Endesa at 42.3 billion euros ($56.4 billion), and said it would sue Enel/Acciona for entering the bidding so late. Enel and Acciona, which together own 46 percent of Endesa, said they would offer at least 41 euros for the company. Market regulator CNMV reiterated on Monday that they could not launch a bid for six months but stopped short of blocking the offer. Caja Madrid's decision to keep its voting rights in Endesa could strengthen E.ON's hand considerably. Endesa's rules cap investor's voting rights to 10 percent regardless of how many shares they hold. With Caja Madrid's 9.9 percent backing, E.ON could secure almost 20 percent of Endesa's voting rights depending on the take-up for its bid. E.ON took out full-page advertisements in Spanish newspapers on Tuesday, trying to win over minority shareholders. "Let's be frank. The only real offer for Endesa is E.ON's," they said. VOTES LIMITED Acciona and Enel's voting rights are limited to 10 and 3 percent respectively. The Spanish energy commission and government are both expected to change their rules to allow Enel to raise its vote to 10 percent. A source familiar with the situation said E.ON would also try to get seats on Endesa's board and exercise power from within. Endesa's current board has backed E.ON's bid. "The main uncertainty now is whether or not E.ON will have a strong enough negotiating position post the tender to agree a break-up of Endesa," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a note. E.ON first tipped its cap at Endesa to extend its reach into the fast-growing southern European market and get its hands on the power group's extensive Latin American holdings. Acciona has its eyes more firmly on Endesa's renewable energy assets, while Enel is looking for global growth. "I haven't heard people talking about a split-up. That's not an option we have on the table," Spanish Economy Minister Pedro Solbes told reporters in Milan on Tuesday. Acciona said in a presentation to analysts that an Endesa acquisition would boost its earnings per share by 97 percent this year and by more than 100 percent in 2008 and 2009. It also said it had an option to sell its shares in Endesa to Enel if the two of them did not control the utility within the next three years.
