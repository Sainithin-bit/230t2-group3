 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lennar Corp. ( LEN.N ), the No. 3 U.S. home builder, posted a 73.4 percent plunge in profit on Tuesday and withdrew its earnings forecast, saying the industry's spring selling season has failed to bloom and its outlook for the rest of 2007 does not look bright. 

 Lennar also said the widening problems in the subprime lending sector have weakened an already anemic market. It did not issue new financial forecasts for the rest of the year, citing market conditions. "While some markets are performing better than others, the typically stronger spring selling season has not yet materialized," Stuart Miller, Lennar chief executive, said in a statement. "These soft market conditions have been exacerbated by the well-publicized problems in the subprime lending market." For the quarter ended February 28, Lennar posted net earnings of $68.6 million, or 43 cents per share, down from $258.1 million, or $1.58 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast earnings of 55 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The U.S. housing market has been suffering from a steep downturn for more than a year, as high prices and climbing interest rates have repelled prospective buyers. Speculators, who bought homes to quickly sell, also have retreated from the market, unloading their investments. The industry is grappling with a glut of supply, while home builders have cut prices and shrunk their businesses to wait out the downturn. Meanwhile, default rates in the subprime segment of the U.S. mortgage market have jumped in recent months and threaten to prolong the housing downturn. At least 20 lenders in the subprime mortgage sector, which serves borrowers with poor credit histories, have gone out of business. The crisis has triggered broader concerns that the fallout may spread to mainstream lenders and damage the economy. "It is unclear today whether there is another shoe to drop," Miller said in a conference call with analysts. "Questions remain as to whether the economy will weaken in a housing-led recession, or perhaps it is the supply and inventory overhang that will be exacerbated by the resetting of mortgage rates on the many adjustable-rate mortgages that have fueled the market over the past years." Lennar said that less than 5 percent of the 70 percent of the loans its mortgage unit originated would qualify as subprime -- loans to borrowers with credit scores below 620. However, about 40 percent of the loans were considered Alt-A -- loans to borrowers with credit scores above 620 but who provided less than the full documentation required to apply for the loan. This category of loans has many different products and the riskier loans require little or no down payment. "We do know that some of these riskier mortgage products were the mortgage of choice for speculators," Chief Financial Officer Bruce Gross said. Last week, KB Home ( KBH.N ) also said it was concerned about the fall-out from the subprime crisis. During the quarter, Lennar recorded a gain of about $175.9 million for the sale of a stake in LandSource, a land and development company, and incurred charges of about $92 million for the lower value of land. Revenue from home sales fell 10 percent to $2.6 billion, primarily due to a 4 percent decrease in home closings to 8,566, excluding unconsolidated businesses. The West and Central regions accounted for most of the softness. The average sales price of a home fell 7 percent to $303,000. Greater sales incentives -- about $45,500 per home sold in the first quarter, compared with $13,800 a year earlier -- squeezed gross margins to 15.6 percent, down from 24.9 percent in the first quarter of 2006. New orders during the quarter fell 29 percent, to 6,778 homes, excluding unconsolidated businesses. "There is so much product available for sale in the resale market, it's very difficult for home builders," JMP Securities analyst Jim Wilson said. On Tuesday a Last month, sales of existing homes rose 3.9 percent, but sales of new homes fell by the same amount, recent government reports showed. In January, Lennar had forecast full-year earnings of at least $3.69 per share, but on Tuesday said it would likely not meet that forecast. The company's shares were down 40 cents or 0.9 percent to $44.14 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange; they had traded as low as $42.64 earlier. The sector was off 1.6 percent, according to the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB.
