 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spanish market regulator CNMV said it had taken note of Enel and Acciona's joint takeover plan for Endesa and reiterated no bid could be made for six months. 

 In a statement e-mailed late on Monday, CNMV said it had taken a preliminary look at the agreement between Enel and Acciona and an appeal by current bidder E.ON against their move. It referred investors back to the first point it made in a statement released on Friday in which it said Enel and Acciona could not launch a bid for six months after the E.ON bid ended, due on April 3.
