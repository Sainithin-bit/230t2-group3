 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ) said on Tuesday that the period it set aside to wait for alternatives to a takeover bid by Carl Icahn's American Real Estate Partners LP ( ACP.N ) has expired without another offer emerging. 

 Lear's board in February agreed to a $2.3 billion, $36-per-share, takeover by Icahn, well known as an activist investor. The deal is worth $5.3 billion including assumed debt. The deal is still subject to a vote by shareholders, a majority of whom would need to approve it. On Monday, Richard Pzena, co-chief investment officer of Pzena Investment Management and a large Lear shareholder, said that he estimated that investors representing at least 30 percent of shares would vote against the offer. Icahn himself already controls a nearly 16 percent stake in the company. Pzena controls about 9 percent. Southfield, Michigan-based Lear said a provision of its agreement with Icahn allows it to continue discussions with "certain parties who had expressed an interest" in the company, but provided no details as to who those parties might be. Analysts have been uncertain whether Lear would attract much rival interest, given management support of the Icahn bid and the fact that few auto parts companies would have the financial strength and strategic focus to find it attractive. Lear shares closed at $36.62 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.
