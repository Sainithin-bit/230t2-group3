 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Top U.S. video game retailer GameStop Corp. ( GME.N ) on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit and a full-year earnings forecast that topped Wall Street targets, sending shares up as much as 12 percent. 

 Video game publishers Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O and Activision Inc. ( ATVI.O ) were each up less than 1 percent on the results amid weak overall stock performance. Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop's net earnings rose to $129.8 million, or 81 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended February 3 from $85.0 million, or 55 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Sales rose to $2.3 billion from $1.7 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least one year increased 26.5 percent in the most recent quarter. Analysts, on average, had seen the company posting a profit of 80 cents per share on revenue of $2.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. GameStop shares surged 12.4 percent in early trade to $31.43, and were trading at $30.90 in afternoon dealings on the New York Stock Exchange. "The excitement is over their guidance," said AG Edwards analyst William Kreher. For the fiscal year ending February 2, 2008, the company forecast comparable store sales rising 14 to 16 percent, backed by a slate of video game releases. Diluted earnings per share for the full year are expected to range from $1.37 to $1.40, it said. For the fiscal year just ended, GameStop reported net earnings of $158.3 million or $1.00 per share after $6,788,000 of pretax merger-related expenses and $6,059,000 of debt extinguishment expenses. It also forecast earnings per share would grow at least 25 percent annually in the two following fiscal years. Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter are expected to range from 15 cents to 16 cents, it said. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to post a first-quarter profit of 13 cents per share and annual earnings of $1.33 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. GameStop Chief Executive R. Richard Fontaine said in a statement that the annual forecast was based on the company's views that the latest growth cycle will be "deeper, wider, and longer than any previous period of new console introductions." "No previous cycle has had the diversity of console attributes currently in our stores; no previous cycle has merged other technologies like HDTV, Wi-Fi, and MP3 attributes to make the gaming experience truly the best ever," he said. For the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the company forecast comparable store sales to rise 12 percent to 14 percent, driven in part by the expected launch of Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T )( SNE.N ) PlayStation 3 in Europe and Australia, as well as continued demand for titles for Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360. Daniel DeMatteo, GameStop's chief operating officer, said in a conference call that he expects 4 million to 5 million hardware unit sales in the United States this year. Higher margin software sales are expected to grow as much as 60 percent, led by titles like "Halo 3," "Mass Effect" from Microsoft, "Grand Theft Auto IV" from Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ( TTWO.O ) and "Guitar Hero" and "Spider-Man 3" from Activision.
