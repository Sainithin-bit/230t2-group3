 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Belgian-French financial services group Dexia DEXI.PA( DEXI.BR ) said on Tuesday its exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages was protected and that it did not expect to incur any losses. 

 Default rates in the subprime segment of the mortgage market in the United States, where Dexia is active through its FSA subsidiary, have jumped in recent months as the housing industry slowed and prices fell. "Dexia's exposure in this class of assets, either directly or through FSA, is very well protected, and would not cause any losses, even in case of further market deterioration," Dexia said in a statement. It said it had expected trouble in the market for mortgage-backed securities. "We have thus strongly reduced our underwritings and investments in the sub-prime mortgages asset class over the last two-and-a-half years," it said. Dexia, one of the world's largest municipal lenders, also said current market conditions create an opportunity for new business. It said in a presentation on its Web site that the subprime mortgage industry is being reorganised, with the survival of stronger participants and a strengthening of loan-to-value and other underwriting standards and rating agency protection levels. "In this new environment both FSA and Dexia expect to find opportunities to write new business at attractive levels of risk and return on capital."
