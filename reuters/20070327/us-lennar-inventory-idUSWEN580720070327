 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lennar Corp., the No. 3 U.S. home builder, on Tuesday said the worst of the buildup of existing homes on the market for sale, a factor that is pressing on the entire industry, may not yet be over. 

 "It feels like inventory at certain points is being -- it is not increasing," Stuart Miller, Lennar chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. "We're still not able to say that the inventory has bottomed, but there are sporadic signals that there is some firming in that situation, and we're just going to have to wait and see," he said.
