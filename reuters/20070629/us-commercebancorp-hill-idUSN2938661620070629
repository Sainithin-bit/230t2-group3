 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Most people wouldn't see much of a connection between burgers and banking. 

 But New Jersey entrepreneur Vernon Hill applied lessons learned running Burger King outlets, about friendly service and convenient hours, to make Commerce Bancorp CBH.N the fastest growing U.S. bank and a revolutionary force in retail banking. The Commerce chairman and chief executive retired on Friday under pressure, at age 61, after years of questionable insider dealings at the bank triggered federal regulatory probes. His sudden departure from the bank he founded 34 years ago ends a career where he came to be regarded as a visionary and a great CEO, but also a maverick with little regard for the rules. "Vernon Hill built this company from scratch, and it is without a doubt one of the best retail banking models in the business," said Mark Fitzgibbons, a bank analyst at Sandler O'Neill. Yet "as Vernon has told me, he is an entrepreneur, this is an entrepreneurial company and there will be entrepreneurial noise." Commerce declined to make Hill available for comment. Hill, a Wharton School graduate who ran a company that found sites for fast-food restaurants, later invested in a string of Burger Kings. Applying these skills to banking, Hill started Commerce with one branch in southern New Jersey. Today Commerce has grown to $47 billion in assets and 437 branches in the New York, Philadelphia and Washington areas, plus Florida. He also amassed $44 billion of deposits, mostly by luring customers dissatisfied by banks that were closing branches and slashing staff. Hill delivered whopper returns to shareholders, with Commerce's stock surging seven-fold since its 1996 IPO. "I can't think of a CEO in all the 27 years I've been covering financial services who is a better CEO than Vernon Hill," said Tom Brown, CEO of financial services hedge fund Second Curve Capital. "I'm sad today. Vernon revolutionized U.S. retail banking, and he was a fun guy to watch." Brown, who does not own Commerce shares, said Hill was rare among CEOs because he paid close attention to the smallest detail. "When he takes you around to visit his branches, he knows all their deposit numbers. He knows how they're doing. Which ones are running out of parking space," Brown said. When big banks consolidated and shut branches, Commerce opened hundreds of new offices. When the industry urged walk-in customers to use the Internet, Hill's branches gave away pens, dog biscuits and lollipops. Commerce offices are open seven days a week and into the evening. Commerce defied the experts by building a profitable branch network from scratch in Manhattan and leasing expensive corner locations. Analysts say Commerce's New York branches average $100 million of deposits, nearly double the industry average. Yet Commerce under Hill also engaged in unseemly deals. The bank leased and acquired property from entities controlled by his family and himself. Commerce paid $6 million to $9 million a year to a design business run by Hill's wife, Shirley. Two Commerce executives were convicted in 2005 in a Philadelphia corruption probe in which the city's treasurer took kickbacks from the bankers, who no longer work for Commerce and are appealing their convictions. Hill also gained a reputation for stubbornness and arrogance. He built a 45,000-square-foot mansion near Philadelphia called "Villa Collina," which he has boasted was bigger than the home built by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Kevin St. Pierre, a banking analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said Hill came across as arrogant and abrasive with competitors and regulators. That, he said, ultimately led to his downfall. "He was a visionary who built a better mousetrap, but he was also someone who pushed the ethical envelope," St. Pierre said. "That clearly will be his legacy."
