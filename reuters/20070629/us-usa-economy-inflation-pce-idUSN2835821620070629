 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Inflation outside of food and energy rose only 1.9 percent in the 12 months through May, the smallest gain in more than three years and one likely to reassure the Federal Reserve price pressures are easing. 

 In a report that also showed consumer spending and income was a bit softer than expected, the Commerce Department said on Friday overall prices rose a stiff 0.5 percent last month but core prices edged up just 0.1 percent. The subdued core price increase pulled the year-on-year reading down to its lowest since March 2004, welcome news for policy-makers at the Fed, some of whom have said they would like to see core inflation in a 1 percent to 2 percent range. The Fed on Thursday opted to hold interest rates steady but still cautioned that inflation was a key concern. "It's a dip into their comfort zone and if it's sustainable going forward, I think it suggests that the Fed is not in a position to raise rates any time this year," said John Silvia, chief economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. U.S. government debt prices rose and stocks opened higher on the tame inflation data. The department said personal income advanced 0.4 percent last month after a downwardly revised 0.2 percent decrease in April. Wall Street economists had expected a 0.6 percent gain. Personal spending rose 0.5 percent in May, the same as in April but a touch softer than the 0.7 percent financial market consensus. Taking the steep rise in overall inflation into account, spending edged up just 0.1 percent. "That is a very subdued rate of spending and it will limit the gain in GDP (growth) in the second quarter," said Kevin Logan, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York. The U.S. economy moved ahead at an anemic 0.7 percent annual rate in the first quarter, and many economists had been looking for growth around 3 percent in the current quarter. Despite its soft tenor and the signs of easing inflation, financial market reaction to the report was muted. Some analysts said this was because the U.S. central bank had thrown attention on the outlook for inflation, rather than current price readings, in its interest-rate announcement on Thursday. While the Fed noted core inflation had eased, it offered a stern caution about taking recent improvement on the prices front as a given. "A sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated," it said.
