 (Reuters) - Apple Inc. began selling the iPhone, which combines a wireless phone with music- and video- playing capabilities and Web browsing, on Friday. The device is one of the most highly anticipated U.S. product introductions of the year. 

 Here are some quotes from some of the first buyers and others waiting in line in front of Apple stores from as early as Tuesday to buy the iPhone, which goes on sale at 6 p.m. in each U.S. time zone. NEW YORK CITY Kristian Gundersen, 23, from Norway, came to New York especially to get on the line at the Fifth Ave Apple Store and bought a high-end bluetooth jawbone set. "It's a one-year dream come true. It's the best day of my life. It's Christmas, birthday, New Year's all rolled into one. I'm a Mac addict. I got on a 10-hour line for 'Lord of the Rings,' but it is nothing compared to this. This is an historic event," Gundersen said. Grant Johnson, 41, an accountant from Brooklyn, managed to buy three after the girl in front of him in the line bought him an extra one as she only wanted one. "I'm keeping one and selling the other two. I'm trying to get $1,200 for them," said Johnson, who had queued up for 25 hours. "I haven't slept in a day and a half. I need a nice hot shower and a bath." CHICAGO: Albert Livingstone, 62, got a room at the Allerton Hotel across the street to help ease the waiting process. "If you're camping out, that's the way to camp out," Livingstone said. "It's the newest toy. I'm 62 - I don't have much time left to buy toys." Nicholas Haubrich, 25, secured the number-one place in line at the Chicago store on Thursday afternoon. "I've had couples come by and offer to buy me breakfast. The city has been great," Haubrich said. SAN FRANCISCO: Dale Larson, 38, works for DonorDigital, a consultant to non-profit organizations. "For me, it's work-related: It's staying on top of the latest technology. I'm working from line." Todd Laguardia, 19, from San Diego, is a student at Stanford University. "You don't have to hold all these different things in your pocket. IPhone captures everything in one device." HOLLYWOOD: Phil Jaffe, 38, a camera assistant, came to Hollywood's The Grove after getting off work at 4 a.m. "I am kind of an Apple freak," said Jaffe. "I have been waiting for this phone for probably two years before Apple even admitted they were making it." Nora Ramatici, 23, waited in line for her boss at an online marketing company. "He wanted the iPhone so bad and he was willing to do anything and everything to get it."
