 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp ( 7261.T ) forecast on Tuesday more than trebling its operating profit this year, counting on the Mazda5 minivan and other new models to drive a sales recovery in the United States and Japan. 

 For the year to March 2011, Mazda, held 11 percent by Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), expects an operating profit of 30 billion yen ($319.1 million), short of the average 43 billion yen forecast in a poll of 16 analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It expects annual net profit of 5 billion yen, against a loss of 6.48 billion yen in the year ended last month. Japan's fifth-largest automaker is also due to launch the Mazda2/Demio subcompact in North America in a few months, following rivals into the growing segment of customers looking for smaller, fuel-efficient cars. Shares in Mazda are the best performer among Japanese automakers in the year to date, soaring 28 percent. Tokyo's transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T fell 1.8 percent in the same period.
