 BERLIN  (Reuters) - When calls for a European rescue of Greece mounted early this year, German Chancellor Angela Merkel huddled with advisers and quickly agreed that a bailout must be avoided at all costs. 

 But as market pressures grew and Berlin's partners began warning of lasting damage to the euro zone, Merkel reluctantly shifted to plan B: make the terms of a rescue so onerous that other euro members would never be tempted to follow Greece's lead in seeking aid. She now looks close to succeeding with this strategy. Pushed to the brink, Greece appears poised to agree to painful new austerity in exchange for tens of billions of euros in aid from its European partners and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But Merkel's hard line could come at a price, the full extent of which may not become clear for many months. By insisting on substantial new budget cuts on top of the billions of euros in savings Athens has already pledged to make, Germany has raised the risks that destabilizing social unrest in Greece will end up dooming the "tough love" rescue. If Greece is ultimately forced to default, it could leave Merkel vulnerable to accusations of exacerbating the crisis. "You could see Greeks burning pictures of Angela Merkel in the streets of Athens," said Charles Wyplosz, a professor of International Economics at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva. Merkel's hard line has already alienated key EU partners including France, whose Economy Minister Christine Lagarde has lashed out at Germany repeatedly, including a thinly-veiled dig on Monday during a speech in New York in which she accused some EU governments of "posturing" to pander to public opinion. RADICAL OVERHAUL Strained ties with European allies could get in the way of Merkel's goal to radically restructure the EU's Stability and Growth Pact in line with German interests. Her advisers see such an overhaul as a crucial second phase of their strategy to avert future intra-euro rescues and a quid pro quo for agreeing to help Greece. "We need to ensure Greece is a one-off, that we're never in such a position again," one official close to Merkel said. But EU partners could dig in their heels and resist Berlin's push for "automatic" penalties for future breaches of EU debt and deficit rules, with violators forced to give up their voting rights and access to the bloc's cohesion funds. Merkel herself has acknowledged privately that the "cultural differences" within the EU have rarely been as large as they are now on the issue of Greece. Her tough line, according to people in her entourage, has been shaped by various factors, including a personal belief that Greece must pay for its profligacy, overwhelming public opposition to aid and deep reservations about a rescue within her own conservative ranks. Fears that Germany's Constitutional Court could balk at approving any future aid requests from euro members have also shaped Merkel's stance. Her decision to call ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet and IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn to Berlin on Wednesday to brief parliamentarians on the rescue plan is the first step in a campaign to sell the Greek aid as a "last resort" move to stabilize the euro and defend German interests. Pursuing a softer approach toward Athens would have risked boosting public dissatisfaction with her 7-month old government and complicating her party's chances of holding onto power in a May 9 vote in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW). GRIDLOCK RISK A loss in NRW would bring to an end Merkel's majority in the Bundesrat upper house of parliament, hurting her chances of pushing through top-priority policies, including tax relief and an extension of German nuclear plant lifespans. Merkel is keenly aware that her predecessors, Gerhard Schroeder and Helmut Kohl, both faced crippling policy gridlock in their final years in office after losing control of the Bundesrat. "The Greek aid debate has come at a bad time for Merkel. Local communities in NRW are out of money and giving cash to Greece would only reinforce dissatisfaction with the government in Berlin and hurt the center-right's chances in the state," said Klaus-Peter Schoeppner, head of the Emnid polling group. Gerd Langguth, a political scientist at Bonn University and biographer of Merkel, believes she limited potential damage to her party in NRW by sensing the mood of the nation early and adopting a hard line on Greek aid. Even if she commits Germany to participating in a rescue, a decision Merkel said on Monday could come within days, any backlash is likely to be contained. But other analysts see broader damage from a crisis in which Merkel, in her desire to protect Berlin's interests, has sometimes appeared to fuel euro-skeptic strains in Germany. "The real danger comes from the fact that for the first time in post-war Germany, anti-European tendencies are gaining strong political traction," said Thomas Straubhaar, a professor at Hamburg University and head of an economic think tank. That appears to be a price she is willing to pay to ensure the euro zone learns from the Greek crisis and adopts the strict budget discipline Germany sees as crucial for the future of the currency union.
