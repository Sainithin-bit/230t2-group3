 FRANKFURT/LONDON  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank delivered record investment bank earnings and European peers Lloyds and Swedbank swung to surprise profits on Tuesday as an economic recovery picked up to aid the embattled industry. 

 Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ), Germany's biggest lender, easily beat analyst forecasts with a 2.8-billion-euro ($3.7 billion) profit that came almost entirely from its corporate banking and securities division, mirroring blowout gains by Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). "The first impression is really good. Deutsche Bank is above consensus both before and after taxes. In addition, the loan loss provisions fell significantly, which is a very good sign," said Merck Finck analyst Konrad Becker. Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ), Britain's largest retail bank, returned to the black in the quarter and expects to deliver a profit in 2010 as losses on bad debts fall. The recovery was quicker than expected for the bailed-out lender, and improved the chances the government will start selling down its 41-percent stake. "This (return to profit) is far earlier than expected," said Andrew Lim, analyst at Matrix in London. "Consensus was pointing to a return to profitability for full year 2010, with second-half profits more than offsetting losses in the first half. This will be taken as very good news indeed." By 4:17 a.m. ET Lloyds shares were up 1.7 percent but Deutsche Bank stock slipped 2.1 percent, partly because of a fall in its core capital ratios and the threat of increased regulatory intervention. Sweden's Swedbank ( SWEDa.ST ) also swung to a surprise first-quarter operating profit, its first in more than a year, after credit losses came in lower than expected. Its shares rose 1.6 percent. Like Lloyds, Swedbank is emerging from a difficult year. It spent 2009 in the red due to a deep recession in the Baltic states, but said it was more confident of improved profits provided there were no big deviations in the global economy. BAR RAISED Deutsche, Lloyds and Swedbank were underpinned by improving bad debts, continuing a trend seen late last year. Lloyds said losses on commercial real estate in Ireland remain a problem but overall impairments had "slowed significantly." Deutsche Bank's main driver, however, was strong capital market-related earnings, as it joined the rest of the sector in reporting robust revenues from fixed income, commodities and currencies. The performance boosts the chances of 62-year-old Swiss Chief Executive Josef Ackermann hitting ambitious profit targets of 10 billion euros in pretax profit by 2011. But strong results from the likes of JP Morgan ( JPM.N ), Goldman Sachs and Citi ( C.N ) have raised the bar for European rivals who report later. Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) posted in-line profits last week, but was punished by investors for lagging U.S. rivals. Barclays ( BARC.L ), UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and most other banks report in the next two weeks. Also on Tuesday, Spain's Popular ( POP.MC ) reported a 9 percent drop in net profit from a year ago, but that was ahead of analysts forecasts and boosted by stronger-than-expected revenue growth and capital gains.
