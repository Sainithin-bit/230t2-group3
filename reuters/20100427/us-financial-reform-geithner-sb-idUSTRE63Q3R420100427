 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday that a financial reform bill won't satisfy everyone, but Congress must pass it to fix the causes of the financial crisis. 

 Geithner, in remarks prepared for delivery in Milwaukee, urged Americans not to leave the reform debate to lobbyists defending financial companies. "These reforms won't satisfy everyone. They won't solve all our problems. But they will fixed what caused this crisis, and they will make future crises less likely and less damaging," Geithner said at an event at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. A text of his remarks were released in Washington. A day after Republicans in the U.S. Senate blocked a measure to begin formal debate on the reform bill, Geithner said, "now we need Washington to act. Do not leave the debate to the banks and their protectors." (Reporting by  David Lawder , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
