 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence rose in April to the highest level since the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, driven by growing optimism about the labor market, according to a private sector report released on Tuesday. 

 The Conference Board, an industry group, said its index of consumer attitudes rose for the second straight month in April to 57.9 from a downwardly revised 52.3 in March. The median of forecasts from analysts polled by Reuters was for a reading of 53.5 for April. The expectations index increased to 77.4 in April, the strongest showing since October 2007, from a revised 70.4 in March. The present situation index advanced to 28.6, the highest since May 2009, from a revised 25.2. Consumers' labor market assessment improved. The "jobs hard to get" index fell to 45.0 percent from 46.3 percent, while the "jobs plentiful" index increased to 4.8 percent from 4.0 percent.
