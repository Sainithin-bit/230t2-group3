 BEVERLY HILLS, California  (Reuters) - The 2010 Milken Institute Global Conference attracted business leaders, academics and policy makers to discuss financial regulation, the economic recovery and other issues. 

 The conference runs from Monday to Wednesday. Here are some notable quotes from the annual gathering at the Beverly Hilton on Tuesday and late on Monday: LEON BLACK, CEO, APOLLO MANAGEMENT "What a difference a year makes. Our portfolio seems to be in much better shape, the world is off the edge of the precipice, our (investors) are still talking to us and I'm glad I'm not Goldman Sachs today." DAVID BONDERMAN, CO-FOUNDER, TPG "When things are hard, it separates the wheat from the chaff." "At the height of 2007, your grandmother could have done an LBO (leveraged buyout) by calling up a too-big-to-fail bank and getting a loan with no covenants." "Difficult regulatory environments, different political environments or difficulty overall does not necessarily make for bad investment times." RODGIN COHEN, PARTNER, SULLIVAN & CROMWELL Sullivan & Cromwell partner Richard Klapper is the lead lawyer defending Goldman against the SEC's charges. "It is appropriate to base a judgment on the merits and the facts as they ultimately emerge in full, and not to base a judgment on the 'evil empire' theory, which isn't a question of legality or illegality, but what some in the media prefer to stir up." RICHARD FERLAUTO, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, SEC'S POLICY OFFICE OF INVESTOR EDUCATION AND ADVOCACY "I can't say too much here, but I will say that when we bring a case, we think we have got pretty good evidence." "We will have to see what comes out. But certainly, I think Goldman is wishing that it weren't a public company." JAMES MCCAUGHAN, CEO, PRINCIPAL GLOBAL INVESTORS "They are almost like Robin Hood in reverse. They are the people who made money out of the poor to give to the rich. Politically that is not a good position to be in." ROBERT REYNOLDS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, PUTNAM INVESTMENTS "I don't know how much is there." "Investment banking has always been in the middle of trades." JEB SPAULDING, STATE TREASURER, VERMONT "I don't know of anyone planning on changing their relations with Goldman Sachs. That may be down the road." DAVID BLITZSTEIN, OFFICIAL, UNITED FOOD & COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION AND TRUSTEE, MARYLAND STATE RETIREMENT SYSTEM "It concerns us in terms of the social value issues on the products being created, and it concerns us on conflict of interest." "Maybe on the merits, they will win their case. On the moral, ethical issues, Goldman has done damage to their franchise." The fund's trustees have discussed, but made no decision on, the fund's client relationship with Goldman. (Reporting by  Megan Davies ,  Jim Christie  and  Paritosh Bansal )
