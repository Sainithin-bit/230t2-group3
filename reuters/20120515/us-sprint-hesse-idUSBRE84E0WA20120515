 OVERLAND PARK, Kansas  (Reuters) - Shareholders in Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) voted to re-elect Chief Executive Dan Hesse as a director, defeating a push by one key shareholder to get the executive off the wireless service provider's board of directors. 
 According to the company, a preliminary count showed that 90 percent of votes cast were in favor of Hesse's re-election, lower than the 98 percent of votes some directors received but higher than the 89 percent some other directors received. The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, which has a roughly 4 percent stake in Sprint, said last week that it would vote against Hesse's re-election. Hesse has come under fire this year from shareholders disappointed with the hit the company's results took from subsidizing Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) popular iPhones and other investments the company is making. Sprint shares were down 1 cent at $2.49 on New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trade. (Reporting by Carey Gillam, writing by Sinead Carew; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Gunna Dickson)
