 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) is considering smaller bonuses for CEO James Dimon and other executives while Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) is also rethinking executive pay structure, both eager to placate investors after management miscues this year, the Wall Street Journal reported. 
 JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, has lost at least $5.8 billion in failed derivative trades. It may cut 2012 bonuses but is also grappling with how to do that without drastically reducing executives' take-home pay, the Journal reported, citing people close to the institution. It also said Citigroup's board is set to decide how to revise next-year's compensation plan to elicit support among investors. In April, shareholders rejected the management's pay structure in a non-binding vote. A number of U.S. banks are wrestling with executive pay amid a soft financial-industry performance, weak economic growth and widespread cost-cutting. Neither JPMorgan or Citigroup could immediately be reached by Reuters outside of U.S. business hours. (Reporting by Sunayan Bhattacharjee in Bangalore; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
