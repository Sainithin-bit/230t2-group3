 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank will not cut its deposit rate below zero this year, according to a Reuters poll of euro money market traders taken on Monday. 
 The ECB reduced the deposit rate, which acts as a floor to the cost of money in the open market, to zero in July to deter banks hoarding cash with the central bank instead of lending it. Twenty-one of 26 traders in the poll said the central bank would not cut it this year, a move that would in effect charge banks to park excess funds with it. Just five said it would. Traders expect the ECB to allot 129 billion euros ($165 billion) at its weekly seven-day operation this week, a touch higher than the 126 billion euros maturing from last week's tender. They also expect the ECB to allot 25 billion euros at its one-month fine-tuning operation this week, as much as the amount maturing from last month's tender. -------ALLOTMENT------ ONE-WEEK ONE-MONTH ------------------------------------------------------- MEDIAN 129 25 MEAN 129 23 MODE 125 25 HIGHEST 160 30 LOWEST 120 10 COUNT 28 26 -------------------------------------------------------- (Reporting by  Yati Himatsingka ; Polling by Namrata Anchan and Shaloo Shrivastava; Editing by Toby Chopra)
