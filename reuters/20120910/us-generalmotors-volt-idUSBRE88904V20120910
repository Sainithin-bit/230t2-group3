 (Reuters) - It costs General Motors Co an estimated $75,000 to $88,000 per car to build the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, based on current sales and production volume, according to auto industry consultants who spoke with Reuters. 
 Here is a breakdown of their average per-car cost estimates. Development and tooling are considered fixed costs. Parts and labor are variable manufacturing costs, dependent on production volume. Fixed-cost figures are based on total Volt sales of 21,500 cars through August, and will drop in the future as sales and production volume increases. Fixed Costs * Development: $18,650 * Tooling: $37,350 Production Costs * Standard Parts, Material and Labor: $12,000 * Unique Parts, Material and Labor: $12,000 TOTAL: $80,000 Note: This does not include marketing and other wider corporate/administrative costs.
