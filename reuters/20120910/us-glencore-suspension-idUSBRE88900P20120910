 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Trading in shares of Glencore International was suspended on Monday, according to a filing on the Hong Kong exchange. 
 The company said in a statement that the suspension was pending the release of information relating to its proposed all-share merger of equals with Xstrata plc. No further details were immediately available. Glencore hammered out a revised $36 billion bid for miner Xstrata in intense weekend negotiations and is set to detail its new offer to the market as early as Monday, days after proposing 11th-hour changes to save the deal.
