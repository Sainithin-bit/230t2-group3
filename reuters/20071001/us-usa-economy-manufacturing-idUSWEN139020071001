 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing expansion slowed in September, as new orders and production slipped but employment improved, according to a survey published on Monday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 52.0 from 52.9 in August, below economists' median forecast for a dip to 52.6. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.
