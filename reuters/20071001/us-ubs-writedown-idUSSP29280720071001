 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Switzerland's largest bank, UBS ( UBSN.VX ), is expected to warn on Monday that it has written off billions of dollars on fixed-income assets, making it one of the biggest casualties so far of turmoil in world credit markets, the Financial Times and Wall Street Journal reported. 

 UBS, which ousted its chief executive, Peter Wuffli, in the wake of losses at an in-house hedge fund in July, is set to replace its investment banking head, Huw Jenkins, the reports said, fuelling speculation that UBS might be altering its strategic course away from investment banking. Citing people familiar with the matter, the FT said UBS was expected to say it has written down its fixed-income portfolio by more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($2.6 billion), triggering a third-quarter loss of at least 600 million Swiss francs. The Wall Street Journal reported UBS was projecting a third-quarter loss of 600 million to 700 million Swiss francs based on a writedown of 3 billion to 4 billion Swiss francs. The bank will report the fixed-income loss on Monday, ahead of its third-quarter results which are due October 30, according to the Journal. UBS told investors in August that the third quarter would be difficult if credit markets continued to struggle. UBS's investment banking arm in London was not available to comment in the early hours of Monday. The bank's losses resulted from applying sharply lower market values to asset-backed bonds, after it took a conservative view, the Journal said, citing people close to the matter. The losses would far exceed those reported so far by other investment banks. The fallout of the subprime crisis has varied in the United States, with Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) reporting a near-80 percent jump in quarterly profit last month, and rival Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N posting a 61 percent drop. The potential losses come at a time when critics are questioning UBS's dual strategy of investment banking and wealth management. The bank earlier this year replaced Wuffli, saying it was dissatisfied with his handling of the bank's in-house hedge fund, Dillon Read Capital Management. Wuffli had led the bank of a steep growth path, expanding from its traditional base in private banking and rapidly building up its business in the United States. Investors have grown increasingly concerned that more banks might announce losses related to credit problems as they closed their books on a tumultuous third quarter. Persistent worries about the health of the banking system have weighed on financial markets around the world. A meltdown in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, sparked by growing defaults on riskier loans, has created a squeeze in credit markets around the world. Despite signs in recent weeks that the credit tightness may be easing, some banks continue to report they are struggling to find cash on wholesale lending markets. The FT report did not specify what type of fixed-income assets UBS was writing off. News of UBS's losses was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.
