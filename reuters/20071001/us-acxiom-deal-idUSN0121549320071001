 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The private-equity buyers of Acxiom Corp ( ACXM.O ) are in talks about breaking off their proposed $2.25 billion acquisition of the data-management company, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday, citing people familiar with the situation. 

 Acxiom in May agreed to be acquired by firms Silver Lake and ValueAct Capital. As of Sunday night, it appeared a settlement agreement was close with buyers probably paying about $65 million, below the $110 million termination fee originally agreed to in the deal, the report said. Problems have arisen from Acxiom's most recent earnings report when it swung to a net loss of $11.5 million, the report said. Results for the coming quarter are expected to be even worse, the report said, citing one person familiar with the negotiations. Acxiom was not immediately available for comment.
