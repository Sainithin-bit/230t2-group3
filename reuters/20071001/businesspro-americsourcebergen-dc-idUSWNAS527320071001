 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Dug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp 
( ABC.N ) said on Monday it has agreed to acquire privately held 
Bellco Pharmaceuticals for a revised price of about $190 
million in cash. 

  AmerisourceBergen said the acquisition will be neutral to 
earnings per share in fiscal year 2008 and add about 5 cents a 
share to earnings in fiscal 2009.  When AmerisourceBergen first announced the proposed 
acquisition in March, the purchase price was $235 million. The 
price was cut because of a now-resolved regulatory issue "and 
other business matters," the company said.  (Reporting by  Toni Clarke , editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
