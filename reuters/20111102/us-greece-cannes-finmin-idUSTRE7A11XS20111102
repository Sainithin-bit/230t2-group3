 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos will accompany Prime Minister George Papandreou to emergency talks on Wednesday with the leaders of France and Germany in the French Riviera resort of Cannes, a finance ministry official said. 
 Venizelos was discharged on Wednesday from an Athens hospital he checked in to for stomach problems a day earlier, the official said. "He is feeling much better and he will accompany the prime minister to Cannes," the official said. (Reporting by  Dina Kyriakidou )
