 ATHENS  (Reuters) - A referendum proposed by Prime Minister George Papandreou will ask Greeks to vote on the EU's new bailout deal for the debt-laden country rather than staying in the euro zone, a government spokesman said on Wednesday. Asked about calls for the referendum to be held on euro membership, spokesman Angelos Tolkas told Reuters: "No, this will not be the issue. It will be the bailout plan." 
 Opinion polls show that most Greeks oppose international bailouts that come with harsh belt-tightening measures but are in favor of staying in the euro zone. (Reporting by Renee Maltezou)
