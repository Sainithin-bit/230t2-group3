 LONDON  (Reuters) - Sterling was on course for its biggest one-day percentage loss against the dollar since mid-1993 on Monday, due to financial sector stress after UK lender Bradford & Bingley BB.L was nationalized. 

 Deepening banking sector and money market woes against a backdrop of slowing growth also dimmed the pound's yield appeal as speculation grew that the Bank of England would need to cut rates soon. "Sterling continues to be hit by financial sector stress," ING senior currency strategist Chris Turner said in London. "But that is not all. The BoE may finally have to acknowledge sharply higher credit conditions and that weak growth will show substantially below-trend demand that will open the possibility for rate cuts." "So the pound will likely continue to be an underperformer." At 1100 GMT, sterling was down 2.3 percent at $1.8025 after hitting a 10-day low of $1.7962, according to Reuters data, on track for its biggest one-day fall since June 1993. In a widely anticipated move, the UK government said lender Bradford & Bingley's branch network will be sold to Spanish bank Santander ( SAN.MC ) and the remainder of the group would be nationalized. But the news raised concerns of further fallout from a banking crisis that was spreading beyond U.S. borders. The pound also lost ground against euro, but the single currency was also reeling from banking sector woes. Belgian-Dutch financial group Fortis FOR.BR was rescued in a state buyout after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet held emergency talks with Dutch, Belgian and Luxembourg officials. Separately, the German government and a consortium of banks decided to provide 35 billion euros ($51.21 billion) in credit guarantees to Hypo Real Estate HRXG.DE. European shares fell heavily as the financial storm hit home and as investors pondered the impact of a long-awaited U.S. government plan to shore up its banking sector. U.S. lawmakers on Sunday finally reached an accord on package which will provide the U.S. government with up to $700 billion to buy toxic assets from banks. They will vote on the bill later on Monday. Sentiment was pessimistic about whether European authorities would come together for a similar plan to fix the banking system. "There is a worry whether there is the ability or the willingness within Europe for a U.S.-style response," said Daragh Maher, deputy head of global FX strategy at Calyon. Data on Monday showed British mortgage approvals fell to a series low of 32,000 in August while net mortgage lending slowed to a standstill. Earlier, a survey by property consultants Hometrack showed British house prices fell for a 12th month running in September to stand 6.2 percent lower than they were a year ago. The BoE will hold its next rate-setting meeting on October 8-9. Traders expect the central bank to cut benchmark interest rates from the current 5 percent as early as November.
