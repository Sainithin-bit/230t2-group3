 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - There is no early end in sight to the turmoil wracking financial markets that has humbled the United States before the rest of the world, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in an interview aired on Sunday. 

 In a taped interview on CBS' "60 Minutes," Paulson said the best hope for stabilizing financial markets was the proposed $700 billion bailout program that appeared headed for congressional approval. He declined to speculate on what would happen next if it fails. "It's gotta do it and we're going to make this work and we're going to do what it takes to work," Paulson said of the program, which is designed to take illiquid and unwanted assets off the books of banks and other financial institutions using tax money and hold the assets for eventual resale. "We will have turbulence and turmoil in our financial system for some time but I believe that this is going to work," said Paulson, who was a former highly paid Wall Street executive before he took over Treasury in mid-2006. CBS said it had "shadowed" Paulson over the past two weeks as he eventually decided that a huge bailout was going to be needed, rather than an effort to deal with troubled firms one by one. He expressed exasperation at the current condition of Wall Street and the rest of the U.S. financial system, which helped spawn the current crisis by securitizing risky mortgages into products so complex that few people understand them. "Unfortunately we have a system that is way out whack where our institutions are too big to fail (and) we don't have the regulatory authorities and structure in place to protect the American people," Paulson said. He conceded it was a galling experience. "I'm not proud of a lot of things, you know, as I go around the world right now representing the United States of America -- it's a humbling experience," Paulson said.
