 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - There could be more pain ahead for Wall Street on Tuesday as the odds of quick passage of the $700 billion bill to bail out the financial sector looked slim after lawmakers rejected the first version on Monday. 

 With Asian stocks set to follow Wall Street's biggest slide since the 1987 crash, investors' fear threatened to grip markets further after U.S. lawmakers rejected the proposed $700 billion plan to stabilize the U.S. financial sector and contain the credit crisis. "Short term, the market is getting crushed. But more importantly, we are telling clients we could be at the beginning of a whole new down phase," said Bill Strazzullo, partner and chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading in Boston. He said the benchmark S&P 500  .SPX  falling to the 1,000 level was not out of the question. The U.S. House of Representatives voted 228 to 205 against a compromise bailout plan that would have let the Treasury Department buy toxic assets from struggling banks. House Republicans, in particular, balked at spending so much taxpayer money just before the November 4 U.S. elections. On Monday the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  sank 777.68 points, or 6.98 percent, to 10,365.45. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dropped 106.59 points, or 8.79 percent, to 1,106.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  lost 199.61 points, or 9.14 percent, to 1,983.73. UNCHARTED WATERS "We have to see what happens here," Strazzullo said. "It is totally uncharted. I think it is very difficult to gauge. It's not trying to predict an economic event. It's a political event and you never know what is going on behind the scenes." Analysts said the freezing of credit markets and signs that more and more banks are now succumbing to the strains stemming from the U.S. housing slump probably will fuel more volatility. S&P 500 futures dropped 3.50 points late on Monday, while Dow Jones industrial average futures declined 40 points and Nasdaq 100 fell 3 points. On the Asian front, Nikkei futures traded in Chicago were down 905 points, or 7.5 percent. "Everyone is talking about when are they going to have another vote. The big thing this market wants is some type of a resolution on whatever bailout plan we get," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. "Fear seems to be really ramping up. Tomorrow's open is going to be the most anticipated opening since the reopening of the market on September 17, 2001." That day, which was a Monday, marked the first day of trading after the September 11 attacks on the United States in 2001. The failure of the bailout bill -- after more than a week of intensive closed-door negotiations intended to hammer out a compromise plan -- brought new uncertainty about the response of the U.S. government to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. U.S. President George W. Bush was set to huddle with economic advisers to consider the administration's next move. Any action, however, might be complicated by the observation of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year holiday, from sunset on Monday, September 29, until sunset on Wednesday, October 1. "The world is obviously looking for some type of leadership from the United States, but the crisis is bigger than just the U.S. obviously," said Detrick.
