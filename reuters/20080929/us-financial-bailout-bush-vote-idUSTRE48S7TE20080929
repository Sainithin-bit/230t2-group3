 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Monday he was disappointed that the House of Representatives voted down a $700 billion plan to rescue the financial system but said he would continue to confront the problem head-on. 

 "We put forth a plan that was big because we've got a big problem," Bush told reporters after a meeting with Ukraine President Viktor Yushchenko. "Our strategy is to continue to address this economic situation head-on and we'll be working to develop a strategy that will enable us to continue to move forward."
