 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The House of Representatives will abandon its previous plan to recess so members can campaign for re-election in order to try to come up with an alternative to a Wall Street bailout bill that failed on Monday, a senior House aide said. 

 "We have to stay here to deal with this," the aide said. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan )
