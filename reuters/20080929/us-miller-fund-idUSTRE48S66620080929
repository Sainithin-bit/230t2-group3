 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Facing his worst-ever slide due to catastrophic bets on financials, Legg Mason Inc ( LM.N ) fund manager Bill Miller is toning down his characteristic bold investment style in an attempt to recapture his past glory. 

 Miller's comeback is crucial to the fortunes of Legg, the second-largest publicly traded U.S. asset manager, which has seen investors pull out billions of dollars from his main Value Trust fund as returns have tumbled since 2006, ending a record 15 straight years of beating the Standard & Poor's 500 index. "What happened with Bill is that he was so successful for so long that when he began to be much less successful he thought it was going to be very temporary," said Jean-Marie Eveillard, a portfolio manager of First Eagle Funds and a well-known value-style investor. "So he waited, and now he's come to the conclusion that 'I have to change my tune,'" said Eveillard, who owns Legg shares. The Value Trust had lost 34.6 percent in 2008 through Friday's close, more than double the Standard & Poor's index's 16.10 percent drop in the same period, and ranked at the bottom of all large-capitalization growth funds, according to Lipper Inc. Its size has fallen to about $8 billion now from $20.6 billion at the end of June 2007. The losses are also tarnishing Miller's longer-term record, on which many institutional investors base their investment decisions. The fund now lags the S&P index over three, five and 10 years as well. Stung by the poor returns, Miller is spreading out his investments in the fund to more sectors, buying more of bigger and safer stocks and stopping a policy of aggressively purchasing select stocks that others are dumping. That's a big change for a manager who bet on Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) at its initial public offering in 2004, when many others shied away, and was an early investor in Dell IncDELL.O in the 1990s and Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ),even as others doubted their futures. Miller, 53, told reporters at Legg's Baltimore headquarters last week that not buying energy and materials stocks when they were cheap earlier this decade, coupled with investments in some financial sector companies, had hurt the Value Trust's returns. "I'm very disappointed in our results relative to history and to our expectations. We are responding to that by analyzing the causes and sources and making adjustments to the (investment) process," Miller said. He did not specify the sectors or stocks that the fund would buy or sell but said General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) would fit the category of "safe and cheap" picks. Investors and analysts viewed Miller's changes as significant but were skeptical whether or how quickly they would work. "The difficulty that he's faced with is that a lot of his concentrated bets have gone out of business, unlike in the past, where they have underperformed but as the market has turned, they have outperformed," said an industry consultant, who did not want to be identified because he works closely with fund managers. Some of Miller's investments in the financial sector have come unstuck, such as American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), Freddie Mac FRE.N, and, earlier, Bear Stearns, which have all been wrecked by the credit crisis. Nearly a fifth of the fund's exposure was to the financial sector as of the end of June. The fund had 35 holdings as of June 30. "He moves to a new strategy which is more conservative, more risk-averse -- which means that his upside is limited. And if he stops moving up, it will take longer for him to recover," said Eveillard of First Eagle Funds. Legg Mason managed $923 billion in assets as of June 30. (Editing by Gerald E.
