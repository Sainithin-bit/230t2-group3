 (Reuters) - ImClone Systems Inc is expected to announce later on Monday that it is continuing talks to sell itself to a major pharmaceutical concern for a price in the range of $6.1 billion, the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, which has been trying to buy ImClone, last week raised its offer for the part of the company it does not already own to around $4.7 billion. ImClone is expected to announce a deadline by which it hopes to have a deal with its other suitor, the paper said, citing the people familiar with the matter. The two sides remain in "deep discussions" and believe they can reach a resolution within days, it added. One person involved in the talks told the paper more than one company had expressed interest in exploring a transaction with ImClone following Bristol's unsolicited July bid. These parties included Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly & Co, the source said. ImClone, Pfizer and Eli Lilly could not immediately be reached for comment.
