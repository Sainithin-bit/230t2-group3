 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Electronics retailer Circuit City Stores CC.N posted a wider quarterly loss and withdrew its financial outlook as it reviews its business ahead of the key holiday shopping season, sending its shares down 8 percent. 

 The company, which last week announced the immediate exit of its chairman and chief executive officer, also said on Monday it would suspend store openings beginning with its 2010 fiscal year to focus on turning around its operations. "These guys face a big uphill climb," said Joe Feldman, managing director of Telsey Advisory Group. "The busiest time of the year is fast approaching and are they going to be able to execute properly is going to be a big concern." Retail forecasters are predicting that 2008 will be one of the bleakest holiday sales periods in years, as a U.S. housing slump, credit crisis and job losses force consumers to rein in spending. The Richmond, Virginia, chain has been trying to rebuild profitability and restore investor confidence over the past year, but faces a tough U.S. economy and intense competition from Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ), which has been gaining market share in key electronics categories. Earlier this month, Best Buy said earnings fell 19 percent for the second quarter as it spent money to improve stores, but sales rose 12 percent. Circuit City has posted losses for five of the past six quarters, and sales have fallen for more than a year. The company's second-quarter net loss was $239.2 million, or $1.45 a share, compared with a loss of $62.8 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges, the loss came to $1 a share, compared with a loss of $1.04 expected by analysts on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales fell nearly 10 percent to $2.39 billion, short of the $2.5 billion analysts expected, as lower U.S. sales offset a rise in international sales. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, fell 13.3 percent, hurt by lower results in major categories including televisions, computers and video games. BUILDING UP TO HOLIDAY SEASON The company cited a significant decline in traffic, which it attributed to deteriorating economic conditions and competition. Circuit City said it was conducting a comprehensive business review, including assessing its asset base. The company said it would take action to improve retail basics for the critical holiday season, including the launch of a new marketing campaign, an upgrade of store signage and a boost in its in-stock position on key products. Last week, Circuit City said Philip Schoonover agreed to step down as chairman and CEO and named James Marcum as acting CEO. Marcum was nominated to Circuit City's board earlier this year by investor Mark Wattles, who had called for Schoonover's ouster. Circuit City also withdrew its financial outlook. In June, it had forecast sales would be relatively unchanged from the prior year, and an improvement in earnings from continued operations before taxes as a percentage of consolidated net sales of 50 basis points to 100 basis points. The retailer also said it was evaluating capital spending projects planned for the second half and for the fiscal year ending in 2010. Other than existing commitments, it plans to suspend store openings beginning with fiscal 2010. Cash and short-term investments fell to $92.5 million as of August 31, from $424.4 million a year earlier, as the company saw a loss from operations and bought property and equipment. Circuit City's shares were down 12 cents, or 8.8 percent, at $1.25 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. Best Buy slipped 3 percent to $37.90. Circuit City's stock has plummeted 69 percent this year, while Best Buy is down about 27 percent. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
