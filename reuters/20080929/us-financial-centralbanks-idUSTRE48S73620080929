 WASHINGTON/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The world's central banks redoubled their efforts on Monday to revive the paralyzed global financial system but their efforts may come to naught after U.S. lawmakers rejected a bank bailout bill. 

 The House of Representatives rejected by a vote of 228-205 a Wall Street bailout bill that would have authorized the Treasury Department to spend up to $700 billion to purchase troubled mortgage-backed bonds from banks with the goal of jump-starting stalled capital markets. Though faulted by many, the bill was also seen as the kind of measure that could unclog the world's bank-to-bank lending market, which is crucial to keeping the global economy moving. News of the bill's rejection caused stocks to plummet but sent U.S. Treasuries prices soaring as investors sought the safety of government bonds, just the kind of risk-averse flight to quality that officials have been trying to unwind. "Now the credit markets are going to be even more frozen," Bill Gross, chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co, told CNBC television. News of the House vote followed the Federal Reserve's announcement of a $330 billion expansion to arrangements aimed at boosting U.S. dollar liquidity throughout the global financial system to counteract a world financial crisis emanating from last year's mortgage meltdown in the United States. The action increased reciprocal swap lines with the European Central Bank and eight other central banks to $620 billion from $290 billion previously, the Fed said in a statement. The announcement came after European and Asian central banks had already been busy pumping more money into sclerotic world banking systems on Monday in an effort to persuade financial firms to stop hoarding cash, which threatens to slow the global economy to a halt. The efforts showed the heightened tensions in interbank lending as the approaching end of the financial quarter compounds the scramble for cash. Global money markets remained under severe stress and the world's financial system appeared to be edging closer to the brink of collapse. Authorities in Europe and the United States struggled to keep banks afloat through injections of cash, nationalizations and mergers of necessity. London interbank offered rates for three-month euro funds and the premium for borrowing euros over anticipated official policy rates rose to their highest ever since the currency was launched almost a decade ago.
