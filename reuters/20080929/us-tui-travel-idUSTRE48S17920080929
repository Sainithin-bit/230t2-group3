 LONDON  (Reuters) - TUI Travel ( TT.L ), Europe's biggest travel firm, said on Monday Thomas Cook ( TCG.L ) has withdrawn from discussions with TUI Travel and Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) about a merger of its charter airline Condor with TUIfly and Germanwings. 

 TUI Travel said it is continuing to explore alternatives for its German airline operation and will update the market in due course. The group, created last year from the tie-up of TUI AG's ( TUIGn.DE ) travel division and Britain's First Choice, also said it is confident of meeting its expectations for the current year and 2009 and said trading in the last seven weeks has progressed as it anticipated. The group said it has now sold 94 percent of its summer 2008 offering in the UK, which is 3 percent ahead of last year. It said it had entered the 'lates' booking period with significantly less stock left to sell, enabling it to reduce the level of discounting compared to previous years. The group and its rival, Thomas Cook, have been cutting capacity, leaving them with fewer holidays to sell and enabling them to avoid deep discounting on late bookings. TUI Travel said that, although it remains very early in the selling season, it is pleased with summer 2009 trading in the UK, which is the only key market currently on sale.
