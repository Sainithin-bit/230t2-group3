 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Steelcase Inc ( SCS.N ), the world's largest office furniture maker, reported lower quarterly net earnings on Monday as commodity cost inflation outpaced price increases. 

 Second-quarter earnings fell to $31.4 million, or 23 cents per share, from $37.7 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. "We continue to face tremendous commodity cost inflation, which is expected to out-pace our recent pricing actions for another quarter or two," said Chief Financial Officer David Sylvester in a statement. Excluding the restructuring charges, however, Steelcase earned 28 cents per share, solidly beating analyst estimates of 22 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The office furniture industry is heading into a slump, after mid-to-high single-digit growth in 2006 and mid-single-digit growth in 2007. Year-to-date, orders and shipments are flat, heralding double-digit declines in 2009, according to data from the Business and Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association. The trade group sees 2008 orders and shipments falling 2.4 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively. In 2009, BIFMA is projecting a drop in both orders and shipments of slightly more than 10 percent. Revenue rose 9.3 percent to $901.8 million, beating analyst estimates of $865.6 million. Steelcase sees third-quarter earnings between 16 and 21 cents per share, including restructuring costs and commodity inflation. Analysts forecast third-quarter earnings of 20 cents per share. Steelcase's shares fell about 1 percent to about $10.34 per share in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Dave Zimmerman)
