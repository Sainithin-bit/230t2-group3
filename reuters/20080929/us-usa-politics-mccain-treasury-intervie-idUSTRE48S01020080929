 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - White House candidate John McCain would choose a Treasury Secretary with expertise and experience in financial markets, but now is too early to identify potential picks, an adviser to the Republican presidential candidate said on Sunday. 

 "You have to do things in the right order and the first is to make our case to the American people and get John McCain elected," senior economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin told Reuters when asked about potential candidates for the post. Interest in who will hold the top Treasury job in the next administration has grown as lawmakers work out a $700 billion bailout plan for financial institutions that would hand greater powers to the department. Holtz-Eakin said McCain, a senator from Arizona, would choose someone with values that he shares. "He's always felt that those sort of appointments require first and foremost ... shared values, the standards of ethics that he brings to this and the desire to operate in that fashion. And then clear expertise, experience and judgment," he said. "I would hope that, since this is a financial market policy, that any Secretary of the Treasury would have adequate experience to be involved in financial markets to begin with." Asked whether the Wall Street crisis increased the likelihood of McCain prodding President George W. Bush's pick, Sec. Henry Paulson, to stay on board, Holtz-Eakin demurred. "There's in general just nothing we can say about appointments. We have a campaign to run and hopefully he'll have a chance to get into the appointments business." Paulson, the former chairman and chief executive of investment bank Goldman Sachs, took over the helm at the Treasury department in July 2006. In recent weeks he has become the face of the bailout drive for the Bush administration. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama told CNBC in a recent interview that Paulson would be involved in the transition to a new administration if the Illinois senator won the November 4 election, but he did not go so far as to say the Republican could keep his job. "I would certainly want to make sure that Paulson was involved in the transition. That doesn't necessarily mean that he'd end up being Secretary of the Treasury," Obama said. In an interview with Reuters on September 15, before the financial crisis had escalated to its current levels, Obama said he would choose someone "with extraordinary credentials who knows the marketplace, knows the players and knows government."
