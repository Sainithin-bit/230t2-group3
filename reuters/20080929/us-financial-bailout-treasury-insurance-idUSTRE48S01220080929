 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Department officials said on Sunday night that taking warrants in companies that benefit from a program allowing them to unload bad assets was a vital way to protect taxpayers' interests. 

 "We think taking warrants is prudent and responsible to help the taxpayers share some of the upside of the institutions as well as protecting taxpayers from some of the downside," one official said at a background briefing as lawmakers prepared for a Monday vote on the program. Treasury could take warrants, which would give it an equity stake in the companies, even if they were foreign companies in some cases. "If there were a foreign bank that had a sufficient U.S.. presence as it is defined in the bill, then yes, we would expect to take warrants in the institutions if they participate in the facility," a Treasury official said. The officials said insurance proposals that were offered in the program at the insistence of some Republican members could be very helpful. The said firms could either try to sell their assets to the Treasury or they could choose to try to insure against losses. Many details are yet to be worked out on the insurance program but officials explained how they think it will work. "As an example if someone has a bond that is trading at a discount, they could in theory come to the Treasury Department (and) pay a premium in exchange for insurance that would pay that bond off at par," a Treasury official said. "The difference between what that bond is worth today and the payoff at par is very roughly what the value of the premium would be." It was still unclear exactly how the Treasury will take troubled assets from banks and other financial firms that are seeking to get rid of them. "Reverse auctions is one technique that we are exploring and this will be suitable for certain classes of assets," a Treasury official said, but not necessarily the only one. "There may be other types of auctions, for example we could solicit a proposal to buy whole loans and receive a lot of proposals from different institutions and evaluate them against one another," the official added.
