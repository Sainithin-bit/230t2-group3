 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup briefly fell more than 2 percent at the market open on Monday after the bank said it will buy Wachovia Corp in a deal brokered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

 Shares pared some of their initial losses, though, and were last trading at $19.99, down 0.7 percent from Friday's close of $20.15. (Reporting by  Steven C. Johnson ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
