 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democratic leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives are going to try to move another financial rescue bill after a $700 billion plan was rejected in a House vote, a senior House Democrat said on Monday. 

 As he rushed into a meeting in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said he expected the leadership to advance another bill, but that he had no idea when it would happen.
