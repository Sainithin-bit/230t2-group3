 TEHRAN  (Reuters) - Iran does not expect OPEC to discuss changing output levels at its next regular meeting in Vienna in September, Oil Minister Kazem Vaziri-Hamaneh was quoted as saying on Sunday. 

 "Crude oil price fluctuations are related to geopolitical issues and a shortage of gasoline in America, and I do not imagine that, at its next regular annual meeting, OPEC would put the issue of changing its output level on the agenda," he was quoted as saying by the Iranian oil ministry's Web site Shana. "There is a long time until then but if the market situation remains as now Iran will not have the view to increase production," Vaziri-Hamaneh said. He also said the amount of oil reserves and production was high and that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would therefore not hold an emergency meeting before the Vienna meeting. The oil price has surged over the past month to near-record highs over $78 as supply concerns helped draw investor interest. On Friday, U.S. oil jumped more than 2 percent to its second-highest settlement on record as supply concerns and signs of U.S. economic growth helped counter worries about falling stock markets. OPEC countries, including its second-largest producer Iran, have repeatedly said the oil market does not lack crude and have blamed the surge in prices on inadequate refining capacity, political issues and other factors.
