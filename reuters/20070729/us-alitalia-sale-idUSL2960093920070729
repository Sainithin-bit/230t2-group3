 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy cannot hope to sell Alitalia AZPIa.MI through private negotiations with suitors because that would be challenged by the courts, the economy minister said, highlighting Rome's dwindling options to save the airline. 

 The Italian Treasury, which has a 49.9 percent stake in Alitalia, is struggling to decide its next move to salvage the money-losing carrier after its seven-month auction collapsed earlier this month. Economy Minister Tomasso Padoa-Schioppa last week said Rome was debating whether to start a new bidding process from scratch or begin direct talks with potential suitors, but backed away from the latter option on Sunday. "This the state cannot do, I can't do it as the economy minister," he said at a book discussion. "The audit courts won't allow it. The judges would begin to investigate the motive with which I began to negotiate with buyer X instead of buyer Y." After being embarrassed by the collapse of its plans to sell Alitalia, the Italian government is now under attack from unions and the opposition for dragging its feet on finalizing the next step to rescue Alitalia. Alitalia loses more than a million euros a day, suffers from frequent strikes and widespread inefficiency. As bad as things may be at Alitalia, Padoa-Schioppa reiterated that he did not expect the airline to go bankrupt and that it could revived without such "traumatic" moves. The airline's woes were the fruit of at least 30 years of missteps, he said, blaming politics, unions, management and the entire system within which it functioned. "A slow descent into an ever more critical situation in which there was a chronic lag in understanding that this was a prosperous, protected company that did not have competitors, was always under much less competition than in other countries," he said.
