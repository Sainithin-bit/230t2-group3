 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ) said on Friday it will sell its subprime lender Option One Mortgage Corp. to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management L.P., sending the tax preparer's shares up nearly 9 percent. 

 The final price H&R Block will receive for Option One, which has been buffeted by a crisis sweeping providers of mortgages to less credit-worthy home buyers, remained unclear. It will depend on the value of Option One's tangible net assets when the deal closes, expected to happen in H&R Block's quarter ended October 31. Cerberus will pay the value of those assets -- $1.27 billion as of January 31 -- less $300 million, H&R Block said. H&R Block will also have the option of selling some Option One assets before the deal closes. The deal allows H&R Block, which also said it is closing the unit's H&R Block Mortgage Corp., to exit the subprime loan arena, which is in crises amid rising defaults among less credit-worthy home buyers. H&R Block shares were up 8.7 percent at $23.70 in electronic pre-market trading. For Cerberus, which made its name as a distressed asset buyer and has grown to become one of the largest fund traders and buyout firms in the world, the deal represents a latest bet on consumer finance after it led a consortium buying 51 percent of General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) financing arm GMAC. GMAC also owns a mortgage finance company which has felt pressure from subprime lending woes. H&R had said in January it hoped to get at least $1.3 billion for Option One, which it sold as part of a plan to refocus on its core tax preparation business. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company added that it will take a noncash pretax impairment charge of about $290 million to $320 million in its fiscal 2007 fourth quarter, which ends in April. In addition to the cash purchase price, H&R Block may also receive an additional earnout cash payment, contingent on Option One's future profit from mortgage originations. The earnout arrangement allows H&R Block to receive half of Option One's cumulative net income from its loan origination business, for the 18 months following the closing, up to a maximum of $300 million. The closure of Option One's loan originator unit H&R Block Mortgage will also result in pretax severance, facilities closure and other charges of about $25 million, and an additional noncash pretax goodwill impairment charge of about $16 million. H&R reiterated its forecast for operating profit of $1.15 to $1.25 per share excluding the impact of the mortgage operations and related charges. On a net basis, it expects to post a full-year loss. As a result of the charges and conditions in the subprime mortgage industry, the company expects to delay filing its fourth-quarter and full year results until June 21. H&R Block said it was advised by Goldman Sachs & Co. ( GS.N ) on the deal. (Reporting by Anup Roy in Bangalore and  Christian Plumb  in New York)
