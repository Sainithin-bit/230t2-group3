 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ), the manufacturer of heavy construction and mining equipment, reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings on Friday and raised its full-year outlook, saying strength in almost all of its businesses was offsetting weakness in residential housing and on-highway engine markets. 

 The company reported net profit of $816 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $840 million, or $1.20 a share, last year. Sales and revenue rose 7 percent to $10.02 billion. Analysts, on average, expected Caterpillar to report a profit of $1.08 a share on sales of $8.910 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
