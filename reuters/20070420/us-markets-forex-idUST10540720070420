 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar edged up against the euro on Friday, after touching a two-year low overnight, helped by rallying U.S. stock prices and as dealers squared their positions before the weekend. 

 A rebound in U.S. stocks on Friday helped offset what is likely to be the dollar's biggest weekly decline against a basket of major currencies so far this year. "The rally in stocks is helping boost the dollar a bit after a week of declines against the euro," said Nick Bennenbroek, head of foreign exchange strategy at Wells Fargo & Co. "It's also Friday, and we have managers squaring their short positions on the dollar." Higher U.S. stock prices helps investor sentiment on the U.S. economy, giving temporary respite for the dollar, which fell to a two-year low on Thursday against a basket of currencies. .DXY. On Friday, the index was at 81.661, nearly unchanged on the day. The euro has been boosted by the outlook for higher interest rates in coming months from the European Central Bank while the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates at least once this year. On Friday, the euro hit a session high of $1.3637, approaching the record high of $1.3670 set in December 2004. But after U.S. stock market benchmark indices rallied, the euro reversed course and slid to $1.3594, about 0.1 percent down on the day.  YEN LOWER The European currency rose against the yen, or 0.2 percent to 161.58 yen, having hit a record peak of 162.42 this week. The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 118.85 yen. Still, Bennenbroek at Wells Fargo and traders said the euro is likely to resume its advance amid signs that European politicians may not take action in the near term to prevent it from strengthening, traders said. "The euro is definitely going to keep strong," said Mike Kaizer, a senior currency trader at M&T Bank in Buffalo, New York. "We are in some sort of 'green-light' zone in regards to the euro. The feeling is that officials won't put a brake to the currency's gains, at least for now." Kaizer at M&T Bank said that a euro/dollar close above $1.3600 on Friday, would pave the way for another push to the all-time high early next week. The euro has also been boosted by prospects of narrowing interest rate differentials with the United States as the region's robust growth and inflation pressures will probably prompt the European Central Bank to raise rates again in June. In contrast, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut rates at least once this year, from 5.25 percent. At the same time, the absence of visible policy-maker opposition to a strong euro has also contributed to the currency's gains. Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker and other finance ministers said on Friday the euro's strength was no reason to panic. "The fact that we haven't heard anything from European politicians, that in itself is encouraging news for the euro," said Adarsh Sinha, currency strategist at Barclays Capital. "Everyone believes they (the ECB) will hike rates in June." With Japanese benchmark interest rates at just 0.5 percent, and seen rising only very gradually, the yen is a favorite funding currency for carry trade investments in higher return units. Amid lack of economic releases on Friday, investors may tune into comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, slated to speak on issues between the U.S. and China. ECB TO HIKE DESPITE STRONG EURO The ECB is set to raise interest rates to 4 percent in June with the risk of another move to 4.25 percent later this year, according to economists' expectations. Growth in the euro area is projected at 2.3 percent in 2007 and 2008, according to the International Monetary Fund. The forecast is higher than a previous estimate by the Fund for a 2.0 percent growth. ECB Governing Council member Axel Weber said in a newspaper interview inflation risks exist in the medium term and the ECB must act against them. Euro zone central bankers and finance ministers, in Berlin for a two-day informal meeting, sounded relatively unconcerned about the euro's exchange rate although Governing Council member Vitor Constancio said the ECB is watching euro strength closely.
