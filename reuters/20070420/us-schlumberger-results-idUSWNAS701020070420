 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Schlumberger Ltd. ( SLB.N ), the world's largest oilfield services company, on Friday reported a 63 percent rise in first-quarter profit that topped Wall Street expectations, as exploration in international markets boosted demand for its products and earnings at its seismic unit increased. 

 Profit rose to $1.18 billion, or 96 cents per share, from $723 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 90 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking ahead, Schlumberger repeated its expectations for a pickup in natural gas activity in North America, but cautioned that extra capacity, especially in the pressure pumping market, will limit pricing power. The Houston-based company, which provides services to help energy companies find and produce oil and gas, reported operating revenue of $5.46 billion, up from $4.24 billion in first quarter 2006. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts had expected revenue of $5.4 billion. Oilfield Services revenue rose 28 percent to $4.76 billion, while pretax operating income increased 47 percent to $1.41 billion. At the company's WesternGeco seismic unit, revenue rose 33 percent to $706 million, and operating income climbed 79 percent to $266 million.
