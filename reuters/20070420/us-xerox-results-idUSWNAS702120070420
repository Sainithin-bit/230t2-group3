 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ), the world's largest supplier of office printers, copiers and related services, said on Friday that quarterly profit rose, driven by sales of service contracts and supplies. For the first quarter, net income was $233 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $200 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special charges, profit was 26 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting 21 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The Stamford, Connecticut, company, which earlier this month said it would buy office technology products provider Global Imaging Systems Inc. GISX.O for $1.5 billion, has in recent years delivered steady profits, despite its struggle to spur revenue growth. Xerox stock closed on Thursday at $18.08, up 6 percent so far this year. Earlier this month, it hit its highest level in almost seven years.
