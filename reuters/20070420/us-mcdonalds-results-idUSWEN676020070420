 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) said on Friday it will sell about 1,600 restaurants in Latin America and the Caribbean for $700 million to a franchisee organization led by the man who brought the Golden Arches to Argentina 20 years ago. 

 The world's largest restaurant chain also reported a 22 percent rise in first-quarter earnings, sending its stock to an all-time high in early trading before reversing course to drop about 1.3 percent. McDonald's profit matched a better-than-expected outlook the company gave last week. Strong U.S. demand for its new chicken Snack Wrap and improved performance in international markets such as China, Japan, France and Russia helped extend a turnaround that has doubled McDonald's stock in the last three years. The sale of the Latin American and Caribbean restaurants to an organization led by businessman Woods Staton, former president of McDonald's Argentina, is part of a broader plan by the company to focus resources on markets where it sees the biggest opportunities for growth. McDonald's Latin American business, after losing money for three straight years earlier this decade, is now profitable thanks in part to three years of double-digit same-store sales increases. But the unit's the overall impact on McDonald's bottom line is small. In 2006 it contributed less than 1 percent to the hamburger chain's overall operating profit. "They are taking capital out of a market in which they are struggling," said Morningstar analyst John Owens. "McDonald's is simply going to collect a royalty from these restaurants, and they no longer are going to have to commit invested capital." PLANS, QUARTERLY PROFIT McDonald's plans to use the funds for dividends and share repurchases. The company expects to pay out $5.7 billion for dividends and share repurchases in 2007 and 2008. The company said it will post a second-quarter charge of about $1.6 billion for the sale of the restaurants, about half of which will be for the difference between the book value of the assets and the cash proceeds. The other half will be for accumulated currency losses. McDonald's said it October it hoped to sell 2,300 restaurants to franchisees, or what it calls developmental licensees. The United Kingdom and Canada are other markets in which McDonald's wants to reduce its restaurant ownership. For the first quarter, net income rose to $762.4 million, or 62 cents per share, from $625.3 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. Initiatives such as a focus on breakfast and extended restaurant hours have been key to revitalizing performance at the company's U.S. business over the last three years, though analysts expect sales increases in that market to slow later this year. In recent months, restaurants in Asia and Europe have started to post robust sales increases, in part because of a strategy of combining higher-priced products with less expensive items on the menu. Quarterly revenue rose 11 percent to $5.46 billion, while same-store sales rose 6.3 percent. One investor said that while McDonald's shares are fairly valued at their current level, sales increases in international markets could send them higher in the coming months. "The potential for strong sales overseas is what will drive that, rather than the U.S. market," said Janna Sampson, director of portfolio management at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Ill. "They are just in the early stages of jump-starting Europe." McDonald's shares trade at about 16.9 times analysts' average 2008 earnings estimate, compared with an average of 18.3 times for companies in the Dow Jones U.S. Restaurants and Bars index .DJSURU Its shares were down 78 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $48.00 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange after hitting a lifetime high of $49.70 earlier in the session.
