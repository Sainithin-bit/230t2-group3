 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Teen retailer American Eagle 
Outfitters Inc. ( AEO.N ) said on Friday it sued Payless 
ShoeSource Inc. PSS.N claiming the shoe retailer is falsely 
creating the impression it is selling genuine American Eagle 
Outfitters footwear. 

  Payless sells a line of American Eagle shoes. It acquired 
the brand name last May from Jimlar Corp., which is not 
affiliated with American Eagle Outfitters.  The lawsuit says Payless is creating confusion among 
shoppers with the brand name and is also marketing those shoes 
in a style similar to American Eagle Outfitters' advertising.  "Payless will continue to unfairly benefit from the 
commercial value of the American Eagle brand," American Eagle 
Outfitters said in the statement.  Payless' Web site displays some 90 different styles of 
"American Eagle" shoes, from flip-flops and sneakers to ballet 
flats and high heels, as well as a selection of tote bags.  Payless did not immediately return a telephone call seeking 
comment.  In a statement announcing the acquisition of the American 
Eagle brand for footwear from Jimlar last May, Payless said the 
move was part of a strategy to offer brands with "recognizable 
brand names."  Payless said in that statement that the youth-oriented 
American Eagle brand had a "rich history and has been available 
at better department stores for the past two decades."  Other brands available at Payless include Spalding, 
Champion, Airwalk and Nike's Tailwind line of shoes.  The American Eagle Outfitters chain, one of the most 
popular in the mall over the past year, sells preppy, casual 
clothing, footwear and accessories to teenagers and college-age 
youth.  (Additional reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj)
