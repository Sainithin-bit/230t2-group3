 LONDON  (Reuters) - A $22 billion bid battle for Alliance Boots, Britain's biggest pharmacy chain, broke out on Friday, pitting a private equity firm led by financier Guy Hands and another backed by billionaire Stefano Pessina. 

 U.S. buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Pessina, Alliance Boots' deputy chairman and biggest shareholder, said they had agreed to buy the drugs wholesaler and retailer with a firm offer of 1,090 pence a share in cash. But only hours later Guy Hands' Terra Firma, working with medical charity Wellcome Trust and banking group HBOS, said it had made an indicative proposal to the company's board worth 1,126 pence a share in cash. This would fall to an actual offer of 1,115 pence a share or 10.8 billion pounds ($21.7 billion) for investors after taking account of the fee the consortium would have to pay to break up the deal with KKR and Pessina. Alliance Boots shares surged to as high as 1,141 pence on speculation the battle had further to run. Alliance Boots and KKR were not immediately available for comment. "There is headroom to this," said Bernstein analyst Luca Solca. He had a target price of 1,060 pence for Alliance Boots shares, but said he had calculated a theoretical maximum of up to 1,300 pence that a private equity firm might be able to pay. Panmure Securities' Christian Koefoed-Nielsen thought KKR was in the strongest position, because it is backed by Pessina. Alliance Boots sells medicines, beauty products and sandwiches and also runs a drug-distribution business. It was  created last year from the merger of 150-year-old health and beauty retailer Boots and drugs wholesaler Alliance UniChem. A nuclear engineer by training, Pessina turned his family's ailing Naples drug wholesaler into pan-European giant Alliance UniChem and then masterminded the merger with Boots. He owns about 15 percent of the group. BIG DEAL Any deal for Alliance Boots would be Europe's biggest leveraged buyout and the first private equity takeover of a FTSE-100 company. Last week a private equity team dropped plans to bid for British supermarket group J. Sainsbury. KKR had been part of that team, but pulled out to focus on its bid for Alliance Boots. Cash-rich private equity firms have been pursuing a string of deals as they take advantage of cheap borrowing costs to buy companies whose property assets and strong cash flows allow them to pay off debt quickly. Terra Firma said it was seeking further information from Alliance Boots and there was no guarantee it would make an actual offer for the firm. An Alliance Boots spokesman said earlier that Terra Firma had seen the same information given to KKR, but would wait to hear what else it wanted before deciding whether to provide it. Terra Firma's indicative offer is 37 percent above Alliance Boots' closing share price on March 8, the day before it said it had received a bid approach. It values Alliance Boots at 24 times forecast earnings versus a European retail sector average of 19.4 times, according to Reuters Estimates. Neither bidding team has reached an agreement with Alliance Boots' pension trustees, which could be a stumbling block as the trustees may request additional contributions for the firm's pension schemes as a condition for their support. Alliance Boots has about 3,000 retail outlets, including around 2,600 pharmacies, health and beauty stores and optician practices in Britain. It also operates over 380 drug distribution depots across Europe and said on Friday it had been appointed as one of two UK distribution partners for drugmaker AstraZeneca. KKR and Pessina are being advised by UniCredit, JP Morgan Cazenove and Merrill Lynch, while Goldman Sachs and Greenhill are acting for Alliance Boots and Lehman Brothers and Gleacher Shacklock are acting for the Terra Firma group.
