 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers (UAW) union is considering a proposal to seek a majority stake in DaimlerChrysler's DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group in return for cost concessions, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 It said the proposal, first floated by a small group of workers, would entail swapping cuts in healthcare benefits and other cost concessions. It cited a person familiar with the matter for the information. DaimlerChrysler, the world's fifth-biggest carmaker, said in February it was considering all options for loss-making Chrysler. Sources have told Reuters that bidders for Chrysler include private equity firms Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, Blackstone Group BG.UL and Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc MGa.TO. Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian has also made a $4.5 billion bid. One source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Thursday that a sale could be wrapped up by next month.
