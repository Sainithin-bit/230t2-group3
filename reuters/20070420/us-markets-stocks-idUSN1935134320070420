 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on Friday, with the Dow closing at a record high after coming within 35 points of 13,000, as Google Inc. and Caterpillar Inc. joined the list of companies reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly results. 

 The Dow closed up more than 150 points, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500 index closed at its highest level since September 2000. April was shaping up to be the best month for the Dow and the S&P in just over four years. Higher oil prices aided the rally, lifting shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. to an all-time high and boosting shares of other energy companies. Google shares gained 2.3 percent at $482.48, which helped the Nasdaq, after reporting on Thursday after the market close a rise in quarterly profit that easily beat expectations. For more see. "Momentum is clearly in the bull favor," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Co, in Philadelphia. "We're in the midst of earnings season. By and large it has come in as expected, and recent economic data keeps suggesting an economy that is slow but not slowing further." The Dow Jones industrial average rose 153.35 points, or 1.20 percent, to end at 12,961.98, its third straight record close. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was up 13.62 points, or 0.93 percent, at 1,484.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 21.04 points, or 0.84 percent, at 2,526.39. The Dow hit an intraday record high at 12,966.29, and had its best daily percentage gain in a month. The average, which rose 2.8 percent for the week, has closed higher in all but one session so far this month. On Wednesday, the blue-chip Dow hit its first record since February 20, a week before the global equities sell-off. For the week, the S&P 500 gained 2.2 percent and Nasdaq rose 1.4 percent. It was the third straight week of gains for all three indexes. In what analysts say is another bullish sign for the market, the Dow Jones transportation average rose 0.8 percent and hit a lifetime high during the session. Shares of Caterpillar, a manufacturer of heavy construction and mining equipment, led advances on the Dow, ending up 4.7 percent at $71.82. Caterpillar also raised its outlook and said growth outside of North America would offset weakness in its U.S. housing and truck engine markets. For more see.

Crude for May delivery gained $1.55 to settle at $63.38 a barrel. Exxon shares rose 3 percent to $79.76, and reached an all-time high of $79.80. More strong results came from Honeywell International Inc., whose stock rose 4.8 percent to $51.40. The diversified manufacturer reported earnings that beat analysts' estimates.
