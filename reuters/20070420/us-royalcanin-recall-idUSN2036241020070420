 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Royal Canin USA said on Friday it was voluntarily recalling all of its dry pet food products containing rice protein concentrate after it found a melamine derivative in some products. 

 Melamine is an industrial chemical used to make plastics and fertilizers. The announcement is the latest in a widening recall of dog and cat food products across the United States since mid-March. More than 100 brands of pet food have been recalled after reports of cases of pets developing kidney failure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received more than 14,000 reports of pet illnesses so far. Officials have confirmed just 16 deaths but believe the actual number could be higher. Royal Canin said it had not confirmed cases of illness in pets due to its products. "We are taking this proactive stance to avoid any confusion for our customers about which Royal Canin USA products are safe and which products may be affected," the company said in a statement. The company will also no longer use Chinese suppliers for any of its vegetable proteins, it said.
