 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) cut its 2007 forecast on Friday on plunging demand for hypertension drug Norvasc in the face of generic competition and warned of potentially lower sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor. 

 Although first-quarter results beat expectations, the world's largest drugmaker lowered its 2007 sales and earnings forecasts largely due to the U.S. arrival in March -- six months ahead of expectations -- of cheaper generic forms of Norvasc. Pfizer shares were flat in early trade. The stock has underperformed its peers in the past year, but the company's hefty dividend and valuation discount relative to its rivals are supporting the share price, analysts said on Friday. "There's basically a whole host of issues that appear to be plaguing the company in a difficult period," said Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez. Sales of Norvasc, still the company's second-biggest medicine, fell 10 percent to $1.1 billion in the quarter, but are expected to shrink more dramatically later this year as new copycats reach drugstores. Pfizer said it now expects company revenue in both 2007 and 2008 to be essentially flat with, or possibly a bit lower than, the $48.4 billion seen last year. It trimmed its 2007 earnings outlook to between $2.08 and $2.15 per share, which translates into growth of up to 4.3 percent. In January, it had projected growth of up to 9.2 percent. Pfizer also cautioned that sales of Lipitor, its biggest product, this year could have "modest growth to modest decline" as U.S. patients keep switching to cheaper generic forms of Merck & Co's ( MRK.N ) rival Zocor. But Lipitor first-quarter sales rose 8 percent to $3.36 billion, helped by a price increase in January, which A.G. Edwards analyst Joseph Tooley said was about $260 million above his expectations. Pfizer earned $3.39 billion, or 48 cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with $4.11 billion, or 56 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 68 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 57 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 6 percent to $12.47 billion, topping the Reuters Estimate of $11.77 billion, helped by surging sales of its drug Lyrica used to treat neuropathic pain. Tooley said total revenues in the quarter exceeded his estimate by about $650 million, enabling Pfizer to handily beat earnings forecasts. Lyrica sales more than doubled to $395 million, while sales of arthritis treatment Celebrex jumped 22 percent to $598 million as the company stepped up its marketing efforts behind the drug. Caduet, a new smoking-cessation drug, contributed $146 million in sales. But sales of anti-depressant Zoloft and antibiotic Zithromax fell 81 percent and 49 percent, respectively, crushed by generic competition, together shedding $761 million in sales. Although Pfizer expects no revenue growth through at least 2008, it aims to deliver some profit growth thanks to ongoing cost-cutting efforts, including an ongoing effort to cut 10,000 jobs by 2008. Pfizer was even at $27.07 in early trading.
