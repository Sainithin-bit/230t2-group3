 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) beat Wall Street forecasts on Friday with a 20 percent rise in net profit, helped by strong demand for automation systems used to run commercial buildings. It also raised its profit forecast for the year. 

 The diversified manufacturer, which is the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics, reported profit of $526 million, or 66 cents per share, compared with $436 million, or 52 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected profit of 62 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Its shares rose 2.9 percent in early electronic trading. Revenue came in at $8.04 billion, up 11 percent from $7.24 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected revenue of $7.71 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "It's a great quarter," said Peter Sorrentino, portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors in Cincinnati, which holds Honeywell shares. "It kind of flies in the face of the thesis that capital spending is missing from this part of the economic cycle ... If it adds to productivity, people are willing to spend on it." The company also raised its profit forecast for the year by 15 cents per share to a range of $3 to $3.10 per share, saying that sales would come in about $700 million above previous expectations, at about $33.5 billion. Analysts, on average, had expected full-year profit of $2.94 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "While we are maintaining a conservative view of global growth this year, we are increasing our full-year financial guidance to reflect strong first-quarter performance and continued confidence in our businesses for the remainder of 2007," said Chairman and Chief Executive David Cote, in a statement. Honeywell has been boosted of late by strong demand from the aerospace sector -- particularly strong investment by foreign airlines -- and demand from the commercial construction sector in the U.S. and abroad, which has not experienced the downturn seen in the U.S. housing market. Sales were up 18 percent at the Morris Township, New Jersey-based company's Automation and Control Systems unit, which makes temperature management systems for large buildings and other infrastructure products. It has been lifted over the past year by strong investment in new office buildings and airports in India, China and the Middle East. Honeywell aims to generate about half its revenue outside the United States this year. Honeywell shares rose $1.44 to $50.50 in early electronic trading, up from a $49.06 close on the New York Stock Exchange. As of Thursday's close, Honeywell shares are up about 8.3 percent so far this year, outpacing the 2.8 percent rise in the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , of which it is a member.
