 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks looked poised to edge up on Friday, helped by strong earnings on Thursday from Web search firm Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), but gains may be limited by uncertainty over the economic outlook. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average hit a record high on Thursday as robust earnings from major drug companies like Schering-Plough SGP.N and Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) offset some of the pessimism growing over the potential for declining Chinese demand for U.S. imports. U.S. stock futures suggested the major indexes could post a slight rise, underpinned in part by Google, which reported earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations and drove its share price up by over 3 percent after the closing bell. "We had quite a volatile period yesterday and Google came out with some decent numbers, so maybe there is some more positive sentiment in the tech space," said Simon Clinch, director of U.S. equities at F&C Asset Management. June Dow Jones futures DJM7 were up 0.1 percent, while S&P June futures SPM7 were up 0.1 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures NDM7 were up 0.2 percent. "We're going to be looking at companies like Capital One, they're a company that have had a bit of a miss and part of the miss is on the mortgage business," Clinch said, adding: "that just might put mortgage and subprime back on the on the map." Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ), the fourth-largest MasterCard and Visa card issuer, reported a 24 percent drop in first-quarter profit on Thursday and cited a surprise loss in a mortgage banking unit it bought in December. The deterioration in the U.S. housing sector, and particularly the sub-prime lending market, has brought into question the Federal Reserve's ability to keep key interest rates at 5.25 percent, as its policy-makers have indicated. Another casualty of the housing market meltdown was the largest U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton ( DHI.N ), which on Thursday reported an 85 percent fall in quarterly earnings, in part due to charges related to the lower value of land. Financial markets show investors widely expect the Fed will cut rates to 5.00 percent by the end of this year, as the economy gradually slows. Earnings are due later in the day from Schlumberger Ltd. ( SLB.N ), the world's largest oil-services company and Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ), the world's largest construction and mining equipment maker, both of which are often used as a gauge of broader economic growth. But any gloom has not been reflected so far this year in the banking sector. On Thursday, profits at Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N, the world's largest brokerage, beat expectations, while Bank of America ( BAC.N ) the second-largest U.S. bank, reported a 5 percent rise in first-quarter profit. Schering-Plough reported a 55 percent rise in first-quarter profit, well above expectations while Merck & Co. and Wyeth WYE.N also reported strong sales and profit figures.
