 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said on Friday that it has found no evidence that a fired systems technician secretly listened to its board or that the retailer conducted surveillance on shareholders who submitted proposals for its upcoming shareholders meeting. 

 The world's largest retailer said the findings came out of a review conducted by its legal department. It also said it was mailing an affidavit and certification of the review's findings to its shareholder proponents. A copy of the letter and the affidavit was provided to Reuters by Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart has faced mounting calls to disclose its surveillance records after it said in March that it fired security worker Bruce Gabbard for what the company said were unauthorized recordings of calls to and from a New York Times reporter and for intercepting text messages. In a Wall Street Journal report earlier this month, Gabbard claimed the he was part of a surveillance operation that included snooping on Wal-Mart's board and stockholders. Following the article's publication, Tom Hyde, Wal-Mart's top legal officer, sent a letter to shareholder proponents saying that while the article implied that the company had initiated an intrusive "threat assessment" of shareholders who submitted proposals for inclusion in Wal-Mart's annual proxy statement, that was not true. In the letter being mailed on Friday, Wal-Mart Chief Executive Lee Scott said he hoped the affidavit would allay the concerns of shareholders.
