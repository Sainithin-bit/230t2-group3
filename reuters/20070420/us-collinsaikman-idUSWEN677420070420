 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Wilbur Ross' auto parts company in North America has agreed to buy the soft trim business of bankrupt U.S. auto parts maker Collins & Aikman CKCRQ.PK for $134 million, the companies said on Friday. 

 The deal, which requires bankruptcy court approval and is subject to an auction, would permit senior secured prepetition lenders to Collins & Aikman to buy up to 25 percent of the outstanding stock in Ross' International Automotive Components Group North America, the companies said. The units to be sold include 16 facilities in the United States, Canada and Mexico that have about 4,300 workers and generate annual revenue of about $615 million.
