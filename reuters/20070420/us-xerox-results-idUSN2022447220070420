 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp. ( XRX.N ) said on Friday quarterly profit rose a better-than-expected 17 percent, helped by sales of printing supplies and color equipment, boosting its shares to their highest level in nearly seven years. 

 Shares in Xerox, the world's No. 1 supplier of office printers, copiers and related services, rose as much as 3.7 percent as investors signaled confidence that a strategy to grow the company's business was paying off. Xerox has bet on introducing color printers and thriving on lucrative long-term supplies and service deals. "They are benefiting from all the investments they made in color over the past several years," said analyst Shannon Cross of Cross Research, adding that it was "a very solid quarter." Sales and leases of printers led to demand for more profitable "post-sale" items like toner and maintenance contracts that draw revenue from customer for many years. Xerox net income rose to $233 million, or 24 cents a share, from $200 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding costs related to restructuring, profit was 26 cents a share, 5 cents better than analysts' average forecast as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 4 percent to $3.84 billion, fueled by strength in "post-sale" items and financing revenue, which represent more than 70 percent of total sales. Analysts were expecting revenue of $3.81 billion. Equipment sales declined 2 percent, Xerox said, but color equipment sales, which represented nearly half of total sales in the quarter, climbed 9 percent. EQUIPMENT INSTALLATIONS STRONG Over the past few years, Xerox -- whose rivals range from Canon Inc. ( 7751.T ) of Japan to Heidelberg ( HDDG.DE ) of Germany -- has grabbed market share with new digital office printers and large-scale presses. But its equipment revenue growth has lagged amid strong competition and pricing pressure on color laser printer sales to some distributors. Xerox Chief Financial Officer Larry Zimmerman said total equipment revenue fell in part because the company sold more lower-priced models. But strength in installations of customer equipment was a better indicator of performance, he said. "For the most part, the number of units installed were very positive," he told Reuters in an interview. "Machines in the field are up and (printed) pages are up." Gross margins were 40.6 percent in the first quarter, up slightly from 40.2 percent a year earlier. The Stamford, Connecticut-based company has in recent years delivered steady profits despite a struggle to spur revenue growth. Xerox said it expects second-quarter earnings of 26 cents to 28 cents per share. Analysts were expecting 27 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. For the full-year, Xerox said it sees earnings per share of $1.12 to $1.16. Xerox shares were up 43 cents at $18.51 on the New York Stock Exchange after jumping as high as $18.74 at the opening. The shares have gained more than 9 percent this year.
