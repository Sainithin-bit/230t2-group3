 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market ( NDAQ.O ) Chief Executive Robert Greifeld received an $18.4 million compensation package for 2006, a year that the largest U.S. electronic stock market's profit more than doubled but its shares fell. 

 The compensation included a $966,077 salary, $13.56 million of stock and option awards, $3.8 million of non-equity incentive awards and $38,313 of other compensation, according to Nasdaq's proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Greifeld, 49, also had a $3.68 million gain from the vesting of 100,000 shares. Compensation is based on salary, bonus, the value of stock options and other awards granted during the year as well as incentives and perks. Nasdaq's profit in 2006 rose to $127.9 million, or $0.95 per share, from $61.7 million, or $0.57 per share, in 2005. Its shares fell 12 percent in 2006. Greifeld and the company also reached a new employment agreement as of January 1 and extending through December 31, 2010, according to the filing. The agreement allows for a stock option grant of 960,000 shares vesting over a six-year period and the granting of additional shares in each year of the contract based on performance. The proxy cites the importance of Greifeld's leadership to building shareholder value as a reason for the new agreement. On Thursday Nasdaq reported first-quarter net income of $18.3 million, or 14 cents a share, compared with $18 million, or 16 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a charge related to its failed bid for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) and other one-time items, Nasdaq's earnings rose to $41.8 million from $26.2 million in the year-earlier period. LSE stockholders rejected Nasdaq's hostile, 2.7 billion pound ($5.36 billion) bid earlier this year. Nasdaq shares closed up 94 cents, or 3.0 percent, at $32.14 on Friday.
