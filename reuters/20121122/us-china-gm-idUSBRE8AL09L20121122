 GUANGZHOU  (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) rolled out its first China-developed electric car at the Guangzhou autoshow on Thursday as it ramps up its green car push in the world's largest auto market. 
 The Sail Springo EV, with a starting price tag of 258,000 yuan ($41,400), will be initially available only at GM's dealer outlets in Shanghai, the U.S. automaker said in a statement. The car, developed and built by GM and its partner SAIC Motor Corp Ltd ( 600104.SS ), has a range of 130-200 kilometres and a top speed of 130 kilometres per hour. Encouraged by Beijing's initiative to put 5 million electric and plug-in hybrids on the road by 2020, many domestic and foreign automakers are gearing up to tap the potential of green cars. SAIC launched its Roewe E50 electric car with a price tag of 234,900 yuan around two weeks ago. Warren Buffett-back BYD Co Ltd ( 1211.HK ) ( 002594.SZ ) had also rolled out a financing package recently that allows fleet operators to buy its pricy electric car e6 in instalments. Earlier in the year, GM launched its Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid in China.
