 BERLIN  (Reuters) - European Union leaders are likely to discuss Greece's debt crisis on the sidelines of a summit on the 27-member bloc's budget in Brussels which starts on Thursday, a senior German official said. 
 "Greece is not on the agenda of the summit, but I expect it could be a topic in conversations between the leaders," the official told reporters. (Reporting by  Noah Barkin )
