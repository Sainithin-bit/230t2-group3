 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics, the world's top maker of memory chips and LCD screens, reported on Friday record quarterly net profit on a resurgent memory sector and brisk sales of flat screens and mobile phones. 

 Samsung's July-September net profit rose to 3.72 trillion won ($3.14 billion) from 1.22 trillion won a year ago, beating an average forecast for 3.34 trillion won from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ***************************************************************** Following are some reactions from fund managers and analysts: PARK HYUN, ANALYST, PRUDENTIAL INVESTMENT & SECURITIES "Samsung is already entering a down cycle. Its memory chip unit will probably continue to do well in the fourth quarter, but LCD and handset units will see their earnings momentum growing weak." "Momentum will probably weaken through the first quarter of next year, and how things go from then on will have to be seen. "The won's strength is one of the key risk factors." LEE MIN-HEE, ANALYST, DONGBU SECURITIES "Samsung's profit has likely peaked in the third quarter and will start to ease from the fourth quarter, with falling LCD prices and demand leading the way. "I expect Samsung to boost investment from early next year and this increased spending, if revenue doesn't pick up over the near term, could drag on profits for the time being. "The key thing to watch for is whether the pickup in global demand can be sustained even after the effect from stimulus spending disappears. "The foreign exchange rate is also a big factor and the company's profit will be affected if the won goes above 1,100 (per dollar) soon." LEE KA-KEUN, ANALYST, IBK SECURITIES "A firmer won is a major risk to Samsung in the fourth quarter and 2010. If the won stays between 1,150 per dollar and 1,190, Samsung shouldn't face big problems. But if it strengthens past 1,150, that would be a serious issue." "The global economy is another concern. If it faces a double-dip, that will put additional pressure on Samsung." "Samsung is seen benefiting from a healthy global chip market despite a possible supply glut. The industry has already experienced an reshuffle. Some are worried about seasonal weakness in the first quarter, but I don't think Samsung will face any problem with that." "Samsung is expected to be in a difficult situation in the first half of the next year due to oversupply issues and capacity expansion by competitors, but in the second half seasonally strong demand will help. That, along with its firm chip business, will lead the company to post strong results." "In the handset business, price competition will not be an issue for Samsung. The smartphone business will be more important to the company, and Samsung should be successful in the segment."
