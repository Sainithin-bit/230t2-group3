 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration will be laying out "relatively soon" the executive pay restrictions for firms receiving federal bailout funds, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday. 

 Geithner also said he does not see a need for further legislation on compensation beyond the administration's say-on-pay proposal and the proposal for independent compensation committees. "We do not believe it's appropriate for the government to set caps on compensation," Geithner said after a meeting with other government officials and shareholder activists, adding that prescriptive rules on pay could be "counterproductive." Mary Schapiro, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said her agency's proposals on pay are "very much in flux still" but would not dictate particular compensation levels. Instead, they will be geared toward disclosures about incentive structures related to risk-taking, conflicts of interest with compensation consultants, and greater disclosures about director nominees.
