 YPSILANTI, Michigan  (Reuters) - The upheaval in the once-mighty U.S. auto industry has left many natives of Michigan asking themselves the same basic question: Should I move on to find work, or stay and hope things get better? 

 "The way I see it, I don't have any choice but to leave," said former auto worker Mike Fleury. Fleury, 51, has been one of the lucky few. He retired in April from his job at General Motors Corp's Willow Run engine transmission plant in this town 30 miles west of Detroit and is due to move to Texas where has found a new job. When GM filed for bankruptcy on June 1, Willow Run was among the 11 U.S. plants the company slated to close. "This is my home, I grew up here and my family's here," said Fleury, who plans to move his family of four within weeks. "But there's no work for me here, so I'm moving on while I'm still young enough to start again." Long the backbone of Michigan's economy, the auto industry has been battered by its bet on expensive gas-thirsty pickup trucks and sports-utility vehicles. Oil price spikes, the credit crunch and recession have pushed sales to 30-year lows. The perfect storm of bad news has forced bankruptcy and thousands of job cuts at GM and Chrysler LLC. But Ford Motor Co is making cuts too. Dozens of parts suppliers for the once fabled "Big Three" are also based in Michigan. "People here know Michigan is not going to turn around," said John Revitte, a labor studies professor at Michigan State University. "Those jobs aren't coming back." Since 2000, U.S. automakers and suppliers have shed 395,000 U.S. jobs, the largest share of them in Michigan. When Michigan bleeds jobs, it also bleeds people. Some experts say the latest exodus of people looking for jobs out of state is muted because the whole nation is in recession. "As the rest of the economy picks up, more people will leave in search of work," said demographer William Frey. 'NOBODY'S PAYING HERE' Michigan was hurting even before the housing crisis hit the rest of the U.S. economy. The state unemployment rate was the highest in the nation in April at 12.9 percent, compared with 8.9 percent nationwide. Almost one in four people in Detroit -- where GM has long been the largest employer -- are out of work. Standing in Ryan Jones' garden in the Detroit suburb of Madison Heights, visitors get a sense of what is going on. His next-door neighbor has gone into foreclosure. The house behind his was deserted 18 months ago. But the lights are on. "A homeless guy broke in and lives there now," said Jones, 27, who moved his wife and two small sons to Chicago in 2007 when the construction firm he worked for transferred his job there. "I didn't want to go," he said. "But the alternative was going into foreclosure here without a job." The Jones family returned last September. "I just wanted to come home," he said. He landed a job in theft prevention at a retailer, earning about $10 per hour -- about half what he earned in Chicago. But now Jones wants to move to Nashville, where he hopes to join the police and has family who can look after his sons. "Nobody's paying here," he said. "As far as I'm concerned, if the money's right, I'll go." CYCLE OF NO RETURN? Michigan is no stranger to what demographers call "out-migration." Recession drove people away in the early 1980s. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the peak exodus year was July 1981 to July 1982 when 158,000 people left. Some returned in the 1990s as automakers' fortunes improved. But despite efforts to diversify the state's economy -- promoting tourism or trying to lure high-tech firms -- people are leaving again. From July 2006 to July 2008, Michigan lost more than 200,000 residents. The population of Wayne County, where Detroit is located, has fallen 10 percent since 2000, while other U.S. cities have remained largely stable. "The magnitude of these losses when most urban areas are holding their own underscores the depth of Michigan's problems," said Kenneth Johnson, a demographer at the University of New Hampshire. "Many people leave home very reluctantly and only if there's nothing left there for them." MSU's Revitte said students talk more often of moving to Chicago or New York and he said the state's "brain drain" includes skilled middle-aged workers who are also moving. "We're losing our best and brightest," said James Fouts, mayor of Warren, a Detroit suburb. "We have to provide people with a reason to stay." (Editing by  Peter Bohan  and  Matthew Lewis )
