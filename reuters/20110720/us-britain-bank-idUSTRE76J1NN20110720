 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to leave interest rates at their record low 0.5 percent this month, and judged that recent economic weakness had reduced the chance that rates would need to rise in the near term, minutes to the BoE's July meeting showed on Wednesday. 

 BoE chief economist Spencer Dale and external member Martin Weale voted again to raise rates, while at the other end of the spectrum Adam Posen repeated his call for more quantitative easing. Following are economists' reactions to the minutes. PETER DIXON, ECONOMIST, COMMERZBANK: "The voting patterns are as expected. There does appear to be a sense, just from looking at the headlines, that there's less of a need for a rate increase. And I think under these circumstances, particularly given that the Q2 GDP number is expected to look pretty soft, the case for a rate hike continues to weaken, and there's every prospect now that we're not going to see any action until next year. "On the QE question, the majority of the committee shares my view that extending QE is not necessarily the appropriate policy at this stage of the cycle. It's a policy designed to cope with emergency situations, such as we had two years ago. "All we can do now is wait until we see signs the economy has started picking up or if the markets start to tank again and the economy goes down with them." ROSS WALKER, RBS FINANCIAL MARKETS "I thought they were little-changed on the month. There had been some chatter about a more dovish set of minutes, the hawks backing down and even more discussion around QE. But I don't sense any real shift. "I think when you are one month away from an Inflation Report there is often a certain sort of in-built bias, a tendency to wait. "That's particularly the case when the outlook is uncertain and when the risks in both directions are substantial. "The overall conclusion is that unless something dramatic happens, then a shift in policy in either direction seems unlikely this year." ALAN CLARKE, SCOTIA CAPITAL "The new information over the month was probably not sufficient to persuade some of those voting for a hike to move back into the majority. I think that will come and if we get a weak GDP reading next week, and downward revisions to growth in the BoE Inflation Report, then we may well lose the hawks at the August meeting. "I think they're babystepping in a dovish direction. I don't think they're considering it (more QE) at all at the moment. With inflation seen going over 5 percent, with not at risk of deflation. But speculation about it will continue to build, particularly if growth disappoints." (Reporting by Fiona Shaikh)
