 PARIS/BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France's President Nicolas Sarkozy reached a joint position late on Wednesday over a new bailout plan for Greece that will include participation of the banking sector, the French delegation said. 

 The joint position, details of which were not revealed, will be submitted to European Council President Herman Van Rompuy overnight, just hours before EU leaders meet at a summit in Brussels in an effort to find a resolution to the Greek debt crisis. Merkel and Sarkozy will meet Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou early on Thursday, ahead of the summit opening, before going on to meet with European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Van Rompuy.
