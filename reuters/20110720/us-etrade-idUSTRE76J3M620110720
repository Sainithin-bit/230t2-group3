 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Four years after injecting $2.5 billion into E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ), its biggest investor is pressing the mortgage-plagued online brokerage to put itself up for sale. 

 Citadel LLC, a powerful hedge fund with a 9.8 percent stake in E*Trade, called on Wednesday for a special shareholder meeting to consider hiring an investment bank that will explore strategic options for the online broker and bank company. News of the push from Citadel founder Kenneth Griffin sent E*Trade shares surging 14 percent to $14.72 on Wednesday, raising the company's market value to about $4.2 billion. "Since November of 2007, the board has continually failed to act in the best interest of E*Trade shareholders," Citadel' Chief Legal Officer Adam Cooper wrote in a letter to E*Trade Chief Executive Steven Freiberg. "Having endured nearly four years of value destruction and lost opportunity, we believe it is time for a change." A sale of E*Trade could be achieved "promptly," the letter said. Chicago-based Citadel also asked E*Trade to replace two long-time directors, Michael Parks and Donna Weaver, with independent directors. "We were surprised and disappointed by the letter we received this morning," Freiberg said in a conference call with analysts after the company reported a 34 percent rise in net income on Wednesday afternoon to $47.1 million. "We will be carefully considering the letter received this morning and at this time have no further comment." E*Trade's second-quarter earnings of 16 cents a share, up from 12 cents a year earlier, were fueled by a decline in the loan-loss provision to cover bad mortgages at the company's bank unit. E*Trade entered banking in an effort to diversify its revenue away from pure retail brokerage, but has struggled with credit problems for many years. TAKEOVER TARGET E*Trade has been subject of takeover speculation for years, with brokerage rivals such as TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ( AMTD.O ) and Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ) often mentioned as acquirers. TD Ameritrade's largest shareholder is Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank ( TD.TO ). E*Trade's attractions include 2.8 million brokerage accounts and a healthy deposit-gathering business. TD Ameritrade or Schwab could offer as much as $21 a share for the company, a 43 percent premium to E*Trade's close on Wednesday, and still realize immediate profits from the acquisition, several analysts said. Other possible buyers for E*Trade include Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ), a credit card and retail bank that recently bought ING Direct, BMO Capital Markets analyst David Chiaverini said in a note to clients. TD Ameritrade CEO Fred Tomczyk said on Tuesday his company has not recently been in negotiations. "We just haven't come across anything that makes strategic and financial sense in recent times," he told Reuters. A TD Ameritrade spokeswoman declined to comment. Schwab may be less likely to pursue a deal because it is in the process of buying OptionsXpress Holding Inc OXPS.O. BMO's Chiaverini wrote in a report on Wednesday after disclosure of Citadel's letter that E*Trade is now under pressure to "at least explore the possibility of a sale in an attempt to appease shareholders and gauge the level of interest among potential suitors." One roadblock to a sale, analysts said, is $14 billion of subpar mortgages on E*Trade's books that a buyer would have to mark down to current values. For Citadel, an E*trade sale would close the books on a rocky four-year relationship. The aggressive hedge fund was lead investor on a $2.5 billion infusion of cash into the brokerage in 2007, engineered a 2009 share sale and debt swap designed to shore up capital and eliminate $1.7 billion of E*Trade debt during its ownership. E*Trade, however, has lost more than $2.1 billion from continuing operations over the last three years and its shares have plunged more than 90 percent since June 2007. At that time, they were changing hands at a split-adjusted $257.90 a share. E*Trade completed a 1-for-10 reverse stock split last year. Citadel has been steadily decreasing its investment, slashing its stake to 9.8 percent now from 27 percent last December. A lock-up agreement that expires on Friday frees it to sell more shares.
