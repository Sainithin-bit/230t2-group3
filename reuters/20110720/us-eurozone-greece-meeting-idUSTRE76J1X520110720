 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - A meeting of euro zone financial officials to prepare options for a second bailout for Greece has been delayed until Thursday morning from Wednesday evening, euro zone sources said. 

 The delay, designed to give more time for a deal to be reached on the involvement of the private sector, means that a summit of euro zone leaders will now start at 1 p.m. (1100 GMT), an hour later than initially planned, the sources said.
