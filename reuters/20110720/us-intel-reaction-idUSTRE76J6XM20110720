 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Intel Corp, the top chipmaker, posted better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, overcoming worries about slow personal computer sales and the rocky economy. 

 Shares of Intel rose about 1.65 percent following a quarterly report that showed both profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street estimates. Commentary: ARNAB CHANDA, ANALYST, ROTH CAPITAL PARTNERS "I think they performed very well. People were very cautious on Intel and worried about them being hurt by PC sales but they had great numbers and a great outlook." "A lot of it was their data server center business which was up almost 20 percent year-over-year, that's also a big factor." "To be honest, the entire market had decided we're in a post-PC era and that Intel's not going to make that transition. But it's clear that if a company of this size is beating estimates by this much then obviously the PC era is alive and well." BOBBY BURLESON, ANALYST, CANACCORD GENUITY "The expectations were that Sandy Bridge (Intel's new chip) has been doing really well for them, that they could beat the number (consensus profit estimate) and then they'd guide somewhere above consensus, because right now consensus was baking in sub-seasonal demand." "Intel still thinks that there's 15 percent PC growth this year (well above independent estimates). There's still kind of a disconnect, at this time of year they are still counting on normal trends to get them there for the year." "There's a disagreement out there as to whether PC growth is really going to exhibit normal seasonal trends in the second half." "The stock should move up (after results), but it's going to be hard to get the stock moving from these levels because of all the uncertainties around PCs, and there's really no way for them to sidestep that." "They can perform nicely in terms of financials and gain share but it's in a market where people are questioning the secular growth." ALEX GAUNA, ANALYST, JMP SECURITIES "These are real strong numbers to me. The wall of worry that the market had been building about Intel was misplaced." "Their growth in earnings verifies everything Intel's been saying about their strategy and the importance of the cloud computing upgrade cycle." "I think part of what investors had been worried about was that there may be lackluster PC sales. Intel's point is that there's been strength in enterprise and there's been strength in emerging markets -- and their results certainly speak to that. PATRICK WANG, ANALYST, EVERCORE PARTNERS "The Q2 report and Q3 guidance were well above expectations. In a quarter where nobody thought they could do it again, they delivered another beat and raise." "The primary question investors are going to ask now is where Intel is seeing the fundamental strength in the PC market." "Take a look at the headlines over the past couple of months, in terms of the global economic malaise. It's hard to have any confidence in how they are going to deliver 7 percent growth sequentially." (Reporting by  Bill Rigby  in Seattle,  Yinka Adegoke  in New York; Compiled by Paul Thomasch)
