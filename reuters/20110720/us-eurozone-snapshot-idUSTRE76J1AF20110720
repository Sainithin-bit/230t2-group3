 LONDON, Jul  (Reuters) - Merkel yesterday appeared to pour cold water on hopes for a sweeping deal on Thursday though there are suggestions she was merely indicating that the overall crisis would not be solved in a day, not that a second Greek bailout was beyond the euro zone leaders. 

 In true pre-summit fashion, she meets Sarkozy in Berlin later to attempt to find a way through. They've done it in the past though their solutions have sometimes unraveled and frequently attract the ire of their euro zone peers. Behind the scenes, officials will meet, and maybe go through the night, to work on the options. Reuters exclusively broke the three choices on the table and we can surmise that the late breaking entrant -- a bank tax to raise 30 billion euros over three years -- could be the favorite given the policy paper noted that, in conjunction with cheaper and longer maturity official loans for Greece, it was the least likely scheme to incur some form of default courtesy of the ratings agencies. The banks are already crying foul about that, presumably on the grounds that they may get whacked for similar if Portugal, Ireland and others require more help. That raises the alternative possibility that the tax is being floated as a stick for the banks to encourage them to go for a bond swap or bond buyback regime. Time is very short and it may well be that no single scheme is agreed upon. Banking sources tell us that the summit may offer a range of options for private bondholders to contribute, which sounds like a recipe for chaos. Some in the markets are already talking of a stark choice - it will either be Super Thursday or Black Friday. "The risk is for massive disappointment tomorrow," one bond trader tells us. If minds needed concentrating, the IMF has waded in saying the crisis could have a major global impact if not solved rapidly. It wants the EFSF rescue fund increased in size and bank recapitalization to shore things up. Obama also talked to Merkel yesterday, an indication of international alarm, although he has his own debt problems to deal with! The ECB remains a key factor. We thought Nowotny had broken ranks with Trichet's refusal to accept any form of default. Not for the first time, a later statement was issued saying he was fully in agreement with his boss. Did he misspeak, or was he firmly sat upon? You decide. Either way it suggests Trichet's hand remains firmly on the ECB tiller even as his term draws to a close. Last week's bank stress tests showed the risk overwhelmingly loaded on Greek banks, and their Cypriot neighbors. Just out, we have Cypriot central bank chief Orphanides saying his country could need a bailout after a destructive blast at a munitions center last week, which he said has put the economy into a state of emergency. A Portuguese T-bill auction will test the contagion waters after Spanish yields leapt at a tender yesterday. (Writing by Mike Peacock; editing by  Janet McBride )
