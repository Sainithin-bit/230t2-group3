 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The Financial Stability Board (FSB) will develop policy recommendations for the world's shadow banking sector by the end of 2012, according to a senior Bank of Canada official who also chairs a key FSB committee. 
 Tiff Macklem, senior deputy governor at the Bank of Canada, said the FSB's recommendations will cover five areas: * the interactions of regulated banks with shadow banking entities and activities * money market mutual funds * other shadow-banking entities * securitization * securities lending and repos. The FSB is a global body of central bankers, regulators and finance officials tasked with implementing the G20's financial reform agenda. Macklem's speech contained no reference to Canadian monetary policy. (Reporting By  Jennifer Kwan ; Writing by  Louise Egan ; Editing by  Jeffrey Hodgson )
