 ZURICH  (Reuters) - UBS said investment banking head Carsten Kengeter will voluntarily forgo a bonus for 2011, after a trader in his unit allegedly racked up $2 billion in losses. 
 The Swiss bank's Chief Executive Sergio Ermotti said Kengeter approached him after the trades and said he would not accept a bonus, regardless of what the board decided. UBS is accepting his decision. (Reporting By Katharina Bart)
