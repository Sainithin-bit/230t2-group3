 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Canadian dollar hit a nine-month low against the U.S. currency on Wednesday, pressured by falling oil prices and expectations that the Bank of Canada will cut interest rates later this year. 

 Markets have been focused on yield differentials and, at 4.25 percent, Canadian rates are a full 100 basis points below U.S. ones. "There are growing expectations that interest rates in Canada are probably turning lower," said Tom Levinson, currency strategist at ING. By 0940 GMT, the U.S. dollar was 0.3 percent higher on the day at C$1.1678  CAD= , hitting levels last seen in early April 2006. It last hit a nine-month high on December 29.
