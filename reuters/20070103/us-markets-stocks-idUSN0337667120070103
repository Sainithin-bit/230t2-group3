 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dow and the Nasdaq ended the first 2007 trading session modestly higher, while the S&P 500 dipped as a sharp sell-off in energy shares and worries about economic growth eclipsed Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s ( WMT.N ) upbeat sales forecast and a jump in Home Depot Inc.'s ( HD.N ) stock after its chief executive officer quit. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 11.05 points, or 0.09 percent, to post an unofficial finish of 12,474.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 7.87 points, or 0.33 percent, to unofficially end at 2,423.16. But the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 1.60 points, or 0.11 percent, for an unofficial close at 1,416.70.
