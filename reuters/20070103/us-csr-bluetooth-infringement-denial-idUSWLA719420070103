 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Bluetooth chip specialist CSR has slammed claims by a U.S. research institute that its Bluetooth chips violate technology patents developed by the University of Washington. 

 "CSR has taken advice from its attorneys. The suit is without merit in relation to CSR's Bluetooth chips and CSR will defend its products vigorously," the Cambridge-based firm said in a statement. The Washington Research Foundation, which markets technology from the university, has sued Nokia, Samsung Electronics and Matsushita-owned Panasonic for using CSR's Bluetooth chips which it says use technology that infringes the University's radio frequency receiver patents.
