 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home Depot Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Nardelli has abruptly left the company after a year of heavy criticism of everything from his pay package to the underperforming retailer's corporate governance. 

 Nardelli, 58, will walk away with a severance package of about $210 million. He and the company said in a release that his leaving was a "mutual decision," and Home Depot shares rose more than 2 percent. Succeeding Nardelli is Frank Blake, the 57-year-old vice chairman who joined Home Depot in 2002. The moves of Nardelli and Blake, who are both former executives of General Electric Co., took effect on Tuesday, according to the company. Wall Street largely cheered the leadership change. Many analysts said that although Nardelli improved operations at the world's largest home improvement retailer, recent unfavorable publicity dented confidence in Home Depot as it faces a slowing housing market and competition from rival Lowe's Cos. "I just think it's a sign that just from a morale standpoint and a confidence standpoint ... from investors, from employees, from the market, they needed to make a change," said Jon Fisher, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, which owns Home Depot shares. CHANGE AND OPPORTUNITY Home Depot co-founder Arthur Blank, who now owns the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons team, said in a statement that "with change comes opportunity, and I'm hopeful the company will continue to grow and thrive" under new leadership. Many analysts said Blake, who worked at the U.S. Energy Department before joining Home Depot, was a better consensus builder, but they said his lack of retail experience was a drawback as store sales weaken. Blake "has never run a company or one of Home Depot's major operating businesses," Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said in a research note. In November, Home Depot reported a 3 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, its first quarterly report of profit decline since the fourth quarter of 2002. It also sharply pared its forecast of earnings growth for the year as sales at stores open at least a year fell 5.1 percent. Home Depot also named Joe DeAngelo, head of its growing supply division geared to contractors, to the new post of chief operating officer and gave added duties to finance chief Carol Tome. In its statement, Home Depot said the board expressed confidence in the company's current business model, long-term strategy and future growth potential. But "potential disruption at Home Depot could provide Lowe's with a unique opportunity to gain market share," Citigroup said in a research note. PILE ON Nardelli, one of the three executives in the running to succeed GE chief Jack Welch years ago, came to Home Depot in late 2000 with much fanfare, but drew mixed reviews from some on Wall Street who expressed concern over his lack of retailing experience. After negative headlines over Nardelli's pay, the board's no-show at the 2006 annual meeting in May, a federal probe into company stock-option grant practices and weakening sales and earnings, activist Home Depot investors became more emboldened, and takeover rumors sprouted. "You always had the feeling you were very unwelcome" at annual meetings under Nardelli's tenure, said corporate gadfly Evelyn Y. Davis, who owns stock in Home Depot and many other companies. "Maybe the best solution would be a merger or acquisition," she told Reuters. Ralph Whitworth, founder and principal at San Diego-based Relational Investors, said in December that he was accumulating Home Depot stock and planned to nominate at least two directors for election at the retailer's 2007 annual meeting. "They need some fresh blood on this board," Whitworth said in an interview on Wednesday on the CNBC network. "We are going to push on." Relational previously led a proxy battle at Sovereign Bancorp Inc. and eventually took a seat on that company's board. Longtime shareholder Laborers' International Union of North America called on Home Depot to require investor approval of "extraordinary" benefits for officers, calling Nardelli's $210 million severance package "obscene." Last month, Home Depot said it found almost 20 years of options backdating, resulting in $200 million in unrecorded expenses. The retailer's independent review of the options practices concluded that there was no intentional wrongdoing by any current member of the management team or board. Home Depot shares, which were up 93 cents, or 2.3 percent, at $41.09 in afternoon trading, have risen about 4 percent since early June and have rallied recently on speculation the company could be a target for a private equity buyout. Home Depot said Nardelli and Blake were not available to comment.
