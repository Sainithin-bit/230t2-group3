 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd ( 7267.T ) on Wednesday said U.S. vehicle sales rose 3 percent in December, boosted by demand for some of its new models. 

 The Japanese automaker said it sold 131,778 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 132,800 vehicles a year earlier. The percentage is based on a daily selling rate and has been adjusted for the extra selling day in December of 2005.
