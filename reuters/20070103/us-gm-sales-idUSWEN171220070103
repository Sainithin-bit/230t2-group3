 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Wednesday said its U.S. December sales fell 9.6 percent from a year earlier, driven by a decline in truck sales. 

 The world's largest automaker sold 341,327 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 392,041 vehicles a year earlier.
