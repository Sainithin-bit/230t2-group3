 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian energy retailer AGL Energy 
Ltd. ( AGK.AX ) said on Thursday it has made a preliminary merger 
approach to Origin Energy Ltd. ( ORG.AX ). 

  AGL said in a statement that the merger approach was based 
on a "nil premium scrip" basis, which means neither party would 
pay a share price premium to gain control of the combined 
company.  Shares in Origin, which have risen 10.5 percent in the past 
month, closed at A$8.57 on Wednesday, while AGL's shares closed 
29 Australian cents lower at A$15.84.  ($1=1.26 Australian Dollar)
