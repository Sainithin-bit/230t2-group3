 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. on Wednesday said U.S. December sales rose 16.6 percent, driven by strong demand for its Corolla and Camry sedans, as it continued to steal market share from Detroit's Big Three. 

 The world's No. 2 automaker said it sold 228,322 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 203,279 vehicles a year earlier.
