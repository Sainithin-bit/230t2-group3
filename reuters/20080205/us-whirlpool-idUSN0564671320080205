 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ), the world's biggest appliance maker, reported higher-than expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday as international sales and savings from the Maytag acquisition offset a drop in U.S. demand, and its shares shot up as much as 14 percent. 

 The maker of KitchenAid, Maytag and Amana appliances forecast 2008 earnings in line with analysts' estimates, saying it expected weak demand in the United States and Europe, and stronger sales in emerging markets such as Latin America, India and China. Quarterly profit rose 72 percent to $187 million, or $2.38 a share, from $109 million, or $1.37 a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $2.15 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Good numbers all around," said Morgan Keegan analyst Laura Champine. The unexpectedly strong results in the face of the worst decline in industry demand in two decades showed Whirlpool was gaining market share and benefiting from new products, she added. Sales rose 7.5 percent to $5.3 billion, above the $5.2 billion analysts expected. Revenue increased 12 percent in Europe, 30 percent in Latin America and 26 percent in Asia. Whirlpool said its branded products, especially Maytag, gained market share in the latest quarter. In North America, Whirlpool's biggest market, sales declined less than 1 percent to $3 billion, outperforming the industry, as U.S. shipments of appliance units fell about 6 percent in wake of the housing slump. But operating profit in the region increased 41 percent as cost cuts from the 2006 purchase of Maytag and sales of higher-margin products helped offset steel and oil costs and the lower demand. This year, Whirlpool expects industry appliance shipments to fall 3 percent to 5 percent in the United States. Whirlpool, based in Benton Harbor, Michigan, said it would boost spending on new products and advertising this year. It also said it was raising prices worldwide to cover rising metal and oil expenses, and vowed to align operating costs with lower expected demand levels in the U.S. and Europe. The company said last week it would close two refrigerator plants and migrate their production to other locations. Whirlpool has cut more than 5,000 jobs as it consolidated facilities since buying Maytag in March 2006, which operated higher-cost plants. "I wouldn't be surprised to see more of these smaller facilities, particularly the ones operated by Maytag, shutting down," Morgan Keegan's Champine said. Whirlpool forecast 2008 profit of $8.50 to $9 a share from continuing operations. Analysts currently expect $8.94, according to Reuters Estimates. Sweden's Electrolux ( ELUXb.ST ), the second-largest appliance maker, is due to report results on Wednesday. Shares of Whirlpool gained $10.85, or 13.3 percent, to $92.44 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has rebounded about 37 percent from a 2 1/2 year low of $67.19 reached in mid-January but is down 22 percent from an all-time high of $118 set in June. (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
