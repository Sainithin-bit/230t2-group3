 (Corrects operating income rise to 24 percent, not 23 percent) 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N posted a moderate rise in fiscal second-quarter profit on higher advertising sales at its Fox News channel and the Fox television network, offsetting a decline in its movie studio business. The New York-based media conglomerate, which closed a $5.6 billion deal to buy Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co Inc in December, said quarterly profit increased to $832 million, or 27 cents per share, from $822 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Operating income jumped 24 percent to $1.4 billion, boosted by double-digit percentage gains in nearly all of its operating businesses. The company said it reported a record operating profit in the quarter. Revenue rose 9.5 percent to $8.6 billion. (Reporting by  Kenneth Li ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
