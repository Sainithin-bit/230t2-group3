 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday denied the Chinese government would mount a legal challenge against BHP Billiton's ( BLT.L ) proposal to take over rival Australian miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ). 

 Britain's Observer newspaper on Sunday said Beijing would use its new anti-monopoly law to oppose a hostile bid by BHP ( BHP.AX ) to take over Rio ( RIO.AX ) in a three-for-one share offer. "I've not heard of this," spokesman Liu Jianchao told reporters on Tuesday when asked if China would lodge a lawsuit to stop the merger of its two largest iron ore suppliers. "This deal is totally between the companies," he said, referring to Friday's surprise announcement that national champion Aluminum Corp of China had teamed up with Alcoa ( AA.N ) to buy a 12 percent stake in Rio. BHP has until February 6 to make a formal bid, or walk away for six months. (Reporting by  Ben Blanchard ; Writing by  Lucy Hornby ; Editing by  Michael Urquhart )
