 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said in its regular post data conference call on Tuesday it had no immediate further comment on the early release of its non-manufacturing survey for January. 

 ISM said earlier it released its services index ahead of schedule because of concerns that the data may inadvertently have been released early. The index data was released at 8:55 a.m. ET. It was originally scheduled for a 10:00 a.m. ET release. (Reporting by  Ellen Freilich , writing by John Parry; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
