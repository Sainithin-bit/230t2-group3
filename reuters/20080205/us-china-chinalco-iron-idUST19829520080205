 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's eleventh-hour gatecrash of what could be the world's biggest mining deal has cast its state aluminum giant in the role of white knight to China's steel sector, which feared seeing its two main suppliers unite. 

 But the country's steel mills, a fragmented group that lacks the financial muscle, industry expertise and right connections to go hunting for lumpy iron ore assets abroad, may yet come to see a darker side. For now, the metals industry is celebrating state-owned aluminum Corp of China's (Chinalco) deal to buy 12 percent of Rio Tinto's ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ) London shares together with Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) for $14 billion, potentially thwarting BHP Billiton Ltd ( BHP.AX )BHP.L's bid to create a mining supergiant. But as much as serving Beijing's desire to prevent one company from controlling over a quarter of the world's iron ore, the deal fits Chinalco President Xiao Yaqing's ambitions to turn his aluminum-focused company into a diversified global giant. Whether that opens up a conflict of interest with Chinese steel mills that depend heavily on imported raw materials is yet to be seen. But history has shown that Xiao, 49, can be ruthless in achieving his expansionary goals. After Xiao took over Chinalco in 2004, he kept prices of the company's imported alumina supplies high in a bid to get small domestic aluminum smelters to sell out -- helping him build an empire that now controls about a third of the country's total aluminum output and more than a half its alumina output. That precedent may be a warning sign to the likes of Baosteel and Minmetals Corp, other state-owned giants which have proven less fleet of foot in providing China with resource security. "Chinalco is starting to be a consolidator of the Chinese non-ferrous industry ... (And) the steel industry has got to consolidate," said Michael Komesaroff, managing director of Urandaline in Australia. "Ironically, one of the ways it could (be forced to) consolidate is a significant increase in iron ore prices," said the consultant specializing in China's capital-intensive industries. HUNDREDS OF MILLS China produces more than a third of the world's steel, but Beijing lacks a forceful national champion amid the 500 mills that compete fiercely over raw materials and market share. Despite a drive by Beijing, China has made little progress in consolidating the industry. The top 10 mills accounted for only 37 percent of its crude steel in 2006 versus 46 percent in 2001. One possible contender, Baosteel Group, the top steelmaker which produces about 6 percent of China's output, squashed talk in December that it was preparing a counterbid for Rio. Another possible contender, iron ore importer and big trader Minmetals Corp, which has been at the forefront of China's search for minerals overseas, lost some confidence after Canadian objections blocked its 2005 bid for Noranda Inc. Meanwhile, Chinalco's Xiao gained Beijing's confidence with his consolidation of the aluminum sector, becoming the world's third-largest producer of alumina, and blazing the overseas trail with deals in Australia, Peru and Saudi Arabia. <ID:nHKG185059> Chinalco has had also long had business ties with Alcoa, which could help avert worries in Australia over being taken over by the Chinese. And it craves access to Rio's copper, coal and alumina assets as much or more than its massive iron ore deposits, which would be the sole interest of steelmakers. "For me it's logical that it's Chinalco, one of the mining companies, rather than a steelmaker. Chinalco would have much more expertise in mining. Chinalco seems to be the preferred vehicle for offshore mining assets," said Andrew Driscoll, head of resources research at CLSA in Hong Kong. It could also help fund any bigger bid for Rio by selling the idea that it is acting in the national interest, help Beijing assuage concerns about the security of its resource supplies. "I think it's very easy for (Chinalco) management to ask the government for financial support ... They can say: 'I am helping the country. I am blocking that,'" Geoffrey Cheng, director of Equity Research from Daiwa Institute of Research (H.K.) Ltd, said. China imported 383 million tonnes of iron ore last year, about half of what it needed to produce 489 million tonnes of crude steel -- about 36 percent of the world's total output. Rio and BHP together account for about 40 percent of China's the iron ore imports. But whether Xiao will be willing to undercut future revenues by selling cheap iron ore to steel mills is an open question. "Why should they do Baosteel a favor, just because they are Chinese, to the detriment of Rio?" asked John Johnson, chief executive of CRU China, an independent research and consulting group headquartered in England.
