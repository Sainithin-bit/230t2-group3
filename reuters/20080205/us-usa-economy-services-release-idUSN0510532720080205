 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Institute for Supply Management on Tuesday said it released its nonmanufacturing index for January ahead of schedule because of concerns the data may inadvertently have been revealed early. 

 "Late yesterday we were contacted by an individual who realized that a very, very general comment was made and they realized as soon as they said it -- though they didn't know if the other party had realized it -- that information might have been revealed," said Andrea Waas, vice president, business and public relations, at ISM. "We discussed it and decided we should release the report early just in case the other party to the conversation realized that something had been revealed," she told a conference call. Waas said it was one of the "very, very few number of people involved in getting the data and making the release happen" who made the general comment. The index data, which revealed a sharp drop in January from December, was released at 8:55 a.m. (1355 GMT) instead of 10:00 a.m. (1500 GMT) as scheduled.
