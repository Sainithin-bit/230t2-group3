 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday it would resume production at its four idled assembly plants following its interim deal with bankrupt supplier Plastech Engineered Products Inc. 

 The automaker said in a statement that the plants would resume production with second-shift employees to report as scheduled. The idled plants are located in Rockford, Illinois; Newark, Delaware; Sterling Heights, Michigan, and Toledo, Ohio. A supplier park in Toledo also had been affected. The interim deal runs through February 15. A hearing has been scheduled for February 13 for arguments on whether Chrysler can seize tooling equipment at Plastech plants that the automaker says it owns. Plastech says ownership of the equipment is in question and that removing the equipment would affect other customers. (Reporting by  Ben Klayman , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
