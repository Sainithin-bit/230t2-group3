 CHARLESTON, West Virginia  (Reuters) - The struggling U.S. economy is at risk of toppling into a shallow recession and may need more interest rate cuts to avoid one, a top Federal Reserve official said on Tuesday. 

 In an unusually sobering assessment, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said he thought the most likely outcome would be continued sluggish growth, as long as the job market did not sputter. "I can also see the possibility of a mild recession, similar to the last two we have experienced -- in other words, shallow and with a short recovery," he told a banking group. "If job growth is positive in the months ahead, and if wages can stay ahead of inflation, then income growth should be sufficient to support consumer spending gains and allow us to skirt the boundary of recession," he said. Lacker, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting panel this year, said he took into account the risk of recession as he considered policy last month. The U.S. central bank cut interest rates by an aggressive 1.25 percentage points in January. Lacker said on Tuesday more rate cuts may be necessary to hold off a downturn. "The prominence of downside risks means that further easing ultimately may be warranted," Lacker said. However, he added that if economic indicators are not weaker than expected over the next several months, "it's not clear further rate cuts would be warranted." SERVICES SECTOR STUMBLES Lacker's acknowledgment of the possibility of recession comes as economic data increasingly point to weaknesses in the economy and is among the most pessimistic assessments of the economy by a Fed official since private economists began warning about rising recession risks this year. Fresh evidence of gloomy prospects for the economy appeared earlier on Tuesday, as a survey showed the services sector retrenched sharply in January to levels not seen since the 2001 recession. The report, from the Institute for Supply Management, sent stocks into a swoon and the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 300 points, or more than 2.5 percent, in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Lacker told reporters after his speech that the services report bumped up the possibilities of recession. The Fed slashed its benchmark federal funds rate to 3 percent in January, the lowest since June 2005, in a rush to prevent the economy from sliding into recession as a result of a housing market collapse and a credit crunch. The rate stood at 5.25 percent as recently as September. A report that appeared after the Fed cut rates showed employers shed 17,000 jobs in January, the first decline in payrolls in 4-1/2 years. Lacker said in his speech that there was some possibility that the underlying trend is stronger than those numbers suggest. The world's largest economy struggled to the end of the year, showing annualized growth of just 0.6 percent in the last three months of 2007. A well-known inflation hawk, Lacker said persistently high levels of inflation continue to trouble him and limit the Fed's choices in thwarting recession. "It implies that one doesn't ease as aggressively as one otherwise would," he said. However, he said that in spite of the Fed's aggressive rate cutting last month, the chance that the central bank will run short on ammunition to fight the slowdown is "minimal."
