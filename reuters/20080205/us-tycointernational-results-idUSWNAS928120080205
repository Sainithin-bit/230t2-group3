 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday on demand from energy and industrial markets and an improving performance at its ADT security division. 

 Tyco, which last month provided preliminary results for its first quarter ended on Dec 28, said earnings from continuing operations before special items were $361 million, or 73 cents per share, up from $249 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. It wasn't immediately clear whether those numbers were directly comparable to the analysts' average profit forecast of 56 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 12 percent to $4.9 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $4.76 billion. ADT posted a 24 percent increase in operating income on a 7 percent increase in sales. At Tyco's flow control division, which makes valves, pipes and other products for energy and industrial uses, profit rose 58 percent as sales rose 29 percent.
