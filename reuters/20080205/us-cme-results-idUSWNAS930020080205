 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CME Group Inc CME.N, which is parent of the world's largest derivatives exchange and in talks to buy the New York Mercantile Exchange, said on Tuesday quarterly profit nearly doubled, topping analysts' average forecast, driven by strong volume growth. 

 Fourth-quarter net income rose to $201 million, or $3.75 per share, from $103 million, or $2.91 per share, a year earlier. "We delivered our seventh consecutive year of volume growth above 20 percent," said chief executive Craig Donohue on a conference call. "Our solid performance reflects our continuing efforts to expand our customer base, improve the speed and functionality of our systems, and develop innovative new products and markets," he said. Earnings were $3.77 per share before special items, beating the average Wall Street forecast of $3.60, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue increased 88 percent to $530.0 million, above the average forecast of $521.5 million. Volume during the quarter averaged 10.6 million contracts per day, up 23 percent from a year earlier. Total quarterly volume exceeded 676 million contracts, with a record 81 percent traded electronically. CME Group's average rate per contract, a key measure of margins, rose to 64.8 cents in the fourth quarter from 62.2 cents in the third quarter. LIFTS DIVIDEND The company also declared a first-quarter dividend of $1.15 per share, payable on March 25. This dividend represents a 34 percent increase from the prior quarterly dividend of 86 cents per share. "This should give only a muted lift to shares given the company's formulaic approach to regular bumps, which make this relatively anticipated, and the modest absolute level of (dividend) yield," wrote Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Edward Ditmire in a note to clients. CME shares were down $3.64 in morning trading, less than 1 percent, at $615.36, amid a broad market sell-off. CME said last week that it was in talks to buy Nymex Holdings Inc NMX.N, parent of the New York Mercantile Exchange, for $11 billion. Chicago-based CME was formed in July 2007 when Chicago Mercantile Holdings bought the Chicago Board of Trade. Also on Tuesday, Transatlantic exchange operator NYSE Euronext NYX.N NYX.PA posted a rise in fourth-quarter profit, benefiting from a surge in trading activity. The parent of the New York Stock Exchange said its profit rose to $156 million, or 59 cents per share, compared with net income of $45 million, or 29 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, which was prior to the Big Board's merger with Euronext.
