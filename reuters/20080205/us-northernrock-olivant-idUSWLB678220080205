 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's plans to extricate itself from the collapse of mortgage bank Northern Rock NRK.L stumbled as it faced the prospect of an auction with only two bidders, including one from the bank itself. 

 Richard Branson's Virgin Group VA.UL and an "in-house" management team have pitched rescue offers and the government is keen on a private sector solution after a four-month crisis has added to a slump in Prime Minister Gordon Brown's popularity. A third potential suitor, investment firm Olivant, quit the race on Monday. Although it could re-enter if the government was willing to reconsider the terms, that is not expected, people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. "The one thing for sure is that the government has egg smeared all over its face," said Howard Wheeldon, a senior strategist at brokerage BCG Partners. Olivant, headed by former Abbey CEO Luqman Arnold, quit after saying it was unable to put together a proposal that met its investment criteria and that of other stakeholders. It wanted to repay a 25 billion pound ($49.4 billion) loan from the government over five years, whereas the government wants to be repaid within three years. "Put simply, for Olivant that meant the maths no longer added up," Wheeldon said. ON THE ROCKS Olivant has been one of the front-runners to save Northern Rock since shortly after the bank was forced to seek emergency loans from the Bank of England in mid-September, sparking the first run on a major UK bank for over 140 years. After already coming under criticism for its handling of the crisis the government is likely to remain tied to Northern Rock's fortunes for years to come after it guaranteed bonds that will be sold to repay taxpayers. Olivant's departure raised the risk that the government would decide that none of the proposals meets its requirements, which could see Northern Rock temporarily nationalized. "We still cannot see positive value creation in Northern Rock; the Olivant withdrawal statement yesterday was most telling," said Sandy Chen, analyst at Panmure Gordon. George Osborne, Treasury spokesman for the opposition Conservative party, said the government's handling of the auction made it difficult for it to now exercise its influence and get a good deal. "I don't like the route the government is going down, exposing the taxpayer to a very considerable risk for years to come," he said, suggesting a Bank of England-led reconstruction would better protect depositors and taxpayers. Full details on both the remaining offers have not been disclosed, and each faces concerns -- Virgin's offer is highly dilutive for shareholders, while the in-house proposal retains a tarnished brand and lacks financial details. Both would pursue low-risk strategies and shrink Northern Rock's mortgage book to ensure European regulators don't block the government-backed funding package. Once the loan has been repaid they could implement modest growth plans. By 1500 GMT Northern Rock shares were up 8 percent at 95 pence, clawing back Monday's tumble to value the bank at just under 400 million pounds.
