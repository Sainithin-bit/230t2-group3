 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Appliance maker Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ) said on Tuesday that all its branded products, especially Maytag, gained market share in the fourth period from the previous quarter. 

 "Our market share improved significantly from third quarter levels," said Michael Todman, Whirlpool's president for North America, said during a conference call. The maker of Whirlpool and KitchenAid appliances has been working to rebuild market share for Maytag since it bought the U.S. company in 2006. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Gerald E.
