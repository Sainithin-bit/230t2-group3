 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ), the world's biggest appliance maker, reported higher fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday as stronger international sales and savings from the Maytag acquisition helped offset lower U.S. demand. 

 Earnings rose to $187 million, or $2.38 a share, from $109 million, or $1.37 a share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting $2.15 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
