 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp posted a 7.5 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday as speedy growth in China, Russia and other emerging markets made up for a slowdown in the United States, and it kept its annual forecasts unchanged. 

 October-December net profit at Toyota, the world's most profitable automaker, was 458.67 billion yen ($4.30 billion), ahead of an average estimate of 455.4 billion yen from six brokerages surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter operating profit, which excludes its Chinese joint ventures, grew 4.7 percent to 601.56 billion yen. For the full year ending on March 31, Toyota left its forecasts unchanged for a net profit of 1.7 trillion yen and operating profit of 2.3 trillion yen -- record results for the seventh straight year. Consensus forecasts from 22 brokerages call for a net profit of 1.82 trillion yen and operating profit of 2.46 trillion yen. Toyota, valued at $196 billion -- about 12 times the market capitalization of General Motors Corp -- has seen its momentum slow in the key U.S. market, but has been making up for that with rapid expansion in developing markets such as China, Russia and the Middle East. That has helped Toyota and domestic rivals Honda Motor Co and Nissan Motor Co shield themselves against a downturn in the United States -- the source of much of their profits -- which has been dogged by falling housing prices, a slowing economy and credit woes. Nevertheless, share prices of Japan's top three automakers have plunged over the past year as investors shunned companies exposed to the United States. Shares of Toyota lost 25 percent in the year to Monday, exceeding a 23 percent fall in Tokyo's transport sub-index ITEQP.over the same period. Honda shed 24 percent and Nissan dropped 28 percent.
