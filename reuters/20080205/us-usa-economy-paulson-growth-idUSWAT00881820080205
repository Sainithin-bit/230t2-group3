 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Tuesday said that the federal budget deficit would grow by $15 billion to $20 billion over White House estimates if U.S. economic growth in 2008 falls to the 1.7 percent level forecast by the Congressional Budget Office. 

 Paulson acknowledged before the Senate Finance Committee that the 2.7 percent 2008 growth forecast underlying the Bush's administration's budget forecast are "a couple months old," but said that the White House and CBO forecasts were similar over a five-year budget window. The White House on Monday proposed a $3.1 trillion budget and estimated that deficits would grow to deficit to $410 billion in fiscal 2008 and $407 billion for fiscal 2009.
