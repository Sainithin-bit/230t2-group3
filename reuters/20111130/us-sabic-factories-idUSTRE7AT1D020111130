 Please be advised the story on SABIC 2010.SE, which was based on a report published in Saudi newspaper al-Eqtisadiah, has been withdrawn after SABIC said some of the comments are inaccurate and were part of an interview originally given in April 2011 to an al-Watan journalist who now works for al-Eqtisadiah.
