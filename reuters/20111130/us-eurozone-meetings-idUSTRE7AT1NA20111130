 (Reuters) - The euro zone is entering a critical 10-day phase that could go a long way to dictating its future, the currency bloc's economic and monetary affairs chief said on Wednesday. 
 The two-year-old European sovereign debt crisis has forced EU finance ministers to meet more often than usual this year. Following is a timeline of some of the major ministerial meetings in 2011. January 18, 2011 - Ecofin meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels. -- European finance ministers inched forward towards beefing up the EFSF and preparing new stress tests for the region's shaky banks, dashing market hopes of quicker action. February 4 - Summit of European Union heads of state and government. -- Germany and France tried to win backing for a pact to strengthen the euro zone economy, but many other EU states were angered by what they saw as a 'fait accompli' and the measures contained in it. March 4 - Fourteen EU leaders, hosted by Finland, meet to prepare a comprehensive response to the euro zone debt crisis. -- Finland said the common will was there for European leaders to agree a pact that would call on member states to enact national legislation on debt. Ireland wanted easier terms on Dublin's financial bailout loans, but was told there would be "no free lunches." March 15 - Meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels. -- Euro zone officials said that they were likely to agree details on how to bolster the region's bailout fund soon and that the reformed EFSF should be operational by the summer. -- On March 12 euro zone leaders agreed that the capacity of the EFSF should be raised to 440 billion euros from 250 billion, but left it up to finance ministers to work out how.

Portugal on April 6 became the third euro zone country after Greece and Ireland to ask for EU and IMF aid.
