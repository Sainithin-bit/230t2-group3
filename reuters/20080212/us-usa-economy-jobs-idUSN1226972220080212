 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Employers posted fewer job openings and hired fewer people in December than a year ago, government data showed on Tuesday, in a report that further underlined the weakness of the labor market. 

 The job openings rate in December, a gauge of how many jobs were still open at the end of the month, stood at 2.8 percent, unchanged from November, but down from 3.1 percent in December 2006, The Labor Department said. Many economists think the economy may be heading into a recession. Hiring has remained stubbornly weak and the number of workers collecting jobless benefits remains at bloated levels, underscoring the difficulties in finding a job. The economy shed 17,000 non-farm jobs in January, the first time in nearly 4-1/2 years that payrolls shrank as fading construction and manufacturing sectors reflected the economy's waning momentum. The rate of hiring during December fell to 3.3 percent from 3.4 percent the prior month and below the 3.6 percent rate posted for a year ago, the data showed. The job separations rate, a measure that covers all terminations of employment, fell to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent in November and down from 3.3 percent posted for the same month a year ago. The quits rate, a subset of total separations and a barometer of how easy it is for workers to change jobs, posted a rate of 1.8 percent in December, unchanged from the previous month and below 2.0 percent a year earlier. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey lags many job market dynamics but it can provide additional insight on labor market dynamics. For 2007 construction; retail trade; professional and business services; arts, entertainment and recreation; and accommodation and food services produced 33.4 million hires and 32 million separations. They accounted for 58 percent of total non-farm hires and 59 percent of total non-farm separations while comprising only 39 percent of total non-farm employment.
