 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank groups looking at rescuing the bond insurers hope to keep the insurers' businesses intact but would split the companies up if necessary, a person briefed on the matter said Tuesday. 

 A group of banks is looking at rescuing Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N, while another group is looking at bailing out Financial Guaranty Insurance Co, or FGIC. Among the options being examined is for banks to unwind their credit derivatives positions with bond insurers, in exchange for receiving a stake in the insurers, potentially through warrants. But if keeping the bond insurers intact failed, banks would look at splitting off the municipal bond business from the structured finance business, the person briefed on the matter said. Regulators would prefer to keep the insurers intact, but if splitting were necessary, their main goal would be to ensure the health of the muni bond businesses, the person said. Warren Buffett said on Tuesday he had offered to reinsure up to $800 billion of the muni bonds guaranteed by bond insurers. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn  and Gerald E.
