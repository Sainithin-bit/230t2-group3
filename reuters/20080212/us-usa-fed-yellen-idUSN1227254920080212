 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen on Tuesday said the Fed must focus on risks that economic growth will be even weaker than expected, hinting at more interest rate cuts ahead. 

 Talking to reporters after a speech to the San Francisco Planning and Urban Research group, Yellen said it was "premature" to talk about how the Fed might set about reversing its current accommodative stance on monetary policy. "We've got a significant threat here," she said. "We need to remain very focused on the downside risks to the economy." Yellen forecast continued anemic growth for at least the first half of this year, but later added that she can't rule out the United States falling into recession, or two quarters of negative growth. The Fed's 12th District President warned of the potential for a vicious cycle where the slowing economy creates even greater caution by lenders, households and business. The Fed is watching for parallels with the early 1990s U.S. recession, and worries that a "factor of fear and caution" could already be at play, she said. "An important objective of Fed policy is to mitigate the possibility that such a negative feedback loop could develop and take hold," she said. The Fed must be "prepared to act in a timely manner." Yellen is not a voting member of the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2008. CUTS "TIMELY AND AGGRESSIVE" The FOMC's recent interest rate cuts had been timely and aggressive, pushing the real, or inflation adjusted, federal funds rate to an "accommodative" 1 percent, Yellen said. The FOMC has slashed its benchmark lending rate to 3 percent from 5.25 percent since mid-September as growth prospects have weakened. Financial markets anticipate another 50 basis point rate cut at the FOMC's March meeting. Yellen said the rapid easing had been appropriate, adding that three recent FOMC dissents in favor of tighter monetary policy, most recently by Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher in January, were "obviously a minority opinion." The Fed has moved to shore up the economy and protect "innocent bystanders" hurt by problems radiating from financial markets, not to bail out Wall Street, she said. "Our job is to create a firewall." At the same time, Yellen said an increase in credit-market spreads was working against the Fed's interest rate cuts, and would take some time to normalize. "These problems are not going to be solved in a month," she said. CONSUMERS HOBBLED Domestic consumers look to be "pretty hobbled" by a toxic mix of high energy prices, falling home values, a weak job market and tightened access to credit by banks, Yellen said. Laboring under those burdens, some households already perceive the nation to be in recession, she conceded in response to a question. Consumer spending drives about 70 percent of the U.S. economy. Retail sales for January, due for release on Wednesday, are expected to have slipped 0.2 percent after falling 0.4 percent in December. Yellen said the "temporary and timely" fiscal stimulus package passed by Congress should help out in the second half of 2008 and into 2009. Recent readings on inflation had been "disappointing," Yellen said, with core price increases now running "somewhat above what I consider to be price stability." The core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased by 2.2 percent in the year through December. But Yellen said core inflation should moderate over the next few years, edging down to around 1.75 percent as energy prices ebb and slower U.S. growth creates more slack in labor and goods markets.
