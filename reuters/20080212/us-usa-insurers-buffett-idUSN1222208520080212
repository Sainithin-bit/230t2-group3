 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett on Tuesday told CNBC television he offered to take over liabilities for other monoline bond insurers in a plan that would cover $800 billion in municipal bonds. 

  KEY POINTS:  * Buffett says one bond insurer rejected his offer. * Buffett says sent offer to bond insurers last week. * Buffett says plan would give bond insurers 30 days to find a better deal. * Buffett says offer extended to MBIA, AMBAC and FGIC.  COMMENTS:  LOU BRIEN, MARKET STRATEGIST, DRW TRADING, CHICAGO "It's important for the muni bond market but it's important to note that he's (Buffett) not going to touch their derivatives positions. He has approached the three biggest muni bond insurers. This changes the pricing of the municipal bond market in anticipation of this (proposal) coming through. The details are not clear yet. On the face of it, this is very positive for the monoline insurers."  RON SIMPSON, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, ACTION ECONOMICS,  TAMPA, FLORIDA: "At face value, it's taking a little uncertainty away from the bond insurers, which have been a major worry for the markets for some time now. The yen and the Swiss franc have been falling as a result and equity futures are higher. The perception is that we're reducing a bit of risk and therefore that's a green light to sell those currencies."  SCOTT MACDONALD, DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH, ALADDIN CAPITAL,  STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "This is obviously helpful but you have to see what the details are. He's still talking and it looks like one (insurer) turned his offer down."  ED PETERS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PANAGORA ASSET MANAGEMENT,  BOSTON: "It gives people some comfort. He must feel it's a good bet. It should be encouraging to people. He must think the worst of the subprime problem is behind us. He doesn't think there's too many more surprises."  ROB HAINES, INSURANCE ANALYST, CREDITSIGHTS, NEW YORK: "It's a huge move. Buffett is trying to capture a huge piece of the market share because of what he sees as a weakness in the whole sector." "The municipal business of the financial guarantors is still in relatively good shape. The default rates on muni bonds are very few and far between and these books of business would be attractive to someone that had the capital to support them. Obviously Buffett has the capital." "There are regulatory issues. There's a lot of moving parts," Haines said.  PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST, MILLER TABAK & CO., NEW  YORK: "Warren heading to the rescue here for the muni bond business -- that get's people excited and that's why we're rallying. There's nothing any deeper than that. The CDO exposure is obviously not going away. Buffett wouldn't touch that stuff. He's trying to help the business that is extremely profitable."  T.J. MARTA, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, ROYAL BANK OF CANADA  CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Investors are taking this extremely positively, that this would be a boon for the bond insurers and that we are now avoiding the doomsday scenario, so there has been a Treasury market sell-off."  MARKET REACTION: - BONDS: U.S. Treasuries extended losses as U.S. stock futures rise on Buffett offer. - CURRENCIES: The dollar rose against the yen. - US STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures rise.
