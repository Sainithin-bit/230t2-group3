 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hasbro Inc HAS.N, the second-largest 
U.S. toy company, expects a 14 percent to 15 percent increase 
this year in the costs of made-in-China products due to higher 
labor, commodity and currency costs, according to a story on 
the Financial Times Web site. 

  The company also expects costs to be affected by additional 
product safety testing in the aftermath of last year's U.S. toy 
safety recalls, the paper said, citing Hasbro Chief Financial 
Officer David Hargreaves.  The paper said Hasbro's China-based suppliers were 
increasingly shifting production away from the coastal 
industrial regions as they face rising costs, including labor.  (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
