 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. phone company Qwest Communications International Inc ( Q.N ) on Tuesday reported an 89 percent rise in fourth-quarter profit, boosted by a benefit related to income tax. 

 Qwest said its quarterly profit totaled $366 million, or 20 cents per share, from $194 million, or 10 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding $106 million in income tax benefits, the quarterly profit was 14 cents a share, matching analysts average expectations according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for Qwest, whose bigger peers include AT&T ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ), fell to $3.44 billion from $3.49 billion a year earlier but was on par with Wall Street views. Shares of Qwest, which is seen as one of the weakest former Bell operating companies, closed on Monday at $5.13 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock over the past year has tumbled 37 percent compared to a 2 percent decline in Verizon shares in the same period. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul , editing by Mark Porter)
