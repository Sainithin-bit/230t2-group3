 (Reuters) - Shares in mining group Xstrata XTA.L fell on Tuesday after a newspaper report that Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ) may abandon its bid plans as Xstrata had rejected a $76 billion takeover approach. 

 Here is a chronology tracing the main events in the bid saga for Anglo-Swiss group Xstrata. December 5, 2007 - Xstrata Chief Executive Mick Davis tells an investor presentation that BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) move to acquire Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.AX ) was likely to lead to another wave of mergers in the sector. December 12 - Xstrata confirms it held preliminary talks about possible mergers after a wave of rumors, but says they resulted in no proposals. January 21, 2008 - Vale ( RIO.N ) says it held talks with Xstrata about a takeover, but cautions that any deal would depend on market conditions. January 25 - Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula says he is yet to discuss Vale's possible bid for Xstrata. A senior government official says the government opposes such a move. January 28 - A debt financing package for Vale's possible takeover of Xstrata is estimated to be in the $30 billion to $40 billion range, banking sources say. February 7 - Brazil's state development bank says it sees no reason to oppose Vale's attempt to buy Xstrata, signaling that the bid is unlikely to be blocked by the government. February 12 - The Financial Times says Xstrata and its 35 percent shareholder Glencore rejected a cash-and-shares proposal worth just under 40 pounds a share, which could lead Vale to walk away.
