 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp CFO Fritz Henderson said on Tuesday the automaker expects to start seeing some savings from its new buyout program in the second half of 2008 and into 2009. 

 Henderson said GM would start to accrue some of the costs from the program in the first half of the year as workers take up offers for early retirements or buyouts. Henderson also said GM had a pension overfunding of about $20 billion at the end of 2007, roughly $11.5 billion to $12 billion from hourly employees and the rest for salaried workers, Henderson said.
