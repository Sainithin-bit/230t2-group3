 (Reuters) - Shares in Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) could rise as much as 45 percent, according to a Barron's story that cites an investor in the company. 
 After a roughly 7 percent decline in the company's shares over the last 12 months, the stock looks "unusually attractive", Barron's said in its March 5 edition. Chief Investment Officer David Rolfe -- whose firm Wedgewood Partners owns Berkshire stock -- thinks the shares are worth at least $170,000 each, Barron's said. That would be 44.9 percent higher than the company's Friday close of $117,350 on the New York Stock Exchange. While two Wall Street analysts are less bullish, they too expect the shares to rise, according to Barron's. The magazine cited a $133,000 share price target from Cliff Gallant at KBW and a $127,500 target from Jay Gelb at Barclays Capital. (Writing by  Sinead Carew  in New York; Editing by  Dale Hudson )
