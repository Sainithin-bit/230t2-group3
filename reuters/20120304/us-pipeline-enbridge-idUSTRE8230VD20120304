 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc expects to restore the Line 14 pipeline to service Wednesday night and the Line 64 pipeline by Thursday, the company said in a statement. 
 Line 14/64, which carries 318,000 barrels per day (bpd) of Canadian crude oil between Superior, Wisconsin and Griffith, Indiana, was shut on Saturday after a deadly vehicle collision. Lines upstream of Superior will require a slowdown or shutdown to manage tank levels, while 14/64 is shut, the company said. (Reporting by  Erwin Seba ; Editing by  Dale Hudson )
