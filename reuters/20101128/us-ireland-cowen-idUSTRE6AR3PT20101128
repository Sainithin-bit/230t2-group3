 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said Sunday he still intended to lead his Fianna Fail party into the next election after agreeing an 85-billion-euro ($113 billion) EU/IMF bailout. 

 In an interview with state broadcaster RTE, Cowen said he remained committed to calling an election after budget laws were enacted, and intended to fight it as party leader. Asked if he still believed he was the best leader of Fianna Fail, he said: "I am the democratically elected leader of the party and I believe it. I do believe it. Of course." The election became unavoidable last week when Fianna Fail's junior coalition partners, the Greens, said they would withdraw from the government once the budget was passed. Opinion polls show Cowen is the least popular prime minister in modern Irish history while presiding over a record-breaking recession in which unemployment surged from about 4 percent to 14 percent. The loan package he agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union Sunday was intended to recapitalize banks whose balance sheets were ruined when property prices crashed, and fund a huge government deficit. It requires a four-year program of tax increases and spending cuts. (Reporting by  Peter Graff ; editing by  Andrew Dobbie )
