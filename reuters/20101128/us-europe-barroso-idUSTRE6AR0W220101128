 PARIS  (Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso hopes for a unanimous agreement on Sunday among finance ministers to support Ireland, he told Europe 1 radio. 

 European ministers are expected to agree 85 billion euro rescue package for Ireland, which is facing a debt crisis, making it the second euro member after Greece to be bailed out. "I hope that today, at the level of finance ministers, there will be a unanimous agreement to support Ireland," he said. Separately, EU sources said the European Union, European Central Bank and the IMF had concluded negotiations with Irish authorities on the bailout and the deal was ready to be signed off by EU finance ministers. Barroso also said Europe was ready to face any difficulties. "We are ready to face any difficulty, and the member states are taking exceptional measures with great courage -- it must be said."
