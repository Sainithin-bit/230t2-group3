 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti promised reforms to boost growth and public finances on Thursday, acknowledging that the government was responding to sweeping demands from the European Central Bank. 

 But to criticism from both the opposition and government allies, he gave little detail. Tremonti's remarks to a parliamentary committee underlined the remarkable extent to which Italian public policy was now being dictated by its European partners in return for ECB help in buying government bonds to bring down Rome's borrowing costs. He told lawmakers the government was ready to follow the ECB's request for steps to liberalize the economy but was still working out detailed plans for balancing the budget by 2013. "We have to pass a very strong fiscal adjustment package for this year and 2012 and for the following year, 2013," he said. "The detailed numbers are currently being worked out. "The political choice on how to re-focus efforts on 2012 and 2013 is a choice we still have to make," he said, adding that plans would be presented at the next cabinet meeting. Parliamentary sources said the meeting scheduled for next week could be brought forward to as early as Friday, despite the lack of detailed agreement so far. The government will have to find some 20 billion euros in budget measures to reach its 2013 target, brought forward from an original date of 2014 in response to pressure from the ECB. The central bank wrote to Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi last week demanding broad reforms in exchange for help in stemming a market selloff that had threatened to tip the euro zone's third largest economy into a full-blown debt crisis. But there has been widespread concern over the lack of detail from the government about a plan which even Umberto Bossi, head of Berlusconi's main coalition partner, the Northern League, described as "woolly." Pierluigi Bersani, leader of the opposition Democratic Party, criticised the absence of specifics and said his party opposed proposals for an amendment to the constitution requiring a balanced budget, which could block government borrowing. "First, let's not talk about things that don't exist in any place in the world," Bersani said during a hearing of the parliamentary constitutional committee. "Balancing the budget in the constitution -- well, we don't intend to castrate ourselves for centuries from any possible economic policy." "So let's find a solution that has flexibility." "SUGGESTED AND APPRECIATED" Tremonti confirmed that ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet had written to the government laying out reform demands and said the ECB, France and Germany had "suggested and appreciated" the goal of bringing forward budget plans. But he rejected opposition and union demands that the letter be made public, saying that would be up to the ECB. The Frankfurt-based bank has been decisive in stemming market turmoil which threatened to engulf Italy last week but it only stepped in to buy government bonds after securing reform commitments from Rome. Northern League leader Bossi said the ECB appeared to have been manipulated by people acting with political motivations. "I fear the letter was written in Rome," he told reporters. "I fear there is an attempt to bring down the government." Bossi seemed to be referring to Bank of Italy Governor Mario Draghi, who will succeed ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet this year and who has previously widely been seen as the potential head of a temporary technocrat government. "Draghi, instead of being in Europe, is always in Rome," he said. Berlusconi met Draghi in Rome on Thursday but there was no immediate word on the substance of their discussions. Tremonti said ECB demands included full liberalisation of local public services and the professions, more flexible employment contracts, easier hiring and firing rules to free up the rigid labor market and cuts to public sector pay. Additional measures included increasing the retirement age for women employees in the private sector and a change in rules on when workers can retire based on their pension contributions. Tremonti said the proposals on hiring and firing and cuts to public sector pay were not in the government's plans, but he added that there was a need for action on freeing up the economy as well as cutting the cost of government. Deep disagreements remain over the proposals, which Tremonti said would be presented to President Giorgio Napolitano later on Thursday. Both the CGIL, Italy's biggest union, and the Northern League -- whose voter base is in the small business sector and middle and working classes of the prosperous north of Italy -- oppose cuts to pensions. Berlusconi, one of Italy's richest men, has ruled out a wealth tax, while employers federation Confindustria has criticised the proposals made public so far as inadequate. Four parliamentarians from the ruling PDL party said they could not guarantee their backing for the austerity measures after what they called "disappointing" testimony from Tremonti.
