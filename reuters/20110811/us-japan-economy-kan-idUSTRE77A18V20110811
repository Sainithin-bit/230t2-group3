 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Thursday exchange-rate moves were one-sided, and that the government will continue to monitor market moves and respond as appropriate. 

 He also said he wanted the Bank of Japan to work closely with the government to support Japan's economy from the financial front. (Reporting Tokyo policy team, writing by Leika Kihara; Editing by  Michael Watson )
