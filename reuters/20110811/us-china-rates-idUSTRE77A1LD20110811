 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Near zero U.S. interest rates would affect China's economy, a senior official at China's top economic planning agency said, but added it is too early to say the world economy is headed for another recession. 

 Zhang Xiaoqiang, vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, was also quoted by state radio as saying the yuan should rise gradually against the dollar. (Reporting by Aileen Wang and Koh Gui Qing) (Editing by John Stonestreet)
