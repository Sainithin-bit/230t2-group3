 ABUJA  (Reuters) - OPEC appeared willing on Wednesday to pull back from more oil output cuts, responding to consumer nation calls to hold off until winter has passed to guard against price spikes that would hurt the world economy. 

 OPEC, which produces over a third of the world's oil, will hold talks on Thursday to decide whether to curb supplies beyond the 1.2 million barrels per day ministers agreed from November 1. Some ministers and officials signaled their priority was to ensure compliance with that deal, which succeeded in arresting a 25 percent price slide, before making additional reductions. "I don't think there will be any cut," the head of Libya's delegation, Shokri Ghanem, told Reuters on Wednesday. OPEC ministers agree the market is oversupplied -- crude oil stocks in top consumer the United States are at a 13-year high -- but some fear cutting output again now, during peak demand, could drive prices further above $60 and hurt consumer nations. The opinion of leading exporter Saudi Arabia is key in determining OPEC output policy. Oil Minister Ali Al-Naimi told reporters on his arrival the market was in better shape than when ministers last met, at October's emergency talks. "The fundamentals of the market are much better than they were in October," he said, adding: "We probably have a little work to do to make it an even better, more stable market." U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman and International Energy Agency head Claude Mandil have called on OPEC to wait until next year before deciding on further supply reductions. A delegate from one of OPEC's Gulf members said there was a strong case for holding fire. OPEC research director Hasan Qabazard said if members abided by the deal they struck in October, that should do the job of restoring equilibrium. Members have delivered almost two thirds of the 1.2 million bpd reduction so far, according to Reuters estimates. Qabazard estimated compliance higher, at 80 to 85 percent, leaving slack of 200,000 to 300,000 bpd of oil. COLD COMFORT The IEA, adviser to 26 industrialized countries, said in its monthly report on Wednesday OPEC cuts from November 1 were making themselves felt, "cold comfort for a risk-prone global economy already facing another winter with high oil prices". Some ministers indicated they are prepared to listen to consumer nations' calls and defer a decision. But they remain nervous that normally slack demand in the second quarter could trigger steep price falls next year. "If we leave it for now we should review it quickly at the earliest opportunity," said OPEC President Edmund Daukoru, who is also Nigeria's minister of state for petroleum. Kuwaiti Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Jarrah al-Sabah said he believed OPEC should stay its hand if prices remained at $60. On Wednesday, U.S. crude stood at $61.03 a barrel. United Arab Emirates' Oil Minister Mohammed bin Dhaen al-Hamli said OPEC would only cut if "absolutely necessary". Oil has fallen from a mid-July peak of $78.40 but is still three times the price at the start of 2002 as Asian demand kicked in. Refining constraints and worries over supply from Iraq, Nigeria, Iran and Russia helped fuel the rally. SPLIT A delegate said members were divided 50/50 over the need to reduce supplies from the current target of 26.3 million bpd. Iran and Venezuela are among those pressing for a reduction. Algerian Energy Minister Chakib Khelil also saw a need for a further reduction because failure to act could lead to more oversupply in the second quarter. "It is highly probable we need to go for a further cut to really be able to stabilize the market for next year," he said. Cuts in place have already gone some way toward draining oil stocks in the industrialized world that reached 2.76 billion barrels, 55 days of demand, in September. The IEA's latest report said stocks fell in October to 2.72 billion barrels, 54 days of demand. Weekly data indicates a further decline in November, the IEA added. "We believe that unless prices fall sharply in the next two days, OPEC will not cut because they will not need to and will not have any incentive to," said Mike Wittner, global head of energy market research at investment bank Calyon.
