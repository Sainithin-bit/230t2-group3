 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Danaher Corp. ( DHR.N ) said on Wednesday it expects double-digit earnings growth next year, citing demand for of professional tools and growth in emerging markets. 

 Danaher said it expects 2007 earnings per share in a range of $3.68 to $3.78. Analysts on average estimate 2007 earnings at $3.72 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Danaher's range would represent a 14 to 17 percent improvement from its estimated 2006 earnings of $3.23 per share. It earned $2.76 a share in 2005. Danaher CEO Lawrence Culp told analysts the company has made progress in rebuilding its portfolio to make it less susceptible to economic swings. About half the company's $10 billion of annual sales now come from less cyclical, less volatile businesses such as dental tools and water treatment technology, he said, adding that the company also had more exposure to fast-growing Asia-Pacific markets. Culp said he sees a good U.S. economic environment next year and expects Danaher to grow sales from existing businesses by 5 percent. That's the same "core" sales growth the company estimated for the third and fourth quarters of 2006, JP Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said in a research note, adding that sales growth was likely to be weaker in the first half of the year than in the second. "While numbers probably go up modestly, fundamentals look to be playing out as expected, so the news is not enough to drive near-term upside in the stock, given recent outperformance," Tusa said in a research note. Danaher shares were off 6 cents at $72.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has gained about 30 percent this year, outpacing the Standard and Poor's 500 index  .SPX .
