 LONDON  (Reuters) - OPEC oil cuts already in place are 
tightening the world market ahead of winter and may prevent a 
recovery in consumer stocks, the International Energy Agency 
said on Wednesday, urging OPEC to hold off on a new reduction. 

  The IEA, an adviser to 26 industrialized countries, said 
OPEC should not cut output for a second time this year at its 
meeting this week as world demand nears its annual peak and 
supply from non-OPEC producers falls short of expectations.  OPEC, source of more than a third of the world's oil, holds 
talks on Thursday in Abuja, Nigeria. Consuming countries are 
worried another supply reduction could drive oil prices further 
above $60 a barrel, threatening economic growth.  "Already, OPEC has tightened the market quite 
substantially," IEA supply analyst David Fyfe told Reuters by 
telephone.  "With prices in excess of $60, the uncertainties over 
winter weather and some of the risks we are flagging about 
non-OPEC growth, I don't think we would see a further cut as 
being merited at this time."  In a monthly report, the Paris-based IEA maintained 
previous forecasts calling for world oil demand to rise by 1.1 
percent in 2006 and by 1.7 percent in 2007 to 85.9 million 
barrels per day.  Even so, it said the 2007 forecast faces "downside risks" 
because of an uncertain economic outlook for the United States, 
the world's largest oil consumer.
  COLD COMFORT  The IEA added to evidence that the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries has yet to implement fully a deal 
to lower output by 1.2 million bpd as of November 1.  While the 10 OPEC members excluding Iraq trimmed supply in 
November by 500,000 bpd to 27.1 million bpd, that is still 
enough to tighten supply, according to the IEA.  Oil inventories in the OECD grouping of industrialized 
countries fell by 40 million barrels in October to 2.721 
billion and weekly data indicates a further decline in 
November, the IEA said.  Stocks equaled 54 days of demand in October, one day less 
than in September and one day higher than October 2005.  "Without doubt, November's output cuts have the potential 
to tighten the oil market this winter, and offer little 
prospect, allowing for demand growth, of a recovery in stock 
cover above the current 54 days," the report said.  That is "cold comfort for a risk-prone global economy 
already facing another winter with high oil prices."  A lower estimate of supply from producers outside OPEC 
prompted the IEA to increase an estimate of demand for the 
group's crude in 2007 by 100,000 bpd to 28.4 million bpd.  Non-OPEC production will average 52.63 million bpd next 
year, 115,000 bpd less than expected, due to weaker supply 
expectations from regions including Russia.
