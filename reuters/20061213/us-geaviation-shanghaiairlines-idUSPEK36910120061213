 BEIJING  (Reuters) - GE Aviation ( GE.N ) will sign a $550 million deal with Shanghai Airlines for nine aircraft engines and a related service contract, the U.S. Commerce Department said in a statement on Wednesday. 

 The deal includes $300 million for the purchase of aircraft engines to power nine Boeing ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner aircraft, with a $250 million follow-on service contract, according to the statement from U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez. He was in Beijing for a signing ceremony to announce several deals between U.S. and Chinese companies, including U.S. home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc.'s ( HD.N ) purchase of Chinese furnishing chain HomeWay. No terms of that deal were announced. The statement, coming ahead of a strategic economic dialogue between ministers and secretaries of the two countries, also called on China to take further economic liberalization steps. "As a leader in the global economy, China needs to do more to open its markets, protect intellectual property and implement economic reforms," Gutierrez said, according to the statement. "Our economic relationship will be strengthened by market forces that foster competition and adherence to the rule of law." Gutierrez added that commercial engagement based on open markets with fair and effective rules was the foundation of what the United States envisioned as a "healthy, strong and continually growing" trade relationship. "U.S. companies produce the kind of world class products and services that can help China meet the demands of its rapidly developing and innovative economy, while supporting American jobs at home," he said, according to the written version of remarks he was due to give at a ceremony.
