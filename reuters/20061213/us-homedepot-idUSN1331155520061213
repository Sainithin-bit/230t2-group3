 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - U.S. home improvement chain Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) said on Wednesday it would buy Chinese retailer The Home Way, marking its first foray into retailing in fast-growing China. 

 Terms were not disclosed, but Home Depot said the acquisition will give it 12 stores in six cities and access to a $50 billion home improvement market that is growing at 20 percent per year. "I anticipate we will grow as quickly as, if not quicker than, the market," Annette Verschuren, president of Home Depot Asia/Canada, told a Beijing press briefing. The Home Way purchase gives Home Depot another potential platform to drive earnings as its retail-sales growth slows in the United States. China's billion-plus population and rising homeownership are luring many foreign retailers. "It's not something that I expect to be a tremendous source of earnings for the company today," said Peter Jankovskis, director of research at Oakbrook Investments in Lisle, Illinois, which owns Home Depot stock. But as Home Depot, which has more than 2,100 stores in the United States, Canada and Mexico, learns more about operating in China, "we could see dividends from that far down the road," Jankovskis added. Home Depot said the deal had received necessary Chinese government regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of the year. The Atlanta-based retailer is looking to establish multiple channels for growth, including foreign expansion and a move into professional contractor markets, as its retail stores approach saturation in the United States and competition increases with smaller rival Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ), which will open stores in Canada next year. STORE OPENINGS SLOW In January, Home Depot said it would significantly scale back store growth with plans to open 400 to 500 stores through 2010, about half the number opened in the previous five years. Privately owned The Home Way Co. Ltd., based in the eastern port city of Tianjin, plans to use part of the proceeds from Home Depot to pay down debts owed to its suppliers, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. Home Depot has been looking to set up stores in China for at least two years. The company opened purchasing offices in Shanghai and Shenzhen in 2002, and received approval from China's government to invest in stores there in 2005. Verschuren told Reuters in an interview that Home Depot talked to a number of China companies about a potential buyout but Home Way made most sense. She said the two companies had an agreement 10 years ago to share best retail practices. "Their culture is very similar to ours; the focus on customer service is similar," Verschuren said. She said Home Depot would likely pursue growth in China in the same way it expanded in Canada and Mexico, via acquisitions and eventually building its own stores. Home Depot has 151 Canadian stores and 59 in Mexico. The acquisition is part of intensified takeover activity in the Chinese retail sector. British supermarket chain Tesco Plc ( TSCO.L ) said on Tuesday it was increasing its stake in Chinese retailer Hymall. Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a research note that the China deal likely "will finally put to rest" long-time rumors that Home Depot would acquire Britain's Kingfisher Plc ( KGF.L ), whose B&Q stores also operate in China. B&Q, which bought the Chinese operations of German rival OBI in April, is on track to have 60 stores in China by the end of this year and 100 by 2010. Home Depot's shares were up 48 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $39.18 in late morning New York Stock Exchange trading. Lowe's shares were up 23 cents to $30.86.
