 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global news agency Reuters RTR.L on Wednesday appointed David Schlesinger to be its new editor in chief, replacing Geert Linnebank, who will become a senior adviser to the company's chief executive. 

 Schlesinger, who has been global managing editor and head of editorial operations since 2003, will take over in January 2007. "He (Schlesinger) has steered editorial operations through strategic and structural change, while demonstrating concern and compassion for journalists facing the day-to-day problems of working under difficult and sometimes dangerous conditions," Reuters Group Plc CEO Tom Glocer said in a statement. Schlesinger joined Reuters in 1987 as a correspondent in Hong Kong. Linnebank, who will also remain chairman of the Reuters Foundation, has been at the helm of Reuters editorial for nearly seven years. He will advise the Reuters board and be nominated as the Reuters representative on the board of Independent Television News Ltd.
