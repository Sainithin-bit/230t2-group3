 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Wednesday cut its ratings on Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ), citing a more aggressive financial policy by management, as reflected in the home improvement retailer's planned debt sale to fund $4 billion in share buybacks. 

 Home Depot is expected to sell $5 billion in a three-part debt sale this week, according to a market source familiar with the sale. The offering includes a three-year floating rate note issue, a seven-year fixed-rate note issue and a 30-year fixed-rate bond. The downgrade also reflects a softening in the company's operating trends, Fitch said in a statement. Home Depot's comparable-store sales declined 5.1 percent in the third quarter and 1.7 percent in the first nine months of 2006, Fitch said. "Weaker sales constrained the company's profitability, with the operating margin narrowing to 11.4 percent in the first nine months of 2006 from 11.8 percent a year earlier," the ratings agency said. Fitch cut Home Depot's debt rating by two notches to "A-plus," its fifth highest rating, from "AA." The outlook is stable, indicating an additional cut is not anticipated over the next one to two years. Home Depot's 5.2 percent bond due 2011 widened 2 basis points on Wednesday to 0.67 percentage point over Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.
