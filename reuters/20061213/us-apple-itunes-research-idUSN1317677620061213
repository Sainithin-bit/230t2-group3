 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Digital music sales surged at Apple Computer Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) iTunes service over the first nine months of 2006, Piper Jaffray said on Wednesday, contradicting a report that sales collapsed in the first half. 

 Apple shares fell 3 percent on Tuesday after Forrester Research reported a 65 percent drop in monthly iTunes revenue in the first six months of the year, based on a survey of North American consumers. But Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster wrote in a research report that the number of songs sold per week on iTunes had risen 78 percent in the first nine months of 2006 compared with the same period in 2005. "Contrary to recent reports suggesting sales on iTunes are declining rapidly, our analysis of Apple company data ... shows strong growth (year over year)," Munster wrote. Piper Jaffray said songs sold by iTunes totaled 695 million from January through September, amounting to about 18.5 million per week. Separately, Morgan Stanley on Wednesday raised its target price on Apple stock to $110 from $90. Apple shares rose $1.80, or 2 percent, to $87.94 in early trade on Nasdaq. Forrester said a study of 2,791 credit and debit card transactions at the U.S. iTunes store showed that only 3 percent of online households made a purchase in the first half of 2006. "It is too soon to tell if this decline was seasonal or if buyers were reaching their saturation level for digital music," it said in the report. Since the launch of the iPod digital music player, consumers are buying about 20 iTunes songs per iPod. Apple says it has sold more than 1.5 billion music tracks and tens of millions of TV shows and movies.
