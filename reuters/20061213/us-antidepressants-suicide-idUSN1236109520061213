 SILVER SPRING, Maryland  (Reuters) - Antidepressant drugs need warnings that they may raise the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in adults up to age 25, a U.S. advisory panel said on Wednesday. 

 The information should be added to current "black box" warnings that say taking the drugs may increase that behavior in children and teens, the panel advised the Food and Drug Administration in a 6-2 vote. Antidepressants include Pfizer Inc.'s Zoloft and Eli Lilly and Co.'s Prozac. The warnings should note that untreated depression also can lead to serious consequences including suicide, several panel members said. "We want to extend the age in the black box and at the same time not discourage treatment," said panel member Dr. Andrew Leon, a psychiatrist at Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York. An FDA analysis found antidepressant use raises the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior in adults up to age 25. Beyond age 30, however, the drugs seem to provide protection against that problem, particularly after age 65. The panel deliberations followed testimony from angry and grieving family members who pleaded for strong new warnings that the risks seen in children also apply in adults. Psychiatrists, however, cautioned against tough language that could scare patients from effective treatment for depression. Millions of patients now take antidepressants. Newer antidepressants include Zoloft, Prozac, GlaxoSmithKline Plc's Paxil, Lilly's Cymbalta, and Wyeth's Effexor. Sales topped $12.5 billion in 2005, according to data from health information company IMS Health. Some of the drugs come in generic versions. The FDA review found the chances of suicidal thoughts or behavior among adults younger than 25 "approaches that seen in the pediatric population." In clinical trials of nine antidepressants, 4 percent of patients who took the drugs reported suicidal thoughts or behaviors, compared with 2 percent who were given a placebo.
