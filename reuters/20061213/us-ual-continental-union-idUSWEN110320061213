 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A union representing workers at UAL Corp.'s United Airlines and Continental Airlines Inc. said on Wednesday it had not been contacted about a potential merger between the airlines but was prepared to defend its members' rights. 

 The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said it was prepared to defend the wages, contracts and defined benefit pension plans of its 25,000 members at the two airlines. United and Continental have held early talks about a potential merger, according to a person familiar with the matter.
