 ZURICH  (Reuters) - A suit brought by the New York Attorney General against UBS, accusing its U.S. brokerage of defrauding customers, could harm the wealth management industry even if the Swiss bank mounts a successful defense, analysts said. 

 UBS has denied it was promoting a scheme that hurt clients and said it intends "to defend itself vigorously." Industry watchers and analysts said negative publicity from the case could discourage potential clients from entrusting their wealth with a private bank or brokerage. "The implications for private banking are not good. This gives high publicity and undermines the trust of the relationship between clients and their bank whether it (the accusation) is founded or not," said an adviser to the wealth management industry, who asked not to be identified. "However it plays out, positively or negatively, there will be consequences for the credentials of the industry," he added. New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued UBS Financial Services on Tuesday, accusing the brokerage of defrauding thousands of customers with commission-based accounts by steering them into fee-based accounts, called InsightOne. "Image is everything in wealth management," said a London-based analyst who has conducted extensive research on the industry. "From a reputational point of view it would not be helpful if they (UBS) get fined." A spokesman for the Swiss Bankers Association said fallout was likely to be limited. "We don't see any immediate spinoffs for the Swiss financial industry," he said. Clients under the InsightOne program are charged fees based on the amount of assets under management rather than a brokerage fee for every single transaction -- such as the purchase or sale of stocks and bonds -- carried out on their behalf. The arrangement benefits clients who carry out regular transactions and is supposed to protect them from having financial advisers deliberately ramp up commissions with a string of unnecessary deals, a practice known as "churning". "It is ironic that Spitzer is upset about something that stops churning," said the London-based analyst. UBS said in a statement that since the launch of InsightOne in 1999, UBS clients had saved hundreds of millions of dollars, on aggregate, compared to what they would have paid in full commissions. The New York Attorney General's Office said in a statement that exactly the opposite happened. "As a result of UBS's fraudulent conduct, InsightOne customers paid tens of millions of dollars more in InsightOne fees than they would have paid in traditional brokerage account commissions," the statement said. The statement also cited five individual cases of alleged fraud. In one instance, it said, "UBS charged a 91-year-old InsightOne client more than $35,000 for just four trades over two years -- some $33,000 more than she would have paid in a traditional brokerage account." UBS said that fee-based brokerage programs are offered by most large broker-dealers and that in 2005 U.S. investors had $258 billion invested in fee-based programs. "I don't think the (InsightOne) product is wrong," said a Frankfurt-based banking analyst. "The problem is that when you shift from one way of charging to another way of charging some people will be better off and others worse off." "Some of the people mentioned in this lawsuit are ridiculously worse off. If UBS had paid attention they would have tried to avoid extreme cases of disadvantage to clients."
