 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - U.S. home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) is to buy a major stake in Chinese furnishing chain HomeWay, making its first foray into retailing in China, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. 

 Atlanta-based Home Depot would "eventually" take management control of the Chinese firm, based in the eastern Chinese port city of Tianjin, the source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Home Depot, which today only has sourcing operations in China, will announce the deal with HomeWay in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon, another source said. The acquisition is part of intensified takeover activity in the fast-growing Chinese retail sector. British supermarket chain Tesco said on Tuesday that it was increasing its stake in Hymall, one of China's largest retailers. The Home Depot-HomeWay deal came after Home Depot failed to buy bigger Chinese chain store Orient Home, the first source added. Home Depot has been looking to set up stores in China for at least two years. It has also been vying with do-it-yourself firm B&Q, part of Britain's top home improvement retailer, Kingfisher Plc ( KGF.L ), to acquire Chinese retailers. Chinese media have long speculated that Home Depot was negotiating to acquire a stake in HomeWay or Orient Home. Home Depot on Monday declined to comment on a published report that said it was planning to spend $100 million to buy a majority stake in a Chinese retailer. Citing people close to the deal, the Financial Times said the retailer would unveil a deal for a stake in HomeWay this week.
