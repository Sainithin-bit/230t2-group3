 NEW YORK  Dec 13 (Reuters) - Monster Worldwide Inc.
( MNST.O ), parent of jobs Web site Monster.com,  said on
Wednesday it overstated profit from 1997 to 2005 by a total of
$271.9 million, as it wraps up its investigation into
historical stock option grants and accounting.  The company, whose founder and chief executive resigned in
October, said it will be current with all its regulatory
filings within the next two weeks, satisfying conditions for
continued Nasdaq listing.  Monster's review is part of a widespread investigation into
stock option backdating. More than 160 companies may have
fraudulently manipulated option grant and exercise dates to
maximize the options' value while lowering the tax burden.  The company said in its amended annual report on Wednesday
that its special committee determined the exercise price of a
"substantial number" of stock option grants from 1997 through
March 31, 2003, was different from the fair market value of the
underlying shares on the grant date.  Monster recorded a net charge of $9.2 million for 2005,
$14.4 million for 2004, $27 million for 2003, $44.9 million for
2002, $65.6 million for 2001, and $110.8 million for the
cumulative period of 1997 through 2000.  Its investigation is substantially complete, and the
special committee will make remedial recommendations to the
board early next year, Monster said in a filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.  In October, Andrew McKelvey resigned from his positions of
CEO and chairman, and later refused to be interviewed by the
special committee investigating Monster's stock options.  The company last month fired general counsel and secretary
Myron Olesnyckyj as a result of its review.  Monster shares were down 52 cents to $43.97 in Nasdaq
trading.
