 YOKOHAMA, Japan  (Reuters) - The head of Isuzu Motors Ltd. 
( 7202.T ) said on Wednesday the Japanese truck maker was 
considering building a truck factory in North America as it 
focuses on growth overseas to make up for an expected 
stagnation in domestic demand. 

  A local factory would be appropriate when U.S. truck sales 
reached 50,000 units a year, President Yoshinori Ida said at 
the unveiling of the new light-duty Elf truck outside Tokyo. 
Isuzu expects to sell 32,000 trucks in the United States this 
year.  Ida did not disclose the likely scale of a future factory, 
but another company executive said it would probably build 2-3 
ton trucks, adding to Isuzu's sole offering of 3.5-ton N-series 
trucks in the United States.  The executive, declining to be identified, said Isuzu was 
in the final stages of purchasing land for a factory. He said 
the truck maker also wanted to add a 4-ton truck to its line-up 
around 2009.  Isuzu currently exports most of the N-series trucks it 
sells in the United States from Japan. It subcontracts 
production of the gasoline version of the model to former top 
shareholder General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ).  Last year, Isuzu sold around 25,000 trucks in the United 
States, of which 4,700 units were built at GM's Janesville, 
Wisconsin plant, an Isuzu spokesman said.  Isuzu separately owns a joint venture factory with GM in 
Ohio to build about 200,000 diesel engines a year.  In 2003, Isuzu transferred its 49 percent stake in an 
Indiana-based joint venture factory for sport utility vehicles 
with Japan's Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. ( 7270.T ) to the maker 
of Subaru cars as its SUV sales plunged.  It continued to subcontract production of about 30,000 
Rodeo and Axiom SUVs to Fuji Heavy's Lafayette, Indiana plant, 
but that ended as the models reached the end of their life 
cycles.  Isuzu now sells SUVs built by GM on an original equipment 
manufacturing basis.  Shares in Isuzu fell 0.92 percent to 538 yen on Wednesday.
