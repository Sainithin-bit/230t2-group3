 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) is considering a major acquisition in the United States early next year, according to a report in The Scotsman newspaper on Wednesday, but the bank dismissed the report. 

 The newspaper, citing "sources familiar with the situation", said the project is code-named "Project S" and details of the target are secret. RBS's U.S. arm Citizens is the eighth-biggest American bank and accounts for about a fifth of RBS profits, but the deal could be outside its existing footprint of New England, the Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest, The Scotsman said. "(Chief Executive) Fred Goodwin has made it patently clear what our position is in regard to acquisitions. He did it at the interims, the investor day and again at the trading statement last week," said Howard Moody, director of communications at  RBS. Goodwin last week told reporters the bank had no plans for big acquisitions. "There's no new news and no change of direction. We're not setting any hares running," Goodwin said. RBS shares closed up 0.5 percent at 19.93 pounds. On Monday they broke through 20 pounds for the first time since June 2002 after the bank said in a trading update last week that its 2006 profits should beat analysts' expectations. Last month RBS bought Illinois-based GreatBanc for $180 million and said it will make more "in-fill acquisitions" in the United States to drive growth. Larry Fish, CEO of Citizens, said similar sized deals to GreatBanc were likely to continue, with perhaps two or three a year.
