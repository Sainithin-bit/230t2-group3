  By  Paritosh Bansal NEW YORK  Dec 13 (Reuters) - Hilton Hotels Corp. HLT.N
forecast strong profit growth for the next three years on
Wednesday and laid out plans to add about 120,000 rooms to its
system, focusing on international expansion.  The outlook, which follows an upbeat forecast by Marriott
International Inc. MAR.N in October, signals that hoteliers
expect growth to continue despite concerns about a slowing U.S.
economy and a jump in hotel openings, analysts said.  "Hilton's outlook through 2009 confirms our view that the
hotel business should remain strong for the next 2-3 years,"
CIBC World Markets analyst David Katz said in a research note.  "Hilton's position in the world market should continue to
improve," Katz said.  Hilton, operator of the Hilton, Conrad and Hampton Inn
chains, said it expects recurring earnings per share to
increase 16 percent to 22 percent annually through 2009.  "We are in the early stages of a global travel boom," Chief
Operating Officer Matthew Hart said at an investor meeting in
New York after the company released its outlook.  Hilton does not expect profit margins at hotels that it
owns to return to their peak of around 35 percent for another
two or three years as the company grapples with property
insurance and other rising costs, Hart told Reuters.  But investor demand remains strong for hotel assets, which
is allowing Hilton to carry out its strategy of selling
properties while retaining management contracts, he said.  "Margins are becoming less of a driver for us," Hart said,
noting that the company at the end of this year will have, for
the first time, generated more money from fee income than from
owned properties.  Hilton forecast earnings of about $1.70 to $2.00 per share
in 2009, assuming 7 percent to 9 percent compound annual growth
in revenue per available room.  One analyst is looking for 2009 recurring earnings of $1.85
per share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Hilton expects earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization to rise at a compound annual rate of 11
percent to 14 percent through 2009, while operating income
could increase 12 percent to 17 percent.  The Americas now account for about 90 percent of the
company's hotel development pipeline, but in the longer-term
more growth is expected outside of the United States, Hilton
brand development president Tom Keltner said.  Hilton's shares rose 80 cents, or 2.4 percent, to close at
$34.37 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded
in a 52-week range of $34.29 to $22.26.  Hilton, which earlier this year bought the hotel operations
of its British namesake allowing it to expand globally, said it
expects international markets, including India and China, to
contribute a gradually increasing percentage to room growth.  Hilton now has about 495,000 rooms in its system globally.  Hilton, which makes about 70 percent of its profit in the
Americas now, expects the Asia-Pacific region to grow the
fastest, Hart said.  "India has over 1.1 billion people, a middle class of 300
million -- the same as the U.S., and fewer hotel rooms than
Orlando, Florida," Keltner said.  Hilton's late start in international expansion means it has
a bigger opportunity relative to competitors like Marriott and
Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ( HOT.N ), he said.  Hilton also affirmed its 2007 outlook, forecasting revenue
per available room -- a key measure of the health of the
lodging industry -- rising about 7 percent to 9 percent.  (Additional reporting by Deena Beasley in Los Angeles)
