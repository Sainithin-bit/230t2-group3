 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - U.S. home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) is to buy no more than a 50 percent stake in Chinese furnishing chain HomeWay, making its first foray into retailing in China, a source familiar with the situation said. 

 Under a deal to be announced later on Wednesday, Atlanta-based Home Depot holds an option to raise its stake to take ownership and management control of the Chinese firm, the source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Privately owned HomeWay Co. Ltd., based in the eastern port city of Tianjin, plans to use part of the proceeds from Home Depot to pay down debts owed to its suppliers, the source added. Home Depot, which only has sourcing operations in China, would announce the deal with HomeWay in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon, another source said. Home Depot previously failed to buy bigger Chinese chain store Orient Home, the first source added. The HomeWay acquisition is part of intensified takeover activity in the fast-growing Chinese retail sector. British supermarket chain Tesco ( TSCO.L ) said on Tuesday it was increasing its stake in Chinese retailer Hymall. Buying domestic firms is viewed as the quickest way to ramp up operations and obtain good retail space, which is becoming scarce as more firms enter the Chinese DIY market, valued by Euromonitor at 195 billion yuan ($24.9 billion) in 2004. "When you've got a big retailer that's fairly dominant in the biggest market in the world, like most dominant retailers around the world, they're looking to expand in China," said Paul McKenzie, head of consumer research with CLSA in Hong Kong. "A lot of companies have figured out it's easier to buy into some existing chains rather than do things organically themselves." The top 100 retail firms account for only 10 percent of the industry in China, Ernst & Young has said, valuing last year's mergers and acquisitions in the Chinese retail sector at 11.1 billion yuan ($1.4 billion). China's first M&A regulations, launched on September 8, should help increase transparency and boost growth in such deals, Ernst & Young said. Home Depot has been looking to set up shop in China for at least two years, and has been vying with do-it-yourself firm B&Q, part of Britain's top home improvement retailer Kingfisher Plc. ( KGF.L ), to acquire Chinese retailers. B&Q, which bought the Chinese operations of German rival OBI in April, is on track to having 60 stores in China by the end of this year and 100 by 2010. Chinese media have long speculated that Home Depot was negotiating to acquire a stake in HomeWay or Orient Home. Both Home Depot and HomeWay declined on Wednesday to comment on the information. Details about HomeWay, such as the number of stores it has and its past financial performance, were not immediately available. The Financial Times said on Monday Home Depot was planning to spend $100 million to buy a majority stake in a Chinese retailer. Citing people close to the deal, the newspaper said the retailer would unveil a deal for a stake in HomeWay this week. (Additional reporting by Alfred Cang in Shanghai) ($1=7.8255 Yuan)
