 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. asset managers are sitting on a 
potential gold mine of new assets held by soon-to-retire 
Americans but they have to be more innovative to cash in, 
according to a new study. 

  Roughly 71 million American baby boomers control an 
estimated $8.4 trillion in assets that may soon be shifted to 
retail individual retirement accounts from company pension and 
401(k) plans, a study by Boston Consulting Group found.  To lay claim to that money however, asset managers must 
enhance the services they provide to clients by redefining 
their product portfolios, broadening their advisory capacity, 
investing in more customer service and diligently keeping up 
with regulatory changes, the consultants wrote.  For the traditionally conservative $10 trillion mutual fund 
industry, that may mean a significant changes lie ahead.  "Ultimately, the players that choose to be aggressive will 
need to make significant investments in areas that may be 
unfamiliar today," said Andy Maguire, a Boston Consulting Group 
director and lead author of the study released on Wednesday. 
"Those institutions that succeed will display the strongest 
ability to build and nurture relationships over the long term 
-- across the lifetime of today's clients and beyond."  As the industry is poised to change, traditional actively 
managed equity, bond and money market funds will come under 
special pressure, the consultants found.  The fast-growing $1.3 trillion hedge fund industry is 
expected to grow by 15 percent annually as these lightly 
regulated portfolios are integrated into mainstream investing, 
the consultants said.
