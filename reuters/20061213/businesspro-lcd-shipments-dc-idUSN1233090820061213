 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Computer maker Dell Inc. DELL.O 
saw its LCD monitor shipments drop in the third quarter from 
three months earlier as consumers went after wider, standalone 
monitors, research firm DisplaySearch said on Tuesday. 

  "A lot more people are upgrading to wide but they are not 
going to PC makers," analyst Chris Connery told Reuters, adding 
that stand-alone monitor makers did better during upgrade 
cycles.  Consumers focused purchases on companies including Samsung 
Electronics Co. Ltd, ( 005930.KS ), Acer Inc.( 2353.TW ) and LG 
Electronics Inc.( 066570.KS ), Connery said.  PC maker Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ). managed 20 percent 
growth in the third quarter compared with the second, but the 
biggest gains were not seen by PC makers, Connery said.  Dell kept the number one spot with 16.8 percent of the 
market as shipments slipped 3 percent from the previous quarter 
to 5.8 million.  Samsung shipments rose 41 percent to 4.7 million, followed 
by HP with 20 percent growth to 3.4 million, Acer with a 49 
percent rise to 3.1 million and LG Electronics with 62 percent 
growth to 2.3 million, the research company said.  The entire LCD display market grew 16 percent to 34.6 
million units, with about 40 percent of that increase from wide 
displays shaped similarly to movie screens.  On a revenue basis, Dell dropped 9 percent to $1.7 billion, 
while Samsung rose 33 percent to $1.3 billion and HP gained 11 
percent to $897 million. Acer rose 41 percent to $805 million 
and LG rose 49 percent to $594 million.
