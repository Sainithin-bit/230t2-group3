 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were flat on Wednesday as renewed concerns about the outlook for interest rates swept away early gains racked up on news of strong retail sales and a flurry of takeover activity. 

 The Dow industrials soared to a record intraday high at 12,368.61 after the opening, but the surge encouraged investors to lock in profits. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) was among the retailers leading the gains. Traders said stronger-than-expected November U.S. retail sales growth probably would diminish chances of a cut in interest rates any time soon after the Federal Reserve kept benchmark rates unchanged at its latest policy meeting on Tuesday.

There is not a lot of driving force to send the market either way right now," said Todd Clark, director of stock trading at Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 7.37 points, or 0.06 percent, at 12,308.21. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up just 0.73 of a point, or 0.05 percent, at 1,412.29. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 3.61 points, or 0.15 percent, at 2,427.99. The S&P Retail Index .RLX was up 0.4 percent. Wal-Mart's stock was up nearly 1 percent at $45.88 on the New York Stock Exchange. It ranked among the stocks limiting the Dow's decline. Wal-Mart also was among the stocks helping the S&P 500 stay in positive territory. Friday's release of the U.S. Consumer Price Index for November is likely to be the next major data catalyst for the stock market, Clark said. But until then, volume may be thin and trading may lack strong direction, he added. Deal news gave some support to the market. Sources familiar with the situation said UAL Corp.'s UAUA.O United Airlines and Continental Airlines CAL.N have held preliminary talks about a possible merger. <ID:nN13432108>. UAL shares rose 5.3 percent to $45.50 on Nasdaq and Continental's stock gained 4.7 percent to $44.90 on the NYSE. Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) shares rose 1.2 percent to $77.17, giving the biggest lift to both the Dow and the S&P 500 index. U.S. crude oil for January delivery CLF7 rose 35 cents to settle at $61.37 a barrel, after government inventory data showed a decline in crude stockpiles in the latest week.
