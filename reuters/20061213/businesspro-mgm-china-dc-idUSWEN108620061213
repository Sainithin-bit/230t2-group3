 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hotel and casino company MGM Mirage 
Inc. ( MGM.N ) said on Wednesday it is in advanced talks with 
Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing to create a joint venture 
to develop non-gaming luxury hotels and resorts globally. 

  MGM Mirage and Diaoyutai would target initially locations 
in China, MGM Mirage said, adding that a definitive agreement 
is expected in the first quarter of 2007.  This is the second such announcement this month by MGM 
Mirage, the No. 2 U.S. gambling company. The company said last 
week it was in discussions to create a joint venture with Abu 
Dhabi's Mubadala Development Co. to develop non-gaming luxury 
hotels globally.  MGM and Mubadala have signed a memorandum of understanding 
with an aim to create a joint venture by the first quarter of 
2007 to build hotels beginning in Abu Dhabi, Las Vegas and 
Britain. Mubadala Development is wholly owned by the government 
of Abu Dhabi.  "We believe these initiatives ... are a smart way for MGM 
to meaningfully enhance its brand in mainland China and cross 
market mainland Chinese gaming and resort patrons into LV 
Strip," Bear Stearns analyst Joseph Greff wrote in a research 
note.
