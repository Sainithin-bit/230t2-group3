 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two analysts lowered their 2007 
earnings estimates for the largest soft-drink bottlers on 
Wednesday, citing probable price increases of the beverage 
concentrate they buy from Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) and PepsiCo Inc. 
( PEP.N ). 

  Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg and Goldman Sachs 
analyst Judy Hong cut their estimates on Coca-Cola Enterprises 
Inc. ( CCE.N ) and Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N to reflect 
what Swartzberg called "recent indications of 
greater-than-expected concentrate cost increases next year."  Industry publication Beverage Digest recently reported that 
Coke Enterprises will pay about 4.5 percent to 6 percent more 
for concentrate in 2007, and that Pepsi Bottling will pay about 
3.7 percent more.  "We believe investors should avoid or take short positions 
in the U.S.-based bottling stocks heading into fourth-quarter 
results and 2007 guidance," said Hong in a research note. She 
forecast that Coke Enterprises and Pepsi Bottling, along with 
Pepsi Americas Inc. PAS.N and Cott Corp. ( BCB.TO ), would come 
in an average of 5 percent below current consensus estimates.  Hong cited "a combination of still-high aluminum prices, 
rising corn prices (used to make the sweetener high-fructose 
corn syrup), sizable concentrate price increases and soft 
demand."  Hong also raised her earnings estimates for Coke and Pepsi, 
due to the concentrate price increases and profit boosts from 
current foreign exchange rates.  Coke shares were up 6 cents at $48.96 and Pepsi shares were 
up 19 cents at $63.04, both on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Coke Enterprises was down 16 cents at $20.41 while Pepsi 
Bottling was down 12 cents at $31.92.
