 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ritchie Capital Management LLC, a large Chicago-based hedge fund group, on Wednesday said it is in talks to sell its main Multi-Strategy Global fund in a deal that it said could be worth $1 billion, according to a spokesman. 

 Ritchie, which has suffered from heavy investor demands for capital return amid lackluster performance, said it canceled a restructuring agreement that it forged with a committee representing investors in October. Ritchie spokesman Justin Meise said the firm "concluded that it was impractical to implement the restructuring" of its flagship fund. Ritchie listed assets of $2.8 billion as of October, with its flagship fund holding about $730 million as of August. Meise said the fund is currently negotiating with a party to buy the multi-strategy fund assets, but that the agreement could still allow Ritchie to manage the fund after the sale. He said an agreement could be reached in "a month or two," but declined to discuss further details. Ritchie in October forged an agreement with its institutional and high net-worth clients that would create two new classes of shares. One class would be allowed to redeem funds invested over 2.5 years and another had a 3.25 year lockup, Ritchie said. The agreement was aimed at allowing Ritchie to hang on to some investor capital as it struggles to reverse poor trading performance. It is unclear why the plan failed. "We have decided to terminate the restructuring and effect an orderly disposition of assets in the general portfolio in the multi-strategy fund," Ritchie told investors in a letter that was sent out Tuesday night. Meise said the investor committee, whose members he wouldn't name, approved the decision to cancel the restructuring plan and proceed with a sale. The move comes as Ritchie has cut back on trading strategies, including energy, where it once was heavily invested. The firm also invests in reinsurance through an offshore subsidiary called Ritchie Risk Link, similar to its cross-town Chicago rival Citadel Investment Group, which analysts said is a plausible buyer for the multi-strategy fund assets.
