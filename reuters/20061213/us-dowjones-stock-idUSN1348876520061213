 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N rose on Wednesday after the company reported November advertising revenue at The Wall Street Journal that two analysts said was higher than expected. 

 The company's stock rose about 3.5 percent on Wednesday. Dow Jones, which also publishes Barron's, the Marketwatch.com Web site and several daily newspapers, reported on Tuesday a 3.6-percent advertising revenue gain at The Wall Street Journal in November on a 4.8-percent drop in linage, the space the paper devotes to ads. Like other publishers, Dow Jones is facing weaker advertising trends at some of its products, as well as falling circulation. Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Ginocchio said the result was better than expected, and that the company is on track to hit his fourth-quarter estimate of 46 cents a share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates are expecting 42 cents a share on average. "With nearly all of the uncertainty now out of 2006, we think the market will start to focus on the robust outlook Dow Jones has for 2007, and the shares should trade up accordingly," Ginocchio wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. Ginocchio also said Dow Jones is trading at a multiple of 9.6 times enterprise value to estimated 2007 EBITDA, or earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization. That is above its newspaper peers at 8.8 times, he wrote. "In our view, DJ's superior growth profile for the next several years warrants a premium to the group," he wrote. Citigroup analyst William Bird raised his fourth-quarter estimate on Dow Jones by 2 cents to 42 cents a share because of better-than-expected November ad revenue growth and "a respectable start to December." Bird also raised the company's price target to $39 from $34 based on his estimate increase, he wrote on Wednesday. Shares closed up $1.29 to $38.56 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. That is short of its 52-week high of $41.39 on March 14, but up from $32.16 on September19.
