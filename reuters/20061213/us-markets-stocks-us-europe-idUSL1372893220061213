 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks are poised to push higher at the start of Wednesday trade, buoyed by a batch of merger activity, as investors shake off cautionary comments from the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

 AirTran Holdings AAI.N will be closely watched after launching a proposal to buy Midwest Air Group MEH.A, while media reports said UAL Corp.'s UAUA.O United Airlines is in preliminary merger talks with Continental Airlines CAL.N. By 1019 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening up 0.2 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. "Toward the end of the year the market will move sideways and we won't see many triggers," said Johan Van Der Biest, a fund manager at Dexia. "Consensus is more and more that the economy will indeed slow down but not to the extent the Fed needs to cut interest rates immediately." U.S. stocks fell on Tuesday after disappointing earnings from electronics chain Best Buy Inc. ( BBY.N ) and a weak forecast from steel maker Nucor Inc. ( NUE.N ) dented confidence in the outlooks for the holiday shopping season and corporate profits. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 12.90 points, or 0.10 percent, to close at 12,315.58. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  dipped 0.10 percent and Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 0.5 percent. The Federal Reserve left benchmark rates unchanged, as expected, but gave a dour view of the slowdown in the housing market. No S&P500 companies are scheduled to post earnings, while on the economic front, November U.S. retail sales are due for release at 1330 GMT. MERGER TALK In corporate news, AirTran said it had made a proposal to buy its rival Midwest Air in a deal that would value the company at $11.25 a share in cash and stock. In other merger developments, the New York Times and Wall Street Journal both reported on their websites the preliminary merger talks between United Airlines and Continental which could potentially create one of the world's top 10 airlines. Elsewhere, U.S. home improvement retailer Home Depot ( HD.N ) is to buy no more than a 50 percent stake in Chinese furnishing chain HomeWay in a deal to be announced later on Wednesday, a source familiar with the situation said. Under the deal, Atlanta-based Home Depot holds an option to raise its stake to take ownership and management control of the Chinese firm, the source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters. Shares in Cooper Cos ( COO.N ) are set to drop after sliding 10 percent in extended-hours as the supplier of eye-care products and surgical instruments reported quarterly earnings that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Martek Biosciences MATK.O shares are likely to gain after the stock rose 4.5 percent in extended-hours trade after its earnings beat analysts estimates. Elsewhere, Tribune Co. TRB.N will be in play after the New York Times reported on its Web that the Chandler family, a major Tribune shareholder, has begun holding talks with several private equity firms about forming a consortium to bid for part of the group.
