 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S.-based investment bank Citigroup 
( C.N ) has agreed to buy wealth manager Quilter from rival 
Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) as it seeks to expand in the UK, the 
companies said on Wednesday. 

  Quilter manages assets worth more than 5.6 billion pounds 
($11 billion), has 18,000 clients and employs 300 staff, said 
the companies, which did not disclose details of the 
transaction such as the price paid by Citigroup.  "Quilter is an important step in establishing a meaningful 
presence in the UK, with an excellent platform to support the 
further growth of our Private Bank and international Smith 
Barney businesses," said Todd Thomson, Chairman and CEO of 
Citigroup Global Wealth Management, in the Citigroup statement.  Citigroup said it plans to fuse Quilter into its CWA unit.
