 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Google Inc may make an announcement next Monday about whether it will pull out from China, the China Business News reported on Friday, quoting an unnamed Google employee. 

 The report also said a local authorized agent had received unconfirmed information that Google would leave China on April 10. "I have received information saying that Google will leave China on April 10, but this information has not at present been confirmed by Google," the agent was quoted as saying. Google officials were not immediately available for comment. Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt said last week he hoped to have an outcome soon from talks with Chinese officials on offering an uncensored search engine in the country.
