 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the second-largest U.S. bank, paid Chief Executive Jamie Dimon $1.32 million in salary and extra compensation in 2009, according to the company's proxy filing. 

 The figure excludes some $16 million in stock and bonds he received this year, based on 2009 performance. Wall Street compensation has faced sharp public criticism since U.S. taxpayers bailed out financial firms reeling from the 2008 crisis. JPMorgan last summer returned the $25 billion it received from the Treasury. Dimon's 2009 salary was $1 million, according to the proxy. He received an additional $322,094 in deferred earnings and other forms of compensation. (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
