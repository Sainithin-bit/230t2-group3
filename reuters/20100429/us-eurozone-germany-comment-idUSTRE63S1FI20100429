 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said talks between European Union officials, the IMF and Athens over a rescue plan for Greece should be accelerated, and has pledged to defend the euro currency. 

 Polls show a majority of Germans oppose helping Athens and politicians including Merkel have raised questions about whether Greece should have been allowed to join the euro zone. Following are extracts from editorials and articles in influential German newspapers on Greece from Thursday: BILD (Center-right, mass-circulation) "25,000,000,000 euros! Greeks want even more billions from us. The German government will apparently make available 25 billion euros for three years -- until now the talk was for 'only' 8.4 billion euros....Shock for European taxpayers. Greece apparently needs a lot more money than previously assumed...The financial requirement of the overly indebted country is 135 billion euros to 2012, according to Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle...Greece is turning out to be a bottomless pit." "Our government keeps a tight hand on the till most of the time when money is involved. We apparently don't have any money for tax cuts, for pre-school or daycare centres. We don't have money to keep our city parks in order. We don't have money to repair the potholes in our roads...and we don't have money for pension increases. But suddenly our political leaders find billions of euros for Greeks who for years were living over their means and cheated their way into the euro." FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG (conservative) "Whoever thinks the Greece crisis is a currency or financial problem, is coming up far too short, and could therefore end up falling into an abyss. It's not just about a country which cheated its way into economic and monetary union (which everyone knew) and now can't live with it. The risk of chain reaction caused by the markets which could hit Portugal, Spain, Italy or Ireland...is not the biggest danger on the horizon. This is ultimately about the whole of the project "Europe." This is already obvious from talk about advantages and disadvantages of a country exiting or being thrown out of the euro area. "In this situation, Germany carries particular responsibility...because economic and monetary union was forced to make reunified Germany compatible with EU treaties and to make European integration "irreversible" (Helmut Kohl). "The Greek crisis shows mercilessly that the EU has overreached itself in preceding decades. Once the current difficulties have been overcome -- in one way or another -- Europe needs real time to reflect." SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG (Center-left) "Let the Greeks solve their own problems, they shouldn't get our money. This seems to be how most Germans think. This is what the initial polls suggest, and the politicians suspected it before. Just this weekend, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called the aid into question, Chancellor Angela Merkel played for time and Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle went on the attack at a party congress. And this despite the fact all three had approved aid measures at EU level a long time ago." "Behind this zigzag course lies the fear that the tabloids could take control of the issue. The barrage from Bild has already begun. Conservative papers at the very least are toying with the idea of making the Greeks think about exiting the euro. "The government's approach is doing great damage. It's panicked the markets and aggravated the crisis. Bit by bit, Greece is sliding into the abyss. On top of this, the government is getting under more and more pressure on the foreign policy front. The ugly German is becoming visible again..." "The government is gambling out of a mixture of fear and self-confidence. It's gambling over power in North Rhine-Westphalia, over the size of the aid payments, over the conditions. Taking a critical approach to the complex rescue process is something you would expect from one of the world's most important economic powers. But it needs to be credible -- credible in the way the old European Helmut Kohl once was. His successors are on the way to squandering that legacy." HANDELSBLATT (business) "Now that politicians, particularly Chancellor Angela Merkel, have inflamed speculation on financial markets for long enough with half-hearted assurances and suggestions they could still pull the plug, the only way out is to take the bull by the horns. That means agreeing an aid package big enough to ensure Greece can get through the markets without having to refinance." "Greece's debt burden must be cut to make it sustainable. In some form or other this will mean that creditors will have to do without billions. To protect the taxpayer, Germany should therefore insist that EU-debts are subordinated to those of the International Monetary Fund, but ahead of private creditors." "It's vital proceedings are carried out properly and under IMF leadership. Germany must also take a tough line in talks on how any additional burdens are shared out. If we face the question of which banks have the biggest liabilities, the French would have to shoulder the most, not the Germans." (Compiled by Dave Graham and Erik Kirschbaum)
