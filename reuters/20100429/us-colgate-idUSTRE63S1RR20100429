 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) posted a sharp rise in sales, but profit fell as it took a hefty charge to account for hyper-inflation in Venezuela. 

 The toothpaste maker said its results bode well for another year of double-digit earnings-per-share growth in 2010. Colgate earned $357 million, or 69 cents per share, versus a profit of $508 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding the charge related to Venezuela, profit rose to $628 million, or $1.21 per share. Sales rose 9.5 percent to $3.83 billion, while the volume of goods sold rose 6 percent. Colgate is about one-fifth the size of Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ), which also will report quarterly results on Thursday. (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
