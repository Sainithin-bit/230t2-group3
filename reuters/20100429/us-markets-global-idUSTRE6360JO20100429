 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global markets staged a relief rally on Thursday as Greece's move to enact severe austerity measures to secure an aid package eased fears that the debt crisis will spread across Europe, boosting the euro and fueling the biggest jump in equities since early March. 

 Risk premiums eased and oil prices rose above $85 a barrel as a potential resolution of Greece's persistent debt problems appeared within grasp. Officials from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund were in Athens to negotiate the bailout and wrap up a deal within days. Another dose of strong corporate results and further signs of economic recovery lifted global equities more than 1 percent after two days of losses. Oil rallied to a two-week high. MSCI's all-country world index of stocks .MIWD00000PUS rose 1.2 percent in the biggest single-day percentage gain since March 5. Major U.S. indices also rose the most since then, while the Nasdaq posted its biggest jump since January 4. "At least for today we have had some respite from this whole fear thing of the contagion of sovereign debt," said Dan Cook, senior market analyst at IG Markets in Chicago. Uncertainty over the size and timing of an aid package for Greece has weighed on markets for weeks. Concerns of spreading sovereign credit risk jumped this week when Standard & Poor's slashed Greece's ratings to junk status. S&P also downgraded Portugal on Tuesday and on Wednesday cut Spain's rating one notch, sparking the latest bout of investor fear that Greece could default on its debt. The euro rose for a second day, gaining 0.3 percent at $1.3244 after earlier rising as high as $1.3280, according to Reuters data. "The market sees a bigger package for Greece, covering three years, as a bigger backstop," said Kenneth Broux, market economist at Lloyds Banking Group in London. "This is helping to address some investor fears and giving some support for the euro." German politicians have said aid to Greece could be worth 100-120 billion euros ($133-160 billion) over three years, against an original plan for 45 billion euros of aid in 2010. A string of better-than-expected earnings reports drove Wall Street higher, led by Motorola Inc MOT.N, Visa Inc ( V.N ) and Aetna Inc ( AET.N ), among others. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 122.05 points, or 1.10 percent, to 11,167.32. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 15.42 points, or 1.29 percent, to 1,206.78. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 40.19 points, or 1.63 percent, to 2,511.92. The Federal Reserve's positive view of the U.S. economy on Wednesday added to improved sentiment. A better-than-expected rise in euro zone economic sentiment in April, which could boost consumer spending and consumption, also boosted investors' appetite for risk. In the United States, data showing the number of U.S. workers submitting new claims for unemployment benefits fell slightly last week drew mixed views, as it implied only a gradual labor market improvement. Crude for June delivery settled up $1.95, or 2.3 percent, at $85.17 a barrel. In London, the ICE Brent June crude ended 74 cents higher, or 0.86 percent, at $86.90. Long-dated U.S. Treasuries edged up to session highs after strong demand for a 7-year note sale ended a week of record issuance on a solid note. The auction of $32 billion of seven-year notes was the fourth and final of this week's $129 billion worth of coupon-paying securities, all of which overcame market uncertainty amid a Fed meeting and euro zone fiscal crisis. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 9/32 in price to yield 3.73 percent. Gold prices were largely flat after reaching near five-month highs in the previous session as a flight to safety fizzled. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled down $3 at $1,168.80 an ounce in New York. Copper prices slid to their lowest levels in 1-1/2-months in New York on concerns about near-term demand deterioration in China. The MSCI index of Asian stocks outside of Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was off 0.1 percent, while Japanese markets were closed for the start of the country's long Golden Week holiday.
