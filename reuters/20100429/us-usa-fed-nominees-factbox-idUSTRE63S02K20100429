 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Thursday nominated San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen, an experienced central banker and renowned labor-market-focused dove, to be Fed vice chairman. 

 He also tapped a state bank regulator and an MIT economist to fill two open seats on the Fed's board. The following is a brief outline of the backgrounds of the three nominees, who will need to win Senate confirmation: JANET YELLEN Currently president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, Yellen is a top-flight economist with a long history of public service. She worked for President Bill Clinton as chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers between 1997 and 1999, and was a governor on the Federal Reserve Board in Washington between 1994 and 1997. Yellen, who is widely respected within the Fed system, academia and by financial markets, is seen as being on the dovish wing of Fed policymakers in terms of how she views the risks of inflation compared with unemployment. In contrast with some policymakers who worry the Fed's extensive easy money policies could stoke inflation, she backs keeping rates low for a while to make sure the tentative recovery gets off the ground. "Even as we applaud the economic turnaround, it's important not to lose sight of just how fragile this recovery is and how far we yet have to go before things return to normal," she said earlier this month. The Fed's mandate is to hold prices low and stable, while ensuring the highest level of sustainable U.S. employment. There is ample scope to come to different judgments about the best interest rate stance to reach this objective. Hawks tend to view higher interest rates, slower growth and lower levels of employment as a price worth paying for keeping inflation at bay. Doves take a more lenient view of inflation if it means stronger employment growth, or are less liable to generate alarming forecasts for inflation as they estimate future growth and price-pressures. SARAH RASKIN Raskin is currently Maryland's commissioner of financial regulation. She would bring bank oversight abilities and experience to the U.S. central bank as the Obama administration seeks to strengthen consumer protection against the sort of financial products blamed for the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, which tipped the economy into a severe recession when the housing market collapsed. Trained as an attorney, she has testified frequently on financial consumer and regulatory issues before Congress. She has chaired the legislative committee of a national organization of state bank supervisors. In her capacity as a state official, she has sometimes chafed at the heavy-handedness of federal authorities over states. While lawmakers are considering giving a federal agency -- possibly the Federal Reserve -- or group of agencies authority to supervise systemwide risks, Raskin has argued that state authorities should also continue to play a role in policing risks across the financial system. She warned in 2009 that the Obama administration's plan to spend tens of billions of dollars to help distressed homeowners modify mortgages could put money in the pockets of unscrupulous lenders charging stiff fees to restructure loans. Raskin was managing director at Promontory Financial Group, a financial consulting group, and banking counsel at the U.S. Senate Banking Committee. She also worked at the New York Federal Reserve Bank and the congressional Joint Economic Committee. In testimony before the panel overseeing the government's bank bailout last year, Raskin called for stronger consumer focus from regulators and backed breaking up banks that have become too large. "The current crisis is the result of well over a decade's worth of policies that promoted consolidation, uniformity, preemption and the needs of the global marketplace over those of the individual consumer," she said in January 2009. PETER DIAMOND An economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Diamond has written extensively on taxation and pension reform. He would add a consumer-focused voice to the Fed at a time lawmakers are debating whether to strip the central bank of its consumer protection role. His 2004 book, "Saving Social Security," was co-authored with Peter Orszag, now director of Obama's Office of Management and Budget. Diamond, a former president of the American Economic Association, is known as a proponent of behavioral economics, which studies why people do not always make rational decisions. He has frequently consulted on panels examining the future of Social Security, the government-backed pension system.
