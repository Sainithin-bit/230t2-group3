 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, on Wednesday said its quarterly net loss widened on higher fuel costs and economic uncertainty would force more capacity cuts in 2009. 

 The company said its fourth-quarter net loss was $340 million, or $1.22 per share, compared with $69 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, AMR said it lost $214 million, or 77 cents per share, compared with Wall Street forecasts for a loss of 73 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Special items included a $23 million charge related to aircraft groundings and capacity cuts as well as a noncash pension settlement charge of $103 million. The airline industry, including AMR, made hefty capacity cuts in the fourth quarter to offset volatile fuel prices and to bolster fares as demand sagged in a weak economy. AMR said it paid 8 percent more for fuel in the fourth quarter of 2008 than it did in the year-ago period. The company said it expects its mainline capacity to decrease more than 8.5 percent in the first quarter amid economic uncertainty. The company reported revenue of $5.47 billion, down 3.8 percent. AMR said it ended the quarter with $3.6 billion in cash and short-tern investments. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
