 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Regulators are examining Apple Inc's disclosures about Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs' health problems to ensure investors were not misled, Bloomberg said, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission's review does not mean investigators have seen evidence of wrongdoing, the person told Bloomberg. The person declined to be identified because the inquiry is not public, the news service reported. Both the SEC and Apple declined to comment on the matter. Jobs, who earlier had said he had an easily treatable "hormonal imbalance," said last week his problems were "more complex" than originally thought, and he would take a medical leave of absence for six months. In 2004, Jobs was treated for a rare type of pancreatic cancer called an islet-cell, or neuroendocrine, tumor. Such tumors can be benign or malignant, but they usually grow slowly and are far less deadly than most pancreatic tumors.
