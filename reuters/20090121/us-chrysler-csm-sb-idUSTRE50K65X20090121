 DETROIT  (Reuters) - An alliance with Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) gives Chrysler access to crucial small car platforms, but the U.S. automaker still faces a funding issue at a time when auto sales remain at decade lows, a leading industry consulting firm said on Wednesday. 

 Italy's Fiat said on Tuesday it would be given a 35 percent stake in Chrysler LLC in exchange for access to technology and overseas markets in a deal where no cash exchanged hands. The alliance gives Chrysler a key partner at a time when it tries to revamp its truck-heavy vehicle lineup and meet new U.S. fuel economy mandates, influential industry forecasting firm CSM Worldwide said. But the lack of cash infusion from Fiat will offer little relief to Chrysler, which is struggling to survive a deep downturn in sales at a time when it and rivals are all burning cash, CSM said. Chrysler's sales tumbled 30 percent in 2008 and it ended the year with only $2 billion in cash and reliant on a government bailout to keep it afloat. It received a $4 billion government bailout in December and is seeking another $3 billion in government loans. "Chrysler still has a cash flow issue." Michael Robinet, analyst at CSM, said in a report. "Despite the access to new technologies, Cerberus will still have to fund the interim period between now and when Fiat-developed Chrysler products could be introduced." Chrysler, which owns the Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands, is 80.1 percent owned by Cerberus, which paid $7.4 billion for its stake in 2007. The remaining stake is held by its former parent, Germany's Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ). Other automakers, such as Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ), could also try to forge an alliance with Chrysler, Robinet said. "Daimler's 19.9 percent stake is still in play and other automakers could find Chrysler's larger vehicle platforms and the Jeep brand to be strategic puzzle pieces in the future," he said. Daimler has written down the value of its remaining 19.9 percent stake in Chrysler to zero. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
