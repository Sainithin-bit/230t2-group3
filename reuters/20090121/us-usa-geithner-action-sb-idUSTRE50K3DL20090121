 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy Geithner on Wednesday said forceful action was needed to combat the U.S. recession and urged reform of the government's $700 billion financial rescue program. 

 "Our test is to act with the strength, speed and care necessary to get our economy back on track," Geithner said in testimony prepared for delivery at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. The panel has jurisdiction over his nomination, which must be approved by the full Senate. In his testimony, Geithner said the Treasury-run financial rescue package needs "serious reform." He pledged measures to ensure credit flows to consumers and businesses, but stopped short of offering specifics on how the program might be overhauled. "We have to fundamentally reform this program to ensure that there is enough credit available to support recovery," he said. Geithner, currently head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, said the financial system needed stronger protections for consumers and investors, and said policy-makers needed more-effective tools to prevent future crises. The Treasury nominee made no mention of his failure to pay certain taxes while he was employed at the International Monetary Fund earlier this decade, an issue that has clouded his nomination.
