 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, told Congress on Wednesday forceful action was needed to combat the recession and he vowed to overhaul the government's $700 billion financial rescue program. 

 KEY POINTS: * Treasury Secretary nominee Geithner says tax return mistakes were careless, avoidable, unintentional * Geithner says President Obama will lay out economic stabilization plan in next few weeks COMMENTS: ROGER KUBARYCH, CHIEF US ECONOMIST, UNICREDIT MARKETS AND  INVESTMENT BANKING, NEW YORK: "To expect that Timothy Geithner or any one else in the new team would have a comprehensive plan to revert this crisis in less than 24 hours after the start of the new administration, is a cheap shot. It is true that the team was formed a couple of months ago and they've been tackling the issue but people forget this is a new Congress and any plan needs to be approved by the very same senators that are now grilling Geithner." "Geithner shouldn't have been careless with the taxes. But he paid it back and apologized for making such mistake. His sincerity and his skills are credible enough to have someone of the stature of Paul Volcker issue a letter supporting him. That is something." DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY: "Certainly we saw an initial rebound this morning with hope that indeed Mr. Geithner was going to be confirmed. Basically that is what Wall Street wants because his learning curve is the most horizontal of the candidates out there. The endorsement by Paul Volcker, considered the senior statesman by all bankers throughout the world is considered meaningful. "Some of that initial goodwill has seemed to dissipate from the equity market as prices recede. As this confirmation hearing goes on it does underscore to all market participants how controversial this decision has been. "The flipside is that he has been very much involved in the decisions made to date, which quite frankly have left us with still tremendous concern and fear as to the health of the banking system." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Geithner doesn't want to offend anyone or  tip his hand. As a finance professional, he knows that fixing foreclosures is chipping at a big rock where as shoring up financial institutions amounts to opening a very tightly shut faucet of credit to the financial markets. It's a vicious cycle. Lenders don't lend so housing prices fall so lenders have new reasons not to lend. But the cycle can be broken at any stage and it is most effective to shore up the financial institutions to keep the flow of credit going. The problem is that these toxic assets weaken the ability of financial institutions to lend to anybody, not just to impaired borrowers." RUDY NARVAS, SENIOR ANALYST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "He is toeing the line, which is expected. The committee wants to hear that further bailouts or the TARP needs better management. They also want to hear things (about) Treasury further attempts to unlock the credit markets, but more important is the housing market. The credit markets don't vote but homeowners do. Doing what they can to spur activity in the housing sector is going to be critical and what he proposes -- which we are not sure of -- is going to be very important." RONALD HERMANCE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, HUDSON CITY BANCORP, NEW JERSEY: "The market wanted to hear more, and perhaps he's waiting for the president to speak. The market may have had too much expectation for what Geithner might do. I think the market wanted a Geithner rally and it's not happening." JESSICA HOVERSEN, FIXED INCOME MARKET ANALYST, MF GLOBAL RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "The market does not like political instability, and his hearing has thrown a monkey wrench to a smooth transition. And his post is one of more important roles in the new Administration. We need political and economic leadership and people will turn to Geithner." BRET BARKER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, METROPOLITAN WEST ASSET MANAGEMENT, LOS ANGELES: "Geithner said Obama's economic plan will come in the 'next few weeks' and I think people are hoping for an immediate package now but the fear is that it could take it could take two to three months." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "If Geithner does not get approved, then the market will have a big sell off and bonds will rally." "Stocks will fall because the Treasury and therefore TARP is without leadership. Bonds rally because of further delay in deficit spending." WARD MCCARTHY, MANAGING DIRECTOR, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "My sense of things is that they are doing the due diligence, but they are still going to approve him -- but the markets seem to be very anxious about that. Equities dropped and the Treasury market has responded favorably right across the curve." "The financial markets and the economy will go nowhere until the financial system comes off life support and I don't think that will happen until we directly address the issue of toxic assets." "Regarding the aggregate bank to accumulate bad bank assets, I don't think they can do that too soon." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes pare gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices halve losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar falls to session low against the yen.
