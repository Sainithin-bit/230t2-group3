 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate Finance Committee plans to vote on Thursday on the nomination of Timothy Geithner to serve as Treasury secretary under President Barack Obama, the panel said on Wednesday. 

 The vote is scheduled for 10 a.m. ET a day after he was questioned by the panel about how the Obama administration planned to boost the struggling economy. Geithner also apologized to lawmakers for "careless mistakes" in underpaying his personal income taxes, which have cast a cloud over his nomination.
