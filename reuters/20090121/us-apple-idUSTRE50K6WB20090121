 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc's quarterly profit beat expectations on strong iPod and Mac computer sales, and the company gave an outlook that cheered investors, sending its shares up 9.4 percent on Wednesday. 

 The results cap a tumultuous few weeks for Apple, which is facing increased headwinds from slumping consumer spending, as well as investor concerns about management succession after Chief Executive Steve Jobs said he would take a medical leave of absence until the end of June. "The trailing quarter is better than expected and the outlook is better than feared, and so it's a relief on multiple fronts," said Ashok Kumar, analyst at Collins Stewart. "Steve is leaving the company in its best shape in history." He added, "They are not going to be able to replace Steve Jobs, I think that's clear, but if they get an operationally oriented CEO, I think the strength of the product pipeline should sustain Apple's financial momentum for the foreseeable future." Apple said its net profit in the fiscal first quarter ended December 27 rose to $1.61 billion, or $1.78 a share, from $1.58 billion, or $1.76 a share, a year ago. Analysts were expecting a per-share profit of $1.40, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 5.8 percent to $10.2 billion, beating the $9.74 billion average Wall Street estimate. Apple, known for conservative forecasts, estimated a profit for the March quarter of 90 cents to $1.00 a share, on revenue of $7.6 billion to $8 billion. That wasn't far off from the average analyst forecast for earnings of $1.12 per share and revenue of $8.1 billion. "This management team has always been conservative in the way it's guided," said Oppenheimer analyst Yair Reiner. "In that context, the first-quarter forecasts are quite encouraging." The December quarter is traditionally Apple's strongest, fueled by holiday season sales. IPod sales rose 3 percent from a year ago to 22.7 million units, beating the 18.5 million expected by analysts. Mac computer sales rose 9 percent to 2.52 million units, in line with expectations. Sales of the iPhone fell considerably from the fiscal fourth quarter, when it was launched, to 4.3 million units. Analysts had expected sales of roughly 5 million units. But over the course of 2008, Apple sold over 13.7 million iPhones, ahead of its 10 million target. Apple executives told analysts on a conference call that "visibility remains low in the current environment," but the economy is not as "unpredictable" as it was back in October. "We're very proud to report record revenue and earnings. This is the best in our history, the first time quarterly revenue exceeded $10 billion," Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer told Reuters in a phone interview. Although Apple continues to take market share in computers and smartphones, with consumer spending expected to be weak at least through  2009, expectations are building about the company's product plans. Many analysts hope a new device this year will be a sales catalyst -- much as the 3G iPhone was in 2008 -- or that Apple will launch products at lower price points to lure in new customers. But Apple executives said the company is "not going to play in the low end" of the voice industry. Apple's gross margin was 34.7 percent in its December quarter, flat with the year-ago period, and the company said it expected margins to be about 30 percent in the current quarter. Kaufman Bros analyst Shaw Wu said lower component prices was helping Apple. "I think one of the things that's really helping them is that the component environment has also been very favorable. The inputs into their products -- processors, memory, flash, panels -- pricing on those products has come down a lot and that enables Apple to maintain their margins even though they are selling a lower-end mix," he said. Shares of the Cupertino, California-based Apple closed up 6 percent at $82.83 on Nasdaq before the results. They rose another 9.4 percent in after-hours trading to $90.60.
