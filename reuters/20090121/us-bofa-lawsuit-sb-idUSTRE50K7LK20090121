 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Investors filed a proposed class action against Bank of America Corp in New York on Wednesday, accusing the bank and its officers of failing to disclose risks in its January 1 takeover of Merrill Lynch Co. 

 The lawsuit, brought by Steven Sklar on behalf of investors entitled to vote on the merger, says BofA and its officers should have warned shareholders that Merrill would post a $15.3 billion loss in the fourth quarter of 2008. It names as defendants BofA Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, former Merrill Lynch Chairman and CEO John Thain, ex-Merrill Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai and ex-Merrill Chief Accounting Officer Gary Carlin. The case is Sklar vs. Bank of America, 09-580, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. (Reporting by  Gina Keating ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
