 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Northern Trust Corp ( NTRS.O ) said quarterly net income more than doubled, helping send the financial services company's shares up 22 percent. 

 The Chicago-based company, which offers private banking, investment management and global custody services, said net income rose to $342.3 million, or $1.47 a share, from $125 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. "Despite the extremely difficult economic conditions, our sound balance sheet and prudent business model enabled us to achieve record fourth-quarter performance," Chief Executive Frederick Waddell said in a statement. Revenue grew 18 percent to $1.15 billion, boosted by foreign exchange trading income, which doubled to $234.6 million. Northern shares jumped $9.72 to $53.65 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, making it the day's best-performing asset management company.
