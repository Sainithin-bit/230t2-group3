 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) eased fears over its financial position on Wednesday by saying in a surprise statement it still expects to make a profit for 2008, although it warned of more trading losses. 

 "They're still managing to make a profit, which is not bad in this environment. It implies they're not in urgent need of new capital," said Reyl France fund manager Dorothee Marty. SocGen said it expected a full-year net profit of about 2 billion euros ($2.60 billion), nearly a fifth below the average market forecast. Reuters Estimates showed the average net profit forecast from 19 analysts was for about 2.4 billion euros. The chairman of French rival BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), Michel Pebereau, later told France 5 television that the country's top three banks were profitable in 2008. BNP also said on Wednesday it did not plan an issue of ordinary shares but that it was considering applying for 2.55 billion euros from the bank lending facility. A source close to France's Economy Ministry told Reuters a second 10.5 billion euro tranche of aid for six French banks would be split in roughly the same way as a first tranche. SocGen issued its unscheduled trading update nearly a year after it unveiled a 4.9 billion euro rogue trading scandal at the bank. SocGen said those losses were caused by Jerome Kerviel, a former junior trader at the bank. Since then, SocGen has been battling to recover, ending 2008 in better shape than many other banks, several of which failed as the global financial crisis unfolded. SocGen said while its retail banking operations had been "resilient," it had been impacted by the devaluation in the Ukrainian currency and by writedowns and the trading losses. "At the same time, the trading activities posted losses that were nevertheless limited by Societe Generale Group's risk reduction policy of recent quarters and the cautious attitude of market operators in reaction to the exceptional dislocation of the financial markets during Q4 2008," it said in a statement. SocGen shares rose 10 percent to 27.175 euros after falling 14 percent on Tuesday. The DJ Stoxx European bank sector .SX7P added 2.5 percent. BNP, France's biggest bank by market value and seen as a possible suitor of SocGen, rose 1 percent. SLIM PROFIT For the first nine months of the year, SocGen made a net profit of 1.9 billion euros, implying it will make a net profit of just 100 million euros for the fourth quarter. In the third quarter, SocGen made a net profit of 183 million euros. It said it had a Tier 1 ratio of about 8.5 percent at end-December, noting this should rise to about 9 percent because of the planned 21 billion euros French government financing package for the French banks in which it planned to participate. SocGen's full results were due on February 18. On Wednesday, a Swiss paper said Swiss rival Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) might have booked a $5.25 billion loss for 2008, while earlier this week Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) warned of a record 20 billion-pound ($28.10 billion) loss for 2008. "I remain very wary over the whole banking sector. There is too much bad news, and the writedowns don't stop," said a share dealer in Paris. Along with falling out of favor with investors, banks have also come under attack from politicians. France's top three banks -- SocGen, Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) and BNP Paribas -- bowed to pressure from President Nicolas Sarkozy this week by agreeing to scrap the 2008 bonuses for their chairmen and chief executives. The French government, which says the banks should do more to lend to businesses and help bankroll the economy, also wants the banks to limit their dividend payouts. Pebereau told France 5 BNP planned a policy of moderation with regard to its dividend payments. SocGen said it would make a decision over its dividend on February 17 -- a day before its results announcement. SocGen shares have fallen about 30 percent since the start of 2009 after a 60 percent drop in 2008.
