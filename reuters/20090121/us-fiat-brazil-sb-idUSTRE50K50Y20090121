 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Italian automaker Fiat ( FIA.MI ) put 800 workers at its main plant in Brazil on leave for 10 days to cut output in a bid to reduce a build-up in inventory, the union representing the employees said on Wednesday. 

 Workers on temporary leave account for nearly 5 percent of the 15,000 total at Fiat's Betim plant, outside the capital of Minas Gerais state. The automaker has no plans to cut its workforce or to announce additional paid leaves for its employees, Fiat's media department in Brazil said. "The reason for the collective holidays is to adjust output plans to meet demand," Fiat said. Fiat produced about 3,000 vehicles a day at the plant before credit in Brazil dried up because of the global liquidity crunch and decreased automobile demand. Daily output has been reduced to 2,400, the metalworkers union of Betim said. The company earlier this year eliminated a third shift at the plant, transferring the workers to the first and second shifts, the union said. Automobile production in Brazil plunged 47.1 percent in December from November, after tumbling 34.4 percent the previous month, as Fiat, U.S.-based General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Germany's Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) sought to reduce inventory. The decline in vehicle output has prompted companies such as autoparts maker Magneti Marelli Cofap to cut 800 jobs, equivalent to 10 percent of its workforce, last week. GM also dismissed 744 temporary workers at a plant in Sao Paulo state last week. Brazil is Fiat's second-biggest market after Italy, accounting for more than 30 percent of its sales globally and the bulk of its profits.
