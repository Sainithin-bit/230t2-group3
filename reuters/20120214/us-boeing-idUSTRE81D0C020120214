 (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Tuesday it signed its largest ever commercial airplane order with Indonesia's Lion Air in a deal worth $22.4 billion. 
 Boeing said Lion Air, Indonesia's largest carrier by passenger volume, has ordered 230 airplanes, including 201 737 MAXs and 29 next-generation 737-900 ERs. Lion Air will also acquire purchase rights for an additional 150 airplanes, Boeing said. The announcement was made in a statement at the Singapore airshow. In November, Lion Air announced the original massive order during U.S. President Barack Obama's Asia-Pacific tour. Europe's Airbus had accused the United States of applying political pressure to secure the deal. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad ; Editing by Matt Driskill)
