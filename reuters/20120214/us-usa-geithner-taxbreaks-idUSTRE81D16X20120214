 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner on Tuesday said the Obama Administration's plan to revamp the corporate tax system will cut "dozens and dozens" of tax breaks enjoyed by business, while keeping a limited number that focus on keeping jobs in the United States. 
 Geithner spoke at the Senate Finance Committee a day after Obama proposed a $3.8 trillion budget plan, including aggressive cuts to corporate tax benefits and steeper taxes on the wealthy. (Reporting By  Kim Dixon  and  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
