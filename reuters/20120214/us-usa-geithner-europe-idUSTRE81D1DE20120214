 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Tuesday the debt crisis in Europe has had a major impact on U.S. growth, but said the Europeans now seemed more committed to avoiding an economic catastrophe. 
 Geithner spoke to the Senate Finance Committee a day after President Barack Obama presented a $3.8 trillion U.S. budget for 2013. (Reporting By  Kim Dixon  and  Rachelle Younglai ; ; Editing by  Christopher Wilson  and  Sandra Maler )
