 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German economy should expand by 3.3 percent in 2010 and two percent in 2011, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will report in early October, German magazine Der Spiegel said on Saturday. 

 That forecast is line with many private economists. Some recent indicators have strengthened the impression the German recovery is slowing after stellar 2.2 percent growth in April-June, the fastest quarterly growth in reunified Germany. The IMF said the strong export growth as well as the improving domestic demand were behind the brighter outlook after it had predicted in July growth of 1.4 percent in 2010 for Germany.
