 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Caterpillar Inc sharply pared gains and hit a session low on Tuesday as the U.S. machinery maker forecast a "challenging" third quarter and announced plans for rolling shutdown of its factories during the period. 

 The stock clung to a modest gain, up 8 percent at $39.56, a level that was just off its intraday low. Earlier Caterpillar -- whose gains accounted for half of the Dow's 40-point advance -- had risen more than 10 percent. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
