 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) posted quarterly earnings on Tuesday that handily topped analysts' estimates as the world's biggest coffee chain began reaping rewards from slashing costs and closing stores, sending its shares up 9 percent. 

 Net income for its fiscal third-quarter ended June 28 was $151.5 million, or 20 cents per share. A year earlier, Starbucks reported a net loss of $6.7 million, or 1 cent per share -- its first quarterly net loss as a public company. Excluding restructuring charges, Starbucks earned 24 cents a share in the latest quarter. Analysts, on average, had been looking for a profit before items of 19 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total revenue fell to $2.4 billion from $2.6 billion. Starbucks global same-store sales fell 5 percent, after sales at established U.S. restaurants declined 6 percent. The chain, which faces increasing competition in coffee from the likes of global fast-food giant McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), has cut jobs, attacked expenses and targeted more than 1,000 stores around the world for closure. It also has selectively lowered prices to attract and retain consumers in a lingering recession. The shares finished down 1.5 percent at $14.69 on the Nasdaq in the regular trading session but jumped to $16 in extended trade. (Reporting by  Lisa Baertlein ; Editing Bernard Orr)
