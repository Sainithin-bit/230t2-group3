 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc warned on Tuesday that the third quarter will be "very tough" on sales and it was conceivable the company would lose money during the period. 

 During a conference call to discuss second-quarter earnings, Mike DeWalt, head of Caterpillar's investor relations unit, said the company planned significant rolling plant shutdowns during the quarter to deal with the downturn, which he called "extremely challenging."
