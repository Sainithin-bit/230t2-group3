 BOSTON  (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) posted a 23 percent drop in profit and lowered its 2009 forecast as it faces weaker-than-expected orders for equipment used in large buildings and aircraft. 

 The world's largest maker of elevators and air conditioners said on Tuesday that cost cuts were starting to pay off and its rate of order decline appeared to stabilizing. Second-quarter earnings were slightly higher than analyst expectations. The company, which also makes jet engines and helicopters. looks for full-year earnings of $4 to $4.20 per share, down from a prior range of $4 to $4.50. Wall Street is more bearish, on average looking for $4.10 per share. United Tech expects profits to grow next year due to cost cutting, Chief Financial Officer Greg Hayes told investors on a conference call. "We do not anticipate a significant economic recovery in 2010," Hayes added.

CFO Hayes said he expected the company to be more aggressive in buying back its shares in the second half of the year.
