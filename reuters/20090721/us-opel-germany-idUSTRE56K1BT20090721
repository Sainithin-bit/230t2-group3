 BERLIN  (Reuters) - A meeting on Wednesday between U.S. carmaker General Motors and German government officials will not yield a decision on which bidder will succeed in taking a stake in Opel, a German government source said on Tuesday. 

 It is also unlikely that a preliminary decision will be made on Opel's future this week, said the source. GM said on Monday it had received three binding takeover offers for Opel. The company will now consider them together with European countries affected by the deal, including Germany. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller , writing by Madeline Chambers)
