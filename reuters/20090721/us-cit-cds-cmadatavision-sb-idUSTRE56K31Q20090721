 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of insuring CIT Group's debt with credit default swaps rose on Tuesday after analysts said a $3 billion lifeline announced on Monday would only delay a bankruptcy filing. 

 CIT's five-year credit default swaps rose to 46 percent upfront from 39.5 percent late on Monday, according to data from CMA DataVision. That means it costs $4.6 million in an upfront payment, plus $500,000 a year to insure $10 million of debt. (Reporting by  Dena Aubin ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
