 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama spelled out on Thursday why landmark Wall Street reform should matter to voters in an election year, stressing it would shelter Americans from "shadowy deals" and end banking abuse. 

 "For all those Americans who are wondering what Wall Street reform means for you, here's what you should expect," he said, promising the sweeping reforms passed by Congress would help people avoid being taken in by unscrupulous companies. The reforms have absorbed official Washington, but thus far left the rest of America nonplused. A poll on Thursday by Ipsos Public Affairs found 38 percent of Americans were ignorant of the reforms, while 33 percent had heard about them, but knew little of what they would mean. Such findings are worrying news for Obama and his Democrats, who will campaign in November congressional elections on this and his other main legislative successes; healthcare reform and a growth-reviving stimulus package. So Obama cut through the complexity of the measures, which create a consumer financial protection agency and strengthen protections against risk-taking, to emphasize his argument that they put his government on the side of ordinary people. "If you have ever applied for a credit card, a student loan or mortgage, you know the feeling of signing your name to pages of barely understandable fine print," he said. "It's a big step for most families and one that is often filled with unnecessary confusion and apprehension. As a result, many Americans are simply duped into hidden fees and loans they just can't afford, by companies that know exactly what they are doing. Those days will soon end," he said. Obama spoke on his return from a trip to Michigan shortly after the Senate, by a vote of 60 to 39, passed a bill that he is expected to sign into law next week. The reforms are designed to strengthen rules governing the financial industry, to prevent the type of risky lending behavior at the root of a financial crisis that began in the U.S. subprime mortgage market in 2007 and spread worldwide. Subprime mortgages were aimed at borrowers with low credit scores, and were concentrated among the poor and minorities. Obama also tapped into public anger over a $700 billion taxpayer bailout of Wall Street's biggest firms. He said this reform will "prevent the kind of shadowy deals that led to this crisis", adding it would "never again put taxpayers on the hook for Wall Street's mistakes." The cost of the bank rescue, by his Republican predecessor George W. Bush, was much lower than initially estimated. But it remains a sore subject among many Americans, with unemployment at 9.5 percent while Wall Street bonuses have surged. The banking lobby launched a massive campaign to thwart the bill, fearing it could dent their profits by clamping down on lucrative -- and potentially risky -- speculation. Obama said only cheats should worry. "Unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers, you have nothing to fear from this reform," Obama said.
