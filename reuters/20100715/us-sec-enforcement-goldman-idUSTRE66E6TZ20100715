 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc reached a $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to resolve a civil fraud lawsuit over subprime mortgage-linked products it offered to investors. 

 Here are details of the pact: * Settlement resolved April 16 lawsuit accusing Goldman of misstating and omitting key facts about its offerings of collateralized debt obligations linked to risky mortgage securities in early 2007. * Of the $550 million to be paid by Goldman, $250 million would be returned to investors; $300 million would be paid to the U.S. Treasury. * Settlement requires approval by U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones in Manhattan * Settlement does not resolve SEC charges against Goldman vice president Fabrice Tourre, the lone individual defendant named in the original lawsuit. SEC says its litigation against Tourre continues. * Settlement requires "remedial action" by Goldman in its review and approval of offerings of certain mortgage securities. * Goldman said in the settlement that it is conducting a review of its business standards. * Settlement said Goldman acknowledged that marketing materials for the CDO at issue in the case, known as ABACUS 2007-AC1, "contained incomplete information." * Goldman said in the settlement that "it was a mistake" for its ABACUS marketing materials to state that portfolio was "selected by" ACA Management LLC without disclosing that hedge fund Paulson & Co Inc, which was betting against the underlying securities, helped choose the portfolio.
