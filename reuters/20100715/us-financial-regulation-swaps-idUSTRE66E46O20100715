 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators face the mammoth task of writing the detailed rules needed to implement the legislation passed by Congress that establishes oversight of the $615 trillion over-the-counter derivatives market. 

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has already created a list of 30 "topic areas" it needs to implement, some of which involve multiple rules -- many in coordination with the Securities and Exchange Commission, CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler said this month. Below is a list of some elements Congress requires from regulators to implement the swaps portion of the legislation: SWAP DEALERS, MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS * Define thresholds to establish who will be deemed swap dealers and major swap participants. * Establish minimum capital and margin requirements for dealers, major participants. * Write rules for how dealers, major participants must register, report trades and keep records. * Establish "business conduct standards" for dealers, major players. CLEARING * Rule on what types, groups, categories of swaps are required to be cleared. * Determine whether to exempt small banks, savings associations, farm credit institutions and credit unions. * Set rules and standards for clearinghouses, including financial resources required. * Establish how clearinghouses can submit swaps for review. * Rules to prevent evasion of clearing requirements. REPORTING SWAPS * Establish timelines and process for how swaps will be reported to a swaps data repository or to the CFTC. * Within 90 days, publish an "interim final rule" for how to report data for swaps that predate the legislation. * Establish data standards and other rules for swaps data repositories. SWAP EXECUTION FACILITIES * Define what type of swaps can be traded on a swap execution facility. * Establish how swap execution facilities register, keep records, report trades and other principles and rules for operation. POSITION LIMITS * Establish limits on trades (other than bona fide hedges) for physical commodities. ANTI-MANIPULATION AUTHORITY * May write rules to prevent disruptive trades and manipulation of swaps markets. * Given power to deem certain types of swaps as "abusive." CONFLICT OF INTEREST * Can set limits on control of clearinghouses, swap execution facilities and exchanges by large banks, financial companies, swap dealers and major swaps participants. SETTLE JURISDICTIONAL SPAT WITH FERC * Within 180 days, reach agreement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on areas where there is overlapping jurisdiction. WHISTLE-BLOWER PROTECTION * Establish protection for whistle-blowers within 270 days. STUDIES, REPORTS * Study with the SEC the feasibility of requiring the use of standardized algorithmic descriptions for derivatives and report to Congress. * Study with the SEC whether "stable value contracts" associated with employee benefit plans are swaps and whether they should continue to be exempt from clearing requirements. * Every second year, report on the growth or decline of derivatives markets in U.S. and abroad, and compliance costs of new rules. * Within 12 months of setting position limits, study their impact on curbing speculation and forcing trade to offshore exchanges. * Conduct an interagency study on oversight of carbon markets, including recommendations for oversight of existing and prospective carbon markets.
