 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said on Thursday its index of business conditions in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region fell in July to 5.1, to the lowest level since August 2009, from 8.0 in June. 

 KEY POINTS: * Economists had expected a reading of 10.0, based on the results of a Reuters poll, which ranged from 4.1 to 18.0. * Any reading above zero indicates expansion in the region's manufacturing. * The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware. * It is seen as one of the first monthly indicators of the health of U.S. manufacturing leading up to the national report by the Institute for Supply Management, which is due next on August 2. COMMENTS: JOE SALUZZI, CO-MANAGER OF TRADING, THEMIS TRADING, CHATHAM, NEW JERSEY: "Death, destruction, story at six. Come on, what more do we need to know here? Double-dip is here, there is no doubt about it. As much as the apologists want to say things are good and getting better. The numbers don't lie. This is bad news, this is with all the stimulus, with all the stuff the government has been throwing at it -- zero percent interest rates and so on. And you still can't anything going. The only thing good is JPMorgan gets money because they can borrow at zero and loan at three. Let's be real here. It wasn't just the Philly Fed today, it was also the other numbers we saw -- Empire Manufacturing, etc. Same thing, more of the same." JIM AWAD, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ZEPHYR MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "It looks like it's confirming other data that we're getting that the recovery is slowing in pace and that showed up in the New York manufacturing index and it's going to add to fears that post-stimulus, the economy is going to ratchet down in terms of its recovery. So on the surface it does not look like a good number. "Earnings remain paramount and forward-looking guidance given by corporations remains key, but on the margins this is going to be number that's going to temper the market and you can see the market weakening in response to it." MICHAEL SHELDON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, RDM FINANCIAL, WESTPORT, CONNECTICUT: "When you look at regional and national manufacturing reports, probably the three most important pieces are new orders, shipments and changes in payrolls. In the Philadelphia Fed report, the index fell. New orders fell, shipments fell and, lastly, employment rose. So two of the three major components fell on a month-over-month basis." HOWARD SIMONS, STRATEGIST, BIANCO RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "It's hard to paint a pretty picture from the Philadelphia Fed data. We are in this economic environment now where it's one step forward, one step back. I don't think we are headed for a double dip (recession), but we are back to the "L" shaped outcome. We will skate along the bottom with slow growth for a long time." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It's a soft number consistent with some of the other data we're seeing suggesting that strength in manufacturing is cooling off a bit. Manufacturing is still expanding, but not quite as rapidly as we saw earlier this year. We still believe that manufacturing is going to be a positive contributor to growth, but probably won't get as big a boost from inventory rebuilding going forward."
