 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate scheduled a final vote on a sweeping rewrite of financial regulations for 2 p.m. on Thursday, shortly after the measure cleared a procedural hurdle. 

 The measure is expected to easily get the 51 votes needed to pass. At that point, it would head to the White House for President Barack Obama to sign into law. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan  and  Kevin Drawbaugh )
