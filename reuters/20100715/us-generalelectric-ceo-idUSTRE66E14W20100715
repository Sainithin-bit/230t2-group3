 MILAN  (Reuters) - The United States and Europe are slowly pulling out of the economic crisis, General Electric Co ( GE.N ) chairman and chief executive Jeffrey Immelt told la Repubblica daily in an interview on Thursday. 

 "The base scenario is that which sees Europe and the United States exiting slowly from the crisis period," Immelt said. "I see it every day, I see the economy improving day after day. I especially see our orders improving day after day." China, India, Brazil, Africa, the Middle East and resource-rich areas "are clearly doing well," he said. He said General Electric was interested in acquisitions in Europe as the dollar strengthened. Mentioning the company's Nuovo Pignone energy research center in Italy, Immelt said: "We will find another investment, of the Nuovo Pignone kind." (Reporting by  Ian Simpson ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
