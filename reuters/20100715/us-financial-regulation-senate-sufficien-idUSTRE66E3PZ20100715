 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Enough votes had been cast in the Senate on Thursday to advance a landmark Wall Street reform bill toward a final vote on passage, although action on a key procedural test was still under way. 

 If at least 60 senators vote to close off further debate on the sprawling measure, it would clear the procedural test and move toward a vote on passage, possibly later in the day. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan  and  Kevin Drawbaugh , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
