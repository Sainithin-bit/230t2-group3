 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate began voting on Thursday on a key procedural test for the most sweeping overhaul of Wall Street regulation in decades. 

 If at least 60 votes are cast to close off further debate on the massive bill, it could then move on toward another vote on final passage, possibly later in the day. The 2,300-page bill would slap tough new rules on the banking industry, set up a new government process for dismantling troubled financial firms, and create a government consumer watchdog to regulate mortgages and credit cards.
