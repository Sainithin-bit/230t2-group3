 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.AS shares finally come to New York on Thursday and investors will be weighing them against those of arch-rival Blackstone Group ( BX.N ), which listed in 2007. 

 KKR will switch from Amsterdam-based Euronext to the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday and trading will begin when the NYSE opens, under the ticker "KKR" ( KKR.N ). This is how KKR and Blackstone stack up: MARKET VALUE * KKR has a market capitalization on Euronext of $7.1 billion, while Blackstone has a valuation of $11.3 billion. Figures are based on closing prices on Wednesday. ASSETS * KKR's assets under management were $54.7 billion as at the end of March. Blackstone said when it reported first-quarter earnings that its fee-earning assets under management totaled $98.1 billion. SHARES * KKR's stock has risen 16.7 percent since it started trading as a combined company on Euronext at the beginning of October at around $9. The stock last traded at $10.50. * Blackstone has lost two-thirds of its value since going public in 2007 at $31 a share. It closed trading on Wednesday at $10.28. EARNINGS * KKR's economic net income for the first quarter of 2010 was $674.8 million. Blackstone reported economic net income for the first quarter of $360 million. * ENI strips out items such as noncash charges. It is the measure that private equity firms prefer to report and that analysts follow. FUND-RAISING * KKR is ranked at the world's third-largest private equity firm with $47 billion capital raised for its funds in the last five years, according to a report released in April by Private Equity International magazine. That puts it after the private equity unit of Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), which raised $54.5 billion, and Carlyle with $47.8 billion. Blackstone is No. 7 with $31.1 billion. * Those numbers do not include Blackstone's sixth buyout fund, expected to be more than $13 billion. HISTORY * KKR was founded in 1976 by Henry Kravis, George Roberts and Jerome Kohlberg Jr. Kohlberg resigned in 1987 and later started his own buyout firm. * Blackstone was founded in 1985 by Stephen Schwarzman and Peter Peterson. OWNERSHIP STAKES * Kravis and Roberts each own 87 million shares of KKR, which equates to just under 13 percent each of the total 683 million shares. * Schwarzman owns about 23 percent of Blackstone. STAFF: * Blackstone has 17 global offices and 1,300 staff. KKR has 14 offices around the world and about 600 staff. WEALTH, COMPENSATION * Schwarzman was ranked in March as number 171 on Forbes magazine's global list of billionaires with $4.7 billion, ahead of Kravis at number 201 with $4.2 billion. * Co-founders Kravis and Roberts are each taking a yearly salary of $250,000. Schwarzman drew a salary of $350,000 last year. (Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
