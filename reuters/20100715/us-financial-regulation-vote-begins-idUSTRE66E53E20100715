 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate began voting on Thursday on final passage of a landmark Wall Street reform bill, with approval widely expected. 

 The measure narrowly cleared procedural hurdles earlier in the day. If ultimately approved, it would be sent next to President Barack Obama to be signed into law. The House of Representatives has already approved the bill, which would slap new rules on banks, set up a government process for dismantling troubled financial firms, and create a government financial consumer watchdog.
