 (Reuters) - Vanguard Group, the largest U.S. mutual fund manager, reduced fees across dozens of its index-tracking stock and bond funds, following similar moves by competitors. 
 The fee reductions range from five-hundredths to one-hundredth of a percentage point per year. With many of the funds already charging low fees of less than 0.20 percent Of assets, some of the reductions were the equivalent of a 20 percent fee cut. Intense competition among managers of index mutual and exchange-traded funds has led to sharp price cutting across the industry over the past few months. BlackRock ( BLK.N ), the largest ETF manager, and brokerage firm Charles Schwab ( SCHW.N ) both announced price cuts earlier this year. At Vanguard's line of broad equity sector funds, such as the firm's Consumer Discretionary ETF ( VCR.P ) and Health Care ETF ( VHT.P ), fees declined to 0.14 percent from 0.19 percent. Vanguard, based in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, posted a full list of the fee cuts at  link.reuters.com/cut84t. Vanguard raised fees slightly on three actively managed equity mutual funds, including on both share classes of the $17.6 billion Vanguard International Growth Fund. Fees on the "Investor" share class ( VWIGX.O ) rose to 0.49 percentage point from 0.47 while fees on the fund's "Admiral" class ( VWILX.O ) rose to 0.36 point from 0.34.
