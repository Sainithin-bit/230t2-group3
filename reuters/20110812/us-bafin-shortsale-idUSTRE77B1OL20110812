 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German regulator Bafin on Friday signaled it was not ready to broaden a existing ban on naked short selling to include all forms of short sales on Friday. 

 "We are montoring the situation closely but see no irregularities in the market at present," a spokeswoman for the German regulator said on Friday. Short-selling is the process through which an investor borrows shares and sells them on the expectation their price will fall and they can be bought back at a lower price. In a naked short sale, the investor has not even borrowed the share, but still bets on a drop in share price. (Reporting by Alexander Huebner; writing by  Edward Taylor )
