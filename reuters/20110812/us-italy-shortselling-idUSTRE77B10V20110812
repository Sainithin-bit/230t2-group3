 ROME  (Reuters) - Italy's market regulator Consob has introduced a ban on short-selling on financial stocks, it said on Friday. 

 The ban on the short selling of financial stocks starts on Friday and lasts 15 days, Consob said. A ban on short-selling financial stocks in four European countries, including Italy, takes effect on Friday, the European Securities and Markets Authority (EMSA) said in a statement late on Thursday.
