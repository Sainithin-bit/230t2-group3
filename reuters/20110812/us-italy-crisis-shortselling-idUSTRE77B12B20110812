 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian market authority Consob's ban on short selling of financial stocks covers 29 companies in the banking and insurance sector, the bourse regulator said on Friday. 

 Consob announced a 15-day ban on short selling financial stocks earlier on Friday, joining three other European countries which introduced similar bans in a bid to curb volatile stock price swings. (Reporting by  Giselda Vagnoni )
