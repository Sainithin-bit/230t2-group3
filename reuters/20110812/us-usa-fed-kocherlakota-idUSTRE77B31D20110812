 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Narayana Kockerlakota said on Friday that he dissented from the U.S. central bank's decision this week to keep interest rates low until mid-2013 because he felt more policy easing wasn't needed. 

 In a highly unusual statement three days after casting one of three dissenting votes, he said that the rise in inflation and decline in unemployment since November, when the Fed last eased policy, makes more accommodation unnecessary today. "I do not believe that providing more accommodation -- easing monetary policy -- is the appropriate response to these changes in the economy," Kockerlakota said in the statement, posted on the Minneapolis Fed's website at:  here On Tuesday, the Fed promised to keep rates exceptionally low for another two years in response to a weakening economy. Kocherlakota was joined in dissenting on the decision by Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher and Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, the first triple dissent against a Fed move since 1992. Kocherlakota noted that he supported the Fed's last round of easing, saying on Friday it was "well calibrated for the prevailing economic conditions." Unemployment fell to 9.1 percent in July, still "disturbingly high," Kocherlakota said, but down from just over 10 percent at its peak last year. Inflation as measured by the Fed's preferred core PCE index rose to 1.3 percent in the 12 months ended in June, from a low last December of 0.9 percent. Kocherlakota said he issued the statement as part of his commitment to transparency, which he called "an essential part of policy formation."
