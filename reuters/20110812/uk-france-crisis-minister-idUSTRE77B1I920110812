 PARIS  (Reuters) - The French government is committed to ensuring financial stability, fighting speculation and avoiding market abuses, French Finance Minister Francois Baroin said in a statement on Friday. 

 The European market regulator ESMA said late on Thursday that France, Italy, Spain and Belgium were banning short-selling of stocks from Friday after a renewed bout of rumour-driven share price plunges this week in financial markets unsettled by the region's sovereign debt difficulties. Baroin welcomed the move in a statement that also said: "Francois Baroin highlights the government's commitment to ensuring financial stability, avoiding market abuses and fighting against all forms of speculation."
