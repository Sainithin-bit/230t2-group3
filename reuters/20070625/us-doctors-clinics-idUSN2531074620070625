 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The American Medical Association said on Monday it will ask state and federal health authorities to investigate retail health clinics such as those offered in CVS/Caremark stores, Wal-Mart Stores and Walgreen Co. for possible conflicts of interest. 

 The AMA said it opposes the clinics, which they said do not offer comprehensive care and might put patients at risk. "Our concerns are very simple: safety and patient care," said Dr. Rodney Osborn, president of the Illinois State Medical Society, who practices in Peoria, Illinois. In 2006, there were more than 200 store-based health clinics nationwide, according to the AMA, and another 1,000 such health clinics are projected by the end of 2007. The influential physician's group said it will support legislation governing "the corporate practice of medicine and the standards by which nurse practitioners and physician assistants are allowed to practice." The AMA's more than 550 delegates voted to adopt the position at its annual meeting in Chicago. The AMA said the clinics disrupt the standard physician-patient relationship and might result in missed diagnoses. "We are certainly concerned about the action of the AMA," said Dr. Rebecca Hafner, a spokeswoman for retail clinic operator MinuteClinic, which was acquired by CVS last year. "We think the net result will be that this will make it more difficult for MinuteClinic and other retail-based clinics to open new clinics," she said. "That will decrease patient access to patient care at a time when many parts of the United States are experiencing a shortage of primary care physicians," she said. Hafner said the clinics are staffed by board-certified registered nurses and physician's assistants. Walgreen, which last month acquired Take Care Health System, an operator of retail health clinics, also opposes the measure. "As this agenda is pushed, they may find out that legislators and their constituents are demanding access to affordable and high quality health care for years," said Michael Polzin, a Walgreen spokesman. "That is exactly what retail clinics are delivering as a supplement to the primary care physicians," he said. The pharmacy chain currently has six health clinics in six states and has plans to open more than 400 by the end of 2008. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman was not immediately able to comment. Osborn, who proposed the measure, said the clinics present a conflict of interest because they dispense prescriptions and also sell prescription drugs. "I think the basic mission is different. They're selling products and prescriptions," he said in a telephone interview. "These are very smart people going into this business and I don't think they are doing it for charity." Hafner said MinuteClinics do dispense some prescriptions, but said staff at her clinics are trained to instruct patients that they are free to fill prescriptions wherever they like.
