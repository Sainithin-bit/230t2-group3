 BOSTON  (Reuters) - John Hancock agreed on Monday to pay $21.2 million to end a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the mutual fund company's failure to disclose certain revenue-sharing schemes, the agency said. 

 The SEC said in its ruling that the Boston-based company, a unit of Canada's Manulife Financial Corp. ( MFC.TO ), used brokerage commissions to pay for affiliated distributors' marketing expenses from 2001 to late 2004, but failed to make the practice public. John Hancock did not admit or deny the SEC findings, but will pay $21.2 million, including disgorgement, prejudgement interest and civil monetary penalty, the agency said.
