 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) posted a 19.6 percent rise in quarterly profit on Monday, boosted by new stores and an inventory credit, but its shares slipped as the large drugstore chain failed to deliver the stellar growth it had produced in the previous three quarters. 

 The company also said it would consider "select" acquisitions and is looking for other pharmacy-related health care opportunities as it continues to open hundreds of stores. The quarter was "pretty solid, although certainly not to the extent" of the prior two quarters, said Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel. Profit rose nearly 25 percent in each of the first two quarters of the fiscal year. Profit also rose 25.3 percent in last year's fiscal fourth quarter. In the fiscal third quarter ended May 31, profit rose to $561.2 million, or 56 cents per share, from $469.2 million, or 46 cents, a year earlier. The latest quarter included an inventory credit of $3.5 million, versus a provision of $24.2 million in the year-earlier period, due to less inflation than anticipated among pharmacy inventories. Analysts, on average, had expected the Deerfield, Illinois-based chain to earn 53 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of Walgreen fell as much as 2.2 percent to $43.97 and were down 1.6 percent at $44.25 in afternoon trading on the  New York Stock Exchange. BB&T Capital Markets analyst Andrew Wolf, who has a "buy" rating on the shares, said investors are probably reacting to inventory helping Walgreen this time after pressuring earnings a year earlier. Still, he said the results were strong even excluding the inventory benefit. Sales rose 12.5 percent to $13.7 billion. While sales were in line with Wall Street's expectations, the growth percentage fell short of the three preceding quarters. Total sales in stores open at least a year, a measure of retail strength known as same-store sales, rose 7.8 percent. Prescription sales rose 13.8 percent overall and rose 9 percent in comparable stores. Comparable sales of general merchandise climbed 5.6 percent. According to Wolf, Walgreen is the most productive U.S. drugstore chain in total sales per square foot. EXPANSION PLANS Director of Finance Rick Hans said in a statement that Walgreen, which typically grows on its own rather than through acquisitions, would look at "select acquisitions" as the drugstore industry continues to consolidate. He said that the company is also looking for opportunities in health care. Walgreen bought in-store health clinic operator Take Care Health Systems in May, giving it a broader reach in the fast-growing industry. Wolf said Walgreen is more likely to get involved in a coalition or other type of venture with a pharmacy benefits manager rather than buy one, as rival CVS did, creating CVS/Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ) in March. Hans said that while the roll-out of more than 400 clinics by the end of calendar year 2008 would not have the same impact as opening 400 drugstores, the clinics would be central to the company's expansion of health care services in the future. Walgreen has expanded at a rapid clip by opening new stores and buying small companies. It operated 5,751 stores as of May 31, up from 5,251 a year earlier. Rival CVS/Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ) had 6,168 stores as of May 26. Walgreen still plans to open 500 new stores during the current fiscal year and more than 500 stores in fiscal 2008. The company is on track to surpass its goal of having 7,000 stores in 2010, Chief Executive Jeffrey Rein said in a statement. Other big retailers, most notably Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), have scaled back their expansion plans. "There's this theory that most of retailing is mature and growth is getting harder to come by. Walgreen's really is one of the few companies defying that, where their growth is not slowing at all," BB&T's Wolf said.
