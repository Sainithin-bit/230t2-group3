 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Australia's Macquarie Bank MBL.AX and private equity fund MBK Partners are among bidders for Goldman Sachs'( GS.N ) stake in South Korea's No. 2 TV cable operator, a source with knowledge of the deal said on Monday. 

 Goldman Sachs is selling its 30.48 percent stake in C&M, valued at $970 million, according to the Maeil Business Newspaper, in the latest sale of Korean assets by foreign investment firms. Goldman bought shares in unlisted C&M in 2004 for 140 billion won ($151 million), becoming its second-largest shareholder. With the planned stake sale, the U.S. investment bank is likely to earn more than $800 million in capital gains, the newspaper estimated. The daily said the total acquisition value could rise to 3 trillion won if the sale includes management rights from the family owners of the country's No. 2 cable TV operator. Goldman and Macquarie declined to comment on the report, while MBK could not immediately be reached for comment. The source said the sale was in an early stage, adding that Shinhan Financial Group ( 055550.KS ), South Korea's second-biggest lender, would provide loans to one of the bidders. The daily cited unnamed investment banking and industry sources as saying that Citigroup ( C.N ), which is handling the deal, closed the auction on Thursday. The deal, if confirmed, comes after U.S. private equity house Lone Star LS.UL sold a 13.6 percent stake in Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS and auctioned off two other South Korean units last week for a combined $2.3 billion. C&M is the second-largest multi-system cable TV operator in South Korea with 2 million subscribers and the largest in the greater Seoul metropolitan area. The company was not available for comment. Goldman had sought to exit from its investment in C&M via a dual Seoul-London listing that was expected to fetch up to $500 million this year, sources had told Reuters last November. But if the stake sale takes place, the listing plan would be delayed or shelved because of a local securities regulation that stipulates IPO candidates should not change majority shareholders one year before the listing. Goldman has been reaping handsome earnings from South Korean investments. It more than doubled its $500 million investment in 1999 in South Korea's top lender, Kookmin Bank 060000.KS, and made hefty gains from selling spirits maker Jinro Ltd. to South Korea's top brewer, Hite Brewery ( 000140.KS ), for $3.4 billion in 2005. Goldman also sold its controlling stake in builder Dong Ah Construction Industrial Co. Ltd. in 2006. The Wall Street bank is likely to offload its 24 percent stake in Korea Express Co. Ltd. ( 000120.KS ), the country's biggest logistics firm, together with an additional stake from other creditors sometime this year. Macquarie is the biggest foreign investment bank in South Korea, and MBK, created by former Carlyle Group CYL.UL Asia head Michael Kim, is the most active homegrown fund in the country. MBK closed a $1.56 billion buyout fund last year, the largest ever for a new private equity firm, and bought South Korea's third-biggest thrift, HK Mutual Savings Bank 007640.KQ, for 117.4 billion won, jointly with Hyundai Capital Services Inc. in 2006. Private equity deals in South Korea have been increasing despite a legal battle over Lone Star's 2003 acquisition of KEB with prosecutors. Private equity investment reached $579.6 million in South Korea from 231 transactions in 2006, up 29 percent from $448.7 million in 2005, according to Thomson Financial. ($1=927.8 Won)
