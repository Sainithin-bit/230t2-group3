 LONDON  (Reuters) - The native American Seminole Tribe of Florida said on Monday it plans to open Hard Rock cafes, hotels and casinos in China, India and eastern Europe and double the size of the business. 

 The Seminoles last year paid Britain's Rank ( RNK.L ) $965 million for the iconic chain and its huge stash of rock memorabilia. Tribal leaders in traditional dress and Hard Rock managers said they planned to push into emerging markets to trade on the name and image. "We know the strength of it, we know the future of it and we know we can expand the cafes, the hotels and the gaming," Max Osceola Jr, one of the five Tribal Council members, said in an interview at the original Hard Rock Cafe on London's Piccadilly. Osceola said Hard Rock would close restaurants in less glamorous locations in the United States and Britain but double outlets globally to around 250. It would expand the number of hotels to between 60 and 100 from nine currently and envisaged having at least 30 casinos. "The most exciting markets are probably the eastern European markets, South America and Asia," said Hard Rock chief executive Hamish Dodds. Osceola said the tribe, which until the Hard Rock deal made around 90 percent of its revenues from casinos on its independently governed land, would look at buying other firms in future. "We get around 10 or 20 business proposals a day. We've had everything from banks to airlines," he said. "I think we are going to concentrate on what we have and plan our expansion but maybe another deal will come along.. we will look (at all deals)."
