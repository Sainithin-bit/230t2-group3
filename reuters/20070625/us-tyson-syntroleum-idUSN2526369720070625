 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN.N ) and Syntroleum Corp. ( SYNM.O ) are set to announce plans for a $150 million plant that would turn fat from Tyson plants into fuel, The Wall Street Journal Online reported on Monday. 

 The Tyson and Syntroleum plant, to be built somewhere in the South Central United States, will produce 75 million gallons of fat-based fuel annually, about 5 percent of the output of a typical modern oil refinery, the Journal said. Neither company was immediately available for comment.
