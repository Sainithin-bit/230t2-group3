 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Expedia Inc. ( EXPE.O ) Chairman Barry Diller said on Monday he has no plans to cede control of the top online travel company to fellow major shareholder Liberty Media Corp. LCAPA.O 

 "I want to say clearly that I have no intention to transfer control of Expedia to Liberty Media Corporation under any circumstances," said Diller in an e-mail to employees. "I don't want any of you to wonder or worry that the company is being tossed around between me and Liberty as a pawn on a chessboard. It is not," Diller said in a brief note to employees on Friday that was made public in a regulatory filing on Monday. Diller, who is also chairman and chief executive of Expedia's former parent, IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ), controls Expedia through an agreement with Liberty Media that allows him to vote Liberty's 43.6 million common shares and 1.2 million Class B supervoting shares. Expedia has 323.7 million shares outstanding, according to filings. In addition to his own holdings, which include 24.4 million supervoting shares, Diller controls about 58 percent of the votes in Expedia. Last week, Expedia announced a plan to repurchase more than one-third of its shares outstanding for up to $3.5 billion. Diller and Liberty Media do not plan to tender their own shares under the buyback, consolidating their control of the company.
