 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) has raised prices on 
its commercial planes by almost 6 percent on average, as the 
cost of its raw materials increases. 

  The world's biggest-selling plane maker, which is a major 
buyer of aluminum, titanium and carbon fiber, said the price 
hike was in line with the general inflation rate for 
manufactured goods.  Boeing posted its revised price list on its Web site 
( here ) on Thursday, showing 
an average price increase of 5.6 percent.  Its hot-selling 787-8 Dreamliner, for example, is now 
listed at $157 million to $167 million, depending on 
configuration. The previous price range was $148 million to 
$157.5 million.  Airlines and plane lessors never pay the full list price 
for an airplane, with significant discounts for large orders, 
but the price hike signals Boeing's intent to start 
negotiations at a slightly higher level.  At last week's Paris Air Show, industry analysts said 
Boeing and European rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) were discounting the 
prices of planes more heavily than usual to secure key orders.  A Boeing executive at the show said the company was "happy 
with where we are at on pricing."  "It's a bit of a misnomer that competition between us and 
Airbus is the driver of price in the industry," Boeing's Mike 
Bair, the head of its 787 program, said at a press conference 
at the air show. "What you are willing to pay for a ticket is 
what drives the price of the airplane."  Boeing is enjoying strong demand for most of its planes, 
and is sold out for delivery for the rest of this year and 
2008. Customers making orders now would have to wait until 2014 
for a 787.
