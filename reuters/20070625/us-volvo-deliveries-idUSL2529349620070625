 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - World number-two truck maker Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) said on Monday deliveries of its trucks fell 10 percent in January through May as continuing weak U.S. demand was partly offset by the addition of its Nissan trucks. 

 Volvo delivered 82,865 trucks in the period, the firm said in a statement, a number boosted by the inclusion of recent acquisition Nissan Diesel which was consolidated in the group last month. Shipments excluding Nissan trucks fell 17 percent in the period to 76,635 vehicles, implying deliveries in May alone fell 18.4 percent year-on-year to 16,099 trucks, according to Reuters calculations. "It (the figure) clearly wasn't strong. If one was expecting a positive surprise, one didn't get it," said an analyst who asked not to be identified. "Still, they had a capital market day recently where they communicated that demand was very low right now in North America." Volvo shares were down 2.1 percent at 137.50 crowns by 0819 GMT, versus a 1.3 percent decline in the Stockholm bourse's blue-chip OMXS30 index  .OMXS30 . After years of strong sales in North American markets, Volvo and its peers have seen demand dry up this year in a hangover from a buying spree that came before implementation of tougher emission rules at the turn of the year. The group's truck deliveries in North America fell 59 percent in the first five months of the year, implying an 65-percent plunge in May alone. Volvo has said the North American heavy duty truck market may hit an annual rate of 250,000 to 260,000 vehicles by the end of this year, up from current levels but well below the 2006 total of 350,000 units. European demand is stronger, boosted by growing sales of new and used trucks in the eastern half of the region, and Volvo last month raised its market forecast to about 330,000 heavy trucks this year, an increase from a historically strong total of more than 290,000 units in 2006. The firm said shipments in Europe, which account for just over half of its sales, rose 1 percent in January through May, translating into a 0.4 percent rise in May. In Asia, shipments surged 91 percent to 9,033 units in January through May on the back of the addition of deliveries of Nissan-branded trucks as of last month.
