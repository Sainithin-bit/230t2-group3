 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity fund Lone Star LS.UL is in talks with several strategic investors to sell Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS, Lone Star chairman John Grayken said in an interview with a local newspaper on Monday. 

 The fund may sell a remaining 51 percent stake in KEB even before a court ruling on its 2003 purchase of the South Korean lender, Grayken said in an e-mail to Maeil Business Newspaper. Maeil did not provide his quotes in English. Lone Star sold on Friday a 13.6 percent stake in KEB and two South Korean firms for a total of $2.3 billion.  The fund scrapped a $7.3 billion deal last year to sell KEB to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS amid a legal dispute with regulators over its $1.2 billion purchase of a majority of KEB in 2003. Further delays in a sale could hurt KEB's growth and may lead to a higher price tag, Grayken said. He declined to name potential bidders with whom Lone Star was talking. When asked about Kookmin, Hana Financial Group ( 086790.KS ) and the National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, Grayken said they can all make a strong strategic investor.
