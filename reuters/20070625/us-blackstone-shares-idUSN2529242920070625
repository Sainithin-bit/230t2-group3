 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Units of Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) fell nearly 8 percent on Monday due in part to concerns about the private equity firm's lofty valuation following its highly publicized market debut last week. 

 "I think the anesthesia has worn off with some investors," said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com. "Some felt (Blackstone) was a must own and I still agree that is the case, but it is a question of valuation and investors being nervous." Blackstone units closed down $2.62, or 7.5 percent, to $32.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. They are called units because Blackstone has taken part of its private partnership public, a difference from the standard IPO. The units rose 13 percent in their Friday market debut to $35.06, in contrast to the wider market, which fell sharply. Blackstone's initial public offering of 133.3 million units on Thursday priced at $31 apiece and was multiple times oversubscribed as investors eagerly lined up to get a stake in one of the world's most profitable and rapidly growing money managers. Analysts said the excitement around the IPO, which raised $4.13 billion, the highest amount by an IPO since 2002, was starting to wear thin. Concerns about Blackstone's tax costs rising are also fueling worries, as lawmakers mull whether to raise taxes on both the corporate rate the firms are charged and on their profits. "Blackstone in the asset management area looks richly valued compared to its competitors, using almost any financial yardstick," said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. Lefkowitz pointed to an article in the June 25 edition of financial newspaper Barron's that reported Blackstone was trading at about 20 times its projected 2008 earnings. That was double that of peers Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers, which fetch about only 10 times their earnings. Sal Morreale, who tracks IPOs for Cantor Fitzgerald, compared Blackstone's performance to hedge fund Fortress Investment Group LLC ( FIG.N ), which posted strong gains in its February market debut -- 68 percent in Fortress' case -- before shares fell into a more normal trading pattern. "Friday was the first day, everyone was enthused. Now the party is over ... Look at the graph on Fortress, it did the same thing." Fortress Investment Group, a publicly traded private equity firm and hedge fund, rose 68 percent on its opening day and February and quickly traded down. Blackstone's debut last week touched off a political storm among lawmakers that may also be weighing on investors. Several legislators raised concerns about tax loopholes used by private equity firms that go public and introduced a bill to effectively double the tax rate, although not until 2012 in Blackstone's case. "I'm sure Washington concerns are in there," said Morreale of Blackstone's decline. (Additional reporting by  Doris Frankel )
