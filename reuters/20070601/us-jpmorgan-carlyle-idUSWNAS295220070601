 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PQ Corp., the specialty chemicals business, said on Friday it was being sold to private equity buyout firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL for $1.5 billion. 

 Berwyn, Pennsylvania-based PQ Corp. was owned by CCMP Capital Advisors, a private equity firm that was formerly part of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s ( JPM.N ) private equity business. CCMP Capital bought PQ Corp. from the founding Elkinton family in February 2005. CCMP Capital had continued to manage the PQ Corp. investment on behalf of J.P. Morgan Partners. Reuters reported in April that PQ Corp. was put up for sale, citing two sources familiar with the situation. One source said at the time it could fetch more than $1 billion and could go to a private equity buyer. The price that the private equity buyers originally paid was undisclosed, although a report at the time in The Deal newspaper put it at $700 million. PQ Corp. operates 60 manufacturing sites in 19 countries. Demand for chemical companies has been high among both private equity firms and competitors as the industry consolidates. Specialty chemicals in particular have done well. In February, Lyondell Chemical Co. LYO.N agreed to sell its titanium dioxide business to Saudi Arabia's National Industrialization Co. 2060.SE for about $1.2 billion, a higher price than expected. The PQ Corp. deal is expected to close in the third quarter. Lehman Brothers LEH.N and J.P. Morgan advised PQ Corp. UBS ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) advised Carlyle.
