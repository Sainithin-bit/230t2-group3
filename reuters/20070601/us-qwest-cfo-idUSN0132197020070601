 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The former chief financial officer of Qwest Communications International Inc. ( Q.N ) was ordered to pay a total of $577,052 to settle charges that she helped defraud investors of billions of dollars, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Friday. 

 Robin Szeliga, Qwest's CFO from March 2001 to July 2002, was also suspended from practicing before the SEC as an accountant and barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company, the SEC said. The SEC alleged that from at least April 1, 1999 through March 31, 2002, Szeliga and others at the telecommunications company engaged in "massive financial fraud" that hid the true source of the company's revenue and earnings growth. In order to meet Qwest's aggressive revenue and earnings growth target, the company repeatedly relied on immediate revenue recognition from one-time sales of assets known as "IRUs" and certain equipment while falsely claiming that revenue was coming in, the SEC said. The SEC also alleged that Szeliga misrepresented the company's performance, failed to properly account for IRU sales transactions and caused the company to falsely report about $3 billion in revenue. It further alleged that Szeliga sold Qwest stock knowing that Qwest had issued materially false information to the public. Szeliga did not admit to or deny the SEC's allegations. A federal judge in Colorado ordered her to pay a penalty of $226,135 in what the SEC said were ill-gotten gains. She was also ordered to pay a $250,000 civil penalty and $100,917 in interest. Szeliga's lawyer could not be reached for comment. The SEC is proceeding with its civil fraud lawsuit against the company's former chief executive, Joseph Nacchio.
