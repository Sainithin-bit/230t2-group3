 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury home builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. ( HOV.N ) said on Friday that the subprime mortgage meltdown tripped up the industry just as some markets were showing signs of recovery. 

 The U.S. housing market, which began declining last year as potential buyers ran from higher interest rates and home-price sticker shock, has been exacerbated by the meltdown in lending to those with checkered credit histories, also referred to as subprime borrowers. After the close of the market on Thursday, Hovnanian reported a fiscal second-quarter loss of $30.7 million, or 49 cents per share, which included about $34 million in pretax charges for land-related write-downs and impairments. "We believe that the further slippage in housing demand in many locations was largely linked to the tightening of mortgage lending standards, particularly in the subprime market," Ara Hovnanian, the chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts. "That seemed to kick in just as the housing markets appeared to be getting their feet under them," he said. Hovnanian said it may incur future impairments but expects to generate positive cash flow in its next fiscal year. "We'll continue to monitor conditions in all of our markets, and if the weakness seen in the first few weeks of the third quarter continues, then we may have additional impairments in future quarters," Hovnanian said. Hovnanian said his company felt the effect on communities that relied on subprime buyers, but that mortgage tightening reached even further. "In other cases, our buyers may not need a subprime mortgage but they need to sell an existing home and somewhere in the food chain, the pool of qualified buyers for their home has shrunk based on mortgage qualifications," he said. To survive the market downturn, U.S. home builders have been working to strengthen their balance sheet and generate cash in a cash-intensive industry. Hovnanian is on the "cusp of becoming cash flow positive," but still expects to see negative cash flow for its fiscal full year ending November 2007 of about $175 million to $250 million. However, it expects to generate positive cash flow from operations in the fiscal year ending November 2008. Shares of Hovnanian fell $2.73 percent, or 69 cents, to $24.58 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where they were among the top 20 percentage losers.
