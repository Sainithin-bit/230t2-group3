 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prudential Securities Inc. ( PRU.N ), the second largest U.S. life insurer, has a decision to make in 20 days: what to do about its 38 percent stake in its joint brokerage venture with Wachovia Corp. WB.N. 

 There are no negative outcomes for an investment that was a legal and financial headache for Prudential as recently as last August, analysts said. The unit was formed 4 years ago with the aim of creating the third largest U.S. broker. Prudential, which must decide on the unit's future after Wachovia announced on Thursday that it would buy A.G. Edwards Inc. AGE.N, could double its return on its merger of the two brokerage units four years ago, "(This) goes down as a home run," said analyst Jeffrey Schuman of Keefe Bruyette Woods in a report. Wachovia's $6.8 billion takeover of regional broker A.G. Edwards would now create the second largest U.S. retail broker. Prudential currently faces the four options it negotiated with Wachovia when it entered into the joint venture in 2003. It can pay to avoid dilution of its investment, an amount the two companies are probably still working out, according to analysts. Or it could sell its stake to Wachovia, making an estimated $2.5 billion to $3 billion profit after taxes, according to analysts -- about twice the worth of Prudential's stake in the joint venture in 2003. Two other less extreme choices also exist, Prudential said. It can stand pat, holding on to a reduced stake in the brokerage. Or it can exercise a "look-back" that will allow it to wait for two years and then decide whether to add to the joint venture or sell it. Suneet Kamath of Bernstein Global Research said Prudential does not need more cash right now. "Prudential already has more than $6 billion of excess capital that they are struggling to redeploy," said Kamath. Taking a buyout could also force Prudential to pay more taxes on those profits. A HEADACHE The joint venture was a king-sized headache for Prudential through the middle of last year. In August, the insurer agreed to pay $600 million to settle investigations of improper mutual fund trading at the unit, avoiding criminal prosecution. But recently, as the stock market soared, the joint venture has been hugely successful. In its first quarter, Newark, New Jersey-based Prudential cited its joint venture as a key profit center, with adjusted operating income of $111 million -- up 61 percent from the year earlier. "We are very pleased with our investment in Wachovia Securities," said John Strangfeld, a vice chairman of Prudential in a statement. "(The combination with A.G. Edwards) takes the business to a new level." The succession picture at Prudential may also influence the life insurer's decision. Current Chief Executive Arthur Ryan, who negotiated the original deal, will retire in 2008 and may leave the decision to his possible successor, who could be Strangfeld or fellow vice chairman Mark Grier. "Management underscored that no option is off the table," said UBS analyst Andrew Kligerman in a report. "Ultimately Prudential's decision will be based on its view of the stock market," said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent LLC in an interview. "If they are bullish on equities, they will keep it because the investment will be worth more in two years."
