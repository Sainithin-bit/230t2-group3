 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp.'s WB.N deal to buy A.G. Edwards Inc. AGE.N for $6.8 billion has put other independent brokerages in focus for possible takeovers. 

 Analysts said potential targets include Florida-based Raymond James Financial Inc. ( RJF.N ), Stifel Financial Inc. ( SF.N ) and privately held Edward Jones -- the latter two based in St. Louis, like A.G. Edwards. On Thursday, following Wachovia's announced deal, shares of Raymond James rose 7.3 percent and Stifel rose 8 percent. "They are very attractive targets," said Aite Group analyst Adam Honore. "Raymond James probably is the number one target left out there." Honore said Wachovia's deal puts the heat on rival banks to make similar moves. "There is a lot of pressure on the people who compete with Wachovia in specific markets to beef up their brokerage arms," he said. "To find a nice regional (brokerage) with some self-clearing capabilities would be a nice feather in their cap." But Raymond James Chief Executive Thomas James said in a statement the company remains committed to independence. While Ronald Kruszewski, chief executive of Stifel, said in an interview: "First of all, we are attractive -- we are a great firm. Second of all, we see no reason to sell." "Selling today from a financial perspective makes no sense to me," Kruszewski added, though he would always consider what was best for shareholders. Edward Jones's managing partner and chief executive, Jim Weddle, said in an interview he had "no interest whatsoever" in the takeover speculation surrounding his firm and that "nobody has called." Weddle added: "Whenever you have a merger or an acquisition you have a kind of a compromise of your values and your culture, and we are not willing to do that." Asked if he would consider an attractive offer, he said: "The answer would be no." He said Edward Jones had received offers over the years and previous bosses had said 'no.' "And I'm saying no. We have no reason to even listen." OLDER AND WEALTHIER Wachovia said it would buy A.G. Edwards to create the second-largest U.S. retail brokerage in a bid to win more business from baby boomers as they grow older and wealthier. Wachovia said it was attracted by the demographic backdrop of A.G. Edwards' business -- aging baby boomers and the management of retirement assets. The combined brokerage, to be called Wachovia Securities, would have 14,784 brokers, vaulting past Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and ranking behind Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N. Its $1.15 trillion of client assets would rank third, behind Merrill and Citigroup, Wachovia said. Such figures should grab the attention of Wachovia rivals keen to pursue similar takeovers of regional brokerages. "They want a ready-made sales force with access into these markets because they have got the branch structures," Aite's Honore said. "That's really the core of what they want -- their book of business basically." Edward Jones has roughly 10,500 financial advisers. Michael Poulos, managing director at consulting firm Oliver Wyman, said it was very difficult for rivals to grow their ranks of financial advisers organically. "That leaves some sort of corporate action -- trying to buy someone," Poulos said.
