 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group Inc. ( CSGN.VX ) will pay Enron Corp. creditors $61.5 million to settle a lawsuit related to equity transactions, the successor to the bankrupt energy trader said on Friday. 

 Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. said the settlement resolves all bankruptcy proceedings involving Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank did not admit wrongdoing. "We're pleased to have this bankruptcy matter fully behind us," said Credit Suisse spokeswoman Victoria Harmon. The settlement remains subject to approval of the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan. Credit Suisse had separately in May 2006 agreed to pay Enron $90 million in the so-called "MegaClaims" litigation to settle allegations it helped the company commit fraud. The Swiss bank won a victory in March when a federal appeals court threw out a $40 billion class-action investor lawsuit against it and Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N over their roles in Enron's downfall. The plaintiffs in that case are seeking review by the U.S. Supreme Court. Credit Suisse and Merrill did not participate in settlements that have netted more than $7 billion for investors. Enron Creditors Recovery Corp. legally changed its name from Enron Corp. on March 1. It exists to sell assets, pay debts and conduct litigation. The Houston-based company in April said it has distributed $11.5 billion to creditors. Enron said equity transactions cases remain pending against Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N and UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ). It said in April that Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) were the only remaining MegaClaims defendants, and that a trial on fraud and bankruptcy claims was set to begin in January 2008. Citigroup spokeswoman Shannon Bell, Deutsche Bank spokesman Ted Meyer and UBS spokesman Serge Steiner declined to comment on their banks' respective cases. A Bear Stearns spokesman did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Once the seventh-largest U.S. company, Enron filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in December 2001 amid an accounting scandal in which it hid billions of dollars of debt. It emerged from bankruptcy in November 2004. (Additional reporting by  Thomas Atkins  in Zurich)
