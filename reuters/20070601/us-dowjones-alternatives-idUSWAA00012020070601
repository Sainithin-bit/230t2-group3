 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co Inc.'s DJ.N board of directors said on Thursday that the company plans to consider alternatives for the company, including a $5 billion bid by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N to buy it. 

 The company also said a board representative would be present at discussions that the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones, holds with Murdoch and News Corp. The family earlier on Thursday said it would meet Murdoch, a softening of its earlier opposition to his $60-per-share offer for the company.
