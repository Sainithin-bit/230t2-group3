 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Friday cut its outlook for industry-wide U.S. auto sales in 2007, estimating annual sales of about 16.8 million vehicles, down from an earlier forecast of 17 million units. 

 "This downward revision is not a surprise, given the headwinds affecting the industry in the spring selling season and given what we anticipate will be the effects of the housing correction through the (second and third quarters) and probably lingering a bit into the fourth quarter," GM sales analyst Paul Ballew said on a conference call. Ballew also said he expected light vehicle sales to come in "just under" 16.5 million vehicles in 2007. GM's overall sales forecast includes some heavy-duty trucks that other automakers and analysts typically exclude from their forecasts.
