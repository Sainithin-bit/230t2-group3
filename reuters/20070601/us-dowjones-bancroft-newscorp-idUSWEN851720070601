 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The family that controls Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N said it will meet with News Corp. NWSa.N to discuss its $5 billion bid for the company, bringing the publisher of The Wall Street Journal a step closer to a sale. 

 "The family has reached consensus that the mission of Dow Jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization, which may include News Corporation," said the statement on Thursday from the Bancroft family, which controls 64 percent of Dow Jones's voting power. "( T )he family has advised the company's board that it intends to meet with News Corporation to determine whether ... it will be possible to ensure the level of commitment to editorial independence, integrity and journalistic freedom that is the hallmark of Dow Jones," the statement also said. "It means they're ready to sell," Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino said. "I think they're facing the reality of the situation -- that this is a one-time-only event." Most of the Bancrofts have opposed the bid over worries that ownership under News Corp. Chairman and Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch would tarnish the Journal's editorial reputation. Dow Jones is a more-than-century-old publisher of financial news, and is known especially at the Journal for its meticulous attempts to present news objectively. It also publishes investors newspaper Barron's, news Web site Marketwatch.com, and Dow Jones Newswires, which competes with Reuters Group Plc RTR.L in publishing financial news. Murdoch, an Australian-born press baron who publishes the New York Post and British newspaper the Times, built his media empire with a heavy reliance on celebrity scandal news and often flamboyant, eye-catching headlines and stories. At least one Bancroft family member and a major shareholder have said they think Murdoch controlling Dow Jones would erode the company's reputation for reliable business news. The Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, which represents Dow Jones employees, still opposes the bid, said Steve Yount, the group's president. "There's nothing that's happened in the past month that has made us change our opposition to the News Corp. approach to Dow Jones," he said. "We think it's bad for the independence and integrity of the paper. ... It's also bad, we believe, for the employees of Dow Jones." But the $60-per-share bid, a 67 percent premium to the company's share price before Dow Jones made the bid public, is a persuasive price for the company's outside shareholders. A spokesman for T Rowe Price, which holds about 15 percent of Dow Jones based on Reuters data, said on Wednesday the Bancrofts should consider Murdoch's offer. Earlier that day, the company's chief investment officer told the Financial Times that $60 was a fairly attractive price. The family also said it is willing to consider other bidders and options for the company. Veteran U.S. newspaper analyst John Morton said he doubts that meeting Murdoch will change the Bancrofts' minds. "I don't think this is a capitulation. This is a family and I suspect that most of the majority of the family that opposes the Murdoch bid has some obligation to resolve their concerns," Morton said. "I can't envision a scenario in which the family essentially gives up control. They might bring in a partner but not a controlling partner." A Dow Jones spokeswoman and a News Corp. spokesman were not immediately available for comment. Hugh Bancroft III, one of the family members, declined to comment, and other Bancroft family members and their legal representatives did not return phone calls seeking comment. Dow Jones shares rose to $58.50 in after-hours electronic trading. They had closed up 46 cents at $53.31 on the New York Stock Exchange earlier in the day.
