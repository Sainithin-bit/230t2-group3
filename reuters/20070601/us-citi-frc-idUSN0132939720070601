 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) will keep Bisys Group Inc.'s BSG.N unit, Financial Research Corp. (FRC), when it buys the financial services provider, a Citi official said on Friday. 

 The decision puts to rest market speculation that Citi might sell Boston-based FRC after its planned acquisition of Bisys closes, which is expected in the second half of 2007. "It's a hot property and a property that we will maintain because of its need in the industry," Andrew Smith, head of Citi's North America funds and securities services, told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry convention. "It's very unique. It's very focused on a very specific operation," Smith said. "Research firms have been contacting us to say, 'What are you doing with this (FRC),'" he said. FRC, known for its monthly mutual fund flow data, was founded more than 20 years ago by Neil Bathon, who left the firm in 2006. FRC has more than 200 clients for its research and strategic consulting business, including most of the large fund groups. Smith said retaining FRC would also help Citi broaden its services "to be that trusted adviser and that one-stop shop for our customer, it's important that we provide some level of research as well," he said. Citi announced a deal in May to buy Bisys for $1.45 billion that also included selling Bisys' retirement and insurance services units to private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co. for about $645 million. Paul Galant, chief executive of Citi's Global Transaction Services business, said there was "very little overlap" between Citi's operations and the Bisys operations it is buying. "We bought it because of the people. I expect that we are going to retain the vast majority of what we bought," Galant said.
