 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - CKX Inc. CKXE.O, the owner of rights to the Elvis Presley and Muhammad Ali names and the "American Idol" television show, said it would be taken private in a $1.33 billion buyout led by its chief executive. 

 Shares of the New York-based company soared as much as 44 percent following the announcement. Shareholders would receive $13.75 in cash and one share of FX Luxury Realty LLC for each share of CKX, the company said. FX Luxury is an affiliate of CEO Robert Sillerman that has real estate interests in Las Vegas as well as licenses to use Elvis Presley's and Muhammad Ali's names in the development of real estate and attractions. The cash portion of the offer represents a 29 percent premium to CKX's closing share price of $10.63 on Thursday. On Friday, shares soared to a high of $15.34 before settling at $14.31 in late morning trade on Nasdaq. As of March 31, CKX had about 97 million shares outstanding, according to a regulatory filing. The management group involved in the deal includes "Idol" creator Simon Fuller, the company said in a statement. The deal would be accomplished through a merger with 19X Inc., a private company owned by Sillerman and Fuller. It would be funded through a combination of equity and debt financing.
