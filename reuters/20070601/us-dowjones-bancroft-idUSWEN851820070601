 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The family that controls Dow Jones & Co Inc. DJ.N said on Thursday it plans to meet with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N to discuss News Corp.'s $5 billion bid for Dow Jones. 

 "After a detailed review of the business of Dow Jones and the evolving competitive environment in which it operates, the Family has reached consensus that the mission of Dow Jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization, which may include News Corporation," the family said in a statement. The family also "intends to meet with News Corporation to determine whether, in the context of the current or any modified News Corporation proposal, it will be possible to ensure the level of commitment to editorial independence, integrity and journalistic freedom that is the hallmark of Dow Jones."
