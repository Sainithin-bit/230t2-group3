 DETROIT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE said on Friday its U.S. sales rose 4 percent in May, boosted by strong demand for its Jeep brand vehicles and big incentives on its Dodge Ram pickup truck and minivans. 

 The German automaker said May sales rose to 221,164 vehicles. Sales at Chrysler Group, which consists of Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler brands, rose 4 percent to 199,393 units. Sales at its Mercedes-Benz division rose 1 percent to 21,771 vehicles. The results were not adjusted for an extra selling day in May 2007.
