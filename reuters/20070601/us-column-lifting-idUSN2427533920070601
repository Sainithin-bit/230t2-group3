 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The mortgage-backed securities market and Wall Street are becoming a roadblock for U.S. banks trying to dig out of the subprime mess. 

 The standard accounting practices and contractual terms used to create the securities leave little room for banks to modify portfolios with rising defaults and delinquencies. And with finger-pointing among regulators, it is unclear if the industry can find any solutions to speed up a recovery in the subprime mortgage market for borrowers with poor and untraditional credit histories. Since the 1970s, financial institutions have built the $6.4 trillion mortgage-backed securities market by pooling individual mortgage loans and reselling them to investors as securities. But to do so, they also created a complex web of legal structures and accounting methods that allow the securities to qualify as "special purpose entities." That treatment meant banks could boost profits from their mortgage loans, while keeping mortgage-backed securities off their balance sheets. It also assured investors who bought the securities that they were relatively independent of the bank that issued them, market experts say. But as banks try to fix the fallout from rising defaults among subprime mortgages, they are finding those very legal and accounting rules stand in their way. This worries Lewis Ranieri, a bond trader often called the father of the mortgaged-backed securities market. "We've never had to do substantial restructurings in housing in mortgage securities," Ranieri said at a Milken Institute conference. "There are a whole host of unforeseen technical problems if you try to restructure or do large amounts of restructuring within the security, some of which, we had never even heard of or thought about." That is also worrisome to regulators and lawmakers who fear the subprime fallout may be extended because it is so difficult to fix. A loan often becomes delinquent before a default and banks feel that, if the rules allowed them to modify the loans, they could reduce the ultimate losses. The concern was expressed in April by Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Bair convened a closed-door meeting with industry and accounting executives, regulators and community groups to discuss how mortgages can be modified before borrowers default on their payments. She said then that loan modification would be a challenge and called on investors and trustees who hold the securitized products to support flexibility for the servicer, who collects monthly payments. "The servicers do not have unlimited flexibility," she said. In fact, some servicers are finding they have almost no ability to modify loans without waiting at least 30 days after a borrower defaults. "The contracts are entered into at the inception of the transaction and, in order to modify them, you usually have to get some consent of the security holders," said Mark Harris, an attorney specializing in corporate securities at Andrews Kurth in Dallas. That can be an expensive process since the number of security holders could often fill a large stadium. Modifying the loans can also breach some of the accounting rules for special purpose entities. "Once you sell it, (the accounting) says you can't go back and touch it," said Bala Dharan, an accounting professor at Rice University's Jesse Jones Graduate School of Management. "It's as if you claimed you sold your house and then two weeks later, you need to come back and fix the garage. The new owner is not going to be really pleased about that." U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, who chairs the House Financial Services subcommittee on financial institutions, has said she will ask the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to allow some flexibility with the rule that governs accounting of special purpose entities, known as FAS 140. Maloney, who held a hearing last month on the role of the secondary market in subprime mortgage lending, wants to see if the rule could allow servicers to modify mortgages when borrowers are in default or when default is "reasonably foreseeable." If the FASB determines that loans can be modified when a default is "reasonably foreseeable," some believe it could help troubled homeowners who are facing monthly payments with much higher interest rates over the next few years. The FASB says it is aware of concerns about FAS 140, but suggests it is the companies, not the rule-maker, that have chosen this particular method of accounting. "GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) does not dictate how companies run their businesses or write loans," FASB spokesman Gerard Carney said. "It's merely a communication of those decisions to their stakeholders."
