 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical Co.( DOW.N ), declined on Friday to comment on recent rumors Dow is interested in buying BASF AG BASF.DE, while adding the deals that interest him are the ones that fit gaps the company has identified. 

 "We'll never comment on a rumor like that, but I will say that between Dow and BASF you are looking at two of the world's leading chemical companies and reality has to set in on do-ability," Liveris said in an interview with Reuters Television. "The barriers to doing deals like that are not just financial." BASF shares rose on Thursday with traders citing renewed market chatter that Dow, the largest U.S. chemical maker, was bidding for its German rival. But Liveris said he would like to grow the company's water solutions and coatings businesses. "I want to have a water business that is $2 (billion) or $3 billion within two or three years. I want a coatings business or a buildings solutions business that is equally as big in two or three years," Liveris said. "These are the areas where we are going to go hunting." Dow's water solutions business, which makes products focusing on contaminant removal, has annual revenue of around $400 million. Liveris also said Dow plans to increase revenue from its health and nutrition business, which makes products such as Natreon oils that are virtually free of trans fats and saturated fats. Liveris also declined to comment on the U.S. Securities and Exchange investigation into whether there was any unusual trading in Dow's shares earlier this year. "I cannot comment on the SEC probe one way or the other. It has been written about in the press. Others have mentioned it. I have never mentioned it," Liveris said. The inquiry by the U.S. securities regulator, which is still in the informal stage, centers on Dow's firings of two senior officials, who were accused by the company of having engaged in unauthorized talks to sell the company.
