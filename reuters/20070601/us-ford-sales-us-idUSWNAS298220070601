 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Friday U.S. May vehicle sales fell 6.8 percent from a year earlier as higher gas prices and a weaker housing market hurt consumer demand and the automaker cut back on fleet sales. 

 The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 259,470 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 278,546 vehicles a year earlier. Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and are not adjusted for the extra selling day in April 2007.
