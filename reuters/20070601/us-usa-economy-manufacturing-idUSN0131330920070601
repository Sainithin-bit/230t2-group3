 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing grew a bit more rapidly in May as factory managers restocked depleted inventories, according to a survey published on Friday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 55.0 last month, its highest since April 2006, from 54.7 in April. The consensus Wall Street forecast had been 54.0. The figures supported the view that performance in the sector, while not quite stellar, is not slowing either. "Manufacturing is showing signs of the potential for a rebound," said John Miller, head of fund management at Nuveen Investments. Analysts said the data would likely reinforce the view that the economy should pick up momentum again as the year progresses following an anemic first quarter. New orders were at their highest since February 2006, although hiring remained subdued. The survey's employment index fell to 51.9 from 53.1. Prices paid eased, but remained at levels likely to worry policy-makers. An inflation gauge favored by the Federal Reserve published earlier painted a more benign picture, however, suggesting price pressures at the factory level are not being passed on to consumers. Another report on Friday showed better-than-expected employment growth in the overall economy, but also a net loss of 19,000 manufacturing jobs.
