 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc. ( ABT.N ) on Friday said it submitted its application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its drug-coated stent called Xience and expects to start selling the heart device in the first half of 2008. 

 Abbott's stent, a tiny wire mesh tubular device that is inserted into diseased arteries, would compete with Boston Scientific Corp.'s ( BSX.N ) Taxus stent and Johnson & Johnson's ( JNJ.N ) Cypher stent, the only two such devices approved on the U.S. market. Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) also has a competing device under regulatory review. An Abbott spokeswomen said Xience, launched in Europe and Asia in October 2006, has captured a share of the market in the low double digits and expects to have market share in the mid-to-high 20 percent range by year end. She said Abbott is predicting similar success in the United States. But the device will enter the U.S. market during tough times. Drug-coated, or drug-eluting, stents -- which have been very profitable for their manufacturers -- have been a source of controversy during the past year. While many doctors have turned to drug-eluting stents over bare metal stents because they tend to keep vessels clear whereas vessels with conventional bare metal stents often re-clog, the drug-eluting variety can carry a rare but potentially fatal risk for blood clots. The devices came under fire again earlier this year at the American College of Cardiology meeting, when a study suggested stents were no better than standard drug treatments in reducing deaths and heart attacks in patients with minor chest pain. Later, at a presentation at a Bank of America investment conference, Abbott Chief Financial Officer Tom Freyman raised the company's 2007 global sales forecast for rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira to more than $2.8 billion from the prior outlook of more than $2.7 billion. The revision was based on trends seen so far this year and the strength of the recent launch for treatment of Crohn's disease in the United States. Humira is indicated for rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Crohn's. Shares of Abbott were down 35 cents to $56.00 in midday New York Stock Exchange trade.
