 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - James Packer, Australia's richest man, has handed control of his family's media assets to private equity partner CVC CVC.UL and offloaded events and ticketing interests to focus on a fast-expanding gaming empire. 

 Packer's Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. PBL.AX(PBL) said on Friday it had agreed to sell a further 25 percent stake in its 50:50 media joint venture to CVC for A$515 million ($426 million). PBL also agreed to sell its interests in online ticketing business Ticketek and Sydney sports stadium Acer Arena to PBL Media for A$210 million. The total return to PBL from both deals is A$725 million. CVC will have 75 percent control of key Australian media assets, including Australia's largest TV network and a stable of magazines, under the deal. PBL will retain a 25 percent interest, and Packer will keep a seat on the PBL Media board. The deal, flagged on Monday after news leaked to newspapers, was a further sell-down by Packer of key Australian media assets inherited from his late father Kerry. "Given market conditions A$515 million is a good price," Commonwealth Securities analyst Craig Shepherd said, referring to Australia's tough advertising market. PBL, which plans to split into separate gaming and media companies, tipped half its media assets into a joint venture with CVC last year. PBL's only remaining media interests after the deal will be a 25 percent stake in pay-TV group Foxtel, 50 percent of Premier Media Group which owns Fox Sports, and employment Web site Seek. PBL Media will own the Nine Network, ACP Magazines, NBN Television, Ticketek, Acer Arena and interests in online businesses ninemsn, myhome and the Australian News Channel (Sky News). The deal follows last month's abolition of foreign ownership limits on Australian media, which previously prevented CVC from owning more than 50 percent of PBL Media. CVC partner Adrian MacKenzie said the deal was made on similar terms to its initial 50 percent purchase and expressed confidence with PBL Media's existing management team. "We believe there are a number of exciting initiatives to add value to the business," MacKenzie said in a statement. Shares in PBL, which rose 1.2 percent on the news on Monday, were trading 1.3 percent weaker at A$21.42 at 0325 GMT. PBL said earlier this month it planned to separate the company's fast-expanding gaming and casinos operations from the media business and return A$2 billion to shareholders as part of a recapitalization. PBL has a casinos joint venture in Macau and last month bought a stake in a Las Vegas casino developer and nine Canadian casinos. It wants to expand its U.S. gaming interests. ($1=A$1.21)
