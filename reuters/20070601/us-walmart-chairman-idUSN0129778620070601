 FAYETTEVILLE, Arkansas  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) Chairman Rob Walton said on Friday that the retailer's board and the Walton family have confidence in Chief Executive Officer Lee Scott. 

 He made the comments at Wal-Mart's annual shareholders meeting, which comes as the company has struggled with sluggish growth at its U.S. stores, a lagging stock price, and criticism from labor groups for its pay and health care benefits. "It hasn't been an easy year, this last year," Walton told the meeting. But he expressed confidence in Scott and thanked him for his work for the company. Rob Walton is the son of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton.
