 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of new U.S. jobs climbed 
by an unexpectedly brisk 157,000 in May on a surge of hiring in 
service businesses while hiring in the factory sector continued 
to decline, Labor Department data showed on Friday. 

  The total of new jobs in May handily outstripped Wall 
Street economists' forecasts for 130,000 jobs and fit with 
other recent evidence that the pace of economic activity was 
bouncing back from a soft patch in the first three months of 
the year. It may also raise fears about the possibility that 
tight labor markets will fan wage and price pressures.  The monthly unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.5 percent 
in May.  The department revised April's job-creation figures to show 
that 80,000 jobs were created instead of the 88,000 it reported 
a month ago.  All the new May jobs came in service-producing industries, 
which produced 176,000 more jobs while 19,000 were lost from 
the goods-producing sector. Among service businesses, there was 
healthy job growth in financial activities, business services, 
education, the hospitality industry and in government.  But another 19,000 jobs were shed by manufacturing 
businesses and there was no job growth at all in construction 
industries.  Average hours of work rose slightly to 33.9 from 33.8 in 
April, though overtime hours fell slightly to 4.1 in May from 
4.2 in April.  Federal Reserve Governor Randall Kroszner, in a speech 
delivered on Friday in Greece, said the U.S. central bank 
expected a rebound in growth after a weak first quarter and 
said policy-makers were wary about inflation risks.  "The high level of resource utilization continues to have 
the potential to put additional upward pressure on inflation," 
Kroszner told the Institute of International Finance.
