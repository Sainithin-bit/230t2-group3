 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. apartment owner Archstone-Smith Trust ( ASN.N ) will have to pay a $235 million break-up fee, roughly 1 percent of the deal price, to end a proposed deal to be acquired by affiliates of Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Tishman Speyer, the company said in a regulatory filing on Friday. 

 The break-up fee, about 1 percent of the price, is low by merger standards, as most run about 3 percent, said UBS analyst Alexander Goldfarb. "They have a fiduciary responsibility," Goldfarb said. "They're trying to allow for a process to occur should one occur." To be credible a competing bid would have to be at least $4 per share higher than the proposed bid, Goldfarb said. However, Goldfarb said the proposed price of $60.75 per share is fair. On Tuesday, Denver-based Archstone said it had agreed to be acquired for $60.75 per share, or a total of $22.2 billion including the assumption of debt, by a partnership sponsored by Tishman and Lehman. The deal is worth about $15.25 billion -- excluding convertible debt and including operating units that can be converted into shares -- plus the assumption of debt. Archstone, whose board approved the takeover deal, also would have to pay up to $10 million to cover Lehman's and Tishman's expenses, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the terms of the deal, Archstone Chief Executive Officer R. Scot Sellers will contribute $8.2 million to the new company, giving him an equity share in the new entity, according to the filing. He also will be permitted to negotiate with a new buyer, should a rival bidder surface and the board view a competing bid superior, the filing said.
