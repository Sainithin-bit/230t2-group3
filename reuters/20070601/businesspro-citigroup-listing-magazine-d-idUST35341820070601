 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup ( C.N ) is likely to list its 
Japan banking unit on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as early as 
July, an online Japanese magazine said on Friday. 

  The U.S. financial conglomerate is likely to list Citibank 
Japan, its retail and corporate banking unit, on the Tokyo 
exchange through an initial public offering, online magazine 
Facta said in an article dated Friday.  Facta is a relatively new online financial publication.  A spokeswoman for Citigroup in Japan, Atsuko Yoshitsugu, 
declined to comment on the article.  A spokeswoman for the Tokyo exchange did not comment on 
whether or not Citigroup was planning an IPO on the bourse.  In February the Nikkei business daily said the firm was 
planning to list depository receipts on the Tokyo exchange.  "Citigroup is committed to Japan for the long term and has 
been reviewing its business strategies which could include 
listing Citigroup on the TSE," the firm said in a statement in 
February.  According to the magazine, Citigroup would not list its 
depository receipts, but would carry out an IPO of the unit.  The financial firm has been expanding its presence in the 
world's second-largest economy.  Earlier this year it announced plans to set up a Japanese 
holding company and double its retail branch network.  It also cemented its largest ever Asian acquisition, a $7.7 
billion buyout offer for brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T
