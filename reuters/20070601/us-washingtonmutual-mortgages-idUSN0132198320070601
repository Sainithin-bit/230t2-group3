 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), one of the largest U.S. mortgage lenders, on Friday said improved underwriting standards have led to a reduction in the number of new subprime mortgages going into default quickly. 

 The biggest U.S. savings and loan is one of many mortgage providers to tighten their loan standards. Industrywide easing in 2005 and 2006 allowed many borrowers with weak credit to obtain home loans they couldn't afford. A surge in the number of borrowers who missed their first or second payments made it tougher for many lenders to sell loans, and cut the value of loans they kept on their books. "We have seen a significant difference in the performance of the '07 vintage of subprime originations from the '06," said Kerry Killinger, chief executive of Seattle-based Washington Mutual, at a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. conference. "What I have seen so far in the way of first payment defaults, early payment defaults and early delinquencies suggests materially improved performance," he added. "That would confirm (that) underwriting standards have improved and pricing has improved in subprime products in '07 versus '06." Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N and Wells Fargo & Co. ( WFC.N ) are among other lenders that offer subprime mortgages, and which have tightened underwriting standards. Rising defaults have led to the demise or sale of dozens of subprime mortgage providers, most prominently New Century Financial Corp. NEWCQ.PK, which is liquidating. Washington Mutual's home loans unit lost $113 million in the first quarter, including a $164 million loss attributable to subprime loans. That contributed to a 20 percent decline in overall profit, to $784 million. Killinger said he expects the home loans unit to return to profitability this year, and that subprime loans still "provide a valuable source of credit" to many customers. To cope with the housing slowdown, Washington Mutual cut 10,688 jobs, or 18 percent, in the year ended March 31. It also reduced subprime loan volume 51 percent. Washington Mutual shares closed Friday up 58 cents at $44.30. They are down 3 percent this year, while the 24-member Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX is little changed.
