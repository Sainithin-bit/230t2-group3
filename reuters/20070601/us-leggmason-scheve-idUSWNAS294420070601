 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Money manager Legg Mason Inc. ( LM.N ) on Friday announced another high-profile change in its top ranks, saying chief administrative officer Timothy Scheve will leave to take the top job at another company. 

 Scheve, who worked at Baltimore-based Legg Mason for 23 years, will become president and chief executive officer of Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, a Philadelphia-based securities brokerage firm, in August, Legg Mason said. Legg Mason said its chairman, Raymond Mason, will oversee the administrative units that previously reported to Scheve, increasing the 70-year-old executive's workload. In April, Mason's hand-picked successor decided he did not want the top job, forcing Mason to abandon his plans to retire soon and to stay on at the firm for at least two more years.
