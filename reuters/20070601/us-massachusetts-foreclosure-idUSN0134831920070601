 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Massachusetts on Friday banned foreclosure "rescue" schemes where for-profit lenders promise to help homeowners at risk of losing their property but often take possession of the houses themselves. 

 The emergency measure takes effect immediately and will be in force for 90 days, said Martha Coakley, the state's attorney general, calling it the best way to protect homeowners at a time when foreclosure rates are surging across the state. The state legislature would have to approve any permanent ban. For-profit lenders often develop "rescue" schemes where they promise to assist homeowners struggling with mortgage payments and facing foreclosure. Sometimes they take over the homeowners' deeds. But there are often no guarantees that the homeowners, who signed over their deeds, will get their equity back or be able to stay in the homes. "These 'rescuers' take a bad situation -- foreclosure -- and make it worse by liquidating any remaining equity in homes to their own advantage and the homeowners' detriment," Coakley said in a statement. The new rule does not apply to family members or nonprofit or community housing organizations who may try to help. In Massachusetts, where housing prices notched double-digit growth between 1995 and 2004, foreclosure filings surged 70 percent last year to a record 19,487 homeowners, as single-family home prices fell for the first time since 1993. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston blames subprime loans for much of the problem, saying they accounted for more than two-thirds of the state's foreclosure filings in the third quarter of 2006, even though they made up just 12 percent of all mortgages.
