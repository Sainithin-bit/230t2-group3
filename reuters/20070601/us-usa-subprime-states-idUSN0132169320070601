 COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (Reuters) - As regulators in Washington hammer out a final directive on how the mortgage industry should provide hybrid products, state regulators say the regulation must also address the ability of borrowers to repay loans on their homes. 

 An increase in delinquencies and foreclosures among subprime borrowers, or those with poor credit, has shaken the housing market nationwide and prompted Congressional hearings about how to help borrowers. "Don't put people in these exploding ARMs (adjustable rate mortgages) unless you've carefully underwritten them and there is a real prospect they ... can repay the debt," North Carolina Commissioner of Banks Joe Smith told Reuters. Smith and other state officials who gathered at the Conference of State Bank Supervisors annual meeting are worried about rising foreclosures. With little or no power of their own to regulate mortgage brokers, state officials say it is crucial that federal regulators address how to prevent consumers receiving mortgages they are not qualified for. Some mortgage brokers have been eager to use a borrower's stated income -- without verification -- to get bigger fees by helping consumers qualify for larger loans and more expensive houses. Such stated income loans have become known as "liar loans" in the subprime market. The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency are trying to finalize guidance on exotic subprime mortgages like "2-28" loans that reset after the first two years. The Fed also plans a June 14 hearing to consider ways to expand its oversight of mortgage market and three state regulators will speak at the event. "Whether that burden (of verifying income) is going to be on the underwriter, the lender, the originator, who knows?," said Linda Watters, commissioner of Michigan's Office of Financial and Insurance Services. "But absolutely I think that's important because we know cases where there's fraud and people are manipulating the numbers." Watters said her office is investigating several dozen cases of potential mortgage fraud carried out by rings involving appraisers, mortgage bankers and title companies. "Everybody (was) working together to try to game the system" by overstating home values, she said. In Michigan, foreclosures are concentrated in the Detroit area, where the unemployment rate was 7.1 percent in April. The U.S. jobless rate in April was 4.5 percent. "It's a convergence of a lot of issues that have compounded the problem," Watters said. "We are seeing the number of foreclosures rising at a fairly rapid rate." Two federal regulators have already said the issue of a borrower's stated income is on their radar screen. OCC chief John Dugan voiced concern recently about how income has not been properly documented to demonstrate a borrower's ability to make monthly mortgage payments. He said the practice of relying on stated income without verification invites potential fraud. FDIC Vice Chairman Martin Gruenberg told the state regulators that "the most elementary notion of predatory lending -- the failure to underwrite based on the borrower's ability to pay -- became prevalent" in the subprime market. So far, one state, Georgia, in 2005 pushed ahead with its own legislation to crack down on mortgage fraud. Arizona and Texas also are currently considering legislation. In Massachusetts, the commissioner of the division of banks, Steven Antonakes, has drafted preliminary legislation that seeks to criminalize mortgage fraud and ban foreclosure rescue scams. It would also require copies of foreclosure notices to be sent to his office detailing location of the property, the type of mortgage and names of the broker, lender and originator. "That data set would give us much better information in terms of tracking hot spots for foreclosures geographically or whether there are patterns of abuse," he said. In January, the state bank regulators' group will launch a registry system for mortgage brokers. So far, 33 states have signed onto the program, but some big states, such as California, remain undecided. For more about the subprime mortgage crisis, see <ID:nN16195443>.
