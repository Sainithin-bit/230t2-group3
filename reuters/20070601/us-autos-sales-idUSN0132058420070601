 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Demand for passenger cars amid high gas prices drove U.S. sales increases in May for General Motors Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Nissan Motor Co. as industrywide sales rebounded slightly from a weak spring. 

 Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) bucked the trend by posting a decline of 10 percent and 1.4 percent, respectively, in May sales. Ford also surrendered the industry's No. 2 spot to Toyota for the month. GM ( GM.N ), which beat Wall Street expectations with a nearly 5 percent sales gain, cut its forecast for industrywide sales in 2007 but said retail sales likely had stabilized after a weak spring that had raised concerns about a deepening slump tied to a slower U.S. housing market. GM forecast U.S. light vehicle sales of less than 16.5 million units in 2007, down from 16.6 million sold in 2006. "This downward revision is not a surprise, given the headwinds affecting the industry in the spring selling season and given what we anticipate will be the effects of the housing correction," GM chief sales analyst Paul Ballew said. Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ), which has been taking U.S. market share from the Detroit-based automakers, overtook Ford in May as the No. 2 U.S. automaker after a higher-than-expected 10 percent increase in sales. "As fuel prices and consumer confidence rose, the industry saw a move to passenger cars, with retail business posting sharp gains over a very challenging April," Jim Lentz, Toyota's U.S. executive vice president, said. Nissan ( 7201.T ) sales rose 3 percent. Percentage sales changes were adjusted for an additional selling day last month. Chrysler Group DCXGn.DE, which announced a deal to be acquired by Cerberus Capital Management in May, posted a 4 percent sales gain on an unadjusted basis. Nissan U.S. sales chief Brad Bradshaw said high gasoline prices have dampened demand for fuel-thirsty SUVs, and many consumers appear to be shifting out of larger sedans to smaller cars. "The economic head winds are continuing to be out there," Bradshaw told Reuters. "I think fuel (prices) are still impacting a lot of people. Ballew estimated that the industry was tracking at a 16.3 million to 16.4 million sales rate in May, slightly better than expectations and the year-earlier tally of 16.2 million. FORD SALES WEAK Ford chief sales analyst George Pipas called May industry results "encouraging." "I think most manufacturers saw sales as having rebounded from April levels," he said. Overall industry sales in April were down at 16.27 million, the weakest tally since November. Ford's sales were dragged down by weak demand for its sedans and a planned cut in sales to daily rental fleets. Car sales fell 17.7 percent and truck sales were flat. Ford's retail or showroom sales were 3 percent lower because of weak demand during the last week of the month. Ford also said it would produce 640,000 cars and trucks in the third quarter in North America, barely changed from the same period a year ago. GM said it would produce 1.075 million vehicles in the third quarter, up 2 percent from a year earlier. Ford's retail or showroom sales were 3 percent lower than a year ago in May. While the company's truck sales were flat, demand for its best-selling and high-margin F-Series pickup trucks fell 11.7 percent. Last month, sales incentives offered to new-car buyers in the United States rose slightly, according to Edmunds.com, an auto industry tracking Web site. Edmunds.com estimated that the average manufacturer incentive on a new vehicle was $2,497 in May, up $44 from April. (Additional reporting by  Jui Chakravorty  and  Kevin Krolicki )
