 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A major Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N shareholder and former executive said on Friday he is disappointed by the Bancroft family's decision to consider selling the company to News Corp. NWSa.N, and urged the company to find a "more trustworthy" buyer. 

 Jim Ottaway Jr., 69, in an e-mailed statement said he is skeptical that News Corp. chief Rupert Murdoch's offer to establish an independent editorial board would guarantee Dow Jones's reputation for unbiased, accurate news reporting. "The best guarantee of the future editorial independence and unbiased news objectivity of Dow Jones and The Wall Street Journal is an owner who respects their brand name and integrity," Ottaway wrote.
