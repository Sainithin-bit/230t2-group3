 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) on Friday said its U.S. sales rose 3.2 percent in May, as strong demand for its sedans more than offset a big decline in truck sales. 

 The Japanese automaker sold 93,062 vehicles in the United States in May. U.S. sales of Nissan cars rose 20 percent, while truck sales fell 17.5 percent in May, Nissan North America sales chief Brad Bradshaw said. The results are adjusted for an extra selling day in May 2007.
