 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, the world's fifth-biggest carmaker, forecast on Tuesday rising profitability through 2009. 


 "Based on the divisions' projections, DaimlerChrysler should achieve a significant increase in profitability in the planning period of 2007 through 2009," it said in its 2006 annual report. "In the medium term we aim to achieve a return on net assets of at least 10 percent," it added. The share price was down 2.4 percent at 52.41 euros by 1300 GMT, when the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP was down 1.9 percent. The company said it assumed global economic growth would slow in 2007 and the euro would stay mostly firm. "Our planning is based on the assumption that compared with average exchange rates during 2006, the euro will appreciate against the dollar and the British pound, but will depreciate slightly against the Japanese yen," it said. Global demand for cars would grow this year, but not as quickly as in 2006 and with most expansion coming from emerging markets, it said. It saw the U.S. market for passenger cars and commercial vehicles easing this year to 17.0 million vehicles from 17.1 million, while western Europe would be flat at best and the Japanese car market would grow slightly. Its Mercedes Car Group premium division should at least equal this year its record 2006 unit sales as a second-half upturn offsets weaker first-half sales amid model changeovers for the Mercedes-Benz C-Class and Smart two-seater cars. It repeated its forecast that Mercedes would generate a 2007 operating margin of at least 7 percent despite a weak first quarter, with the division's profitability to continuously improve through 2009. Chrysler Group, which posted a 2006 operating loss of 1.12 billion euros ($1.48 billion) amid slumping demand for a product lineup that relied heavily on light trucks and sport utility vehicles, should benefit from a rejuvenated range of models, it said. It will roll out more than 20 new and 13 facelifted vehicles from 2007 to 2009, it said. "Already at the beginning of 2007, the Chrysler Group had a fairly new model range compared with its competitors. So the right conditions have now been created on the supply side in order to increase unit sales and further improve the division's market position worldwide," it said. It reiterated it expected sharp downturns in the U.S. and Japanese heavy trucks markets this year while it sought to keep sales in western Europe around 2006 levels. "We will also strengthen the division's competitive position with new products, which are expected to generate higher unit sales once again starting in the year 2008," it said.
