 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp. ( CVC.N ) on Tuesday posted a larger-than-expected fourth quarter loss due to discontinued operations, although subscriber numbers rose across its television, phone and high-speed Internet services. 


 The cable operator said its net loss was $23.9 million, or 8 cents a share, compared with a profit of $49.4 million or 17 cents a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected the company, which owns the Madison Square Garden arena in New York and cable TV networks AMC, IFC and WE, to post a loss of 2 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Cablevision said revenue rose to $1.69 billion from $1.49 billion. Analysts had forecast revenue of $1.66 billion. The Bethpage, New York-based company said basic video subscribers rose by 16,000, or 0.5 percent, to 3.1 million subscribers in the fourth quarter. It added 82,000 digital video subscribers, 75,000 high-speed Internet subscribers and 109,000 digital phone subscribers. Cablevision's subscriber growth missed the forecast of analyst Todd Mitchell at Kaufman Bros. He expected 105,000 digital video additions, 85,000 high-speed Internet subscribers and 115,000 digital phone additions. Cablevision beat Mitchell's forecast of 15,000 basic subscriber additions. Last month, Cablevision rejected a bid to take the company private by the Dolan family, who are its controlling shareholders.
