 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks plunged on Tuesday, joining a global equities rout sparked by the biggest one-day drop in Chinese stocks in a decade. 


 The equities slide set off a flight from risky assets and emerging markets and into the relative safety of government bonds.   COMMENTARY: THOMAS METZOLD, VICE PRESIDENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, EATON VANCE, BOSTON: "Only time will tell if this is a correction or more. But I feel we had gotten the point of feeling that risk was nonexistent and maybe people have finally gotten a wake-up call. I feel this must have something to do with the subprime mortgage market and some major banks like HSBC and Citi and JPMorgan Chase have some pretty substantial exposure and I'm not sure that anyone has gotten their hands around this. I would not be surprised it a hedge fund or two got into trouble." HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, JOHNSON ILLINGTON ADVISORS, ALBANY, NEW YORK: "It's everything. It's subprime mortgages, China. Those are the two big things. It's hard to figure out which is more important. But both of them are pretty darn important. And both of them carry with them negative implications for the U.S. economy and earnings. I think the markets have overstated the outcome, but there's no question that the markets at long last are reflecting some concerns, legitimate concerns." GARY LISENBEE, PRESIDENT, METROPOLITAN WEST CAPITAL LLC, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA ($8 BILLION UNDER MANAGEMENT): "Obviously things were kicked off by what happened in Asia, and there's some volatile markets over there. I think the market was a little vulnerable to sell-off here. Personally, I think the underlying fundamentals are strong. I've been a long believer of this global growth theme. I think we're going to continue to see strong growth globally... "It wouldn't surprise me if the market has some kind of correction, maybe 5 percent to 8 percent, just to throw some numbers out there. I don't see it as the beginning of the end or of any sustained bear market or downturn because there is still a tremendous amount of liquidity out there. The supply-demand situation is positive for the equity markets. At some point investors will become opportunistic and we'll see the buying come in. Whether it's tomorrow it's tough to say, or if we get a little more sell-off before that happens." CHRIS LOW, ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "What is striking to us is not the big move in Chinese stocks, but the contagion driving stocks down around the world. For the past couple of years, contagion was a thing of the past. Several emerging markets sold off hard last year after Japan started to raise rates, for instance, purportedly due to the unwinding of the carry trade ... Still, a synchronous drop in equities worldwide is noteworthy, especially since we have escaped this sort of thing for so long. Like the events in the subprime market in the past couple of months, and the fact that we no longer think of homes as a suitable part of a financial portfolio, this looks to be one more sign that the global liquidity glut is drying up." TIM HARTZELL, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICERS, KANALY TRUST CO., HOUSTON, TEXAS: "The sell-off is indicative of the restrictive monetary policies you see around the world. You see Japan raising rates slightly. A couple of weeks ago, China changed the reserve requirement. "Slowly but surely on the margin, liquidity is starting to be pulled back off the table. "So the first thing investors would do is go into their most risky assets and start bringing down their risk profiles. There's going to be a little more of a flight to quality. So you still see bigger cap names do a little bit better." ANDRE BAKHOS, PRESIDENT OF PRINCETON FINANCIAL GROUP IN PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "The theme seems to be the chatter about the yen carry trade unwinding. There's a lot of bewilderment out there. As the afternoon has progressed there seems to be a sense of panic among some professional investors....There's talk about margin calls. "There seems to be just an air of nothing is safe anymore--there's nowhere to go and people are rotating into bonds as a safe haven....No one right now wants to be in equities. " "With the velocity and magnitude of the afternoon's fall, it makes one stop and think that there may be more spillover tomorrow." TODGER ANDERSON, CHAIRMAN, DENVER INVESTMENT ADVISORS LLC, DENVER: "In a nutshell, this is a healthy correction. In other words, we all know the markets run hard and fast. This is just a correction reminding people something they know, that stocks don't go to the sky. It's time for the heavily leveraged and momentum players to get scared a little bit."
