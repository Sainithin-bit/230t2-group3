 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ), which plans to buy rival XM Satellite Radio XMSR.O, posted a narrower quarterly loss on Tuesday, driven by an increase in subscribers. 


 The satellite radio operator said its fourth-quarter net loss was $245.6 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of $311.4 million or 23 cents a share a year ago. Sirius said revenue rose 142 percent to $193.4 million, beating the $173.1 million average analyst forecast according to Reuters Estimates. The company's shares rose 1.9 percent in premarket trading to $3.81, from their Monday Nasdaq close of $3.74. Chief Executive Mel Karmazin said in a statement that Sirius achieved positive free cash flow - cash flow excluding amortization and depreciation but including capital expenditures - in the fourth quarter, four years after signing its first subscriber. The company ended 2006 with 6.0 million subscribers, after adding a net 905,247 subscribers in the fourth quarter. It forecast its subscriber base would grow to more than 8 million by the end of 2007, with revenue approaching $1 billion. Wall Street was looking for 2007 revenue of $994 million, according to Reuters Estimates. XM had ended 2006 with 7.6 million subscribers and forecast growth to a range of 9.0 million to 9.2 million in 2007. A Congressional antitrust task force will hold a hearing this week on Sirius' proposed takeover of XM, which the companies say will help them better compete with other digital audio products, such as iPods and mobile phones, as well as traditional radio. The combination of the two satellite radio companies must be approved by the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, which review mergers for their impact on competition and customer service. Sirius also estimated its average subscriber cancellation rate, known as churn, to be between 2.2 percent and 2.4 percent in 2007, up from 1.9 percent in 2006 It forecast the gross cost to acquire each subscriber at about $95 this year, which would be down from $114 in 2006.
