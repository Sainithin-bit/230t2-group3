 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The question was not if, but when world markets would suffer a correction, and the easy money would end. 


 Finally, the day may have arrived. Investors all over the world saw the cozy world of liquidity and calm markets evaporate in less than 24 hours on Tuesday. Scrambling for safety, investors roiled markets as they ran from risky and volatile markets in stocks, junk bonds, and emerging markets, and poured money into the safe haven of Treasury bonds and cash. The rush was precipitated by the biggest one-day fall in a decade in China's benchmark stock index which wiped out about $140 billion of market capitalization. "China was just the trigger" leading the flight from risky and volatile securities, Bill Gross, chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co., told Reuters on Tuesday. "The bullet is represented by trillions and trillions of dollars of leverage that has piled into risk markets over the past few years," he said. Added Mohamed El-Erian, the president and chief executive officer of Harvard Management Company, the world's largest educational endowment fund: "Up until today, all we've seen is how much risk appetite had gone up even more since the last global shakeout at the end of last spring." A day after the Shanghai Composite Index hit a new record high, it plunged nearly 9.0 percent on Tuesday to 2771.79, ahead of a meeting by parliament next week where it is feared that interest rates could be raised in an effort to cool down the blistering pace of their economy. Tuesday's drop in Chinse stocks was the biggest in percentage terms since an 8.9 percent fall on February 18, 1997. The widely-followed ishares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index Fund, which tracks the performance of Chinese stocks, fell 9.87 percent, while big capitalization stocks, PetroChina and China Life) were each down more than 6.0 percent. "China's market downturn comes at a time when U.S. investors have never been more exposed to the emerging markets," wrote Joseph Quinlan, chief market strategist at Bank of America, in a research report Tuesday. Indeed, the impact of the fall in Chinese stocks was most evident in emerging markets, investors' favorite for the "carry trade" for the past four and five years, where investors have borrowed in low yielding Japanese yen to buy high-yielding emerging market stocks, bonds and currencies. The Brazilian currency, the real, which had been trading near its strongest level since May 2006, weakened about 2.5 pct 2.1345 per U.S. dollar on Tuesday. The Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange plunged 6.6 pct percent to 43,145, suffering its biggest one day loss since September 11, 2001. The index closed on Monday near a record high of 46,452.26 points set last week. "The worldwide sell-off is just the latest sign of the emerging global economic and financial importance of China," said Chris Orndorff, who helps oversee $50 billion in assets as managing principal at Payden & Rygel Investment Management in Los Angeles. "I'm staying on the sidelines for now," he added. DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS ALSO FEEL THE HEAT The Latin American and global equity markets were not the only sectors experiencing that sinking feeling. After a long steady climb since last summer, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged over 500 points by mid-afternoon, before ending down 3.3 percent at 12,216. Equally important, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, shot up more than 70 percent to a high of 19.01 before easing somewhat to 17.97, still a gain of over 60 percent. The jump in the VIX is the most in its 17-year history during a major global markets sell-off. Wall Street's favored "fear gauge" reflects investors' inclination to seek shelter from financial market and economic uncertainty. U.S. Treasury debt prices have risen for three straight days, with the benchmark ten year note yield falling to around 4.50 percent, its lowest in three months on Tuesday, as concerns about defaults in the U.S. subprime mortgage market were supplemented by safe-haven buying by investors in other markets. Adding to money managers' worry list, U.S. economic data released on Tuesday showed new orders for durable goods in January, excluding volatile transportation orders, posted their steepest drop since July 2005. For details see. Investors in Treasuries were betting the Federal Reserve will cut benchmark interest rates sooner than had been expected on deepening fears that China, and rising defaults in the subprime mortgage sector could slow growth even further. Short-term U.S. interest rate futures are now showing a roughly 96 percent chance of a 25 basis point cut in the U.S fed funds rate by August. FLIGHT OR FRIGHT TO QUALITY? Orndorff of Payden & Rygel said the downturn in global stocks is "the beginning of a healthy correction, and probably a needed one at that." Investors have shown enormous appetite for the Dow, and everything else not related to U.S. blue chips, he said. Money managers and hedge funds have been pursuing stocks in international markets because of their consistent double-digit percentage gains, and on the long-term view that U.S. dollar weakness is likely to continue. The Morgan Stanley Capital International All-Country World Index, comprising 48 global developed country and emerging market indexes, touched its latest life-time high last week, after posting nearly 20 percent total returns in 2006. What's troubling, however, is that global and emerging market securities could have been bought on margin in record levels, said Charles Biderman, chief executive officer at TrimTabs Investment Research, a Santa Rosa, California based firm that tracks market trends for institutions. Emerging Portfolio Fund Research estimates that so far this year, investors have added a net $23.8 billion to global and emerging market stock funds compared to a net inflow of only $1.2 billion to U.S. equity funds, according to its latest data. "It's difficult to imagine that individuals have been leveraging up solely in U.S. equities as investors have put little cash to work in U.S. equity funds." Biderman said: "Borrowing to buy in size is another sign of an impending crash in offshore stock markets -- the only question is when it will happen." Perhaps it has just begun, he added.
