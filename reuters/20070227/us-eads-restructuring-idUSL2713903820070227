 PARIS/LONDON  (Reuters) - Airbus unions geared up on Tuesday for a fight over potentially heavy job cuts at the troubled planemaker, despite efforts by European governments to calm its 55,000 staff on the eve of restructuring announcements. 


 The 2 billion euros annual cost-saving plan is expected to trigger job losses and possible factory sales in France and Germany, with jobs in Spain and Britain also at risk. Fears of unpopular cutbacks sparked political wrangling between France and Germany and ruptured the negotiations last week, but the board of parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) buried differences between the two national factions late on Monday. Airbus is keeping staff waiting until Wednesday to find out how jobs will be affected by the Power8 restructuring plan, but union leaders met in Brussels on Tuesday to plot strategy. "The choice of massive redundancies at EADS and the scale of factory factories in France and Germany is nonsense," the CGT union in France said in a statement, adding Airbus was slashing jobs at a time when its order book was full. Industry sources predicted the planemaker, run by astute former French railways boss Louis Gallois, would make a maximum effort to present the lower possible number of job cuts by distinguishing between core Airbus jobs and contractors. French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin said last week that Airbus would cut 10,000 jobs, though many of those are thought to involve work at supplier firms. Jobs are a major issue in Germany and especially in France, which is eight weeks away from presidential elections. German Economy Minister Michael Glos said he was confident the Airbus restructuring plan was fairly balanced between Germany and France, whose leaders agreed at a summit on Friday to share both cutbacks now and modern technology later. "I don't know the details but I am pleased that a joint solution was found that clearly gives both sides confidence that the burdens and the opportunities are fairly shared," Glos told Reuters during a European Union meeting in Brussels. "All the signs suggest it's a good solution in which the Franco-German balance is preserved and as many jobs as possible are saved at the parent company." French Finance Minister Thierry Breton said Gallois had done his utmost to ensure the plans were fair. "He and his team have spent a lot of time going to see, talking with, meeting all the stakeholders...who are not just French as Airbus is a European company -- they are also German, Spanish and British -- to develop a balanced and fair plan." In Britain, British Prime Minister Tony Blair praised the "fantastic" job done by the planemaker's workers. Power8, first announced last October, calls for annual cost savings of at least 2 billion euros ($2.64 billion) from 2010, 5 billion euros in cash savings by then, and faster product development. Airbus said it would brief unions on the plans on Wednesday and hold a news conference at 1400 GMT the same day. Wednesday's announcement is expected to spell out how it achieves all of that, though industry officials and analysts say questions will remain, especially if the Franco-German company opts to tread lightly with French elections just weeks away. EADS shares fell in afternoon trade, down 2.55 percent at 25.25 euros versus France's benchmark CAC-40 index  .FCHI , which was down 2.93 percent as of 1458 GMT. "Setting up the Power8 restructuring plan still carries execution risks, as is the case with Airbus's financing needs which could stand at least 3.5 billion euros according to our initial calculations," Natexis Bleichroeder analysts said in a research note, while sticking with a "hold" rating on EADS shares and a target price of 23 euros. PLANT SALES If plans to sell factories are announced, the question will be who might buy and what challenges there are for valuations, especially if Airbus continues to vacillate over where it places coveted work such as on carbon fiber composites. UK firm GKN Plc ( GKN.L ) is one of several possible bidders mooted in brokerage analyst reports. Analysts also expect interest from private equity firms. "We will see what opportunities we may get on the structure side once Airbus have decided on the industrial structure," GKN Chief Executive Kevin Smith told reporters on Tuesday. "We are interested in working on the A350 program," Smith said, referring to the next new Airbus model. Wrangling over where Airbus places composites work on the A350 has been blamed for delaying Power8. Like Boeing's next plane, the 787 due in 2008, the A350 is expected to use far more lightweight composites in its wings and fuselage. That change in materials has shed doubt on whether some of the established Airbus factories for such work and using aluminum will get fresh contracts. Troubles at Airbus that have forced it to draft Power8 stem largely from a two-year delay in the double-decker A380 superjumbo after the planemaker encountered problems wiring the mammoth planes. A380 sales have slowed, airlines have demanded compensation for late delivery and Airbus has incurred cost overruns trying to resolve the problem. With planes sold in dollars and much of its cost base in euros, a 35-percent weakening of the U.S. dollar since Airbus made its first cost and profit projections on the A380 has also hurt the company.
