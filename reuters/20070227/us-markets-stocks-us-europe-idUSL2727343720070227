 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street is set to open down on Tuesday with investors jittery after shares plunged in China and awaiting key clues about the strength of U.S. consumption from economic data and corporate earnings. 


 U.S. stocks could be ruffled if funds start to pull money out of emerging market equities after the Shanghai Composite Index  .SSEC  fell nearly nine percent, its steepest decline in a decade. Another concern for investors will be oil prices, which have knocked Wall Street over the last week and remain above $61 on Tuesday on forecasts for a drop in U.S. fuel stocks and escalating Iran nuclear tensions. "This should be a warning shot across the bow that if you haven't taken some profits, you might want to do that," said Steve Previs of Jefferies International. U.S. stock futures suggested the major indexes would all open weaker. At 1140 GMT Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1, S&P 500 futures SPc1 and Nasdaq futures NDc1 were down 0.5-0.9 percent. The market will also turn its gaze to a series of economic indicators and corporate results that will help paint a picture of the state of U.S. consumption. Most important will be the U.S. consumer confidence date for February, to be released at 1500 GMT. U.S. existing home sales for January, due at the same time, will also be significant. On the corporate front, results from the U.S.'s second-biggest retailer Target ( TGT.N ) and electronics retailer RadioShack ( RSH.N ) will be in focus. Also of interest to the market will be news that Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ), the world's number two truck maker, said on Tuesday it had agreed to buy the road construction machinery business of U.S. diversified manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand ( IR.N ) in a $1.3 billion cash deal. On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  declined 0.12 percent to end at 12,632, the S&P 500  .SPX  slipped 0.13 percent to 1,449 and the Nasdaq  .IXIC  weakened 0.42 percent to 2.504.
