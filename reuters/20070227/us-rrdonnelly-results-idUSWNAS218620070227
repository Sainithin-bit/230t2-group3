 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Printing services company R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. RRD.N on Tuesday said its fourth quarter loss narrowed as sales increased and restructuring and impairment charges fell. 


 The net loss shrank to $1.2 million, or 1 cent per share, from $162.5 million, or 75 cents a share, a year earlier.
