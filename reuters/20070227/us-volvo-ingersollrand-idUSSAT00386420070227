 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - World number two truck maker Volvo said on Tuesday it would buy the road construction machinery business of diversified U.S. manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand for $1.3 billion in cash. 


 The agreement extended a buying spree by Volvo, whose war chest is packed from years of strong demand in key markets. Last week it spent $1.1 billion to take over Japan's Nissan Diesel Motor. The Gothenburg-based truck manufacturer, which also makes buses, engines and a range of construction equipment, said the acquisition also included 20 dealerships in North America along with distribution arms in Europe and Russia. Volvo shares were down 4.67 percent at 551 crowns by 1456 GMT, matching a fall in the Stockholm exchange's blue-chip OMXS30 index as equity markets worldwide slid sharply. Chief Executive Leif Johansson told a news conference the purchase would make Volvo the third-largest construction machinery manufacturer after Caterpillar Inc. and Japan's Komatsu Ltd.. The Ingersoll-Rand unit, which earned $101 million on sales of $864 million last year, makes heavy equipment for road building and soil compaction at plants in the United States, Germany, India and China. It has 2,100 employees. Volvo said the acquisition furthers its strategy to expand in the $4 billion road construction equipment market and will complement its existing product range. "I think the sales network that Volvo is getting is another strategic basis for this," Danske Bank analyst Henrik Breum said. "They will get stronger distribution of their existing products within construction equipment through this." CHINA NEXT Volvo has long said it planned acquisitions to boost its equipment business and to expand in Asia across most of its divisions, defying calls from shareholders such as activist fund Cevian that it return more cash to its owners. Last week's deal to take over Nissan Diesel -- a push to expand its heavy-duty truck business outside its mature European and North American markets -- may be followed by investments to gain a secure foothold in the Chinese market. Volvo is in "serious discussions" with Chinese truck maker Dongfeng Motor Group Co. Ltd. to replace Nissan Motor Co. as Dongfeng's partner, but such a deal would not mean Volvo was leaving the acquisition trail, Johansson said. "I don't think that, even were we to make Dongfeng, it would be the last acquisition you would see from us, " he said. "These are still consolidating industries. There is still a desire from Volvo to grow by acquisitions," Johansson said, adding that under the right circumstances, Volvo would keep on buying for "many more years to come". Volvo said it saw the Ingersoll-Rand acquisition generating annual synergies of 600 million crowns ($85 million) within five years, a third through cost savings and the rest through higher sales as the deal extended its distribution network. "In terms of products this is right. These are things they don't have in their product line-up," Swedbank analyst Anders Bruzelius said. "In terms of the price, you always pay quite a lot for these types of assets since they have rather high margins." The deal was expected to close during the second quarter after approval from authorities, Volvo said. (additional reporting by Johannes Hellstrom)
