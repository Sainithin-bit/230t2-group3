 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ) said a widely publicized incident where rats were filmed running around a New York City KFC/Taco Bell restaurant was an isolated event. 


 "We believe each of our brands has the highest restaurant quality standards, and they are being followed. We want to reassure customers that our restaurants are clean and safe," Emil Brock, president of U.S. Yum Brands, said in a statement on Tuesday. He said the company "will continue to work closely with the New York City Health Department and if there's ever an issue, we will immediately resolve it." A Taco Bell spokesman said last week that the restaurant was owned by a franchisee who also owned other Yum outlets. Also on Tuesday, the New York City Department of Health said the inspector who gave the Manhattan restaurant a passing score on February 22, a day before the restaurant was closed, has been removed from inspection duty until the department completes a review of the inspector's work. "While day-to-day cleanliness must be maintained by restaurant staff, our February 22 inspection of the KFC/Taco Bell was clearly not up to standard," Commissioner Thomas Frieden said in a press statement on the agency's Web site,  here Yum shares closed down $1.98, or 3.34 percent, at $57.24 on the New York Stock Exchange amid a sell-off in global markets after a nearly 9 percent decline in China's main stock market. China is a key growth market for Yum.
