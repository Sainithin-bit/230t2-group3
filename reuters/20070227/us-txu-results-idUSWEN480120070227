 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas power company TXU Corp. TXU.N, which has agreed to the largest leveraged buyout in history, posted a 33 percent rise in fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by improved margins and lower operating costs. 


 Net income was $475 million, or $1.03 per share, compared with $356 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings were $1.20 per share. Analysts' average forecast was $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Results were boosted by price increases, lower fuel and purchased power costs, increased nuclear power generation, and reduced use of less efficient plants, the company said. Those benefits were partially offset by lower retail sales volume due to less favorable weather conditions and customer attrition. TXU, the largest power generator in Texas, has agreed to be acquired by a group led by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL for $31.8 billion. Including debt, the deal is worth $43.8 billion, according to research firm Dealogic. The acquisition of TXU could meet with resistance from politicians and environmentalists over rates and plans to build coal-fired power plants, even though TXU said it would cut the number of planned coal-fueled plants to three from 11 and would reduce rates by 10 percent to save the average Texas household about $250 a year. The acquisition needs support of the state legislature. While TXU said the acquisition does not need state regulatory approval, one investor said the Texas Public Utility Commission would closely watch the deal. Regulators in Maryland and New Jersey torpedoed two power sector deals last year.
