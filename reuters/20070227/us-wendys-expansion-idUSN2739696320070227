 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc. WEN.N said on Tuesday that expanding in international markets was not an immediate priority, and that it will focus on increasing margins in its U.S. and Canadian markets first. 


 Speaking at a Bear Stearns consumer conference in New York on Tuesday, Chief Executive Kerrii Anderson said the near-term focus would be on lifting margins in 600 U.S. and Canadian stores, and that would be the company's "biggest priority." "We are beginning to see where international business can play a roll in Wendy's ... but it is a much more longer play and will take patience," Anderson said. Anderson also lauded rival McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) for introducing its "premium" coffee, which helped bring attention back to breakfast menus at fast-food chains. Wendy's plans to serve breakfast in 20 percent to 30 percent of its restaurants by the end of 2007. Wendy's, faced with stiff competition from a revitalized McDonald's and Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N, has been trying to turn around its primary hamburger business, which has suffered in recent years. Last year, the company spun off such smaller brands as Baja Fresh and Tim Hortons to focus on reviving sales at its flagship chain. At an investor meeting earlier this month, the company said it planned to boost profits by reducing the number of salaried restaurant managers from an average of 3.6 to 3.3 per store -- a total reduction of 450 positions -- and increasing customer traffic with better service and cleaner, more attractive restaurants. On Tuesday, Anderson said Wendy's would work toward decreasing service time, but not to the point that it disrupts customer service. "(Service time) will not be so fast that it ends up irritating the customer by shoving stuff out the window," she added. Wendy's shares were trading down 4.3 percent, at $31.90 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. stocks took a hit on Tuesday, after a weaker-than-expected economic report and a sharp fall in China's main stock index worried investors.
