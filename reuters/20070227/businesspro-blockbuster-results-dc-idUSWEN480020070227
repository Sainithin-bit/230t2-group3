 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N, the No. 1 
U.S. video rental chain, reported lower quarterly profit on 
Tuesday due to store closures and higher costs associated with 
growing its online business. 


  The company posted net income of $12.9 million, or 5 cents 
per share, compared with $18.0 million, or 9 cents per share, 
in the year-ago quarter.  Revenue rose 1.4 percent to $1.51 billion, Blockbuster 
said.
