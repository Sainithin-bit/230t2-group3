 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. said on Tuesday their U.S. sales declined in February as they pulled back on discounted sales to daily rental companies. 


 GM's February U.S. sales are set to fall by 6 percent to 7 percent, GM spokesman John McDonald told Reuters, adding that the company expected retail sales to be flat. Ford's U.S. sales will likely slide by about 10 percent to 15 percent, with fleet sales accounting for the majority of the decline, George Pipas, Ford's chief sales analyst, told Reuters. The cautionary outlooks came the same day that fast-growing rival Toyota Motor Corp. said it will build a $1.3 billion assembly plant in Mississippi to keep up with American demand for its light trucks. Automakers are set to announce February sales figures Thursday, with many analysts expecting to see an overall decline, reflecting weaker results for U.S. car companies. Sales of Ford vehicles to commercial and government fleets are expected to be down 20 percent in February, including a 30 percent decline in sales to rental firms, Pipas said. Sales of Ford's best-selling F-Series pickup trucks may fall by a double-digit percentage in February, he said. Both GM and Ford, which are restructuring their North American operations, have announced plans to reduce fleet sales this year. They are trying to move away from low-margin sales as the U.S. automakers seek to recover from billions of dollars in losses and shrinking market share. Chrysler Group, the North American unit of DaimlerChrysler AG, declined to forecast its February sales. Analysts expect Chrysler to post a sales decline of between 3 percent and 12 percent for February. Erich Merkle, an analyst with IRN Inc., said there was some evidence that Chrysler, which is up for possible sale by its parent company, was stepping into the fleet market as Ford and GM pulled back. "I think they're backfilling a bit on the fleet side what's been left by GM and Ford," he said. A reliance on fleet sales in the past allowed the Detroit-based automakers to keep assembly plants running, but eroded the value of the brands by cutting into the resale value of new cars, according to analysts. Industrywide sales for February on an annualized basis are expected slip to between 15.8 million and 16.2 million vehicles, sharply below the 16.6 million recorded a year earlier, according to analysts. Cautionary signs for February auto sales included a rise in gas prices and weakness in the U.S. housing market, said Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy. In a note for clients, Murphy said he expected European and Asian automakers as a group to post a sales gain of about 7 percent, with Toyota outstripping the pack. Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson forecast Toyota would record an 8 percent rise in sales for February, while Honda Motor Co. would see a 14 percent gain. Johnson expects Honda's sales rise to be driven by new light truck offerings, including the Acura MDX and RDX, and "generous" incentives on the Accord sedan. Sales incentives from the Asian automakers have been far below those offered by GM, Ford and Chrysler, and any evidence that they are rising will be watched closely by analysts. Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold said in a note that a "potential headwind" for auto sales was the rising inventory levels being recorded by some Asian automakers. "This could indicate that industry sales are slowing," he said. "Alternatively, the negative impact could be limited to domestic automakers if the Asian (automakers) react by increasing incentives significantly."
