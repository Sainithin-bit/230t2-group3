 (Reuters) - DuPont ( DD.N ) said it would add more than 400 
positions mainly in research and development in its Pioneer 
Hi-Bred International Inc. unit, as it executes a $100 million 
reinvestment plan to accelerate new seed products. 


  New positions will be filled by redeploying current 
employees from other DuPont businesses and outside hiring, the 
chemical maker said in a statement.  (Reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore)
