 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, the parent of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday. 


 The company also said it plans to change its corporate name to Macy's Group Inc., effective June 1, and that its board approved a $4 billion boost in its stock buyback program. Net income rose to $733 million, or $1.40 a diluted share, for the fourth quarter ended February 3, compared with $699 million, or $1.26 a share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included an extra week. Excluding costs and adjustments tied to the acquisition of the former May stores, earnings from continuing operations came to $1.66 a share, exceeding Federated's forecast of $1.55 to $1.60 a share. Analysts on average expected profit of $1.58 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The fourth-quarter results include a gain of about $34 million after taxes, or 6 cents a share, tied to completion of a debt tender offer. Quarterly sales fell 4 percent to $9.16 billion as the company closed about 80 duplicative stores over the past year. Still, sales were better than analysts expected. Federated forecast earnings of 15 cents to 20 cents a share for the first quarter and $2.45 to $2.60 a share for the full year, excluding merger integration costs. The company expects same-store sales to rise 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent in the first quarter and 2 percent to 3.5 percent for the full year. Analysts currently expect profit of 23 cents a share for the first quarter and $2.84 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said its board would ask shareholders to change the company's name to Macy's Group Inc. at its May annual meeting. It said the new proposed name "accurately reflects the transformation" of its business in recent years as 90 percent of its sales involve the Macy's brand.
