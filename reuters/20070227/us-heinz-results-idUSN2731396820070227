 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ketchup maker H.J. Heinz Co. HNZ.N on Tuesday said quarterly profit soared nearly 90 percent, helped by new products, increased marketing and improvement in its international business. 


 Heinz also stuck to its full-year earnings outlook from last week, when it said it expects earnings between $2.35 and $2.39 a share, in line with Wall Street Estimates. It also said quarterly earnings were expected to rise about 30 percent from a year earlier. The company, which makes products ranging from its namesake ketchup and Ore-Ida french fries to Smart Ones entrees and Heinz baked beans, said profit was $219 million, or 66 cents per diluted share in the fiscal third quarter, up from $116.6 million, or 35 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings beat analysts' expectations, who on average forecast 61 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite strong results, shares of the Pittsburgh-based company slipped in morning trading. That was because implied fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, one analyst said, adding that he anticipated shares would fall. "Heinz beat our estimate by 6 cents, but did so on lower corporate expense, higher 'other income' and a lower tax rate," JP Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic said in a research note. "We rate Heinz neutral, but expect the stock to be down today." Heinz shares fell as much as 1.1 percent in early trading, but still outperformed the overall market, which fell over 1.5 percent on Tuesday on a weaker-than-expected U.S. economic report and a dip in China's main stock index that followed back-to-back days of Wall Street losses, worrying investors. Fourth-quarter earnings, calculated from the full-year outlook, will range between 52 and 56 cents a share, Zuanic said. Analysts expect earnings of 59 cents per share, on average, as per Reuters Estimates. The company acknowledged the outlook on the conference call and pinned it to a higher tax rate in the quarter. SOUP WOES U.S. sales were up 8.5 percent in the quarter, driven by strong ketchup sales, promotions and new product offerings. Instant food and beans sold well in the UK, its largest sales segment. But frozen soups seemed to be a problem area, selling weakly across the board and dragging down sales. "Rest of the world (other than Europe and the United States) and Asia Pacific segments are leading the way in terms of growth rate at 32 percent and 28 percent respectively," said Chief Financial Officer Art Winkleblack. Sales in its Asia-Pacific segments grew 6.5 percent in the quarter. Overall sales at Heinz rose 5 percent to $2.3 billion in the third quarter from $2.19 billion a year ago. Heinz is among several companies vying to sell good-for-you food items. Recently, PepsiCo ( PEP.N ) said it would introduce fruit chips later this year as it looks to expand its line of health-conscious products. Heinz itself sells high fiber beans, baby food and Weight Watchers and Smart Ones meals and snacks. But the company may not be successful in moving from "a ketchup and beans company to a health and wellness and emerging markets company," said Prudential Financial analyst John McMillin, who has an "underweight" rating on shares. Heinz, which has sold off businesses in Europe, intends to focus on core products such as sauces and condiments, baby food, snacks and meals to try to revive a business that has been a drag on results. The moves are similar to a restructuring the company undertook in its U.S. business several years ago. That has led to the recovery at Heinz, which last year fought a proxy battle over board seats with activist investor Nelson Peltz's Trian Group in which Trian won two of the five seats it had sought. Heinz shares were trading down 17 cents at $46.84 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.
