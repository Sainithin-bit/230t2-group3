 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange experienced intermittent delays toward the end of the trading day and is assessing the situation, an NYSE Group spokesman said on Tuesday. 


 The glitch may have further complicated a major sell-off in U.S. equity markets on Tuesday, sending the benchmark S&P 500 index to its biggest one-day slide in more than 3-1/2 years as a sell-off in China's equity market fanned worries that stock valuations there are too high and some data indicated U.S. economic growth may slow.
