 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company Inc. GAP.N said on Tuesday it was in talks to acquire rival supermarket chain Pathmark Stores Inc. PTMK.O for about $653 million in cash and stock. 


 A&P said no final agreement has been reached. A deal would mark the latest merger in the quickly consolidating grocery-store industry. Last week Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O said it would buy Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O for $565 million. Traditional grocery chains have grappled with increased competition from larger rivals, the growth of discounters like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and higher-end gourmet and organic markets like Whole Foods. "It's no secret that it would be a significantly value-creating event for A&P if they could acquire and did acquire Pathmark," Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. analyst Karen Short said before the companies confirmed the merger talks. A&P said it was in talks to buy Pathmark for $12.50 per share, though there were no assurances a deal would be reached. As of November 24, Pathmark had about 52.2 million shares outstanding. At $12.50 per share, the company would be valued at about $652.5 million. Pathmark has been rumored as a possible target or merger candidate for years. In 2005, Yucaipa Cos., the private equity firm owned by billionaire grocery magnate Ronald Burkle, took a stake in Pathmark. Both Pathmark and A&P have been revamping store formats and merchandise at several locations to improve sales. In November, A&P-owned New York grocery chain Food Emporium announced it would sell high-end imported foods in its Manhattan stores. It also has been targeting budget-conscious shoppers with low prices at its Food Basics chain. Meanwhile, last year Pathmark signed a deal to sell products from Wild Oats in its stores in an effort to satisfy demand for healthier fare. Yucaipa also has a stake in Wild Oats. After it confirmed the merger-talks, shares of A&P surged $2.30, or 7.5 percent, to close at $33.17. Shares of Pathmark remained halted for news pending. The stock had jumped 20 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $12.25 before being halted. Bullish options volume and option volatility in both A&P and Pathmark were on the rise prior to their stock halts, said Paul Foster, options strategist at Web site theflyonthewall.com in Chicago.
