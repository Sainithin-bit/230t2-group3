 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for U.S.-made durable goods fell by a much sharper-than-expected 7.8 percent in January as nondefense goods orders saw their biggest monthly decline ever, a government report showed on Tuesday. 


 A steep drop in orders for Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) airliners helped push down nondefense orders for durable goods, items meant to last three years or more. Excluding volatile transportation orders, which are heavily skewed by aircraft, durable goods orders fell by 3.1 percent in January, their steepest drop since July 2005, the Commerce Department reported. That followed a downwardly revised gain of 2.8 percent in December. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast that orders for durable goods would fall 2.5 percent, orders excluding transport would drop 0.2 percent and orders excluding defense goods would rise 0.3 percent. The weak data boosted U.S. Treasury debt prices, while the dollar fell to fresh two-month lows against the euro. Overall nondefense orders fell by a record 7.8 percent in January, while closely watched orders for nondefense capital goods, seen as a proxy for business spending, fell by a record 19.9 percent. Excluding aircraft, nondefense capital goods spending fell 6.0 percent, the largest drop since January 2004, when orders fell 8.1 percent. Analysts said the lower-than-expected figure could help ease the Federal Reserve's concerns that a strengthening economy was contributing to inflation. "The durable goods orders number was considerably weaker than expected and it's not isolated to aircraft. It's broader than that," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. "It's not a catastrophe for the economy because these numbers tend to be volatile. Still, it's a shakier number than what economists had looked for and raises the issue of why investment spending is not sturdier," he said. Transportation orders fell by 18 percent, a figure affected heavily by a 60.3 percent drop in civilian aircraft orders. Boeing Co. reported orders of just 13 planes in January, after a strong tally 212 in December. Defense aircraft and parts orders also fell 54.6 percent. Automotive orders also fell 5.1 percent following a 5.3 percent rise in December. In a separate release, Redbook Research on Tuesday reported that U.S. chain store sales rose 3.0 percent during the week ended February 24 compared with the same week a year earlier. Sales for February were down 1.2 percent compared with January, but up 2.8 percent from February 2006, according to the report.
