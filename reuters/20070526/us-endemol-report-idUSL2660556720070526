 MILAN  (Reuters) - Endemol's EML.AS new owners will invest and look at acquisitions worldwide, John De Mol, who founded the television content company and is now buying it with Italy's Mediaset ( MS.MI ), told Italy's La Repubblica newspaper. 

 "We will invest, we'll put new blood into the company ... with acquisitions worldwide," he said in an interview published in the newspaper's Saturday issue. Mediaset, owned by opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi, and De Mol are buying 75 percent of Endemol from Spain's Telefonica ( TEF.MC ) for 2.63 billion euros ($3.53 billion) and are also in the market for the remaining 25 percent. De Mol said he saw synergies for Endemol with Internet companies and search engines. "I see synergies between Endemol and entities like Microsoft ( MSFT.O ), Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) and Google ( GOOG.O )," he said in the interview, adding that he still had "100 percent" belief in consolidation between television and telecommunications. He said although there were no current plans for further cooperation with Berlusconi's businesses, "never say never". And he committed Endemol to continuing to provide programming to Italy's state broadcaster Rai -- Mediaset's biggest competitor. "I promise Rai, with my hand on my heart, that they will have the best products," De Mol said. Mediaset and Rai between them dominate Italy's free-to-air television and feed viewers a diet of reality shows, quizzes and soap operas.
