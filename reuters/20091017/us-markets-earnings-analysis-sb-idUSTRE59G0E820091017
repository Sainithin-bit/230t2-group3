 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Unexpectedly strong results from Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ), Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) could be the worst thing to happen to third-quarter earnings. 

 "The expectation bar based on this week's earnings reports from big companies has been reset fairly high," said Fred Dickson, market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Co. in Lake Oswego, Oregon. "There may be some question as to whether companies over the next couple of weeks are going to be able to come in and deliver the numbers to the same degree." Some companies have already been stung by investor disappointment. Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and IBM ( IBM.N ) some of the most closely watched companies in the market, failed to impress this week. Goldman's earnings quadrupled, but its investment banking results were lackluster. GE reported sales that missed expectations. Coming into the quarter, investors were hoping for improvement in revenue growth that was not seen in the first two quarters of earnings. They got a taste of it with Alcoa, which last week beat on earnings and revenue. This week Intel did the same and JPMorgan's profit came in much stronger than expected. That helped the three major indexes end with gains for the week, while the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed above the 10,000 level twice during the week and the Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  remains up some 60 percent since its early March lows. The news follows a slew of economic reports pointing to a steady recovery from the recession. Analysts say companies need to show revenue growth to convince investors the economy isn't just spinning its wheels. NO FORGIVENESS Next week marks the third week of third-quarter results, and with the likes of Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ), Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) reporting, investors are eager to see revenue beating expectations and positive comments on the economic outlook from chief executives, instead of just better-than-expected net income. So far, earnings and revenue estimates are improving since the start of the quarter. As of Friday, third-quarter earnings for S&P companies were seen down 22.6 percent from a year ago, compared with expectations for a decline of 24.7 percent earlier this month, according to Thomson Reuters data. Revenue is seen down 10.4 percent as of Friday, versus a decline of 11.5 percent October 2.

"With signs of a gradual recovery evident, we believe that investors will not be as forgiving and will need to hear commentary and/or see signs of improvement in firms' top-line to push stocks higher," Brown Brothers Harriman analysts wrote in a research note. Shares of IBM were down 5 percent at $121.64, even after it late Thursday raised its full-year outlook and reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit. "It's like it's almost insufficient just to beat market expectations," said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer, Advisors Capital Management LLC in Paramus, New Jersey. Just more than 10 percent of S&P companies have reported so far. Next week 135 S&P companies are expected to post results, 13 of them Dow components, according to Thomson Reuters. Other top names on the earnings agenda include a number of names in health care, including Gilead Sciences ( GILD.O ), UnitedHealth ( UNH.N ) and Pfizer ( PFE.N ). Also to report: Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ), Texas Instruments TXN.N, 3M Co. ( MMM.N ), American Express ( AXP.N ), Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB.O ), KeyCorp ( KEY.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ).
