 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve wants the economy to grow more robustly but is not actively seeking higher inflation rates, Fed Board Governor Jeremy Stein said on Thursday. 
 "I disagree with the premise that what we're doing is seeking to gin up inflation," he said in response to questions at the Brookings Institution. (Reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
