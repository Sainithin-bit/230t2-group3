 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - Bumi Resources sees a proposal to part ways with London-listed coal conglomerate Bumi Plc as a positive development for both sides, a company director said on Thursday. 
 "The development appears positive and a likely all round win-win," said Bumi Resources director and corporate secretary Dileep Srivastava. "We are focused on operational excellence: to reach 100 million tons production in 2014, deleverage and cut interest charges, look to monetize assets expeditiously at fair prices and thereby unlock our intrinsic value - without distractions," he said.
