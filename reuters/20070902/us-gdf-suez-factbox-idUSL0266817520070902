 (Reuters) - French utilities Suez and Gaz de France moved closer to clinching a 90-billion-euro ($123 billion) merger on Sunday after agreeing terms that involve floating off shares in Suez's Environment business, a source close to the talks said. 

 Analysts had previously said that to get the merger of equals that was envisioned at the outset Suez, the bigger of the two in terms of market capitalization, must first sell some businesses and distribute the receipts to its shareholders through a special dividend. Another issue under close scrutiny is what share the state should take in the capital of any merged firm. Here are some details about the two companies: SUEZ - Its history goes back to the 1822 foundation of Societe Generale des Pays-Bas by William of Orange and the 1858 creation in Paris by Ferdinand de Lesseps of the Universal Company for the Maritime Channel of Suez. - Suez Energy includes Electrabel, Distrigaz, Fluxys, SUEZ Energy International, Elyo, Fabricom and Tractebel Engineering. Energy activities account for 75 percent of group revenues. - Suez Environment, whose origins are in Lyonnaise des Eaux, supplies water, sanitation and waste services to industrial and individual customers around the world with the Ondeo, SITA and Degremont brand names. - Suez employs 140,000 people and says it is Europe's biggest supplier of energy services, the fifth biggest power producer and sixth biggest gas operator. - Total group sales rose to 44.3 billion euros ($57 billion) in 2006 from 41.49 billion in 2005. It posted first-half revenue of 23.729 billion euros ($32.43 billion) in 2007, up from 22.353 billion in the first half of 2006. - In 2003 Suez became a majority shareholder in Belgium's Electrabel, which has expanded in France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Suez bought out the minorities and now owns 100 percent of Electrabel. - In July 2007 the company sold its 30.53 percent stake in Compagnie Immobiliere de Belgique (Immobel) to JER Property Fund, a subsidiary of JER Europe Fund. - Suez has a market capitalisation of 54 billion euros. - Chairman and Chief Executive Gerard Mestrallet, 58, took the helm of Suez in 2001. GAZ DE FRANCE - The state-owned company, founded in 1946, produces and supplies natural gas. It says it operates Europe's largest gas transmission system. - The company, which has 50,244 employees, made its market debut in July 2005 in the world's biggest initial public offering in three years. - It generated revenue of 27.64 billion euros ($35.9 billion) in 2006, up from 22.87 billion euros in 2005. - It reported a bigger than expected 11 percent drop in first-half sales in 2007 to 13.8 billion euros ($19 billion) in from 15.423 billion in the same period of 2006. - GDF supplies power to 200,000 business clients and has a market capitalization of 36.2 billion euros. - The company, like Suez, is present in Belgium, where it bought a 51 percent stake in Societe de Production Electrique in a joint venture with Britain's Centrica. SPE is the only producer of electricity in Belgium apart from Electrabel. - Jean-Francois Cirelli, 49, a civil servant for 20 years, was promoted to head Gaz de France nine months before the company's market debut.
