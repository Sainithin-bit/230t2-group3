 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Ann Taylor Stores Corp ( ANN.N ) predicted stronger-than-expected first-quarter sales after a strong holiday quarter, and the women's clothes retailer renamed itself as it shifts more to online and outlet stores. 

 Ann Taylor shares rose as much as 16 percent to on Friday. The company, which decided to change its name to Ann Inc, outlined plans to boost business at its online and outlet channels this year as they generate better sales volumes. "One of our key priorities in 2011 is to further capitalize on the enormous potential of the e-commerce channel," Chief Executive Kay Krill said on a conference call with analysts. Ann Taylor sells office wear through its namesake stores. LOFT is its more affordable, casual-wear chain. During the fourth quarter, it saw a 74 percent jump in the Ann Taylor online channel and a 77 percent rise in the LOFT online channel. Sales fell 3.2 percent at LOFT retail stores. E-commerce now accounts for about 12 percent of its total quarterly sales, while outlet channels contributes 17 percent. Online sales have been a strong growth driver for most retailers. Maintaining and running an online store needs less overhead costs and lets retailers make more margins on sales. For the first quarter, Ann Taylor expects gross margins of about 58.5 percent, up from 51.7 percent in the fourth quarter. "For the first quarter, many had feared weak sales and a steep gross margin decline; however, the quarter has started out well, with positive comps in all channels at all brands and healthy gross margins," analyst Paul Lejuez at Nomura Equity Research said. Chico's FAS Inc ( CHS.N ), also a women's apparel retailer, last month forecast strong margins and sales for 2011. Women's clothes retailers had lost customers over the past two years, as many of their clientele cut back on shopping with unemployment and a weak economy hurting their budgets. As the economy betters slowly, customers are returning to shops and retailers are making aggressive moves to improve merchandise and grow sales. Ann Taylor said it will accelerate its outlet store plans in the first half of the fiscal year ending January 2012, and is planning to open around 44 factory outlets in the first half. For the first quarter, it said sales will be about $510 million, while analysts were expecting sales of 488.1 million. "For the first quarter, most specialty apparel retailers are guiding below consensus on sales and earnings. So to see Ann Taylor come out and guide sales so much ahead of consensus is an indication of momentum behind the business and advantages on costs," Wall Street Strategies analyst Brian Sozzi said. For the fourth quarter, operating costs fell to 48.9 percent, a 260 basis point improvement over last year. Ann Taylor's stock has lost about 14 percent in value since hitting a 31-month high in December, underperforming a 5.3 percent drop on the S&P Apparel retail sub-index .GSPRETA since the year-end holiday season. In late morning trade on Friday, the shares were up 11 percent at $26.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. Chico's rose 2 percent to $13.83. For the fourth quarter, Ann Taylor earned 19 cents a share on an adjusted basis, ahead of analysts' estimates of 17 cents. Sales rose 10 percent to $515.3 million during the period. "It was abnormal sales gains by division and by channel," Wall Street Strategies' Sozzi said . "They are driving better assortments at Ann Taylor, which was for many years being viewed stodgy."
