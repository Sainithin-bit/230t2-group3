 NEW YORK, March 11 (IFR) - The House Financial Services Committee is holding a hearing on legislative proposals to create a covered bond market in the United States. 

 The hearing follows the introduction of the United States Covered Bond Act of 2011 to Congress on Tuesday. Covered bonds are widely used by European banks to raise money to finance home loans. There have been several attempts to introduce covered bonds in the U.S., but the product has been stymied by the absence of legislation, competition from other sources of mortgage financing such as Fannie Mae FNMMA.OB and Freddie Mac ( FMCC.OB ) and uncertainty surrounding the FDIC's role in the event of bankruptcy. Here are some facts about covered bonds: * WHAT IS A COVERED BOND? Covered bonds are debt instruments issued by banks and secured by a cover pool of mortgage loans (property as collateral) or public-sector debt to which investors have a preferential claim in the event of default. Unlike the loans behind existing mortgage- and asset-backed securities, covered bond loans remain on the balance sheet of the bank issuing the bond, making them obligations of the bank. The issuer keeps control of the assets and can change the make-up of the loan pool as well as alter the terms of the loans. * HISTORY AND TIMELINE Covered bonds comprise one of the oldest and largest sectors of the European bond market. In 1770, Germany introduced covered bonds, known as Pfandbriefe, to finance public works projects. Since then, 24 other European countries have adopted the covered bond system, each operating under a set of unique laws. Spanish covered bonds backed by mortgages are known as Cedulas Hipotecarias, while in France they are known as obligations foncieres. Previous regulatory efforts in the U.S. started in 2008 and included the U.S. Treasury's best practices and the FDIC's Financial Policy Statement on covered bonds. Both attempts were soon overshadowed by the wider disruption of capital markets during the credit crisis. In 2010, hopes for implementation of a US covered bond law were dealt a blow when U.S. lawmakers excluded the covered bond legislation from the financial-regulatory reform bill. Citigroup ( C.N ), JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Wells Fargo Corp have all said they plan to sell covered bonds to help kick-start the new U.S. market. To date, Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and Washington Mutual are the only U.S. banks that have issued covered bonds. The last issue came from Bank of America in June 2007. Foreign banks issued nearly $30 billion of covered bonds to U.S. dollar investors in 2010, compared to less than USD3bn in 2009. In 2011, Yankee covered bond issuance is set to rise to $50 billion, according to Bank of America. A key part of the debate in the U.S. is the FDIC's concern that legislation would impair its ability to recover losses from its deposit insurance fund when it winds down a failed bank by allowing covered bond holders to be treated differently than other creditors. * HOW BIG IS THE EUROPEAN COVERED BOND MARKET? The total volume of outstanding covered bonds grew 5 percent to 2.4 trillion euros in 2009 from the previous year, according to the European Covered Bond Council. More than 25 countries issue covered bonds and there are over 300 issuers of the instruments. *WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF A COVERED BOND MARKET? Covered bonds have dual recourse, with claim against the issuer and preferential claim against the cover pool in the event of an issuer's insolvency. For the issuer, covered bonds can offer the potential for longer-term funding at lower costs versus senior unsecured bonds. Covered bonds offer banks another source of financing of mortgages for consumers, rather than selling assets in the secondary market currently dominated by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home Loan Bank System. * WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE U.S. MARKET? almost 20 percent of European Union residential mortgages are funded by covered bonds, according to global business and technology consultancy firm Capco. Funding of U.S. residential mortgages at this level would translate into $2 trillion of covered bond issuance. By the end of 2007, residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) stood at over $2.25 trillion, about 20 percent of the total volume of outstanding residential mortgage debt, according to the International Monetary Fund.
