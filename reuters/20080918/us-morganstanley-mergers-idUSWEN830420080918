 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley intends to remain independent, but the embattled investment bank is holding merger talks with Wachovia Corp and pursuing more capital from China Investment Corp among several options to help it weather the worsening credit crisis, a person familiar with the firm's plan said on Thursday. 

 Morgan Stanley, one of the two remaining major Wall Street firms, is pursuing "multiple tracks," the source said. Its preliminary merger talks with regional bank Wachovia have progressed and entered a more formal stage. At the same time, it has approached China Investment Corp, the Chinese government investment fund, about increasing its equity stake. Beyond Wachovia, Morgan Stanley is in talks with a number of other financial institutions, the source said. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone ; editing by John Wallace)
