 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has raised with Congress the idea of pursuing a Resolution Trust Corp-type solution to the financial crisis, a congressional aide told Reuters on Thursday. 

  COMMENTS: WILLIAM LARKIN, FIXED INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, CABOT MONEY  MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "It does two things. It tells me the problem is very serious. But that structure basically allows banks to sell off some of their bad stuff. "I'm wondering how they are going to get this thing done, how do they agree on something like this? It develops a lot of questions. But, it's a good idea, I think. They've got to do something. There is just a void of confidence obviously across all markets." "The problem is everybody is deleveraging. They're all similar institutions and they tend to be all selling the same type of securities. This would be one way to create liquidity." "This is what the government is supposed to do. When things get drastic they are supposed to take drastic action. And they can do some creative stuff." KEVIN CAVIN, MORTGAGE STRATEGIST, FTN FINANCIAL, CHICAGO: "The markets are responding positively. "They've talked over the past several days and weeks about an orderly unwind, an orderly liquidation. That's what they talked about with Lehman Brothers. I can't imagine Lehman and AIG are the only institutions that are in trouble. There are a lot of other institutions that are very capital-constrained and some them won't make it. "I think the big implication is to try to engineer a soft landing, or a softer landing -- or a less hard landing. "There was a lot of leverage, a lot of companies that had enormous balance sheets based on borrowed funds. Capital ratios were way too low. Now that the value of those assets has been declining, the loss in market value is eating up a lot of their capital and as a result they have to sell. They have to sell some of their high quality assets, and it seems that all this paper, all these assets are going to be hitting the market at the same time. It just creates a vicious spiral." MALCOLM POLLEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, STEWART CAPITAL  ADVISORS, PITTSBURGH: "The problem with publicly traded companies in this environment -- for example, Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns -- is that even though the company may be solvent on an assets to liabilities basis, the market is not giving it time to do an orderly liquidation of assets and this would solve that problem." "An RTC-like entity is a tool by which an orderly unwinding of problem assets could be achieved."  MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. benchmark indexes shot to session highs, with the Dow  .DJI  regaining the 11,000 mark at its high. BONDS: Treasury prices dropped to session lows. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar strengthened broadly. RATE FUTURES: U.S. short-term interest rate futures fell to their low of the day, cutting implied chances for Federal Reserve rate cuts.
