 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Package delivery company FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ) reported quarterly profit in line with estimates, but said earnings had been hurt by challenging global economic conditions and high fuel prices. 

 FedEx also gave an outlook for the current quarter that was above analysts' expectations and announced a 2009 rate increase for its express delivery unit that will take effect in January. The Memphis, Tennessee-based company reported a first-quarter fiscal 2009 net profit of $384 million, or $1.23 a share, compared with $494 million, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the quarter of $1.23, according to Reuters Estimates. Last week FedEx raised its profit outlook for the quarter to $1.23 from a previous range of 80 cents to $1.00, citing the recent fall in oil prices from record highs. FedEx has a two-month lag in its fuel surcharge program -- many transportation companies use surcharges to pass on rising fuel costs to customers -- meaning that when oil prices spike, the company is out of pocket until its fuel surcharge increases. When prices fall, however, the company gets a short-term lift from the higher surcharge. "FedEx should see another large year-on-year benefit in fuel during the fiscal second quarter but if fuel prices stabilize that will go away in the second half of fiscal '09," Edward Wolfe of Wolfe Research wrote in a note for clients. Like its main rival, Atlanta-based United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ), FedEx is seen as a bellwether of U.S. economic activity. Both companies have said this year that some customers have reacted to the weakening economy and high fuel costs by switching to UPS and FedEx's slower, low-cost services from their more lucrative express services. FedEx reported fiscal first-quarter revenue of $9.97 billion, up 8 percent from the $9.20 billion a year ago. Analysts had expected revenue of $9.87 billion. Revenue at its core express delivery unit rose 9 percent to $6.42 billion from $5.89 billion, the company said on Thursday. For the current quarter, the package delivery company said it expects earnings per share in a range from $1.40 to $1.60. Analysts had expected EPS for the quarter of $1.35. FedEx reiterated its previous full-year forecast of EPS in a range from $4.75 to $5.25. Analysts have expected full-year EPS of $5.20. "We believe that FedEx's full-year '09 guidance is conservative, but it also probably reflects limited visibility," JP Morgan analyst Thomas Wadewitz wrote in a note for clients. Despite the challenging economic environment, FedEx said it will raise shipping rates at FedEx Express by an average of 6.9 percent for U.S. domestic and U.S. export services. That hike will be partially offset by a 2 percentage point decrease in the company's fuel surcharge. FedEx usually announces rate increases later in the year. The new rates will come into effect on Jan 5. FedEx said it will announce rate increases for its ground package delivery unit FedEx Ground. FedEx said that it has cut its capital expenditure plan to $2.6 billion for fiscal 2009 from $3 billion in fiscal 2008. "Though fuel should provide a tailwind if it stays where it is or falls further and the company is implementing cost-saving initiatives, the U.S. economy is unlikely to give the company a hand in the near term and a deceleration in the global economy will cause more pain," UBS analyst Rick Paterson wrote in a research note, In trade on the New York Stock Exchange, FedEx shares were down $1.49 or 1.69 percent, at $86.58.
