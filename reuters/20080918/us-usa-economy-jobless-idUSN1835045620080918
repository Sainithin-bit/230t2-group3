 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose unexpectedly by 10,000 last week, as the first wave of job losses from Hurricane Gustav rolled in after reporting delays in Louisiana, the Labor Department reported on Thursday. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 455,000 during the week ended September 13 from 445,000 the prior week. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast claims to drop to 440,000 last week. Normal seasonal factors predicted a 10.3 percent rise in jobless claims because of the typical rebound that occurs after the Labor Day holiday week, a Labor Department official said. However, claims actually increased 12.3 percent as Louisiana was able to report numbers for the first time in two weeks as power in the state's reporting office was restored, the official said. Those numbers were much higher than what the department had estimated, he said. Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York, said the jobs data was another bad sign for the already weak U.S. economy. "The job market is grim. We are solidly in recession territory. We should see a negative GDP number in the third quarter. We are starting to see some pretty hefty layoffs in the many tens of thousands," Low said The four-week moving average for claims, considered a more reliable barometer since it irons out weekly fluctuations, rose by 5,000 to 445,000 in the week ended September 13. Meanwhile, the number of continued claims -- people remaining on benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid -- unexpectedly fell by 55,000 to 3.48 million in the week ended September 6, the most recent week for which that data is available, after an increase of 129,000 the prior week. Analysts had expected continued claims to be almost unchanged from 3.53 million in the week ended August 30, which was the highest reading since October 2003.
