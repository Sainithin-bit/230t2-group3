 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has been shopping around a proposal to congressional lawmakers that would create an entity to deal with the bad debt, similar to what was done in the savings and loan crisis, a congressional aide said on Thursday. 

 "It's a modernized version of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was used after the S&L crisis," said the aide, declining to be further identified. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky , editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
