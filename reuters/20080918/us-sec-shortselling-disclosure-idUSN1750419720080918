 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Hedge funds and large investors would be required to disclose their short trade positions under a measure being considered by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 SEC Chairman Christopher Cox, under pressure from lawmakers and banking executives to curb short selling, said on Wednesday that he was asking the commission to consider, on an emergency basis, a new disclosure rule to ensure transparency in short selling. The SEC is considering requiring managers with more than $100 million invested in securities to publicly report their daily short positions. Investors are already required to report significant long positions to the SEC. Cox also announced new enforcement initiatives and said enforcers will expand their market manipulation investigations. The SEC's enforcement division intends to obtain disclosure from large hedge funds and other institutional traders of their past trading positions in specific securities, Cox said.
