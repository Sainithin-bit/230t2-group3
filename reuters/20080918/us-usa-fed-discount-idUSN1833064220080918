 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. financial institutions borrowed a record $47.97 billion a day on average from the U.S. Federal Reserve in the latest week in a scramble for cash as the global credit crisis deepened, Federal Reserve data showed on Thursday. 

 The Fed's increasingly pivotal role as a provider of cheap cash was likely to grow as long as banks remain distrustful of lending to each other for fear that such interbank loans may not be repaid, analysts said. "I don't think this will stop here," said Howard Simons, strategist with Bianco Research in Chicago. "If banks aren't going to lend to each other right now, the job of the central bank is supposed to be the lender of last resort." Commercial banks' primary credit borrowings averaged $21.6 billion a day in the week ended September 17, a record. That compares with an average amount of $19.80 billion per day the previous week, the Fed data showed. "What this tells us is that the markets rate liquidity very highly and the Fed is doing everything it can to make sure that there is an ample supply of reserves in the banking system," said Ward McCarthy, managing director with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, in Princeton, New Jersey. "I suspect a week from now when we get the data for the full maintenance period, what we will see is a huge increase in excess reserves in the banking system," he said. Rates in the U.S. overnight interbank market fell steeply in late trade after the U.S. central bank had added a daily record of $105 billion of temporary reserves on Thursday to the financial system via repurchase operations. Federal funds traded down at 0.0625 percent, well below the 2 percent target rate the U.S. central bank sets. "The fed funds rate collapsed toward the end of the day and that is a sign that ample liquidity is available," McCarthy said. Investment banks borrowed an average of $20.27 billion per day from the Fed's Primary Dealer Credit Facility, up from zero the previous week. The PDCF is one of several programs the Fed has introduced to provide cheap financing to financial institutions pinched by the credit crisis. The data also showed the Fed loaned $28 billion on Wednesday to American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), and possibly others. That was the day after U.S. authorities agreed to provide $85 billion in loans to the insurer to stave off what would have been the largest bankruptcy in history. (Editing by Leslie Adler)
