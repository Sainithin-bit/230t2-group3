 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Mid-Atlantic factory activity jumped unexpectedly in September, rising into positive territory for the first time in 10 months, a survey showed on Thursday.
   

  KEY POINTS: * The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index soared to 3.8 in September from minus 12.7 in August. * Wall Street economists had expected a reading of minus 10.0, according to a Reuters poll. Their forecasts ranged from minus 15.0 to minus 4.5. * The headline index reading was the highest since November 2007 * The new orders index was the highest since December 2007. * The prices paid index was the lowest since September 2007.  COMMENTS: MICHAEL TREBING, ANALYST, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF  PHILADELPHIA, PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA: "There were a few comments about uncertainties in the financial markets in the monthly business outlook survey and about the possible effects of that on consumers, but those comments were not prevalent at this point. Some of the sentiments reflected in the outlook could possibly be readjusted after the financial news of this past weekend but on balance the expectations have improved for a couple of months and the numbers looked a little better. We even focused (respondents') attention this month on production expectations for the fourth quarter and those comments also paralleled the basic improvement in expectations in the regular survey. "For the most part, respondents were concentrating on their business as of the beginning of the month. We mailed the survey forms just before September 1 and electronic requests went out on September 4 so the majority of responses were in before Friday September 12. A few trickled in before September 15 which was the deadline. "There were no comments (from respondents indicating that they had had difficulty getting financing, short-term financing for financing inventories, anything like that)." GEORGE DAVIS, CHIEF TECHNICAL STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL  MARKETS, TORONTO: "Quite a bit stronger than expected and given the volatility we have seen in markets it is likely to trigger some short covering that will push the dollar off of its lows."  MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes rose to session highs BONDS: Treasury prices fell DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pared losses against the euro and moved back to near session highs against the yen RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures dipped, trimming back the market expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut
