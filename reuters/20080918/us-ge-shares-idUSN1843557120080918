 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) shares rose 10 percent in late trading on Thursday, amid a broad rally in U.S. stocks after CNBC reported that the U.S. Treasury Department was working on a solution to the financial crisis. 

 "Today people are beginning to realize that, yes, GE does have some risk on the financial side but nothing of the severity seen at the investment banking firms," said Perry Adams, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Huntington Private Financial Group in Traverse City, Michigan. The shares were up $2.24 to $25.32 on the New York Stock Exchange. That gain took back about half the ground the conglomerate's shares had lost over the past week after several days of heavy selling. GE, which makes about half its profit in finance, is "closely monitoring the situation in the markets, but focused on running our businesses," said spokesman Russell Wilkerson. So far this year, GE shares are down 31 percent, a steeper slide than the 17 percent drop of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI . (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
