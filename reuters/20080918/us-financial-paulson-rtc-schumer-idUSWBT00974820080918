 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer said on Thursday he did not know if the Treasury Department had readied a plan to set up an agency to dispose of bad assets. 

 Asked on CNBC if he knew of a plan by the Treasury that was ready at this time, the New York Democrat said, "No." Pressed further if he had heard of any proposal or if congressional leaders had been briefed on such a plan, he also responded: "No. "We have not been briefed on such a plan. I do not know if they have a plan. All I know is this, I think they realize, as we all realize, that doing this on an ad hoc basis isn't good enough," Schumer added. (Reporting by  Tim Ahmann )
