 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of insuring Washington Mutual's( WM.N ) debt with credit default swaps fell following reports that the beleaguered savings and loan has put itself up for sale. 

 Credit default swaps on Washington Mutual fell to 34.5 percent upfront early on Thursday from 44.6 percent on Wednesday, plus 500 basis points annually, according to data from Markit Intraday. That means it costs $3.45 million in upfront payments plus $500,000 annually to protect $10 million of Washington Mutual debt.  (Reporting by  Dena Aubin , Editing by Walker Simon)
