 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks slipped, threatening to halt a fifth straight day of gains on Wednesday, as weak orders for U.S. durable goods in June cooled the economic outlook and drove the dollar lower. 

 New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods fell unexpectedly for a second straight month, marking their largest decline since August, in a fresh sign the economy had slowed in the second quarter. But some analysts said the report was respectable after stripping out certain categories. Still, the dollar fell versus the Japanese yen as the news increased concerns about the U.S. outlook and analysts said the Federal Reserve is likely to report softer economic conditions when it releases its Beige Book report on recent regional economic conditions later during the session. Oil fell below $77 a barrel after an industry report showed an unexpected rise in U.S. crude stockpiles and the durable goods data fueled doubts about the pace of recovery in energy demand. The Commerce Department said U.S. durable goods orders fell 1.0 percent in June after a revised 0.8 percent drop in May. Analysts forecast an increase of 1.0 percent. "Combined with the confidence numbers yesterday, they don't bode well for continued progress in the economy," said Alan Lancz, president of an investment management firm that bears his name in Toledo, Ohio. "It will be more difficult to break out of the trading range (for stocks) and might be settling back a little bit." However, Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at BNY Mellon in New York, said the durable goods report is always difficult to digest. The number was negative because of commercial aircraft orders, he said. "If you strip out aircraft and defense, you're left with a respectable rise of 0.6 percent" in the important capital goods category, he said. Those orders were up 15.2 percent on a year-on-year basis. "That's consistent with a strong recovery in industrial production and durable goods orders. So these numbers are not very concerning," Woolfolk said. MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS traded flat, and the Thomson Reuters global stock index  .TRXFLDGLPU  was slightly lower. Earnings reports in Europe and Japan supported equity markets earlier, but the economic data weighed on sentiment already soured by a Tuesday report that U.S. consumer confidence in July fell to its lowest since February. European stocks ended a one-week rally on the U.S. durable goods data, which revived worries about the economy and prompted investors to book some of their recent gains. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares trimmed early gains, slipping 0.31 percent to close at 1,050.88 points. At 12:54 p.m. ET, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 7.64 points, or 0.07 percent, at 10,530.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 2.97 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,110.87. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 11.83 points, or 0.52 percent, at 2,276.42. With the S&P's 200-day moving average currently around 1,114, traders are struggling to determine if it is the top of a recent rally or a consolidation point before further gains. U.S. corporate results continued to surprise on the upside. Aircraft maker Boeing Co ( BA.N ), defense contractor General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ) and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), the No. 3 U.S. oil company, all beat expectations. After almost half of the S&P 500 having reported earnings, 77 percent of companies have beat expectations, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.09 percent at 82.114. The euro rose above $1.30, but has been stuck in a range recently. Woolfolk said it will take a change in risk sentiment to start a new trend in dollar-euro trade. The euro was unchanged at $1.2993. Against the yen, the dollar dipped 0.20 percent to 87.70. Sterling hit a five-month high against the dollar at $1.5630 as earlier comments from the Bank of England did little to quell optimism about the UK economic outlook. Copper rose to its highest point since early May after assurances on economic growth from top metals consumer China and improving fundamentals. U.S. Treasuries eased to trade flat to slightly lower after gaining on the U.S. durable goods data. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was unchanged in price to yield 3.05 percent just ahead of the government's auction of 5-year notes at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT). U.S. light sweet crude oil fell 65 cents to $76.87 a barrel. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei  .N225  climbed 2.7 percent for its highest close and biggest one-day gain in two weeks. MSCI's index for Asian stocks less Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS trimmed gains to trade flat.
