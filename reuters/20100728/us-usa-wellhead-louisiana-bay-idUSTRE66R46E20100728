 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - A ruptured wellhead in Louisiana's Barataria Bay has spread a slick of oil covering 6 square miles (16 square km), the U.S. Coast Guard said on Wednesday. 

 A dredging barge being pushed by a tug struck the underwater wellhead early on Tuesday morning. The Coast Guard has ordered the last recorded owner of the well, a company called Cydeco, to pay for the clean-up costs. Wild Well Control Inc of Houston has been hired to secure the well and Environmental Health and Services has been hired to manage the cleanup, the Coast Guard said. So far, 10,500 feet of containment boom and 3,000 feet of absorbent boom has been deployed to contain the spill. Thirty-one boats have responded to the spill. (Reporting by  Erwin Seba )
