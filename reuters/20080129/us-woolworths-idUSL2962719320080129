 LONDON  (Reuters) - British sweets-to-DVDs retailer Woolworths Plc WLW.L said it had replaced management at its EUK wholesale unit, as an analyst said he expects the company to announce the renegotiation of its bulging debt shortly. 

 Shares in Woolworths rose 12 percent by 5:56 a.m. EST. Woolworths said Lloyd Wigglesworth, managing director of the EUK division which sells DVDs and CDs to other retailers and which has been cited as a possible target for disposal along with its 2entertain division, was stepping down. Wigglesworth will be succeeded by Steve Lewis, currently managing director for retail and distribution at Woolworths. "There has been a change in management because there was a massive underperformance in that division last year," said broker KBC Peel Hunt analyst Robert Brent by phone. There has been persistent speculation that Woolworths, a heavily-indebted fallen titan of the British high street with over 800 stores, could be split up with EUK or 2entertain, a DVD publisher it owns 50/50 with BBC Worldwide, put up for sale. "Woolworths could get 150-200 million pounds ($297-397 million) for its share in 2entertain which everyone is getting excited about," said Brent, referring to its option to sell its stake in March. There is also speculation Woolworths is about to announce the restructuring of its debt facility with its banks which will allow it to borrow more, although analysts said the credit crisis would make this more difficult. "When I spoke to the company a couple of weeks ago they were very confident of concluding it," said Brent. Woolworths was not immediately available for comment. "EUK is now entering a different stage of its development, where the focus turns toward further improving customer service and enhancing operational efficiency," Woolworths Chief Executive Trevor Bish-Jones said in a statement on Tuesday. "The new team is ideally suited to take EUK, now a substantial business with a strong market position, to the next phase of growth and to build on recent progress made in Woolworths," he added. EUK saw sales jump by 46.7 percent in 49 weeks to January 12, driven by growth in the games market. Shares in Woolworths, which have underperformed the general retailers' index by almost 55 percent in the past 12 months, were up 12 percent at 10.75 pence by 5:56 a.m. EST, valuing the company at around 157 million pounds. There is also a technical reason for Tuesday's share jump, a trader said, as the bid/offer spread is now 0.25p as opposed to 0.01p when they traded below 10 pence. However, Cazenove analysts said in a note on Monday that a sum of the parts valuation does not support a partial break-up and cash return. "While a partial break-up via the disposal of one of the entertainment businesses would serve to reduce Woolworths' substantial average debt ... reducing the company's gearing and alleviating concerns over the company's balance sheet, there would, we estimate, be no surplus cash available for any return to shareholders," they added. As of August 4 last year, the end of the first half of its financial year, the company had net debt of 218 million pounds. (Reporting by Mike Elliott and Chris Wills)
