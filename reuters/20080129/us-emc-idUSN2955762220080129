 BOSTON  (Reuters) - EMC Corp ( EMC.N ), the world's largest corporate storage gear maker, forecast better-than-expected 2008 revenue but its shares fell after its unit VMWare ( VMW.N ) missed Wall Street's growth estimates. 

 Shares of EMC fell nearly 7 percent on Tuesday, a day after its majority-owned business software maker, VMware, gave a disappointing earnings report and outlook. VMware's news dwarfed EMC's own stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results and its forecast for 2008 revenue of $15 billion, which was above the average Wall Street projection of $14.7 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.. The "strong fourth-quarter and 2008 revenue outlook (were) probably neutralized by the VMware miss," Goldman Sachs analyst David Bailey said in an investor note. "Our view on EMC's stock would improve with more certainty that EMC will cleave off VMware in early 2009, a stance that EMC seems to be inching toward as its stock bears the brunt of EMC's miss," said Bailey, who has a "neutral" rating on EMC. EMC stock had jumped as much as 40 percent after it sold a stake in VMware last August in one of the most-anticipated initial public offerings of a technology company since Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) in 2004. Investors had viewed EMC as a relatively inexpensive alternative to owning VMware stock directly. Shares of VMware, whose technology boosts the efficiency of server computers by letting one machine perform the work of many, had quadrupled after the stake sale, but plunged after the company late on Monday reported quarterly revenue below analysts' expectations and forecast slower sales growth. VMware said it expected revenue growth this year to slow to 50 percent from 88 percent in 2007. Its shares fell 33.3 percent to $55.35. "We are facing uncertain economic times," EMC Chief Executive Joseph Tucci said on a conference call on Tuesday to discuss its quarterly earnings. "But EMC itself couldn't be better positioned." EMC forecast 2008 GAAP earnings per share at 78 cents and non-GAAP earnings at $1.04 per share. Wall Street was looking for 2008 earnings of 82 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. EMC's fourth-quarter net income rose to $525.7 million, or 24 cents a share, from $388.8 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings per share beat the average analyst forecast of 22 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue rose 19 percent to $3.8 billion, topping Wall Street's forecast of $3.7 billion. The Hopkinton, Massachusetts, company estimated revenue growth in its main data storage and security software businesses to slow to 9 percent in 2008 from 14 percent in 2007. It expects those businesses to account for 87 percent of 2008 revenue. EMC stock was down 5.44 percent at $15.99 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. It had fallen to around $14.95 in after-hours trade on Monday following VMware's quarterly results and sales warning.
