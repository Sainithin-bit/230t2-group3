 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd ( FLEX.O ) posted an adjusted third quarter profit that beat Wall Street forecasts on Tuesday, and reaffirmed its earnings and sales forecasts, sending its stock up nearly 5 percent. 

 Flextronics which makes mobile phones for Sony Ericsson( 6758.T )( ERICb.ST ) and video game consoles for Microsoft Corp( MSFT.O ) among other products, also stuck to its earlier guidance for its fourth quarter. The Singapore-based company expected adjusted earnings of between 22 and 24 cents per share on revenue of between $7.5 billion and $7.9 billion. Wall Street analysts were looking for an adjusted profit of 23 cents per share on revenue of $7.81 billion. "At the end of the previous quarter, what we said was that there had been a little slowdown in the industrial segment and telecoms, and that slowdown I would say has stabilized," Chief Financial Officer Thomas Smach told Reuters in an interview. "Consumer is probably the only market segment we see continued slowing in. For Flextronics, I think we can still grow through that because we are still winning new programs and new products like LCD TVs, digital cameras and MP3 players." For its third fiscal quarter ended December 31, Flextronics said its profit excluding acquisition costs and other charges was $250 million, or 30 cents a share, beating the 26 cents expected by Wall Street. In the first quarter including results from its Solectron purchase, Flextronics said net sales were $9.07 billion, up 67 percent from $5.42 billion a year earlier and ahead of the $8.61 billion that was the average analyst estimate. Flextronics shares rose as much as 4.6 percent to $10.78 after the results were announced, before settling back at  $10.60. (Reporting by  Scott Hillis ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
