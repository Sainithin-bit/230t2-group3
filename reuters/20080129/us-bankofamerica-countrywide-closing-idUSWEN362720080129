 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis on Tuesday said Countrywide Financial Corp's CFC.N fourth-quarter results were consistent with the bank's expectations, and "everything is a go" to complete the acquisition of the largest U.S. mortgage lender. 

 Countrywide on Tuesday posted a larger-than-expected $421.9 million fourth-quarter loss. Bank of America said on January 11 it agreed to pay about $4 billion for the company. "The items driving the loss were consistent with our due diligence and transaction price," Lewis said at a Citigroup Inc financial services conference. He said the results also reflect "dramatic" improvement in the fundamentals of the mortgage business. Countrywide lost $1.2 billion in the third quarter.
