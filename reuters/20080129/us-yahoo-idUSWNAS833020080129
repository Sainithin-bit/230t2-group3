 SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc reported a drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday and forecast 2008 revenue below Wall Street expectations as it tries to shore up its Web advertising business. 

 Shares in Yahoo fell nearly 11 percent in extended trading. Yahoo's revenue forecasts for the first quarter and full year disappointed investors, even though Wall Street analysts had already slashed their expectations of Yahoo's ability to grow Internet advertising in a weakened U.S. economy. The company also announced a renewed deal with AT&T Inc that analysts expect to bring in less revenue this year and outlined a plan to cut about 1,000 jobs. It said the efforts would help produce improved cash flow next year. "I would classify the results as mediocre and the guidance as cautious," said Ryan Jacob, a fund manager at Jacob Internet Fund in Los Angeles. "I think Yahoo is telegraphing the fact that they will be spending more in 2008 to try and regain their competitive position against Google." Yahoo's fourth-quarter profit fell more than 23 percent to $205.7 million, or 15 cents per share, from $268.7 million, or 19 cents per share, a year ago. Overall revenue rose 8 percent to $1.83 billion and revenue excluding payments to advertising partners rose 14 percent to $1.4 billion. Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings per share of 11 cents on revenue of $1.41 billion excluding traffic acquisition costs, according to Reuters Estimates. Yahoo's larger share of the display market for corporate advertising makes it more vulnerable to any spending pullbacks in a recession. Analysts expect key rival Google Inc to fare better in a downturn with its dominance of paid search, a form of advertising viewed as more closely tied to sales. 2008 HEADWINDS Chief Executive Jerry Yang predicted a tough 2008 as he pledged to reduce the company's more than 14,000 employees. Details on the cuts will be announced in mid-February. "While we will continue to face headwinds this year, we believe that the moves we are making will help us exit 2008 stronger and more competitive and return to higher levels of operating cash flow growth in 2009," Yang said in a statement. On a call with analysts, Yahoo executives said they expected to cut about 1,000 jobs, targeting reductions in some areas of its operations and investing in others. "Looking to 2008, we are taking an aggressive investment posture, prioritizing and allocating resources towards our key growth drivers," Yang said. Yahoo forecast revenue excluding traffic acquisition costs of $1.28 billion to $1.38 billion for the first quarter and $5.35 billion to $5.95 billion for the full year. Analysts, on average, had forecast revenue excluding TAC of $1.32 billion to $1.45 billion for the first quarter and $5.54 billion to $6.40 billion for the full year, according to Reuters Estimates. Separately, Yahoo said on Tuesday it has renewed a key subscription revenue deal with AT&T, the largest U.S. phone company. Their new partnership includes delivering advertising to Internet users on phones and computers. The companies did not disclose terms, but Wall Street analysts had expected a new deal would see AT&T slash the amount of subscription fees it shares with Yahoo in favor of less-consistent, but potentially more lucrative, ad revenue. Yahoo shares fell to $18.56 in extended trading after closing at $20.81 on the Nasdaq. (Editing by  Braden Reddall )
