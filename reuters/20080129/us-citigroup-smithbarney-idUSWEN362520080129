 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) CEO Vikram Pandit is likely to keep the company intact rather than spinning off or selling units such as the Smith Barney retail brokerage, CNBC's Charles Gasparino said on Tuesday without citing sources. 

 That decision is not final and is still subject to change, Gasparino said. Some investors have argued that Citi is too large to be run efficiently and should instead be broken up into pieces, but others have argued that Citi's recent difficulties stem from execution rather than size. Michael Hanretta, a spokesman for Citigroup, declined to comment. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Mark Porter)
