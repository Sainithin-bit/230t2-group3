 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co ( MMM.N ) said on Tuesday its first-quarter financial comparisons with a year earlier would be "a little challenging" due to the timing of the Easter holiday and a slightly longer Chinese new year holiday. 

 The company made the comment in a conference call with analysts and investors following the release of its fourth-quarter results. (Reporting by  Chelsea Emery ; editing by John Wallace)
