 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Allstate Corp ( ALL.N ), the largest publicly traded U.S. home insurer, said on Tuesday that net income fell 37.3 percent in the fourth quarter, hurt by higher catastrophe losses. 

 Allstate said net earnings were $760 million, or $1.36 a share, down from $1.21 billion or $1.93 a share in the year earlier quarter. Operating income, which excludes investment gains and losses, was $701 million, or $1.24 a share in the fourth quarter, compared with $1.12 billion, or $1.78 a share in the same quarter the prior year. In December, Allstate warned that catastrophe losses for the fourth quarter could run as high as $400 million and would hurt fourth quarter net income.
