 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Managing risk within a bank is not just a matter of relying on internal processes but also requires taking the right decisions at the top of the company, Citigroup Chairman Win Bischoff said on Tuesday. 

 Banks are under pressure to tighten their internal risk controls after French bank Societe Generale last week unveiled the biggest incident of alleged fraud in history. "You can't manage risk just on process. There also has to be judgment at the top of the organization," Bischoff told a financial markets conference. "The information is there, but there is a judgment factor as well. In some of the institutions where this has happened, that judgment proved to be erroneous," Bischoff said. He was speaking at a financial markets conference that focused on policymakers' calls to improve transparency in the sector, particularly in banks and sovereign wealth funds. Bischoff said transparency had become a "totally misused concept" and a catchphrase. Citigroup and rival Merrill Lynch have both accepted cash injections from sovereign wealth funds to bolster balance sheets hit by writedowns from the U.S. subprime home loans crisis. When Citigroup and Merrill first went to sovereign funds, it was seen as a sign of strengthening the financial system, but there is more concern now, Bischoff said. "Politicians are looking at it," Bischoff said. Americans, however, have wanted their financial institutions to be sound, helping to counterbalance the concerns. "It's very early days in this debate. It's the China and Russia syndrome of sovereign wealth funds that is the more concerning," Bischoff said. Citigroup said earlier this month it was privately raising $12.5 billion after announcing a record quarterly loss of nearly $10 billion. The infusion includes nearly $7 billion from Singapore Investment Corp Pte, $3 billion from the Kuwait Investment Authority and an undisclosed amount from Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, the bank's largest individual shareholder.
