 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N said on Tuesday that quarterly net profit fell, hurt by charges related to restructuring, the disposing of some vending machines and the absence of a year-ago gain. 

 The world's largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) drinks reported net income of $81 million, or 35 cents per share, for the fourth quarter, which ended December 29, compared to $133 million, or 55 cents per share, a year ago. Excluding items, the bottler earned 39 cents per share. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
