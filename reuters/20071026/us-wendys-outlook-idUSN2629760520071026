 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc.'s WEN.N management on Friday laid out plans to improve sales and profits by expanding beverage choices and boosting business during late-night and morning hours, 

 The plans come as its board of directors is under investor pressure to sell the company. The world's No. 3 hamburger chain, which is struggling with higher food costs, weakened consumer spending and stiff competition from bigger rival McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), outlined 10 initiatives to drive growth and improve returns. "We are focused on exactly what we can control, which is improvement in our core business, and improvement in our core business quite honestly is the best way that we can create value for our shareholders, our franchisees and our employees," Chief Executive Kerrii Anderson said on a conference call with analysts. Wendy's plan includes improving sales of bigger, fancier hamburgers by focusing on its new Baconator sandwich and emphasizing its use of fresh, rather than frozen, beef. The chain also said it hopes to capture more snack sales in the afternoon and late-night hours, something McDonald's has capitalized on in the last year with its popular new chicken Snack Wraps. Wendy's also plans to expand a new breakfast menu, add more beverage choices and update its lower-priced value menu to reel in younger consumers. The company on Thursday reported a 0.3 percent decline in sales for the third quarter and lower net income, though earnings before restructuring and other expenses rose 55 percent after the company raised prices and cut costs. "While we are encouraged by the margin gain achieved in the cost-cutting program that Wendy's has employed, topline momentum remains elusive," Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kron said in a research note. Third-quarter same-store sales rose 0.2 percent at U.S. company-owned restaurants and climbed 1.3 percent at U.S. franchised restaurants. By comparison, McDonald's same-store sales rose 6.9 percent. Wendy's has been trying to revitalize profits at its more than 6,600 restaurants for some time, but some investors have grown impatient. A special committee of Wendy's board of directors has been weighing a recapitalization or sale of the company since early this year amid pressure from activist investor Nelson Peltz. Anderson has said in the past that the strategic review was not her idea. Triarc Companies Inc TRY.N, Peltz's restaurant company that owns the Arby's chain, has been in discussions to buy Wendy's. Wendy's Chief Financial Officer Jay Fitzsimmons on the conference call declined to comment on the board's review of strategic alternatives, but said the process was taking longer than expected due to volatility in the credit markets. Executives said prices on beef, dairy and French fries in the fourth quarter would all be up from the same time last year. The company also said it did not expect same-store sales, or sales at restaurants open at least 15 months, to accelerate in the current quarter. Wendy's shares closed at $34.03 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, up 78 cents, or 2.4 percent.
