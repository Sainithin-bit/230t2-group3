 LONDON  (Reuters) - British insurer Pearl announced a 4.94 billion pound ($10.1 billion) cash bid for rival Resolution ( RSL.L ), topping a cash-and-shares deal agreed between Standard Life ( SL.L ) and Resolution earlier on Friday. 

 Pearl, which has had two previous bids rejected by Resolution, said it had also bought a further 39.66 million Resolution shares, taking its stake in the target company to 22.2 percent. "Pearl's strong preference is to implement the increased offer on a recommended basis," Pearl said in a statement. "Pearl has requested a meeting with Resolution's board and its advisers."
