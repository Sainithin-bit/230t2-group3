 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Ingersoll-Rand Co Ltd ( IR.N ) reported better-than-expected quarterly net profit on Friday on stellar international results and demand for such industrial products as air compressors, sending its shares up about 2 percent. 

 Ingersoll, which is in the process of focusing on security, refrigeration and industrial technologies, said each of the three divisions posted higher quarterly revenue. However, only industrial technologies had higher operating margins, reflecting demand for air compressors and strong pricing. Ingersoll cited restructuring costs and unfavorable product mix for lower margins in the other two divisions. "Climate control is fighting through economic and material cost problems," said analyst Eli Lustgarten of Longbow Securities, who has a 'neutral' rating on the stock. "(In) security and safety, they did a terrific job, given there is a lot of exposure to housing and construction markets." The company, which also raised its full-year forecast, said net earnings rose 9 percent to $266.6 million, or 92 cents per share, including 24 cents from discontinued operations, compared with $243.8 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, earnings were 6 cents ahead of analysts' average forecast of 90 cents a share, Reuters Estimates said. A stock buyback reduced the number of shares outstanding to about 289 million from about 320 million from a year earlier. Revenue rose 10 percent to $2.24 billion, ahead of Wall Street forecasts for sales of $2.2 billion. Ingersoll said sales were up by double-digits in Asia and Europe, and saw strong recurring revenue from parts and services. Longbow's Lustgarten said Ingersoll's discontinued operations exceeded his expectations. This year the company sold its road construction machinery segment to Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) and is selling its Bobcat compact machinery segment to South Korea's Doosan Infracore ( 042670.KS ) for $4.9 billion in cash. "The key question for the company continues to be how do they redeploy their cash," said. "This is a $3 (per share) earner from operations, plus what they do with the cash." CEO Herb Henkel said he's seen a marked slowdown in private equity activity, which makes deals more affordable for Ingersoll. "In view of improved deal multiples, we expect to be able to close more transactions over the next few years," he said on a conference call. "Overall, I really do expect we'll be spending money and making bolt-on acquisitions and adding to geographic reach in all three of (our) sectors." Asked about the impact of the U.S. housing downturn, Henkel said Ingersoll's security business, whose products include Schlage locks, is affected by lower demand from residential construction and so-called big-box retailers, but the security unit is able to gain market share. "My expectation is we'll be able to outgrow what will be a negative market in 2008," he said, adding that the company recently added Pulte Homes ( PHM.N ) as a client. "If you go into today's big box, you'll see we have more linear feet than we had beforehand." Ingersoll, incorporated in Bermuda but with administrative headquarters in New Jersey, said it expects full-year profit from continuing operations of $2.66 to $2.69 a share, or total 2007 earnings of $3.55 to $3.60 per share, excluding restructuring costs and gains from asset sales. One quarter ago, its range was $3.45 to $3.55 a share, and analysts were looking for $3.52. The company said it would provide a 2008 forecast in January. The shares were up 79 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $50.49 on the New York Stock Exchange. Counting Friday's advance, the stock is up about 34 percent over the past year, triple the return of the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX .
