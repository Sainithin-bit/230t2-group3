 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Health Management Associates ( HMA.N ), which operates 59 hospitals in the United States, reported a 59 percent drop in its third-quarter profit on Friday after an increase in uninsured patients and mounting unpaid bills for its services. 

 Health Management, whose shares tumbled as much as 5.7 percent in early trading, said its net income fell to $30.5 million, or 12 cents per share, from $74.4 million, or 31 cents per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $1.07 billion in the quarter from $989.3 million in the year-ago period. Provision for doubtful accounts, or bad debt expense, was $126.5 million in the quarter, up from $94.1 million in the same period of 2006. The Naples, Florida-based company has said it expects bad debt expense as a percent of net revenue to be about 12 percent for the rest of 2007. "The company maintained bad debt guidance of 12 percent, although it isn't entirely clear to us how they will achieve that based on this quarter's performance," CIBC analyst Michael Wiederhorn wrote in a research note. Since February 2007, the company has given a 60 percent discount to uninsured patients for non-elective services. Uninsured discounts for the quarter were $155.6 million, compared with $153.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2007. Charity care write-offs for the quarter were $19.2 million compared with $156.9 million for the same period a year ago and $18.5 million for the second quarter. Health Management reiterated its 2007 objective for earnings from continuing operations to be between 45 to 50 cents per diluted share, which is in line with Wall Street's consensus of 47 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares were down 27 cents, or 4 percent, to $6.52 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. They have traded between $21.47 and $6.22 during the past 52 weeks.
