 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - If Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N Chief Executive Stan O'Neal is forced out, there's little doubt who the firm's army of more than 16,000 brokers would like to see replace him: their own boss. 

 Robert McCann, president of Merrill Lynch's global private client business, has emerged as a potential candidate to replace the embattled O'Neal. Other candidates include BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) Chief Executive Larry Fink and NYSE Euronext NYX.N CEO John Thain as possible replacements. O'Neal's grip on Merrill has weakened after the company posted its biggest quarterly loss in its history. O'Neal admitted this week he and his team misjudged the company's exposure to subprime mortgages, triggering an $8.4 billion write-down in the third quarter. McCann looked to have been sidelined just a few months ago after his direct reporting line to O'Neal was severed. But now he's making a comeback. "If naming your CEO was a popularity contest, Stan would be out and McCann would be in. But we know it doesn't work that way," said a Merrill Lynch executive, who declined to be named. It's unclear if McCann has enough recognition among Merrill Board members, a group put together during O'Neal's tenure. But Tom Sowanick, chief investment officer of Clearbrook Financial LLC in Princeton, New Jersey, said McCann has the experience and leadership skills to run Merrill. Sowanick, a former Merrill Lynch wealth management strategist, worked for McCann before leaving the company. "Bob is a very demanding yet capable leader. He will be able to shepherd Merrill Lynch out of this storm," Sowanick said. Merrill's retail brokers have already lost confidence in O'Neal, thanks to the massive writedowns that happened on his watch. And some brokers are nervous that Merrill could be an attractive takeover target for a foreign bank. The company's , depressed stock price and nearly $2 trillion in client assets might spur action from bidders. Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo said Merrill could fetch $100 to $120 a share in a takeover. That's a 90 percent premium over the company's current trading price. A report in the New York Times on Friday said O'Neal directed investment bank head Greg Fleming to approach Wachovia Corp WB.N about a merger. Dick Bove, an analyst at Punk Ziegel & Co., said the overture "may indicate some panic on Mr. O'Neal's part." Many investors share the brokers' feelings about O'Neal, who the Times said has also angered the board by authorizing the Wachovia talks without consulting with it. Merrill Lynch declined comment for this story. "We're clearly disappointed in Stan O'Neal..." one of Merrill's largest investors said on condition of anonymity. CNBC television reported on Friday that O'Neal had conceded to friends he could be out of a job by the end of the weekend. BROKERAGE BEDROCK Whatever happens, McCann looks to be making an unlikely recovery within Merrill's power structure after appearing to be the odd man out among senior executives at Merrill Lynch just a few months ago. A reorganization announced in May cut the direct reporting line between McCann and O'Neal. Ahmass Fakahany and Fleming became co-presidents and seemingly gained power. Fakahany is one of O'Neal's closest confidantes and Fleming is seen as the company's star investment banker. At the time, Merrill downplayed the move, saying McCann was still a candidate, along with several other executives, to succeed O'Neal. Merrill shares, down 32 percent this year, rose 3.4 percent in afternoon trade on speculation O'Neal would be replaced. McCann, in charge of Merrill's army of 16,610 brokers, is insulated from the turmoil dogging O'Neal. Revenue at his division, Merrill Global Private Client, surged 23 percent to $3.3 billion in the third quarter. And a flood of $26 billion in net new client assets was the strongest quarter in more than six years. During a tense conference call with analysts and investors on Wednesday, O'Neal got a rare chance to be upbeat when he discussed Merrill's global wealth management business, which mostly consists of McCann's operations. "Our global wealth management (revenue) was up 30 percent, and from my own point of view, this is the best business of its kind in the world and continuing to get stronger," O'Neal said. Bernstein Research analyst Brad Hintz said Merrill's retail brokerage produced a 28.7 percent pre-tax margin during the first half of this year. That's better than the 23.8 percent at Citigroup's ( C.N ) Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley's ( MS.N ) 15.8 percent. But if Merrill takes a further $4.5 billion write-down on subprime-related assets in the current quarter, as some analysts suggest, the book value of the overall company would decline an additional 10 percent, Hintz said. O'Neal's town hall meeting on Wednesday drew several hundred employees, with some worried about their jobs and their pay. Many questions came from Merrill brokers.
