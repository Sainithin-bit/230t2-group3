 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N said on Friday it raised list prices on its roast and ground Maxwell House and Yuban coffees, citing higher green-coffee prices. 

 The increase will see a price hike of roughly 10 cents per 11 to 13 ounce equivalent container, effective immediately, spokeswoman Bridget MacConnell said. The increase comes after Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ), the largest U.S. roaster and industry trendsetter, raised its list prices on Tuesday for some of its Folgers Coffee blends, due to gains in green arabica and robusta prices. Massimo Zanetti Beverage USA also increased its list prices on Tuesday by nearly 4 percent for brands including Chock full o'Nuts.
