 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hartford Financial Services Group Inc ( HIG.N ), the fourth-largest U.S. insurer by assets, said on Thursday its third-quarter net income rose 12 percent, helped by growth in its life insurance operations. 

 However, net capital losses of $212 million worried analysts and its shares were up only slightly in aftermarket trading. Hartford said net earnings were $851 million, or $2.68 a share, up from $758 million, or $2.39 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Hartford said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance, were up 46 percent to $1.06 billion or $3.33 a share, exceeding analysts' average forecast of $2.46 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. In the year-ago quarter, Hartford earned $727 million, or $2.30 a share, in operating earnings. Hartford raised its outlook for 2007 operating earnings to a range of $10.60 to $10.75 per share, up from $9.60 to $9.90 a share. In aftermarket trading, Hartford's shares rose less than 1 percent to $92 a share from their close at $91.54 on the New York Stock Exchange, after a loss of 82 cents during the regular trading day. "The $212 million in net realized capital losses is material," said Matt Nellans, an analyst with Morningstar Inc. Hartford Chief Financial Officer David Johnson said in an interview that two-thirds of those losses were due to the widening of spreads on corporate bonds and credit derivatives in Hartford's portfolio during the volatile quarter as investors reacted to the subprime mortgage and credit crises. "Few of these were write-offs," said Johnson. "And only 15 percent of them were subprime." Morningstar's Nellans noted that the company also had a $213 million after-tax gain from deferred costs related to the sale of products such as variable annuities. "The two unusual items balance each other out," Nellans said. Total assets in life operations grew by 21 percent to $367 billion as of the end of September. Net income for Hartford's life operations was $525 million, 23 percent higher than last year's. In the last 12 months, Hartford shares have risen about 2 percent compared to a small decline in the Standard & Poor's insurance index. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt)
