 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N on Friday said it expects to be profitable in mortgage banking in the fourth quarter, and expects loan losses to decline to the low-$200 million range, Chief Financial Officer Eric Sieracki said on a Friday conference call. 

 Separately, Chief Operating Officer David Sambol said the largest U.S. mortgage lender is enjoying "very attractive trends toward margin improvement" as competition declines, despite shifting its focus to smaller, safer loans that Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N will buy. Countrywide earlier Friday said it had procured $18 billion of new liquidity. This includes $6.25 billion of new facilities, on top of $12 billion disclosed in September, the company said. Countrywide also said it has renewed a $10.4 billion asset-backed commercial paper facility for one year. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
