 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Insurer Coventry Health Care Inc CVH.N on Friday posted a 14 percent increase in third-quarter profit, in line with Wall Street's target, as membership grew in its Medicare plans for the elderly. 

 Net earnings rose to $168.7 million, or $1.08 per share, compared with $147.5 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected $1.08 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 32 percent to $2.52 billion, helped in part by two acquisitions made in the past year. Membership was 4.67 million at the end of the quarter, up about 560,000 members from a year ago. Much of that growth has come from new additions to its Medicare plans for the elderly, including 200,000 in its full-service Medicare Advantage plans. Coventry projected full-year earnings of $3.97 to $3.98 per share, up about 15 percent over 2006. It forecast 2008 earnings per share of $4.42 to $4.58, up 11 percent to 15 percent over its 2007 expectations. Analysts had expected 2007 earnings of $4.01 and 2008 earnings of $4.58.
