 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard Life ( SL.L ) said on Friday it was "comfortable" with the cash portion of its 4.9 billion pound ($10.06 billion) cash-and-shares offer for rival insurer Resolution ( RSL.L ), adding it was confident of a positive reception from investors. 

 Standard Life's finance director, David Nish, said the insurer's bid was fully funded, adding debt levels would fall next year, helped by cash thrown up by the Resolution business as well as by Swiss Re's RUKN.VX cash payment for Resolution assets. "I think we have a very strong presentation, a very strong team producing very strong results. Today's share price, in my view, is nowhere near the value of Standard Life's business," Chief Executive Sandy Crombie told reporters. "We are starting a marketing effort on this transaction as of now and I am sure, and expect, we will be well received by investors." He declined to comment on rival suitor Pearl's increased cash offer for Resolution at 720p-per-share, above Standard Life's 715p-per-share.
