 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo on Friday said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an informal inquiry into his stock sales, confirming previous reports, and that he and the company are cooperating. 

 Mozilo has realized more than $100 million of gains in the last year since he began selling shares on a regular basis last October, just as the U.S. housing market was cresting. He later accelerated the pace of those sales twice. Mozilo said "categorically" that "at no time" did he made any trading decisions based on material, nonpublic information, and said he "fully complied" with all Countrywide policies and applicable securities laws. Countrywide is the largest U.S. mortgage lender. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
