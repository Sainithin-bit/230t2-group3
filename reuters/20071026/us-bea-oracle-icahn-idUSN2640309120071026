 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn called on the board of BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O to conduct an auction of the company, then let shareholders vote to accept or reject the results. 

 In a letter to the board, he said BEA should not let a $17-per-share bid for the company from Oracle Corp ORCL.O. disappear. Oracle has said its offer will expire on Sunday and that it will "move on" and look at other possible acquisitions. "If a topping bid arises, then all the better," Icahn said. "But if no topping bid arises it should be up to the BEA shareholders to decide whether to take the Oracle bid or remain as an independent Company," he said in the letter, released in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. A spokesman for BEA could not be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Jim Finkle )
