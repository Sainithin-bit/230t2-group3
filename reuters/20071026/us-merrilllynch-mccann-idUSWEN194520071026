 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N senior executive Robert McCann, who oversees the company's more than 16,000 brokers, has emerged as a possible candidate to replace embattled Chairman and Chief Executive Stan O'Neal, people familiar with the situation said on Friday. 

 McCann, president of Merrill Lynch's global private client business, runs a business that has been insulated from the credit-loss turmoil that has weakened O'Neal's grip on the company. An $8.4 billion write-down on O'Neal's watch has put his tenure in jeopardy and CNBC reported on Friday that he had conceded to friends he could be out of a job by the end of the weekend.
