 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Operating profit at Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) rose more than 50 percent in the third quarter thanks to resurgent earnings at its core VW brand, after the world's fourth-largest carmaker cut thousands of jobs last year. 

 After initially trading sideways, shares in VW got swept up by overall positive sentiment for the sector as stock in French rivals PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) and Renault ( RENA.PA ) rallied as well after strong results published late on Thursday. Fears that its unchanged forecast suggested a cautious outlook for the remaining quarter proved unfounded after Volkswagen's finance chief told a conference call that strong earnings growth would continue. "Regarding the profit trend ... it should be in line with the trends we've seen so far this year," Hans Dieter Poetsch said. VW increased quarterly operating profit to 1.46 billion euros ($2.1 billion), easily beating the 1.31 billion average in a Reuters poll of 17 analysts. The group affirmed it expected to earn at least 5.1 billion euros before tax in 2007 -- a year earlier than first targeted -- adding that its operating result would grow "substantially" over last year's figure of 4.38 billion before special items. This implies a pretax profit of more than 820 million euros for the fourth quarter, or twice what VW earned alone from its non-operational "other" income and the profits from its equity stakes in companies including European truckmakers MAN ( MANG.DE ) and Scania ( SCVb.ST ). "The writing is on the wall ... VW is set to not only easily surpass its year-end 5.1 billion euros pretax target, but we think it could even exceed 6.5 billion euros," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote, adding that earnings could plunge 77 percent in the fourth quarter and still meet VW's target. "This is not going to happen," they said. MARGIN IMPROVES Volkswagen shares, which have more than doubled in the past year in part on speculation that Porsche was angling to gain a controlling majority, rose 4.2 percent to 181.80 despite some concerns that the rally cannot last much longer. "VW is at an all-time valuation peak reflecting both peak earnings and a bid premium: we believe the risks are skewed to the downside and rate the stock 'underperform'," Sanford Bernstein analyst Stephen Cheetham wrote. Net liquidity at its automotive operation at the end of September increased by almost 70 percent to about 13.9 billion euros after it radically reduced its debt, while free cash flow stagnated mainly due to expenses incurred building its stakes in MAN and Scania early this year. Operating profit at its core VW brand more than doubled in the first nine months thanks to successful restructuring and improved sales. This lifted its margin by over 1.6 percentage points to just over 3 percent for the period -- better than the 2007 forecast from French rival PSA of more than 2 percent and in line with restructuring specialist Carlos Ghosn's plans this year for Renault. In an interview to be published on Saturday in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Volkswagen Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn pledged to boost productivity every year by 10 percent while ensuring that future models use parts that can be more easily assembled. "This way we will increase productivity by 20 percent at least in the changeover from the (current) Golf V to the Golf VI," Winterkorn told the paper.
