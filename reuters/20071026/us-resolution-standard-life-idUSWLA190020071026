 LONDON  (Reuters) - Insurer Pearl made a 4.9 billion pound ($10.1 billion) cash offer for rival Resolution ( RSL.L ) on Friday in a dramatic move aimed at thwarting a deal between Resolution and Standard Life ( SL.L ) agreed just hours earlier. 

 Run by entrepreneur Hugh Osmond, a long-time rival of Resolution Chairman Clive Cowdery, Pearl also boosted its position by increasing its stake in Resolution to 24.2 percent. Pearl, which has had two previous approaches rejected by the Resolution board and is backed by mutual insurer Royal London, said on Friday it was now offering 720 pence a share in cash, up 4.2 percent from its last proposal. This compares with a cash-and-shares bid from Standard Life that was worth 715 pence a share at Thursday's closing prices, and which was endorsed by Resolution's board earlier on Friday. Resolution shares, however, climbed as much as 3 percent to 730 pence on speculation the battle had further to run. "We haven't seen the end of this," said Pali International analyst Marcus Barnard. "Standard Life has got to improve the offer. I'm surprised they low-balled it in the first place." Oriel Securities analyst Roman Cizdyn said it was tough to see which way the battle would go, but Pearl's stake and the fact its bid was all cash could give it the upper hand. "We're right in the middle of it. I always thought that Osmond could go higher -- higher still than now. And Standard Life probably can go higher as well," he said. A source close to the matter said Resolution's board would consider Pearl's bid over the weekend and meet with Osmond's team over the coming days. Pearl is expected to go straight to investors if it fails to agree a deal with its rival's board. BIDDING WAR? Resolution, which like Pearl specializes in life funds closed to new business, has been targeted by suitors since it announced plans to merge with Friends Provident FP.L in July. That merger deal formally collapsed on Friday, when Resolution gave its blessing to the deal with Standard, which is backed by reinsurance giant Swiss Re RUKN.VX. Standard Life declined to comment on whether it could sweeten its offer after Pearl's fresh bid. Its partner Swiss Re, however, set to pay 2.35 billion pounds for some Resolution assets, said it had agreed a fixed price, indicating it is unlikely to pay more. "There is considerable upside value to Standard Life shares. You don't have to go very far at all to make this a very attractive offer indeed," Standard Life Chief Executive Sandy Crombie told analysts when asked whether he would raise the bid. Standard Life's offer comprises 517 pence in cash and 0.715 new shares for each Resolution share. Standard Life's shares fell as much as 4 percent after the deal was announced, on concerns that the 1.3 billion pounds of shares it planned to issue would dilute earnings. But the stock bounced back to trade over 4 percent higher after Pearl raised its bid, on speculation Standard Life's offer would fail. Ironically, that pushed the value of Standard Life's cash-and-shares bid above Pearl's to up to 723.8 pence a share. Standard Life, a former mutual which listed last year after a painful overhaul of its business, will take on roughly half of Resolution's closed books of business, but its main interest is in the protection business, distribution and asset management. Buying Resolution would transform Standard Life into one of the UK's leading life and pensions companies with about 7 million UK customers, and create an asset management business with about 191 billion pounds of funds under management. For Swiss Re, the deal would be the biggest to date for its Admin Re unit, which buys up closed life portfolios to administer them and has become one of its main growth drivers. Swiss Re shares were up during the day, as analysts welcomed the fact the company would continue its 4 billion Swiss franc share buy-back programme, even if the deal went through. Standard Life said on Friday it expected to make annual pretax cost savings of at least 53 million pounds by 2010 and financial savings of 18 million pounds before tax. It said Resolution's Cowdery had been invited to become Standard Life's non-executive deputy chairman. One major loser from Friday's maneuvers is jilted partner Friends Provident, with analysts questioning its ability to remain independent. Friends, which will get a break fee of about 49 million pounds, said it was confident of its prospects. Resolution is being advised by Lazard and Citigroup, while Merrill Lynch and UBS are advising Standard Life. Pearl is working with Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and ABN AMRO, while Credit Suisse advised Swiss Re and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan advised Friends Provident.
