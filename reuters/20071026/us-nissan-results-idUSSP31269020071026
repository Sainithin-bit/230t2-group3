 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) posted a surprise 12 percent gain in quarterly operating profit on Friday as a pickup in its global car sales outweighed rising commodity prices, and it kept its full-year forecasts unchanged. 

 Nissan, Japan's third-biggest automaker held 44 percent by Renault SA ( RENA.PA ), has seen sales of light trucks such as the Titan pickup and big SUVs fall in its biggest market, the United States, as competition heats up and consumers turn to more fuel-efficient vehicles. U.S. retail sales volumes in the July-September quarter rose, but were chiefly boosted by less profitable models such as the Versa subcompact and Altima coupe. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn has flagged a firm profit recovery in the latter half of the year supported by new models such as the Rogue, a crossover car-cum-SUV that joins one of the fast-growing segments in the United States. Nissan this week also unveiled a new incarnation of its iconic GT-R sports car at the Tokyo Motor Show, hoping to boost its brand image and increase showroom traffic to sell other, mainstay products. Many analysts have said they expected Nissan to fall short of its full-year targets, partly due to the yen's recent resilience against the dollar and soaring commodity prices. July-September operating profit at Nissan was 218.71 billion yen ($1.91 billion), beating an average estimate of 183.5 billion yen in a survey of four brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Net profit slid 27 percent to 120.11 billion yen from the year before, when it booked extraordinary gains from the sale of shares in truck affiliate Nissan Diesel Motor Co to Volvo AB ( VOLVb.ST ) and had a lower tax rate. Revenue grew 13 percent to 2.618 trillion yen. Japanese automakers' earnings are under the spotlight following a powerful earthquake in northern Japan at the beginning of the July-September quarter, which disrupted production at all of the country's automakers. Nissan's larger rival Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) reported a 48 percent jump in second-quarter operating profit a day earlier on brisk sales of its fuel-efficient CR-V crossover. Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), the world's biggest automaker, is due to report on November 7. Consensus forecasts put Nissan's operating profit at 785.5 billion yen for the year to next March, against the company's projection of 800 billion yen. Nissan left its net profit forecast at 480 billion yen, or up 4.2 percent from 2006/07. Nissan shares fell 24 percent in the year to Thursday, underperforming Tokyo's transport sub-index .ITEQP.T, which has lost 18 percent. Prior to the earnings announcement, the stock ended up 3.2 percent on Friday, against a 4.2 percent rise in the subindex.
