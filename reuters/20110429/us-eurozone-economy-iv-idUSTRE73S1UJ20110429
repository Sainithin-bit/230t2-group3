 (Reuters) - Euro zone inflation rose further above the European Central Bank's target in April, data showed, increasing the chances of another interest rate rise in June despite a weakening of economic sentiment. 

 ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS PIET LAMMENS, ECONOMIST AT KBC ON INFLATION: "It's slightly higher than consensus but that wasn't a complete surprise. We saw from Germany and Spain, which already published numbers, that it could go this way. However, I can imagine that some market participants will expect the rate increase by the European Central Bank at an earlier date. We expected June, the market is still expecting July. I guess the consensus will now move to June." DOMINIQUE BARBET, SENIOR ECONOMIST AT BNP PARIBAS ON INFLATION: "We said in the morning meeting today that risks were skewed to the upside since the release of the German CPI, which was higher than expected. The stronger Spanish inflation also reinforced such risks. No detail is available for the time being; however the rising energy prices and the impact of Easter, which came late in the month, may explain the inflation pick-up. Of course this can only comfort the prospect of more rate hikes from the ECB. This also highlights the need of a strong upward revision of the inflation forecast in the next set of ECB staff projections due early June. We forecast the next rate increase for July, however the risk of an earlier move signaled by the use of the "strong vigilance" terminology during next week's press conference cannot be completely ruled out." ALINE SCHUILING SENIOR ECONOMIST ABN AMRO ON INFLATION: "This is the flash estimate and we do not have the details yet, but we think that energy price inflation increased, while the core rate fell somewhat. "The core rate unexpectedly jumped higher in March on the back of clothing prices, which seems to be due to the timing of discount sales and should have been reversed in April. "Looking forward, we expect headline inflation to remain well above 2 percent for the whole of this year, before dropping back in line with the ECB's price stability goal next year. "This is based on the view that the uptrend in core inflation will be limited by significant levels of slack in the economy, while food and energy price inflation should drop back noticeably. "Inflation is likely to average around 2.6 percent this year and 1.8 percent next. "The inflation numbers support the view that the ECB will deliver another interest rate hike before long. Indeed, although we expect a rate increase at the July meeting, the balance of risks is tilted toward an earlier move."
