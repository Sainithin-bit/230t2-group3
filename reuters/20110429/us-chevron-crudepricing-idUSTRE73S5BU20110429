 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) is switching to Europe's Brent crude benchmark from West Texas Intermediate (WTI) when calculating production-sharing contract changes, to better reflect moves in international oil prices. 

 Chevron, the third-largest nongovernment-controlled oil company by value, said on Friday that higher oil prices cut volumes under production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts in the first quarter by about 22,000 barrels per day (bpd). "Given the recent divergence in the WTI-Brent spread, going forward we will use the change in Brent to calculate a price effect because it is more closely tied to our international realizations," Jeanette Ourada, general manager of investors relations, told analysts on a conference call. Ourada said Brent prices increased by an average $19 per barrel between the fourth quarter and first quarter, resulting in a 1,200-bpd volume reduction for each $1 increase in Brent. The San Ramon, California-based firm had earlier reported a near 1 percent decline in overall first-quarter oil and gas production, along with a sharp rise in profits. Brent has gained momentum as the global oil price reference of choice for producers and users, in a battle of benchmarks for the world's most widely traded commodity. Earlier this month, Malaysia's Petronas PETR.UL dropped national crude Tapis as its export benchmark in favor of Brent. Two weeks earlier, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ) announced it had swapped out its previous jet fuel hedges based on the WTI contract, and switched to Brent.
