 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - In February, the entire front page of a Finnish tabloid featured Nokia cellphones in the shape of a cross beneath the headline: "Beginning of the End." 

 The reaction to new CEO Stephen Elop's announcement that Nokia would dump its Symbian software in favor of Microsoft Windows summed up the Nordic country's fear that he would kill jobs and a business considered a national treasure. Less than three months on, the would-be grim reaper from Silicon Valley is increasingly seen as the company's best chance of reviving its ailing smartphone business. It will not be easy to turn around the world's largest cellphone maker, which has surrendered dominance of the handset market to Apple and Google and which Elop himself described as a "burning platform" in February. "It speaks volumes that Elop was able to stand up in the company canteen, deliver his burning platforms speech and then get a round of applause - particularly when he had essentially outlined a strategy that would result in many people in the room losing their jobs," says Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight. But people who have worked with Elop say his openness and optimism - a stark contrast to predecessor Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo's stiff demeanor and terse communication style - is keeping up morale even as he makes tough decisions. Nokia said on Wednesday its shift to Microsoft software would mean transferring 3,000 staff to Accenture and cutting a further 4,000 jobs, mostly in Finland, Denmark and Britain. HALT DECLINE Elop, the first non-Finn to run the company, was enticed last September from his post as President of Microsoft's Business Division to lead Nokia and halt its decline. His software know-how and leadership skills will stand him in good stead but at Nokia he will have to focus on hardware rather than the programing that has become so crucial to the success of smartphones. He started leading transformations early while studying computer engineering and management in Canada's McMaster University, where he ran a project to replace electric typewriters with networked computers. "Steve had the expertise and the initiative to do it. He was so innovative," says 75-year old Don Woods, former director of the program Elop took. Jim Reilly, associate chair of the department of electrical and computer engineering who was a young teacher fresh to the program when Elop graduated says he has a glowing personality. "He shone like a light bulb," Reilly said. QUICK CAREER MOVES Elop spent seven years at Macromedia, the San Francisco-based software house which produced Web design tools beloved of Apple developers. Macromedia made the Flash video software that powered the rise of YouTube, and Dreamweaver, widely used to build websites. It successfully pushed to get Flash into mobile devices, winning over every handset maker and service provider including Nokia. Adobe bought Macromedia for $3.4 billion in 2005. But when it was plain he was not going to become the next Adobe CEO, Elop wasted little time in moving to Juniper Networks as COO, and then on to Microsoft to run its business division -- a $19 billion operation that includes Microsoft's Office software and is the largest of the company's five divisions. While Elop did not develop a public profile there, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer has praised him as a solid leader during the recession. "Stephen is a visionary with a good balance of strategic thinking and relentless execution," says Ashish Gupta, who worked with Elop in Microsoft. Elop helped steer the company toward online versions of programs such as Word, Outlook and Excel, which users could access from anywhere, including mobile devices. That was a tough transition for Microsoft, whose fortune is founded on software installed on desktop computers. The company announced a tie-up with Nokia a year ago as part of this drive. Microsoft's chief negotiator in the deal? Elop. "He is meticulous and thoughtful in making decisions and then managing them toward success," says Gupta, now marketing chief at video technology firm Vidyo. "He learns the landscape quickly, makes sound decisions and motivates his team to deliver." (Additional reporting by  Alastair Sharp  in Toronto; Editing by David Cowell)
