 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Standard and Poor's downgraded its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt rating on Wednesday, warning that the huge cost of last month's earthquake will hurt the country's already weak public finances without tax hikes. 

 Below are key quotes from policymakers and an analyst at the rating agency: TOM BYRNE, MOODY'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SINGAPORE "The bottom line is we are maintaining a negative outlook and watching developments ... "The most immediate concern we have is the comprehensive tax reform program (due to be announced in June). That has not changed at all. The only thing that has changed is that probably the government debt trajectory has been bumped upward and deficit will be greater in fiscal 2011 than the government had anticipated, yet (that is) not great enough to prompt any immediate negative rating action ... "The bottom line is what the government deficit will be and how that will contribute to government debt. "We would expect some combination of expenditure reduction or expenditure shifting ... or perhaps tax increases ... "We are interested in the bottom line, that's the rating bottom line -- the government fiscal deficit and government debt." TAKAHIRO OGAWA, S&P SOVEREIGN RATINGS DIRECTOR, SINGAPORE "With politics, it's very difficult to tell. Any changes in politics that have negative implications for fiscal or macroeconomic policy could be a trigger for future action ... "If you look at long-term rates, they show that markets aren't worried now, but reconstruction spending will slowly erode Japan's fiscal position. "A lack of consensus on economic policies contributed to the change in the ratings outlook. "The government can do more by having a better review of spending to use public funds more efficiently. There are also revenue-enhancing measures, but it's up to the government to decide how to fund reconstruction. "If the government spends money wisely, reconstruction spending could push up domestic demand, which could lead to an increase in revenue." FINANCE MINISTER YOSHIHIKO NODA "I won't comment on specific action by private rating agencies. "The government at present is doing its utmost for disaster relief and reconstruction. It is important to pursue fiscal reform at the same time. "We will try to gain trust in Japan's economy and public finances in and outside Japan. "Fiscal reform is something we cannot avoid." JAPAN CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY YUKIO EDANO "Obviously various steps are needed, including fiscal ones, to deal with the natural and nuclear disasters. But on the other hand achieving this while retaining trust in JGBs is a key principle we want to firmly retain." JAPAN DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER FUMIHIKO IGARASHI "It (the negative ratings outlook) shows the earthquake has cast doubt about Japan's fiscal reform efforts."
