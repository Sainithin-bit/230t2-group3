 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Standard and Poor's lowered the outlook for Japan's sovereign rating to negative on Wednesday, saying the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant disaster will increase Japan's fiscal deficits above previous estimates. 

 ********************************************************* KEY POINTS: - The rating agency affirmed Japan's sovereign rating at AA minus. - It estimates that reconstruction costs could range from 20 to 50 trillion yen ($245-613 billion). - It does not expect the disasters to materially affect Japan's long-term growth. COMMENTARY TAKUJI OKUBO, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE SECURITIES, TOKYO "In my view the S&P rating cut is premature with no upper end concerns in funding (government bonds) and no visible signs that the market is worried about Japan's credit. "This will put more pressure on the Japanese government to do something about revenue enhancement and I think ... could be positive for Japan in the sense that it will push the Japanese government into raising the consumption tax next April." KIMIHIKO TOMITA, HEAD OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, STATE STREET BANK & TRUST CO, TOKYO "We already know Japan's fiscal position is bad. "The government can finance debt within Japan, but maybe in the next two to three years we are afraid that we cannot finance our liabilities by ourselves. At that point overseas investors would start selling yen. "The time it will take to reach the tipping point may have been brought up. "Yields may rise in the medium term but the JGB market won't just crash. There are a lot of individuals who worry about public finances and park their money in the bank, but they don't realize that money goes into JGBs." JUNKO NISHIOKA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RBS SECURITIES, TOKYO "Given the huge damage from the earthquake, everyone knows that government spending will be massive. We are not expecting big new government bond issuance for the coming second supplementary budget but political deadlock is likely to heighten the negative risk for sovereign debt. "There is a possibility that debate on raising the consumption tax may not make much progress because of the political stalemate. "But in the immediate future, politicians from both ruling and opposition parties may refrain from pushing for dissolving parliament for a snap election given the urgency of dealing with the disaster. So the impact from the S&P move on markets may be limited." BACKGROUND: - Japan is facing its worst crisis since World War Two after a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and a tsunami battered its northeast coast on March 11, leaving nearly 28,000 dead or missing and triggering radiation leaks at a nuclear power plant. - Japan's economy is expected to contract in the current quarter but will grow again in July-September on reconstruction efforts, a Reuters poll showed. Some economists say gross domestic product may have contracted in January-March, meaning three straight quarters of contraction to June cannot be ruled out.
