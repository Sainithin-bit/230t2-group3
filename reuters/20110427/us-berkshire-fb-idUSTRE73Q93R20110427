 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway released a report from its audit committee that suggested former executive David Sokol may have violated Delaware law. 

 Below are some of the accusations featured in the report: * Sokol bought Lubrizol shares while serving as Berkshire's representative in connection with a possible deal * He made "misleadingly incomplete" disclosures of the share purchases to senior management, falling short of the expected degree of candor * Sokol's purchases violated the prohibition on employees trading securities of another company while anticipating a possible merger between Berkshire and that company * Sokol used confidential information for stock trading purposes * He used information obtained as a representative of Berkshire and for the purposes of potential profit by Berkshire as an opportunity to make a profit for himself * Sokol did not meet the full disclosure criteria expected from an employee when facing an ethically ambiguous situation or a potential conflict of interest * He also did not satisfy the full disclosure mandated by the state law of Delaware, where Berkshire is incorporated * Sokol did not disclose his plan to buy Lubrizol shares to Berkshire's audit committee, which he would be required to do if he thought the transaction might involve a material potential conflict of interest Sokol's attorney could not immediately be reached for comment.
