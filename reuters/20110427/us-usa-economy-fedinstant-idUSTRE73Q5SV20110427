 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve signaled on Wednesday it is in no rush to scale back its extensive support for the U.S. economy and said a run-up in commodity prices that has dented growth should be fleeting. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said in a statement after a two-day meeting it intends to complete its $600 billion bond buying program in June as scheduled. * Despite some headwinds, the U.S. central bank indicated that it believed the economic recovery was proceeding at a moderate pace, with little risk an inflationary psychology would take hold. * "Inflation has picked up in recent months, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable and measures of underlying inflation are still subdued," it said. COMMENTS: JIM VOGEL, HEAD OF FIXED INCOME RESEARCH, FTN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE "The market's response is like, gosh, nothing. What's interesting about the market reaction is that earlier this year if people thought the Fed was going to come out with the statement at the April meeting they would have been selling bonds. But they aren't selling bond. It's possible that the six month fight with the Fed is over and the Fed has won. "You had this pattern where the Fed would speak, confirming its current views and people would sell bonds right and left so you're always watching to see if people are going to do it again. It seems like the market is much closer in line with the Fed now than it was before." JOHN BRADY, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT - GLOBAL INTEREST RATE PRODUCTS, MF GLOBAL, CHICAGO: "FOMC statement is very similar to what we saw last time. There were no significant changes in policy. There is slight nod to inflation pressure. They were not going to throw any curve balls today. "We don't think there will be any surprises at Bernanke's press conference. They want to establish this press conference as a successful platform and one of the tools to communicate its message if the market conditions necessitate. He will play it right down the middle." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It's basically a nonevent, as was expected. Today's comments were mostly all in line with expectations. (Bernanke's comments) should be more of the same; I'm not sure it's going to sway movement, though you could get some type of minor movement. I think we're looking at it through a microscope here, and we're not going to find much. But there seems to be heightened alert." BOB ANDRES, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT MERION WEALTH PARTNERS IN BERWYN, PENNSYLVANIA "The comments didn't have much of an impact since they were what everyone expected. Some investors are probably nervous ahead of the press conference, but I don't think they should be. The Fed doesn't really have an option to stay the course, so any reaction to the speech will be short-lived. It won't impact the way people view investing compared with yesterday." KEITH SPRINGER, PRESIDENT, SPRINGER FINANCIAL ADVISORS, SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA: "It's increased stimulus without a name. It's the Bernanke tightrope walk. He knows that we can't withdraw stimulus but it can't come across as too much stimulus because that would be inflationary and too negative for the markets. "The Fed will use the proceeds of these bonds to continue buying new bonds. It's still in the billions ... the fact that the stock market didn't sell off is important. This market is so reliant on continued stimulus. The more you give it the higher its going to go." "Bernanke kept the extended period language and that tells you the Fed sees continued weakness ... the big concern among people was inflation. The Fed obviously doesn't see inflation. It sees more of a threat of deflation." NICK BENNENBROEK, HEAD OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK, NEW YORK: "When you look through the statement there really is little change in Fed policy as most of the key phrases are identical to the last meeting. They will continue to monitor inflation but there was nothing there to give change the dollar short positioning. Since there were no changes to the significant phrases surrounding inflation people will continue selling the dollar at this point. The statement indicates that investors will continue to play the dollar from the short side and look to sell it against other currencies." GENE MCGILLIAN, ANALYST, TRADITION ENERGY IN STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "It doesn't seem like they changed anything. They are leaving interest rates unchanged and reaffirming the end of QE2 and the dollar is starting to get hit on that. "If anything, the statement the will be mildly supportive for oil prices, but the driver today seems to be more about oil product inventories. The key level is the recent multi-year highs around $113.50. We will wait to see if any fresh length comes into the market." ENRIQUE ALVAREZ, LATIN AMERICAN DEBT STRATEGIST, IDEAGLOBAL, NEW YORK: "We don't have frontal effects at this time. It is more of the same rhetoric as far as low rates for an extended period. "I don't think that the pass-through to Latin America is really large here. The main point was to look at the forward-looking prognosis on what they were going to do with their QE2 program. That is fairly in place from the text of the communique and there is no mention of what happens after June. "So in the meantime, Latam is left on the same path, which essentially is abundant liquidity and we see what happens at the end of June at the end of QE2. The abundant liquidity obviously favoring risk tolerance which is the Latam game at this point in time." TOM KNIGHT, SENIOR TRADER, TRUMAN ARNOLD, TEXARKANA, TEXAS "Since the Fed is ignoring inflationary pressures, it suggest further downside pressure on the dollar which would translate into higher commodity prices." DOMINICK CHIRICHELLA, SENIOR PARTNER, ENERGY MANAGEMENT INSTITUTE, NEW YORK: "The Fed statement was supportive for oil. It came in pretty much as everybody expected. What was a little bit different is that the slack time in the recovery is longer now. This is positive for oil. It means the Fed will continue with its easing monetary policy for some time and that will mean a weaker dollar." CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "There are very few word changes in the statement, but this is just the first strike today in terms of learning what the Fed is up to. There's a lot more information to come at the press conference at 2:15 p.m. when the Fed chairman will put some flesh on the bones of this statement. As far as the market reaction is concerned, I can only think that people are waiting until 2:15." JOHN MCCARTHY, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY TRADING AT ING CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK: "Bit of dollar selling on the announcement as expected but respecting the day's ranges. Nothing too much has changed. Still waiting for Mr Bernanke's Q&A." BRET BARKER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT TCW, LOS ANGELES: "We did not expect any material surprises in the FOMC statement and there was none. It remains quite dovish. It could be argued they slightly downgraded growth and maintained the view that inflation is 'transitory.' It was very boilerplate." SEAN INCREMONA, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "There were no surprises, they largely stuck to the script from what I can see at first glance. Policy is unchanged, which is what was expected. It was out baseline projection that they would complete the QE2 program in full through June. There was some question about whether they could maybe taper it but the plan that we saw in November is intact." IGOR CASHYN, INT. RATE STRATEGIST, MORGAN STANLEY, NEW YORK: "I think it was largely as expected, the extended language stayed. They are viewing the inflation pickup as transitory, which makes sense because core PCE is still at 0.9 percent year-on-year which is still a way off from the 1.6 percent that they expect. Inflation expectations over the longer term are still stable." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS: "The latest FOMC statement makes only subtle changes to that released on March 15, but sounds a little more concerned about rising inflation but a little less positive on growth, and makes it clear QE2 will be complete at the end of this quarter, thus no tapering into Q3. On growth the FOMC state that the recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace rather than on a firmer footing, which seems slightly less upbeat. However they state explicitly that inflation has picked up rather than simply commodity prices are putting upward pressure on inflation, hinting at a heightened degree of concern, though it still sees underlying inflation as low relative to the mandate and notes stable longer-term inflation expectations and subdued underlying inflation. There were no adjustments to QE2 though is made explicit that the program will be completed by the end of the current quarter (the word complete was absent on March 17). This appears to be satisfactory to the hawks, who give no dissent." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes added to gains BONDS: U.S. bond prices added to losses FOREX: The dollar added to gains
