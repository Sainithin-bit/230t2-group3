 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( B.N ) is leaning toward building a new variant of its popular 737 aircraft rather than simply placing more efficient engines on the current design, a senior company executive said on Wednesday. 

 Jim Albaugh, chief of the manufacturer's commercial aircraft division, said Boeing would "provide more clarity" on future plans for the workhorse jetliner closer to the middle of the year. "We're looking at a lot of different options. Clearly a new small airplane is one that we have talked about," Albaugh said on the sidelines of a U.S. Chamber of Commerce aviation forum. He added that so called "reengining" of the 737 has not been ruled out but said it was "fair to say" Boeing was at this point leaning in the other direction. Albaugh also said that Boeing is seeing productivity gains in the long-delayed 787 "Dreamliner" wide-body as it sorts out years of supplier and other problems. "The learning curve on that program continues to improve," Albaugh said. "As we clean up the condition of assembly, the productivity that we're seeing in our factories and our supplier factories continues to improve." (Reporting by  John Crawley , editing by Bernard Orr)
