 TOKYO  (Reuters) - - Japan's first supplementary budget for disaster relief, worth 4 trillion yen ($49 billion), will likely boost gross domestic product by 0.6 percent this fiscal year, the government said on Wednesday, partly offsetting damage to economic growth from the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. 

 The emergency budget, to be submitted to parliament on Thursday, focuses on disaster relief, public works projects, removal of debris and restoration of infrastructure. Of the total, 600 billion yen is for disaster-related loans. The remaining 3.4 trillion yen will directly add to the public demand component of GDP, the Cabinet Office said. The extra budget is also expected to create about 200,000 jobs, it said. Japan's GDP totaled 474 trillion yen ($5.8 trillion) in nominal terms in fiscal 2009/2010. The government estimated in December that GDP would grow a real 1.5 percent in fiscal 2011/12, which started on April 1. But the effects of the earthquake and tsunami, which disrupted supply chains and triggered power outages, are certain to cause the government to revise down its estimates in the coming months. The Bank of Japan holds a policy review on Thursday at which it is expected to sharply cut its growth estimate for the current fiscal year to between 0.5 and 1 percent, from 1.6 percent projected in January, roughly in line with a 0.7 percent projection by analysts polled by Reuters earlier this month. In addition to job creation, the government is set to spend an additional 730 billion yen for subsidies to companies to support employment by tapping a special account, with the move seen affecting some 1.45 million jobs. The government has not yet said how much it expects GDP to have been reduced by the disaster, though it estimates material damage alone could top $300 billion in the world's costliest natural disaster, and is expected to come up with more spending packages later to fund reconstruction.
