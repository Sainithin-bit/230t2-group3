 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ), the business lender run by former Merrill Lynch Chief Executive John Thain, said first-quarter profit fell 55 percent, hurt by charges linked to buying back debt. 

 The company earned $65.6 million, or 33 cents per share, down from $144.5 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Thain has been cutting costs and selling assets to pay down high-cost debt left from CIT's 2009 bankruptcy while he seeks new, cheaper sources of financing. Repaying high-cost debt results in early payment fees, though. CIT, a century-old lender, collapsed after it lost money on bad loans and mortgage securities and investors were unwilling to continue funding it. The company's results since bankruptcy have benefited from so-called fresh start accounting that reset the value of its assets and liabilities. CIT's year-earlier first-quarter results were boosted by $364 million in accounting benefits. Under fresh start accounting, earnings benefit when borrowers repay loans whose value was marked down in the bankruptcy. The adjustments have complicated CIT's reported results, as have one-time gains on asset sales and fees for early repayment of debt. In the first quarter CIT repaid the last $750 million of a series of bonds bearing a 10.25 percent interest rate, and also redeemed $1 billion of 7 percent notes. The company's net interest margin, reflecting the difference between the interest it pays on money it borrows and the interest it receives on loans it makes, rose to 1.46 percent from 0.71 percent a year earlier. The figures exclude fresh start accounting adjustments and debt repayment fees. CIT's book value per share rose 4.7 percent to $44.85.
