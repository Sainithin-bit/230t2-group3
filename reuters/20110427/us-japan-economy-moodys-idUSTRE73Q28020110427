 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service is maintaining a negative outlook on Japan's sovereign debt rating and watching developments, its senior vice-president Tom Byrne said on Wednesday. 

 Byrne made the remarks after S&P lowered the outlook for Japan's sovereign rating to negative on Wednesday, saying the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear power plant disaster will increase Japan's fiscal deficits above previous estimates. "The bottom line is we are maintaining a negative outlook and watching developments," Byrne told Reuters in an interview. "We are interested in the bottom line, that's the rating bottom line -- the government fiscal deficit and government debt." Moody's warned in February it might cut Japan's Aa2 rating -- its third highest -- if government policies fall short of comprehensive tax reform. Byrne said the most immediate concern has not changed since then, which is to see if the government can come up with comprehensive programs in June to bring huge public debt under control in a fast-aging society. Japan's debt trajectory has been bumped upwards and its deficit will be greater in fiscal 2011/12 than the government had anticipated in the wake of the March 11 earthquake, Byrne said. But it was not great enough to prompt any immediate negative rating action, he said. Byrne expects the government to use a combination of a shift in spending cuts and tax rises to fund the cost of reconstruction. "The bottom line is what the government deficit will be and how that will contribute to government debt." (Reporting by Tetsushi Kajimoto; Editing by  Michael Watson )
