 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission is probing former Berkshire Hathaway ( BRKa.N ) executive David Sokol, who has been under scrutiny for his trading in Lubrizol LZ.N, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 The source, who asked not to be named because the probe is not public, said the SEC's review started before a Berkshire audit committee report released on Wednesday found that Sokol intended to deceive the company in the way he disclosed his interest in Lubrizol.
