 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Cost cuts and bigger margins helped General Dynamics ( GD.N ) and Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ) deliver stronger-than-expected quarterly profits as U.S. budget issues hampered sales. 

 Tighter global defense budgets are expected to challenge contractors, which are shedding nonstrategic operations and looking to buy higher-growth technologies. Earlier this month, U.S. President Barack Obama called for shaving $400 billion from U.S. security-related spending from fiscal 2013 through 2023 as part of deficit-reduction moves. "The trouble for the defense stocks has got more to do with the direction of the defense budget because of pressures from federal spending than with who is in charge at this point," said Morningstar analyst Anil Daka. "We think that the top lines are not going to go particularly well." Standard & Poor's Equity downgraded General Dynamics to "hold" from "buy" on Wednesday, saying weaker defense budgets at home and abroad will weigh. Boeing Co ( BA.N ) also topped Wall Street profit estimates despite flat sales in its defense unit. The company is benefiting from a recovery in commercial aerospace. BUDGET ISSUES AFFECT Q1 General Dynamics, whose products include tanks, ships and Gulfstream jets, told analysts that defense orders were "somewhat light" in the first quarter, partly reflecting delays in U.S. defense appropriations legislation. "With its recent passage, we expect healthier order activity in the coming weeks and months," Chief Executive Jay Johnson said on a conference call. Northrop, which last month spun off its ship business, also said U.S. budget funding affected first-quarter sales, which fell 3 percent to $6.73 billion. Northrop raised its full-year profit forecast. Net earnings at General Dynamics were $618 million, or $1.64 a share, for the quarter, ahead of analysts' average estimates of $1.61 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue rose less than 1 percent to nearly $7.8 billion. Operating profit rose at General Dynamics' aerospace, combat systems and marine systems divisions but declined in information systems. At Northrop Grumman, which supplies unmanned spy planes and does ballistic missile defense work, net income came to $530 million, or $1.79 a share. On a continuing basis, profit was $1.67 per share, topping analysts' average estimate of $1.56. Northrop said pension adjustment produced income of $103 million in the latest quarter, up from $2 million a year earlier. It said lower corporate expenses also aided profit. Shares of General Dynamics were up 0.2 percent at $72.75 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Northrop shares were up 0.8 percent at $63, also on the NYSE.
