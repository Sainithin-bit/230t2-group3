 (Reuters) - Standard and Poor's on Wednesday downgraded its outlook on Japan's sovereign debt rating, warning that the huge cost of last month's devastating earthquake will hurt the country's already weak public finances without tax hikes. 

 The warning could embolden those in the government who are pushing for higher taxes. Still, the rebuke will likely be of little comfort to Prime Minister Naoto Kan, who has been accused by opposition politicians, his own party and quake survivors of failing to take command of the response. The following are comments and actions by ratings agencies on Japan: STANDARD & POOR'S -- Standard & Poor's lowered its outlook for Japan's rating to negative from stable three months after it cut the rating for the first time in nine years to by one notch to AA-minus, its fourth highest rating and one level below Moody's and Fitch's ratings. -- S&P said in a statement on its downgrade on January 27 that the move reflected its view that Japan's government debt ratio, or the ratio of debt to GDP, already among the highest for rated sovereign debt, will continue to rise. -- In January 2010, the agency cut the outlook for government debt to negative from stable, citing reduced wiggle room on fiscal policy and voicing disappointment with the government's budget consolidation plans. -- S&P said in a statement on April 27 that they lowered Japan's outlook because the March 11 earthquake, tsunami, and damage to Tokyo Electric Power Co. Inc.'s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant mean Japan's fiscal deficit will exceed S&P's previous forecast of 3.7 percent of gross domestic product to 2013. MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE -- Moody's changed the outlook on Japan's Aa2 sovereign rating to negative from stable on February 22 due to heightened concern that economic and fiscal policies would fall short of the tax reform needed to achieve deficit reduction targets and curb a rise in debt. -- Moody's said on March 21 that Japan's economy could shrink after a devastating earthquake and tsunami, but the government has the fiscal and credit means to deal with a disaster. -- In May 2009 Moody's cut Japan's foreign currency rating to Aa2 from AAA but raised the domestic debt rating to Aa2 from Aa3. The outlook in both cases is stable. Moody's last lowered Japan's local currency bond rating in May 2002. -- Moody's said in May 2009 it believed the domestic market would absorb the record level of bond issuance that year to fund the government's economic stimulus plans. It said the rating reflected the risks of Japan's high level of debt, which leaves the country's fiscal position vulnerable to shocks or imbalances that could cause a sharp rise in interest rates. -- Moody's said on January 30 that Japan's credit strengths include high national income, savings and economic resilience, a broad and deep market for government debt, and a very strong external payments position. On the other hand, credit challenges for Japan stem from high government debt and fiscal consolidation, deflation and sustainability of economic growth, as well as demographic pressures due to a fast-aging population. FITCH RATINGS -- In September 2009, shortly after the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) swept to power for the first time, Fitch kept Japan's long-term foreign and local currency issuer default ratings at AA and AA minus, respectively, both with a stable outlook. It last cut the ratings in November 2001 and November 2002, respectively. -- Fitch said in September 2009 that deterioration in Japan's public finances was offset by an exceptionally strong external balance sheet. The agency also said it was too early to judge if the DPJ's policies could be financed without additional debt even though the priority of the newly elected government was still to stimulate economic growth. -- The agency said after S&P's downgrade on January 27 that Japan's sovereign ratings were supported by its ability to fund itself at low yields but that a failure to make progress on fiscal consolidation would put downward pressure on its ratings. Japan's aging population and a drawdown of savings by households to fund retirement posed a threat to funding conditions in the medium term, said Andrew Colquhoun, head of Asia Pacific sovereign ratings at the agency. -- In June 2010, Fitch said Japan's newly announced medium-term fiscal framework lacked detail on how its targets would be achieved, calling the targets "relatively unambitious". While a debate was under way on raising the consumption tax from 5 percent, Fitch said it saw a risk that any fiscal gains could be swallowed up by higher social security spending rather than contributing to deficit reduction.
