 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods rose more than expected in March and bookings for the prior month were much stronger than initially thought, pointing to continued strength in the manufacturing sector. 

 For a separate gauge of U.S. Midwest manufacturing see: KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said on Wednesday durable goods orders increased 2.5 percent after an upwardly revised 0.7 percent rise in February, which was previously reported as a 0.6 percent fall. * Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 2.0 percent increase in March. Orders last month were buoyed by bookings for motor vehicles, transportation equipment and aircraft. * Excluding transportation, durable goods orders rose 1.3 percent after a revised 0.6 percent gain in February, which was previously reported as a 0.3 percent drop. Economists had expected this category to rise 1.8 percent. COMMENTS: CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK "It's better than expected because the numbers were pretty much spot-on in March but revised way up in February. Even so, because there was such a big drop in January, orders are still down in the quarter as a whole. It signals at least a slowdown in equipment spending for GDP when we get that. "It's likely that the slowdown is attributable to the weather because a lot of the economic statistics showed weakness because of storms in the east in January and February. "I don't expect that you're going to see interruptions (from Japan) until later, maybe in the second quarter. "It doesn't look like there was any impact from high oil prices on orders. But obviously that doesn't mean you're not going to see a reaction in the second quarter." CORT GWON, CHIEF STRATEGIST AT HUDSONVIEW CAPITAL MANAGEMENT IN NEW YORK "What probably happened is that rising commodities are slowing demand a little bit. As oil and other commodities rise, companies think twice about ordering new machines or other heavy goods. But in general the economy is still going strong. Some of the global headwinds we were dealing with have sort of receded to the background." JULIA CORONADO, CHIEF ECONOMIST-NORTH AMERICA, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK "It's a pretty solid report. The upward revisions do explain the recent disparity between manufacturing reports like the ISM and business investments. Now things are more in line. We are going to get a decent investment reading in Q1. "This is not going to change a subdued reading in Q1 GDP. The manufacturing sector remains one of the stronger sectors in the economy while other sectors lag. "The Fed is trying to walk a very fine line right now. The Q1 economic readings show how fragile the recovery still is. We have risk-averse consumers who are bending under the weight of rising energy prices. So you will probably see the Fed speak about an improving economy and acknowledge rising energy prices without sounding too hawkish. The economy still needs the support of the Fed." VIMOMBI NSHOM, ECONOMIST, IFR ECONOMICS, A UNIT OF THOMSON REUTERS "Orders for durable goods finally posted the strong performance other manufacturing surveys had indicated earlier in the year, rising by a respectable 2.5% in March. Even more encouraging is the fact that February's originally reported surprise decline of 0.9% (thought to have been devoured entirely by defense orders) has been revised to a 0.7% (with larger positives and smaller negatives in nearly every good). "This revision, as well as January's -- which is showing a better performance a tenth of a percentage point in every breakdown (headline, ex. trans, & ex. defense)-- contributes to manufacturer's average growth of 2.1% in the first three months of the year. Comparing growth annually, manufacturers ordered 9.6% more goods than what was ordered March 2010. "The goods of larger influence, transportation and capital, rose notedly from February, by 5.9% and 3.7% -- as did most other orders such as machinery (up 4.2% after having been down 0.1%) and metals (up 3.9% vs 0.9%). Within transportation, auto orders rose 3.7% (similar to the prior month's 3.5% advance), and defense orders grew 6.3% after February's decline of 16.1%. When excluding for transportation, orders grew by 1.3% -- its second month of positive showing (Feb, up 0.6%). "Nondefense capital goods rose by 3.2% over the month, and are up 14.4% over the year. When excluding for aircraft, these types of orders are still up 3.7%, which is better showing than the 0.5% gain in February." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures show little reaction, remain steady at higher levels. BONDS: U.S. bond prices steady at lower levels. FOREX: The dollar was steady at lower levels versus the euro.
