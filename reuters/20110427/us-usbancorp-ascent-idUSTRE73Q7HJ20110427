 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - US Bancorp ( USB.N ) plans to open two offices by fourth quarter 2011 to launch the Midwestern bank's new boutique unit catering to the ultra-wealthy, the division's president said on Wednesday. 

 The Minneapolis-based bank plans to open offices in its headquarters city and Denver for the unit, called Ascent Private Capital Management. Long-term, US Bancorp plans to open six offices across its Midwestern footprint catering to clients with at least $25 million in investable assets, said Michael Cole, president of Ascent Private Capital Management. The new division will ultimately employ 60 advisers and support personnel, Cole said. US Bancorp announced plans earlier this year to formally create a wealth management unit focused on ultra-high net worth clients. Banks have become more interested in offering those services because while they generate lower profitability than some other businesses, they provide the steady, consistent earnings that shareholders want.
