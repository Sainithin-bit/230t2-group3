 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP is seeking $1 billion in loans from seven banks for up to $7 billion, a senior London-based loan banker told Thomson Reuters LPC on Friday, as the company raises funds while battling to plug a gushing oil well in the Gulf of Mexico. 

 BP was not immediately available to comment.
