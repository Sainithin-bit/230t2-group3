 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp CEO Howard Stringer was paid 410 million yen ($4.5 million) for the financial year ended March 2010, the company disclosed at its annual shareholders' meeting on Friday. 

 The figure includes fixed payment and performance-related pay. Under new regulations, Japanese companies are this year being forced to reveal what they pay executives who take home more than 100 million yen annually. Non-Japanese executives such as Stringer and Nissan Motor Co's Carlos Ghosn are thought to make much more than their Japanese counterparts.
