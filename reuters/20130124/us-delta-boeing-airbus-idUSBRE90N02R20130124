 (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) is in talks with Airbus SAS and Boeing Co ( BA.N ) to buy $1 billion or more new jets, Bloomberg reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 
 The Atlanta-based airline is looking at current versions of the Airbus A320 and Boeing 737, not the newest versions, likely meaning a deeper discount to retail prices than normal, the news agency quoted one person as saying. ( link.reuters.com/byw45t ) The talks are for an order of twenty-four to thirty planes and deliveries would start in three to five years, it said. Lindsay McDuff, a spokeswoman for Delta, told Reuters that the company does not comment on industry rumor and speculation. The deal could have a book value of at least $1 billion, based on prices tracked by consultant Avitas of Chantilly, Virginia, Bloomberg said. Delta, the No. 2 airline behind United Continental Holdings ( UAL.N ), is looking for a deal in which it could exchange some of its 50-seat regional jets for new planes from Boeing or Airbus, similar to a deal with Bombardier Inc ( BBDb.TO ) made in December. The sale of old aircraft is a part of a cost-cutting program at the company, which includes retiring smaller, less efficient planes from its fleet.
