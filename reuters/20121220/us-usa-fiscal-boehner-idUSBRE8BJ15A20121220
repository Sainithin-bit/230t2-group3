 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Thursday that he expects to keep working with President Barack Obama to try to avert the year-end "fiscal cliff" after House Republicans pass an alternative plan for a tax hike on millionaires. 
 "The country faces challenges, and the president and I, in our respective roles, have a responsibility to work together to get them a result. And I expect that we'll continue to work together," Boehner told a news conference at the Capitol. (Reporting by  David Lawder  and  Kim Dixon ; Editing by  Vicki Allen )
