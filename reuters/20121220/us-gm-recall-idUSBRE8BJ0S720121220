 (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Thursday it is recalling 145,628 mid-sized pickup trucks globally as the hood could open unexpectedly due to a possible missing latch. 
 Of the Chevrolet Colorado and GMC Canyon pickups affected by the recall, 118,800 are in the United States, 15,264 are in Canada, 7,492 are in Mexico and the rest are exports, GM said. GM is recalling the model year 2010 to 2012 trucks because the hood may be missing a secondary hood latch, so if the primary latch is not engaged the hood could open and block the driver's view and increase the risk of a crash, according to documents filed with the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. There are no reports of crashes or injuries related to the issue, and there are four known cases of the secondary hood latch being missing, GM said. GM said it will notify owners and instruct them to inspect their trucks for the presence of a secondary hood latch or take the truck to a dealer for inspection. If the secondary latch is missing, a new hood will be installed, the company said. Dealers were notified of the issue on December 18 and GM expects to begin mailing letters to owners on January 17, according to NHTSA. (Reporting By  Ben Klayman  in Detroit; Editing by Gerald E.
