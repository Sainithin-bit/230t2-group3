 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Friday there were signs that liquidity was not just abundant, but excessive in the United States. 

 "Today we have abundant liquidity and the cost of money is zero," he said, adding that no amount of policy accommodation or new accommodation would solve the U.S. economy's problems. "Today we have abundant liquidity and the cost of money is zero." "We did our job as a central bank, we may have done too much," he told an event on 'Which way for the U.S. economy', organized by the Bruegel institute in Brussels. "We will no longer press on the monetary pedal." Fisher is regarded by economists as one of the most hawkish policymakers at the U.S. central bank.
