 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - France's finance minister on Thursday renewed pressure on Ireland to give up its coveted low corporate tax rate after euro zone countries came to its rescue last year with an 85 billion euro bailout. 

 European Union leaders are meeting on Thursday and Friday to try to narrow differences on long-term solutions to the euro zone debt crisis. As part of the talks, Dublin has called for better terms on its bailout loans. France and Germany insist Ireland must first boost its corporate tax rate - the lowest in the region -- to bring it in line with the rest of the euro zone. In an interview with Reuters Insider, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said euro zone members "closed ranks" to help Ireland and should not be undercut by its corporate tax rate. "Clearly there shouldn't be tax competition between member states and there shouldn't be a zone for arbitrage, and one that is not an appropriate level playing field," Lagarde said. "It's a discussion that we will continue to have with our Irish friends." TRICKY SUBJECT Still, Lagarde conceded Ireland's tax rates were a "tricky" subject. While EU member states are unified by a shared currency, they jealously guard their sovereignty on tax issues. Ireland has resisted raising its 12.5 percent corporate tax rate. Dublin this week signaled it would consider ratifying EU-wide rules that would pool tax collection across countries in a Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCTB), a change it had previously resisted. Lagarde said the issue was not just Ireland's corporate tax rate but also its tax base. "I hope we will see good common interest in really arriving at a more level situation," Lagarde said. Ireland took a bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund late last year as it scrambled to keep its banks in business. It has since argued the interest rate on the loans is crippling its economy. France and Germany say Ireland must make a gesture on its corporate tax regime before they cut the interest rate on the 40 billion euro EU segment of Ireland's rescue package. Irish authorities need "a bit of time to figure out what is appropriate," Lagarde said. European finance ministers will decide on any changes to Ireland's bailout program after the results next week of stress tests at Irish banks, the president of the European Council said on Thursday. PORTUGAL, JAPAN EU leaders agreed on Thursday to boost the region's temporary bailout fund. However, the meeting was dominated by the political crisis in Portugal that forced the resignation of its prime minister who is adamantly opposed to a bailout that some EU officials say it needs. "If and when they decide that support is needed... then certainly the euro zone members will be up to it and will be able to deliver," Lagarde said of potential aid to Portugal. Lagarde was also asked about the Group of Seven nations move last Friday to sell yen after the Japanese currency spiked to record highs. The G7 made the move on concern the soaring yen could further weaken an economy already reeling from a devastating earthquake and a nuclear crisis. Lagarde, whose government chairs the G7 this year, said the group made the decision after her Japanese counterparts "realized that the variation of the currency had been quite dramatic and that something probably stronger than a collective message would be desirable." In a call last Thursday night, "we came rapidly to the conclusion that yes, collective action was needed." Ultimately the disaster in Japan's will not have a major macroeconomic impact on France, although it may cause some "minor ripple effects," she said.
