 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Friday he does not expect Portugal will seek assistance from the EU rescue fund any time soon. 

 "I don't assume that Portugal will be putting in a request for financial assistance," he told Deutschlandfunk radio in Germany. "The situation in Portugal is very complicated. But nothing suggests that Portugal will put in a request any time soon. "It's not up to us to ask  Portugal to seek support," he added. "That's a matter for Portuguese government."
