 LIMA  (Reuters) - Workers went on strike to demand a share of profits and better working conditions at Peru's La Oroya smelter and metallurgical facility on Saturday, but the U.S.-owned company said it was premature to discuss the impact on output. 

 The facility, some 108 miles east of the capital Lima, processes iron, zinc, copper, silver and gold. "We are on strike," said Anibal Carhuapoma, secretary general of the La Oroya metallurgical workers union. "There are 1,500 of us in the streets of La Oroya at this moment." A company executive confirmed the strike was on but could not comment on the impact on production. (Reporting by Jean Luis Arce, writing by Pav Jordan; editing by  Eric Beech )
