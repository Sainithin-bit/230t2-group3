 RICHMOND  (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Tuesday he would back an interest rate cut if the evidence pointed to slowing U.S. economic growth and diminished inflation, but warned that it was still too early to be sure such a move was warranted. 

 "If evidence arrives that we need a policy move, of course I will consider it and I will take that evidence seriously. ... That evidence would be of the nature of information that alters the outlook for real spending and inflation," he told Reuters in an interview. "I would not like people to believe that our sense of concern about inflation is diminished because of this episode," said Lacker, deemed one of the most hawkish members of the Fed's policy-setting committee. Lacker cemented a reputation as an inflation hawk last year when he dissented four consecutive times from the majority decision to keep interest rates steady out of concern inflation had yet to be brought under control. He is not a voter on the panel this year. Concern that problems in U.S. subprime mortgage market will have a lasting impact on the availability of other credit have roiled global financial markets, and the Fed has said it will do what is needed to keep the payments system working. This has contributed to a strong belief that the U.S. central bank will cut the overnight federal funds rate target by at least a quarter-percentage point to 5 percent at its next scheduled policy meeting on September 18. "The extent to which this (turmoil) has implications for real interest rates will depend on the extent to which it has implications for the path of real spending. If it lowers growth and real spending, that is going to warrant a lower path for real interest rates," Lacker said. "I think it is very unclear whether the effect on the path of real spending is going to be significant or not," he added. Lacker also stressed that although recent inflation numbers had been good, he still wanted inflation expectations to be better-anchored, and he challenged the notion that the recent market woes definitely meant inflation pressures would ease. "I do not think it is automatic that the change in the outlook for real spending we have seen in the last month ought to make us that much more optimistic about inflation." The government said on Friday core inflation, as measured by the Fed's favorite gauge, held steady at a year-on-year reading of 1.9 percent in July, just inside the 1 percent to 2 percent "comfort zone" of many Fed officials. "We have had a couple of good inflation numbers recently. The overall inflation number has come down," Lacker said. Pessimists warn the Fed does not have the luxury of waiting for hard evidence that the economy has been tipped off course by recent financial market gyrations. Lacker acknowledged that policy-makers might have to act without the benefit of all the data. But he said he still would want to be pretty sure of what was underway. "Policy is always about the expected path for spending or the expected path for inflation. ... You don't have to wait for a slowdown to move, but at the same time you would want good reason to believe in it," he said.
