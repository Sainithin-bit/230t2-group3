 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) said on Monday it will open its first store in Russia this week in Moscow and expects to have a second store open in the city by year's end as part of its international expansion plan. 

 The first new store opens on Thursday at the Mega Khimki Mall in Moscow with a second flagship store planned for the historic Stary Arbat Street in the city's center. Russia is one of five countries that Starbucks has said it is focusing on for international expansion. The others are China, India, Egypt and Brazil. Starbucks and a Russian joint venture partner will operate the two Russian stores and any others planned for that country, Cliff Burrows, president of Starbucks Europe, Middle East and Africa, told Reuters. The company has no immediate plans to expand beyond Moscow, he said. Burrows said the Seattle-based coffeehouse chain is capitalizing on "a great tradition around the cafe" that already exists in Moscow. "There is a great cafe culture. We have a great respect for the local competitors and we think we can add to that," Burrows told Reuters. The new store will feature the chain's familiar mix of tables and overstuffed chairs but will offer local foods, including honey cakes and cinnamon buns with custard, he said. As in its other nearly 10,000 stores, the Russian Starbucks will not allow smoking, in line with a company policy aimed at protecting the aroma of the coffees, Burrows said. Starbucks expects Muscovites to frequent the stores during the morning rush hour and to return for evening beverages and chat -- similar to the way Starbucks patrons in large western European cities use the chain. "This is a vibrant city that is awake until the evening," Burrows said. Burrows expects drip coffee and lattes to be top sellers at first at the new stores, and said the chain has no plans yet for any specialized local beverages. "We will look at opportunities around the different seasons of the year to bring to Muscovites the beverages we believe will be most appropriate, or what they have been asking for," he said. The premium coffee chain, whose white-and-green recyclable cups have become a hallmark of the world's upwardly mobile, hopes to appeal to Russian patrons, Burrows said. The CIA estimated Russia's per capita gross domestic product, or personal purchasing power, was $12,200 in 2006. "We have ... built great loyalty in some of the lower income countries where we find people use us less frequently rather than as a daily treat," he said.
