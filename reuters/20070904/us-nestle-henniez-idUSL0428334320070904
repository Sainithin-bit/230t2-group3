 LAUSANNE, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ) accelerated its expansion in the bottled water business on Tuesday by agreeing to buy Swiss bottler Henniez HIZN.S in a deal valued at 155 million Swiss francs ($128.3 million). 

 Through the purchase, Nestle will triple sales in its home Switzerland, control a quarter of the local water market and add a respected brand name to the group's stable of products. Bottled water comprises around 10 percent of the group's total revenue and is one of its key growth pillars as consumer trends favor natural, unsweetened drinks. Nestle, the world's largest food company, said it would first buy a 62 percent stake in Sources Minerales Henniez at 3,000 Swiss francs per share from Switzerland's Rouge family. Nestle will then launch a public tender offer for the remaining listed shares of the family-run Henniez at 5,303 francs per share, the company said in a statement. "We think the deal is reasonable," said Kepler Equities analyst Jon Cox, who rates the company a "buy". "It gives the company more negotiating power. However, it is small change for Nestle." The move lifts Nestle's position in the Swiss bottled water market to 25 percent. Henniez had sales of 152 million francs in 2006, while Nestle's Swiss bottled water operations posted sales of 77 million francs. In August, Nestle said it had ended a major acquisitions spree in its fast-growing nutrition division but had budgeted around 2 billion francs a year for minor purchases. The global food giant has recently executed such important acquisitions as the nutrition division of pharma firm Novartis ( NOVN.VX ) and Gerber baby food, also from Novartis, and Jenny Craig diet foods for around $8.6 billion. Henniez bottled mineral water in 1905 as a medical remedy before mass consumption of bottled drinks took off following the Second World War. Roman explorers discovered the spring, which produces several hundred liters of mineral water that originates in the Alps per minute, around 200 A.D., according to the Henniez Web site. Henniez shares rose 2.5 percent to 5,475 francs in early trading. Nestle was down 1.3 percent at 516.50 francs in an overall weaker market.
