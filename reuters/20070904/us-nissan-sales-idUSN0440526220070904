 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) NSANY.O posted a 6.3 percent increase in August U.S. sales from a year earlier, boosted by gains for its flagship Altima sedan, the automaker's U.S. sales chief said on Tuesday. 

 Nissan sold 85,275 of its Nissan-branded vehicles, up 6 percent from a year earlier, while sales for its luxury Infiniti brand were up 8.7 percent to 10,252 vehicles, Mark McNabb, Nissan's senior vice president for sales told Reuters. The sales of Nissan's car line-up were up 7.6 percent, while light truck sales were up 3.9 percent. McNabb said weaker U.S. credit markets and subprime mortgage problems appeared to be dampening consumer confidence, but added there was no sign tighter credit was shutting consumers out of the market. "When people walk through the door, we're not seeing a denial of credit or anything like that," he said. "I think the impact may be on consumer confidence. "Something's obviously going on in the industry. Someone who says there's not an impact is probably wrong." Nissan's Altima accounted for about a quarter of its sales in the month, including a boost from the new Altima Coupe. The company recorded 3,228 sales of that new model for the month, McNabb said. Nissan had been one of the most cautious of the major automakers in forecasting weaker industry-wide U.S. auto sales for 2007 and McNabb said the company was sticking with its forecast for light-vehicle sales near 16 million units. Other automakers initially forecast sales closer to 16.5 million and down just slightly from 2006. Many have trimmed those estimates after sales slumped in early summer. "I think everyone's coming around to where we are," McNabb said. McNabb said the gain in Nissan-branded trucks and sport utility vehicles in August partly reflected an increase in targeted incentive spending on older models. "Our incentives are probably up a touch, but not substantially," he said. "We definitely got a better bang for buck."
