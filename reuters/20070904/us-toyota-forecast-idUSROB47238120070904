 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Tuesday it is sticking to its forecast for a sales increase of 5 percent to 7 percent in the United States in 2007. 

 The Japanese automaker, which saw sales fall nearly 3 percent in August, said consumers were holding back on big purchases such as autos. Toyota Motor Sales group vice president Bob Carter told reporters on a conference call the turmoil in the credit markets is beginning to impact consumer confidence.
