 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Toymaker Mattel Inc is set to announce a third recall of Chinese-made toys because they may contain too much lead paint, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday. 

 The latest recall involves a Fisher-Price toy and accessories to a Barbie playset and covers several hundred thousand units, the AP reported, citing two anonymous persons it said had been briefed by Mattel executives. Mattel, which in the last five weeks has announced two recalls of millions of Chinese toys due to excessive amounts of lead paint and other dangers, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The report said Mattel would make the announcement on Wednesday. A spate of toy recalls has sparked concern over the quality of products made in China. The U.S. House of Representatives' subcommittee on commerce, trade and consumer protection is to hold a September 19 hearing on how to protect U.S. children from imported products containing lead paint. Lead paint has been linked to health problems in children, including brain damage. Mattel has faced questions recently over whether it acted quickly enough in announcing last month's recalls of more than 19 million toys due to lead paint and hazards from small magnets that can be swallowed and cause injury. The recalled toys included Pixar Sarge die-cast toy cars and Sesame Street and Fisher Price toys. Earlier on Tuesday, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission disagreed with Mattel's chief executive, Robert Eckert, who told the Wall Street Journal that the company preferred initially to investigate reports of dangerous toys without informing the agency. A CPSC spokeswoman was not immediately available to comment on the AP report.
