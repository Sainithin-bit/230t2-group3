 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Title insurer First American Corp. 
( FAF.N ) said on Tuesday that it expected to reduce personnel by 
about 1,300 in the third quarter, citing rapidly changing 
economic conditions. 

  First American said this is in addition to 600 jobs 
eliminated in the second quarter. It expects the personnel 
reductions to generate annualized cost savings of $108 million.  Amid fallout from the U.S. housing downturn, First American 
on August 2 posted a surprise second-quarter loss as it beefed 
up reserves to combat rising defaults, foreclosures and fraud.  The Santa Ana, California-based company said at the time 
that it had added $243.6 million to reserves to cover title 
policy losses and other claims.  On Tuesday, First American said in a statement: "In light 
of rapidly changing economic conditions, the company continues 
to evaluate its personnel needs, including its utilization of 
offshore resources."  (Reporting by  Mark McSherry )
