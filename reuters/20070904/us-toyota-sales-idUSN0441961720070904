 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) on Tuesday said August sales fell 2.8 percent, citing weaker consumer confidence due to a meltdown in the subprime mortgage market. 

 The Japanese automaker said August sales totaled 233,471 vehicles, down from 240,178 units a year earlier. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty )
