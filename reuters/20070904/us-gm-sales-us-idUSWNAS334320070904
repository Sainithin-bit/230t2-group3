 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on Tuesday said U.S. sales rose more than 5 percent in August, boosted by strong demand for its pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 

 GM said it sold 388,168 vehicles in the United States last month, up from 368,776 vehicles a year earlier. The automaker cut its third-quarter North American production forecast by 2 percent from last month's outlook to 1.050 million vehicles and set its fourth-quarter production target at 1 million vehicles, down 10 percent from a year before.
