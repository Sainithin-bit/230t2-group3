 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. retail gasoline prices jumped almost a nickel over the last week to the highest level in a month as tight motor fuel supplies threatened to send pump costs higher, the government said on Tuesday. 

 The national price for regular gasoline rose 4.7 cents to $2.80 a gallon, up almost 7 cents from a year ago, the federal Energy Information Administration said in its weekly survey of service stations. The rise in gasoline prices mirrored a drop in U.S. fuel inventories to the lowest level ever recorded by the government in terms of demand, meeting just 20 days of expected gasoline consumption. Total U.S. gasoline inventories over recent weeks have fallen by more than 12 million barrels to just under 193 million barrels during the previous week, a bigger decline than normally seen at this time of year, according to the EIA. A preliminary Reuters poll of energy analysts expects government data to be released on Thursday to show that gasoline stocks fell another 1.5 million barrels last week. The EIA, which is the Energy Department's forecasting arm, warns that low fuel inventories will limit the usual decline in pump costs seen after the Labor Day holiday weekend, when gasoline demand drops off. In the EIA's new weekly price survey, retail gasoline was again the most expensive in the Midwest, up 13.3 cents to $2.97 a gallon. Among major cities, Chicago had the highest gasoline costs at $3.20, up 17.1 cents. Cleveland came in second at $2.98 a gallon, up 17.4 cents The Gulf Coast states had the lowest price by region at $2.66 a gallon, up half a penny. Houston again had the cheapest pump price at $2.54 a gallon, down 2.3 cents. The EIA also reported gasoline prices were down 1.7 cents to $2.88 in San Francisco, up 4.9 cents to $2.84 in Denver, up 0.3 cent to $2.82 in Miami, up 4.7 cents to $2.79 in Seattle, down 1.1 cents to $2.71 in New York City and down 0.5 cent to $2.64 in Boston. Separately, the average price truckers paid for diesel fuel jumped 3 cents to $2.89 a gallon, but was still down 7.4 cents from a year ago. The West Coast had the most expensive diesel at $2.97, up a slight 0.7 cent. The lower Atlantic states again had the most affordable diesel at $2.84, up 3.5 cents.
