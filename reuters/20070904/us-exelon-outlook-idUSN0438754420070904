 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power company Exelon Corp ( EXC.N ) said on Tuesday it would buy back up to $1.25 billion of stock and raised the lower end of its 2007 profit forecast. 

 It revised its 2007 earnings forecast, excluding special items, to a range of $4.15 to $4.30 per share from a previous estimate of $4.00 to $4.30. Analysts on average expect the company to earn $4.29 per share in 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. In 2007, Exelon expects its wholesale generation unit to post $3.45 to $3.55 per share, its Illinois utility to earn 20 to 25 cents per share and its Pennsylvania utility to add 65 to 70 cents per share to earnings. The revised outlook excludes costs associated with the Illinois electric rate settlement, said Chicago-based Exelon. It maintained its net income forecast of $3.70 to $4.00 per share for 2007. The company said it expects to complete the share repurchase program within the next six months. (Reporting by  Lisa Lee )
