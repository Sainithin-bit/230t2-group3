 SEOUL  (Reuters) - HSBC's agreement to buy a majority stake in Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS is putting the South Korean banking sector under even more pressure to consolidate, amid growing prospects of privatization and sales. 

 HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) said on Monday it agreed to buy 51 percent of the country's sixth-largest bank by assets from U.S. private equity firm Lone Star LS.UL for $6.3 billion. The deal, if finalized, will bring another strong foreign player into South Korea's crowded banking industry, which has combined deposits of more than $750 billion. Citigroup ( C.N ) and Standard Chartered Plc ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ) became key players by buying local rivals in 2004 and 2005, respectively. "Intensifying competition in the sector will drive many leftover banks to another round of integration," Merrill Lynch analyst Bryan Song said in a research note. HSBC's acquisition, which is conditional on the resolution of several legal and regulatory hurdles, comes as South Korean banks are seeking to expand into lucrative non-banking financial services including wealth management, brokerage and insurance. Asia's third-largest banking market has a booming $250 billion fund industry, Asia's third-biggest, that has already spurred a wave of acquisitions of asset managers as money flows into investment products from low-yielding bank deposits. HSBC's stronger local presence and global expertise will likely be a threat to South Korea's top four banks -- Kookmin Bank 060000.KS, Shinhan Financial Group ( 055550.KS ), Woori Financial Group ( 053000.KS ) and Hana Financial Group ( 086790.KS ), which account for about half of the country's banking assets. Kookmin lost a bid last year to buy KEB from Lone Star for $7.3 billion after the private equity firm scrapped the deal, citing regulatory issues. Analysts expect Kookmin shares to remain soft for the time being, whereas Goldman Sachs upgraded their rating on KEB to buy on Tuesday. "HSBC will definitely tighten the competitive landscape. That won't be a good thing for banks' profitability," said Prudential Investment & Securities' analyst Sung Byung-soo. "In particular, Kookmin and Hana, which wanted to buy KEB, can lose growth momentum from HSBC-KEB." The race for a bigger share of the country's $380 billion market for high net worth individuals could also drive consolidation. Woori Financial Group said recently it was in talks with Merrill Lynch MER.N for a tie-up. Woori, which runs the country's third-largest bank, is on the lookout for a private owner as the government is trying to reduce its 73 percent stake in the group. The Industrial Bank of Korea ( 024110.KS ), majority owned by the finance ministry, is also bracing for privatization in the medium term, while provincial players such as Jeonbuk Bank 006350.KS and The Bank of Cheju ( 006220.KS ) are expected to draw bidders who want a banking license. South Korean banks went through a round of consolidation between 2000 and 2005 after the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s sent some of them close to bankruptcy. The number of South Korean commercial banks was almost halved to about 15, making Kookmin the top player with a quarter of deposits and loans among local banks. But some analysts were cautious about drawing immediate conclusions about the wider impact of HSBC's KEB purchase, noting that it faces a lengthy process of winning government and regulatory approval, and integration itself. Recent state-run asset sales have gone to local companies after a public backlash against foreign firms that racked up big gains by buying distressed domestic firms. HSBC will have to wait for a Supreme Court ruling before seeking final approval from regulators and the government, and analysts say a court verdict could take two or three years. The court is being asked to rule on whether Lone Star acted illegally in its $1.2 billion purchase of KEB in 2003. Bigger banks are not necessarily synonymous with success in new markets, other analysts added. "When Standard Chartered and Citigroup acquired local banks, they had been seen as a big threat to local competitors," said NH Investment & Securities' analyst David Kim. "But their acquisitions have since weakened, and it looks difficult for KEB to grow enough to transform the domestic banking landscape."
