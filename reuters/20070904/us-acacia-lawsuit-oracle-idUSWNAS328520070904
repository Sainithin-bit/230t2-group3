 (Reuters) - Acacia Research Corp ( ACTG.O ) said its Disc Link Corp unit agreed with Oracle Corp ORCL.O to resolve a pending lawsuit on patents relating to portable storage devices with links that can retrieve added data through the Internet. 

 The technology licensing company, which has been settling patent disputes with several companies over the past six months, said its unit entered into a license agreement with Oracle covering the same patents but specific terms were not disclosed. In July, Acacia's unit Financial Systems Innovation LLC settled a potential patent dispute with German software maker SAP AG ( SAPG.DE ) and its related companies. Earlier in the year, Acacia entered into separate agreements with Sage Software North America and McAfee Inc. MFE.N over patents relating to portable storage devices with links. The portable storage devices with links technology generally relates to products sold or distributed on CDs or DVDs that include a link to get additional data via the Internet.
