 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) chief sales analyst on Tuesday said the automaker had 519,000 vehicles in its inventory at the end of August, down 140,000 units from a year earlier. 

 On a call with analysts and reporters after the automaker reported a 14-percent drop in August sales, Ford's George Pipas said that inventory included 151,000 cars and 368,000 trucks. Pipas also said the automaker is on track to cut sales to daily rental companies by 135,000 units this year. Ford has reduced those sales by 113,000 vehicles this year, and will achieve the rest of the cuts over the next two months, Pipas said. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty )
