 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission is investigating the timeliness of toy company Mattel Inc's disclosures before its most recent recall, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Tuesday. 

 Internal commission documents also raise questions about whether Mattel has passed information to regulators about possible recurring electrical problems with a recalled toy the company has declared fixed, the report said. Last month, Mattel recalled millions of Chinese-made toys due to hazards from small magnets and lead paint. Mattel openly acknowledges its definition of a timely response differs sharply from the government's, the report said. According to the report, the commission says that manufacturers must report all claims of potentially hazardous product defects within 24 hours, with few exceptions. Mattel spokespeople could not immediately be reached for comment.
