 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Tuesday it is offering rebates of up to $1,000 on most 2007 and 2008 model year vehicles in the United States this month as it tries to boost sales in a slowing U.S. auto market. 

 Ford's U.S. sales slipped 14 percent in August and are down 12.5 percent so far this year. The consumer incentives are part of the automaker's "Swap Your Ride" marketing campaign, where Ford is chronicling the difference between its vehicles and those sold by its competitors, the automaker said. Ford is also offering interest-free financing on its F-150 pickup truck in addition to a cash rebate. The rebate offer runs through October 1, the company said in a statement. The combined incentives spending for U.S. manufacturers averaged $3,293 per vehicle sold in August, down from $3,393 in July, according to industry-tracking firm Edmunds.com. Ford's incentives in August averaged $3,145 per vehicle, trailing Chrysler, which had the highest incentives of $3,758 per vehicle in August. Sales of U.S. automakers have been hurt by a weak housing market, high gasoline prices and tough competition. Weak housing starts have also sapped demand for high-margin pickup trucks, which are typically bought by construction workers. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
