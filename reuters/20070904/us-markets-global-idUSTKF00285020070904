 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with Nasdaq and the S&P 500 gaining more than 1 percent on the outlook for technology spending and as higher oil prices drove up energy shares. 

 The U.S. dollar tracked equities higher, but longer-dated Treasury bonds traded down slightly after a report showed manufacturing activity expanded in August, easing recession worries, and drawing money into stocks. Technology stocks stole the spotlight after Piper Jaffray said Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) could beat its iPhone sales goal in the September quarter and research group iSuppli said the iPhone outsold all smart phones in the United States in July. Helping to bolster equities was a report by the Institute for Supply Management that showed that factory activity expanded in August, though at a slower pace than in July. "If there was going to be slow growth, one of the first businesses to cut back would be technology," said Steve Goldman, market strategist at Weeden & Co. in Greenwich, Connecticut. According to the latest available figures, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 92.34 points, or 0.69 percent, at 13,450.08. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 15.36 points, or 1.04 percent, at 1,489.35. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 33.88 points, or 1.30 percent, at 2,630.24. Apple shares jumped 4.1 percent to $144.16, and Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ) rose 5.5 percent to $23.97 after Bear Stearns named the Internet media company as a top pick. A rise in energy shares also lent support as crude oil CLc1 prices jumped $1.06 to $75.10 on continued concerns about the hurricane season. Shares of Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) rose 1.8 percent at $87.23. European equities recovered their earlier losses to finish higher, helped by U.S. equities and comments by Deutsche Bank's chief executive that the outlook for banks had begun to brighten after weeks of credit market turmoil. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  of top European shares rose 0.66 percent higher at 1,549.41 points -- its highest close since August 8 --having been down as much as 0.7 percent earlier The move in stocks turned support away from the yen and the dollar pushed higher. "Equities are still driving currencies, and for now the market isn't pricing in a radical contraction in U.S. growth," said Boris Schlossberg, senior currency strategist at DailyFX.com in New York. "Don't get me wrong, there are clearly jitters out there, but right now, people see only a slight growth slowdown." The dollar was up 0.4 percent at 116.32 yen  JPY= , well off a session low of 115.35 yen. The euro was slightly lower  EUR= , dipping 0.07 percent to $1.3620. While U.S. government debt first showed little reaction to U.S. factory sector data because the market still expects the Federal Reserve to cut rates this month, long-end Treasuries slipped as stocks edged higher. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR was down 7/32, with the yield at 4.5545 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note US2YT=RR was up 1/32, with the yield at 4.1363 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond US30YT=RR was down 5/32, with the yield at 4.8361 percent. (Additional reporting by  Caroline Valetkevitch , Viviana Rodrigues,  Ellen Freilich )
