 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup is nearing a deal with the U.S. government that would allow it to pay back some of its bailout money, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The newspaper said the proposed deal would allow the bank to raise more than $10 billion in new capital by issuing common stock, which would help Citigroup pay back some of its bailout money. The bank's executives hope to announce a deal as early as Monday morning, the report said, noting that the agreement is not finalized and may not be done by then. The new capital would also let Citigroup exit a program in which the government is shielding it from losses, the report said. Citigroup is eager to repay the government so it can avoid the executive pay restrictions that come along with the three rounds of U.S. assistance it received. Citigroup borrowed $45 billion last year under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. This year, the government agreed to convert $25 billion of those funds into Citigroup common stock, leaving the United States with a roughly 34 percent stake in the bank. The Wall Street Journal also said that Citigroup executives hope the U.S. Treasury will announce that it will sell at least some of the stake held by the government. Citigroup was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Michael Erman , editing by Martin Golan)
