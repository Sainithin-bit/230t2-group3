 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Michael Widenius, creator of MySQL database, which could become the stumbling block for Oracle in its Sun takeover, has launched an Internet campaign trying to line up MySQL users to stop the deal. 

 The European Commission (EC) has objected to Oracle's $7 billion bid for Sun, saying the purchase may limit competition in the database market. Widenius said he launched the campaign -- asking users to e-mail their view of the deal to the commission -- in response to Oracle mobilizing its big customers to tell the commission at last week's hearings that the takeover was not anti-competitive. Antitrust lawyers have said enlisting major companies to express support at a hearing could sway doubtful regulators. MySQL has been a rare major newcomer to the global database market -- dominated by technology heavyweights Oracle, IBM and Microsoft -- pushing down prices of databases and their maintenance. Widenius, one of the most respected developers of open-source software, left Sun earlier this year to set up his own small database firm Monty Program Ab earlier this year. The Sun acquisition would give Oracle MySQL as Sun bought MySQL for $1 billion in 2008. "With your support, there is a good chance that the EC could prevent this from happening or demand Oracle to change the terms for MySQL or give other guarantees to the users. Without your support, it might not," Widenius wrote in his blog.

Oracle has to submit final proposals to address the Commission's concerns by the end of Monday, in order to allow the regulator enough time to reach a conclusion about the deal by the January 27 deadline.
