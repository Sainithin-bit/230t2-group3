 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Trade officials will announce a major trade enforcement action against China on Tuesday, according to a Trade Representative's office advisory obtained from a business group. 

 The advisory, which was distributed to media on a not-for-publication basis, said Trade Representative Ron Kirk "will hold a press conference to announce a major trade enforcement action against China." The release did not provide any additional details. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by  Peter Cooney )
