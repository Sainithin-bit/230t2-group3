 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Documents turned over to the Connecticut attorney general show that American International Group Inc paid out over $218 million in bonuses, more than the previously disclosed $165 million, published reports said on Saturday. 

 The reports said the documents were turned over to Attorney General Richard Blumenthal's office late on Friday in response to a subpoena. The documents show that bonuses of at least $1 million were paid to 73 people, and five received more than $4 million. The giant insurance company has been widely criticized for granting bonuses after receiving federal bailout funds exceeding $180 billion. (Reporting by  Jim Marshall , editing by Alan Elsner)
