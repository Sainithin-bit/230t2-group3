 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The United States released long-awaited details on Monday of plans for a public-private effort to rid U.S. banks of toxic assets at the heart of the worst global financial crisis in generations. 

 The plan, which would allow banks to lend more freely again, is key to reviving the recession-hit economy at a time when unemployment and jobless claims have risen to multi-year highs. But a solution to the complex problem has been elusive and critics fear a flawed plan could trigger further losses for banks or put more taxpayers' money at risk. Asian stocks and U.S. stock futures rose as more news on the bad debt plan emerged on Monday, while U.S. Treasuries slipped. ************************************************************** KEY POINTS: * U.S. Treasury to invest $75 billion to $100 billion from its existing $700 billion bailout fund to partner with private investors and buy troubled assets from banks, according to an Obama administration official * Treasury also aims to buy $500 billion to up to $1 trillion in "legacy" assets from banks; U.S. government to offer generous financing terms for private investors ANALYSTS' COMMENTS HONG SUN-YOUNG, SAMSUNG ECONOMIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE, SEOUL "This is a positive development especially in a sense that this plan is aimed at helping the financial markets restore their function as well as cleansing the toxic assets. "There remain questions about how much the financial markets can play their role and about the moral hazard issues regarding the pricing of toxic assets, but at this time, the most important thing is that (the U.S. authorities) do something actively." MAMORU YAMAZAKI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RBS SECURITIES, TOKYO "If the U.S. authorities actually succeed in buying up to $1 trillion of 'toxic assets', it would be considered a significant step by the financial markets. However, the markets will be disappointed if the programs did not move forward due to problems regarding how the assets' value is measured. "The markets will also be watching to see what sort of time-span the authorities plan to buy the assets. The markets will not react positively if it turns out that it takes much more time than they expected." ANANTHA NAGESWARAN, CIO, JULIUS BAER, HONG KONG "This approach - recapitalizing banks - does not think the solutions through to their logical conclusions. "The key to the success of all these initiatives is the ability and willingness of corporations and U.S. households to borrow. Households, especially, are still over-leveraged. The solution to that is to save more out of current income and use the savings to repay debt. But, lower interest rates incentives borrowings and not savings. If they do not choose to fall for the bait of lower interest rates, what would the Federal Reserve and US Treasury do next?" WINSON FONG, MANAGING DTR, SG ASSET MANAGEMENT, HONG KONG "Doing this is probably better than not doing anything at all but it is very difficult for the U.S. Treasury to come up with a concrete plan to deal with the situation. It's an ever changing, never ending story with some major political hiccups thrown in. So what works for today may change by next week, and if you look down the road long enough there are many other problems lurking." CHENG CHENG-MOUNT, ECONOMIST, CITIGROUP, TAIPEI "This will boost financial markets but markets will still have some doubts about the effectiveness of the program. "I guess the program is obviously trying to ease concern in financial markets and this is the right direction to go and Asian currencies will rise for a day or two on hopes for a return of investor confidence. An improvement in U.S. financial conditions would help U.S. investor and consumer confidence, but we need more details of the plan and its impact on U.S. fundamentals." JUN KATO, DEPUTY GM TREASURY BUSINESS GROUP, SHINKIN CENTRAL BANK, TOKYO "The scheme is necessary for the market and the size of the reported toxic assets to be bought seems large. Some market players may see this as an opportunity to sell stocks on the facts, but the market looks set to gain some stability for a while, especially after a relay of global efforts to combat the economic and financial crisis after the G20 meeting. "The currency implication from that is a weaker dollar and further rises in yen crosses. The euro could rise as high as $1.40, given a recent premise that the dollar had been bought at the height of risk aversion." ANDREW ORCHARD, EQUITIES ANALYST, ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND "This is more positive for sentiment rather than a fundamental change. Most investors are still going to take a wait-and-see attitude, but clearly on the back of further clarification this is something that will be positive for the market. "The one thing in the immediate term that could hurt stocks is of course company results. If they disappoint or if guidance is weak, then we will definitely see the end of this rally." AKIRA TAKEI, GENERAL MGR, INTERNATIONAL FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT, MIZUHO ASSET MANAGEMENT "The government has to do this, but so far, every step the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have taken has been artificial. They are pumping a lot of money into the system, but that is not improving confidence among private bankers. It is difficult to see banks increasing lending now. They may also be reluctant to participate in the Treasury's latest scheme, because of fear of government influence and backlash over bonus payments." ANNETTE BEACHER, SENIOR STRATEGIST, TD SECURITIES, SYDNEY "Given the extent of the crisis in the U.S. banking sector, this is an essential step to restoring confidence, if carried out correctly. Banks need to free up capital to restore the credit cycle, and this is a key step." SEAN CALLOW, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WESTPAC, SYDNEY "The rally in S&P 500 futures and Asian equities suggests considerable optimism, though this surprises me a little because it looks to be about what was expected and faces the huge hurdle of coaxing private investors. "Investors will be very wary of committing capital at the same time as Congress is vilifying Wall Street on bonuses etc and adding one restriction after another on any corporation that accepts any government loans. "If markets have bought the rumor then the risk is they sell the fact of the Geithner plan, which would mean equity sell off and higher USD/Asia." LINUS YIP, STRATEGIST, FIRST SHANGHAI SECURITIES, HONG KONG "This is good. But the real challenge would be in pricing these toxic assets. If the government and banks can reach an agreement on that, then there is a pretty good chance the credit market will return to normal. But of course, there will be other things worry about like the enormous debt U.S. has racked up." DAVID MANN, SR FX STRATEGIST, STANDARD CHARTERED, HONG KONG "It's really a difficult tightrope to walk in terms of what the plan is going to be able to achieve. They're talking about the Treasury investing up to $100 billion, that is not significant. But the plan for legacy assets could be taken as a relative positive for the market. At least there is more detail about what the plan is going to be. It will take a while for the market to really digest how acceptable it is and how much the banks have gained or lost out on this plan. Even from what we're seeing here, it's not clear whether the taxpayers or banks have lost out. "This can help risk appetite along with the potential out there for a delay to mark-to-market accounting, as is the surprisingly aggressive Fed moves from last week. Overall, just having more details to go through is an encouraging sign." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock futures rose more than 1 percent as details of the toxic asset plan slowly emerged; for prices click for S&P 500 futures, for Dow futures. Asia stocks also rose on hopes the plan would stabilize the U.S. financial system BONDS: U.S. Treasuries slipped in Asia as stocks rose on the bad debt plan, reducing safe-haven bids for government debt. The benchmark 10-year note was down 13/32 in price to yield 2.683 percent, up 5 basis points from Friday.
