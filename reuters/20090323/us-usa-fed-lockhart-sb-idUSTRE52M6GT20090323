 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Massive Federal Reserve buying of U.S. Treasuries is warranted by a worsening economic outlook, and aggressive action to tackle the crisis will yield results, a top Fed official said on Monday. 

 Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said purchases of longer-dated Treasuries had been discussed by the Fed in January, but seemed premature, owing to the economic forecast and because official stimulus measures were pending. "At this FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting, at least relative to my own forecast ... that forecast had deteriorated from January to some extent, and much of the total economic package had been clarified," Lockhart told Reuters in an interview, referring to a Fed policy meeting last week. "So I think it was appropriate and proportionate to support the proposal of a $300 billion program for Treasuries," he said. The surprise news of the purchases led to a hefty rally in U.S. government debt prices and Lockhart said the results so far had been "encouraging".
