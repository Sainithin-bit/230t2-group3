 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The private sector is showing interest in a new plan to deal with toxic assets in which private firms would partner with the U.S. government, Austan Goolsbee, a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on Monday. 

 "I think you have seen a considerable amount of interest on the part of the private sector," he said in an interview with Reuters Financial Television. (Reporting by  Tabassum Zakaria ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
