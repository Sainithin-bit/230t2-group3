 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian government indicated on Monday it was less concerned with the overall holding that Suncor Energy Inc would have following its takeover of Petro-Canada than with the stakes that individuals own. 

 Under the proposed C$18.43 billion ($15.11 billion) deal, Suncor shareholders would control 60 percent of the new company, but Ottawa did not appear to view that as running afoul of a law that says that no one can own more than 20 percent of Petro-Canada. Petro-Canada was founded in 1975 as a government-owned corporation. Ottawa began selling shares to the public in 1991 and completed the privatization in 2004. However the ownership provisions remain on the books. "The act places a 20 per cent limit on the proportion of Petro-Canada shares that any individual investor (or a group of related investors) may own, whether they are Canadian or not," said Stephanie Rubec, a spokeswoman at the Finance Department. "The policy rationale for this 20 per cent restriction is to ensure that Petro-Canada is widely held." Petro-Canada said, and the government took it at face value for now at least, that this 20 percent limit would continue to apply to the merged company. "The Petro-Canada Act will still be in place for the combined entity," Petro-Canada Chief Executive Ron Brenneman said on a conference call after announcing the deal. Darren Cunningham, a spokesman for Industry Minister Tony Clement, said: "Suncor and Petro-Canada have indicated the proposed merged company will continue to be governed by the provisions of the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act; within our due diligence we will verify that." The Competition Bureau will also examine the transaction as a matter of course, from the point of view not of shareholding but of market concentration. "We're aware of the transaction. We will be reviewing it," said Ian Jack, a spokesman for the bureau. He said that under recent legislative changes, a merger is deemed approved if after 30 days the bureau does not raise any issue with the companies concerned. The Competition Bureau looks at each segment of each market, geographically and by function -- for example, the producing and refining operations of oil companies -- to determine if it has any concerns about mergers and takeovers. Typically, it has said any concentration under 35 percent does not pose an issue. Rather than blocking a merger per se, where concentration is above that level in a particular market, it has tended to require steps to dilute the concentration.
