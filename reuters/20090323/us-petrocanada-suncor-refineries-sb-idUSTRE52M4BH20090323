 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc's chief executive said on Monday the company has no plans to sell off any refineries once it completes its C$18.4 billion ($14.9 billion) acquisition of Petro-Canada. 

 Rick George told reporters he was happy to have the 430,000 barrels per day of refining capacity the new firm will control when the merger is wrapped up. The deal will combine Suncor's refineries in Sarnia, Ontario, and Denver, Colorado, with Petro-Canada facilities in Edmonton, Alberta, and Montreal.
