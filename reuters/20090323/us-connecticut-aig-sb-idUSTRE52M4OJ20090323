 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The state of Connecticut is analyzing the details of bonuses paid by American International Group to see whether they violated state law and what possible remedies might be pursued, the Commissioner of Consumer Protection said on Monday. 

 The list of remedies includes issuing a cease and desist order or restitution to the federal government, Commissioner Jerry Farrell, explained by telephone. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said there were $218 million of bonuses, a higher figure than the $165 million the Connecticut governor said the company reported. This discrepancy now will be probed, Farrell said.
