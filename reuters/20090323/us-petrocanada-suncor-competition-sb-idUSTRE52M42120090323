 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian government's arm's-length Competition Bureau will review the proposed C$18.43 billion ($14.86 billion) purchase of Petro-Canada by Suncor Energy Inc as a matter of course. 

 "We're aware of the transaction. We will be reviewing it," Ian Jack, spokesman for the bureau, said on Monday. He said that under recent legislative changes, a merger is deemed approved if after 30 days the bureau does not raise any issue with the companies concerned. The Competition Bureau looks at each segment of each market, geographically and by function -- for example the downstream and upstream operations of oil companies -- to determine if it has any concerns about mergers and takeovers. Typically, it has said any concentration under 35 percent does not pose an issue. Rather than blocking a merger per se, where concentration is above that level in a particular market, it has tended to require steps to dilute the concentration. Separately, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty will have to review the transaction to see if the deal runs afoul of the Petro-Canada Public Participation Act, which stipulates that any one shareholder can own no more than 20 percent of Petro-Canada.
