 (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Monday it will buy rival Petro-Canada for shares worth C$18.4 billion ($14.9 billion) to create the dominant player in Canada's oil sands. 

 Following is a look at the assets and operations of the two companies. SUNCOR: 2008 profit: C$2.14 billion, or C$2.29 a share, down 28 percent from 2007. 2008 oil and gas production: 264,700 barrels of oil equivalent (boed) a day. 2008 yearend total reserves: 15.1 billion barrels HISTORY: Once an arm of Sun Oil Co, the company opened the first oil sands project in 1967. It started trading separately from its U.S. parent in 1992 and became completely independent in 1995, when Sun sold its remaining stake. MAJOR OPERATIONS: Produced 300,000 barrels a day at its Fort McMurray oil sands operations and upgrading facilities in February, matching its 2009 monthly target. It also produces 202 million cubic feet of natural gas per day in Western Canada to feed its oil sands operations. Suncor owns an 85,000 barrel a day refinery at Sarnia, Ontario, and sells gasoline in the province under the Sunoco banner at 300 retail stations. The company also owns a 93,000 bpd refinery in Denver, Colorado, and markets gasoline at 44 "Phillips 66" stations it owns in the Denver region and supplies 165 other Phillips 66 outlets in the state. PETRO-CANADA: 2008 profit: C$3.13 billion, or C$6.47 a share, up 15 percent from 2007. 2008 production: 418,400 boed 2008 yearend total reserves: 11.27 billion barrels. HISTORY: Founded by the Canadian government in 1975 as a state-owned oil company. The firm was given preferential access to new exploration lands and was augmented with the purchase of the Canadian operations of Atlantic Richfield, Pacific Petroleums and others. It expanded overseas in 2002 when it acquired the exploration and production assets of Veba Oil & Gas for C$3.2 billion, nearly doubling output. The government first began selling shares to the public in 1991 and completed the privatization in 2004, when it sold its remaining 19 percent stake. MAJOR OPERATIONS: Owns two Canadian refineries, in Edmonton, Alberta, and Montreal with a combined capacity of 255,000 barrels a day. Sells gasoline through a chain of 1,323 retail sites under the Petro-Canada banner. Owns a 12 percent interest in the Syncrude Canada joint venture and operates the 25,000 bpd MacKay River oil sands project. Petro-Canada also owns a 60 percent stake in the proposed C$21 billion Fort Hills oil sands project with partners UTS Energy Corp and Teck Cominco Ltd, each of which hold 20 percent. The company produces conventional oil and gas from properties in Western Canada and in the Atlantic Ocean, off Canada's East Coast. It also operates in the North Sea, Libya, Syria and elsewhere.
