 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Legislation meant to give the U.S. government a better way to handle problems at failing firms that are not banks, like AIG, is being developed by a key House of Representatives committee, aides said on Monday. 

 In a sign Congress is moving fast on the Obama administration's top priority for financial regulation reform, a bill to create a government process for unwinding failing nonbank firms is among measures likely to come before the House Financial Services Committee for a possible vote on March 31, aides said.
