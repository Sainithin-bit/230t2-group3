 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury's asset purchase plan will benefit troubled midcap banks by restarting asset sales, a team of analysts at Morgan Stanley said. 

 The inability to sell troubled loans is one of the group's biggest problems, they wrote in a note to clients. "We believe several banks would be willing to sell certain distressed loans, even below what they consider their true underlying value, if only to remove a major source of market uncertainty," the team said. Banks that have high capital positions, the most toxic loan portfolios and have already taken sizable write-downs on those loans will benefit the most from this process, the analysts said. East West Bancorp, First Horizon National Corp, Marshall & Ilsley Corp, South Financial Group Inc and Synovus Financial Corp will be the biggest beneficiaries from the plan, they said.
