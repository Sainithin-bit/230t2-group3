 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Monday that he shares the public's outrage over bonuses paid by companies getting government bailouts and promised to work with Congress on the issue. 

 But in an interview on CNBC television, he avoided saying whether new public-private investment funds will subject all participants to executive compensation restrictions. A new plan for public-private partnerships unveiled on Monday said "passive private investors" would not face such restrictions. Geithner said government rescue money should not be used for "rewarding failure," but credit must be restored. "We're going to work through this," he added.
