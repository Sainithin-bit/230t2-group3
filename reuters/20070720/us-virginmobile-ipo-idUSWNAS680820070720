 (Reuters) - Virgin Mobile USA Inc. filed with U.S. regulators on Friday to raise up to $506 million in an initial public offering of Class A common stock, up from its earlier filing to raise up to $100 million. 

 The Warren, New Jersey-based company told the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in a preliminary prospectus that Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch & CO. and Bear Stearns & Co. Inc. were underwriting the IPO. The provider of wireless communications services said it applied for a New York Stock Exchange listing under the symbol "VM." The filing did not reveal how many shares the company planned to sell or the expected price.
