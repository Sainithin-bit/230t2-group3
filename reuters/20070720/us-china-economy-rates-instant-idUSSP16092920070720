 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China raised interest rates on Friday for third time this year in a largely expected move after data showed the economy grew in the second quarter at its fastest annual pace in more than 11 years. 

 It was the latest in a series of tightening moves that have included eight increases since June 2006 in the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserve rather than lend out. KEY POINTS -- The People's Bank of China raised the one-year deposit rate by 0.27 percentage point to 3.33 percent, and the one-year lending rate by 0.27 percentage point to 6.84 percent. -- Central bank said increases to keep credit, investment in check, stabilize inflationary expectations. -- Central bank ups rate on sight deposit to 0.81 percent from 0.72 percent.  COMMENTARY -- WEIMIN CHANG, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FRANKLIN TEMPLETON SEALAND FUND MANAGEMENT CO. LTD: "I think the general consensus is the (domestic) stock market will react positively to the news. The rate hike is moderate and I think people won't move their money back to bank accounts just because of the lower deposit tax. Remember real interest rates are still around zero." -- ZHANG YONGJUN, ECONOMIST AT THE STATE INFORMATION CENTER, BEIJING: "I think the rate rises could curb the rapid investment growth and credit expansion to a certain degree. "But it's far from enough. The current interest rates are still low and real deposit rates are in negative territory. "I think China should scrap the 20 percent withholding tax on interest-rate income and raise benchmark interest rates more in the future until the one-year real deposit rate is around 2 percent." -- IAN STANNARD, SENIOR FX STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, LONDON: "All the data we have had from China suggested this move and further monetary tightening measures, via regulatory changes, changes in reserve requirements, and interest rate rises. The growth and inflation data justify these measures. We expect gradual appreciation of the yuan, and there has been increased speculation of a revaluation on the anniversary of the revaluation (July 21, 2005). Gradual appreciation will also continue in other Asian currencies, but the yen is probably going to struggle as global risk appetite is still high." -- LIN SONGLI, AN ANALYST AT GUOSEN SECURITIES, BEIJING: "The move is broadly expected. "However, it will not completely ease inflationary pressure in the second half, because current fast CPI growth is mainly due to the short supply of pork and other foodstuffs. It takes time for newly raised pigs to go to the market. "And I'm also concerned that the price rises in food may spread to other sectors and push up PPI. "CPI may exceed 4.4 percent and hit a new record in certain months in the second half. In that case, the central bank will raise interest rates again. I expect CPI growth for the whole year will be 3.8 percent. "The economy is not overheated, because investment and exports actually slowed down from last year. It was consumption that drove up the GDP growth, which is what the government hopes to see. "However, is the growth in consumption sustainable? We'll have to wait and see. "Also, there are still problems in the economy, including fast expansion in energy-intensive industries and comparatively weak consumption growth." -- ANTHONY MUH, HEAD OF ASIA FOR ALLIANCE TRUST, WHICH MANAGES ABOUT $1 BILLION IN ASIAN EQUITIES: "We're not surprised and it's still nowhere near enough." "Anytime when you get a rate hike, I think it will lead to a temporary curtailment of interest in the market, but suspect it's going to be very temporary. With 27 basis points, you're still talking about nominal overall rates well below where they ought to be." -- THOMAS HARR, CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT STANDARD CHARTERED BANK, SINGAPORE: "It's very much expected after the extremely strong growth data and very strong inflation data yesterday. "But I don't think the rate rise will be that effective, the problem is that they are struggling to slow down the fixed-asset investment. But that's easier said than done. Probably they will go for one more hike at some point. "We now expect GDP to grow 11.5 percent in 2007 despite the rate rise and inflation will be 3.5 percent. "The market had expected this move, that's the reason why the market is pricing more and more expectations of yuan appreciation. "I think until now policy makers in Beijing have seen currency appreciation as the last tool in the box to try to slow down the economy, but with this tremendous growth and huge trade surplus, maybe it's the last tool they want to use. "But it's very unlikely to see much faster appreciation. -- GAO SHANWEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT ESSENCE SECURITIES, BEIJING: "It's not a surprise. Since economic data released yesterday turned out to be that much higher, the market has been highly expecting tightening moves, especially an interest rate rise today." "The interest rate rise is not enough to bring the current real interest rate into positive territory. So I think it is necessary and quite likely for the government to abolish the 20 percent withholding tax on interest income soon. "But we all know that the fundamental source of the economic woes is the yuan's exchange rate. I expect the pace of yuan appreciation to accelerate and a 10 percent annual rise is both needed and possible." -- PAUL CAVEY, ECONOMIST, MACQUARIE SECURITIES, HONG KONG: "That's a very timid response to the high GDP and inflation numbers. On the other hand it says they are not panicked by the CPI figures, which sort of makes sense because it was mainly due to food prices and may be temporary. "But the way property stocks went up steeply today suggests investors are looking at the issue quite differently. I expected Beijing to raise rates by more. I think the market will completely shrug this off and for the economy it doesn't amount to much at all." -- BILL BELCHERE, ECONOMIST, MACQUARIE RESEARCH, HONG KONG: "They haven't done enough. This is just part of an extended process as they deal with the side-effects of an undervalued currency. "There will be more interest rate hikes and perhaps even another hike in reserve requirements. But they are still not ready to let go of the currency." -- JAMES MALCOLM, CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT DEUTSCHE BANK IN SINGAPORE: "For China, I don't think it makes any difference to how the markets view the currency. It won't have much of an impact on anything. "There could be some disappointment if there is no follow-through to rumors over the past 24 hours of a further band-widening." -- FLEMMING NIELSEN, ASIA ECONOMIST AT DANSKE BANK, COPENHAGEN: "It's certainly not a surprise after the very strong figures we had on GDP and industrial production. "We believe there will be more 27 bps hikes this year, maybe in the fourth quarter, and in October there may be more administrative tightening measures. I also expect them at some point to eliminate the tax on interest income. They have already taken preliminary steps towards this." -- KAMAL SHARMA, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BANK OF AMERICA, LONDON: "It's very much in line with what the market had anticipated, 27 basis points had been largely priced in but there had been some expectations of more. We have had very strong Chinese data in the past few days, the surprise would have been if China did not move. Further hikes are still very much on the cards. In the absence of moves in the exchange rate, domestic monetary policy is the best way to curb growth." -- DARAGH MAHER, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, CALYON, LONDON: "After yesterday's data the case for some form of tightening had built and the markets have got used to them delivering that in relatively short order after the data... (The rate hike) obviously plays to yuan strength and by definition the Japanese yen enjoys some strength on the back of that." MARKETS -- Unfazed by speculation about a rate rise, share prices on the Shanghai market  .SSEC  rose 3.7 percent on Friday to end at a three-week closing high. -- The yuan  CNY=CFXS  hit its highest level against the dollar since its 2005 revaluation and was quoted at 7.5740 per dollar late on Friday. -- The yield on five-year government bonds CN5YTFIX=R eased to 3.8918 percent bid from 3.8936 percent on Thursday. BACKGROUND -- The central bank last tweaked benchmark interest rates on May 18, when it raised commercial banks' one-year deposit rate by 0.27 percentage point to 3.06 percent, and the one-year lending rate by 0.18 percentage point to 6.57 percent. -- Economists had widely expected the People's Bank of China to take further tightening measures after data on Thursday showed annual economic growth surged to an 11- year high of 11.9 percent in the second quarter. -- Separate data on Thursday showed that soaring costs of pork and grain had helped push annual consumer price inflation to a 33-month high of 4.4 percent in June, versus 3.4 percent in May.
