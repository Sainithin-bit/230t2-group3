 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) and Wachovia Corp 
WB.N on Friday posted higher-than-expected quarterly profits, 
as acquisitions and investment banking activities offset large 
increases in bad loans. 

  Profit rose 18 percent at Citigroup, the largest U.S. bank, 
and 24 percent at Wachovia, the fourth largest.  Shares of both companies fell, however, as investors 
worried that banks would get stuck with more soured consumer 
loans or riskier corporate debt on their balance sheets.  "All the banks said we'd get into a more normal credit 
environment, and that's what's happening," said Anton Schutz, a 
portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New 
York. "What I worry about is a slowdown in leveraged lending."  In afternoon trading, Citigroup fell 1 percent, while 
Wachovia dropped 3.1 percent and touched a 20-month low. The 
24-member Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX fell 1.4 percent.  Other profit gains reported by U.S. banks this week include 
5 percent at Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), 20 percent at 
JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and 9 percent at Wells Fargo & Co. 
( WFC.N ).
  CITIGROUP  Profit for New York-based Citigroup rose to $6.23 billion, 
or $1.24 per share, from $5.27 billion, or $1.05, a year 
earlier.  Excluding items, profit was $1.18 per share, according to 
Reuters Estimates, 5 cents above the average analyst forecast. 
Revenue jumped 20 percent to $26.63 billion, topping forecasts 
for $24.88 billion, while operating expenses rose 16 percent.  Citigroup said it has eliminated one-third of the 17,000 
jobs expected under a cost-cutting plan announced in April. 
Revenue rose faster than costs for a second straight quarter, 
and nearly half of profit and revenue came from international 
operations.  "I am more and more confident of the path we're on," Chief 
Executive Charles Prince said on a conference call.  Corporate and investment banking profit surged 64 percent 
to $2.83 billion, while profit in consumer banking fell 15 
percent to $2.7 billion. The bank set aside $2.52 billion for 
loan losses, up 75 percent from a year earlier.  Citigroup said revenue was hurt because the bank was stuck 
with four leveraged loans on its balance sheet, as investors 
grew more averse toward corporate buyouts funded by junk-rated 
debt.
  WACHOVIA  Net income for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia 
rose to $2.34 billion, or $1.22 per share, from $1.89 billion, 
or $1.17, a year earlier.  Excluding merger costs, profit was $1.23 per share, a penny 
ahead of analysts' average forecasts. Revenue rose 20 percent 
to $8.69 billion, topping forecasts for $8.39 billion, but 
compared with the first quarter rose more slowly than costs.  Profit jumped 34 percent in consumer and business banking, 
though Wachovia now projects "relatively flat" growth for 2007 
lending income, excluding mergers. Earnings rose in corporate 
and investment banking, capital management and wealth 
management.  Wachovia set aside $179 million for bad loans, triple the 
year-earlier level.  Nonperforming assets rose $341 million from the end of 
March, with much of the increase related to the former Golden 
West Financial Corp., a California mortgage specialist that 
Wachovia bought in October for $24.2 billion. It was criticized 
for overpaying amid fear the five-year housing boom was 
cresting.  Asked if he would buy Golden West again, Wachovia Chief 
Executive Ken Thompson said: "We're going through a little pain 
with it now, but I think a year out, 18 months out, two years 
out, we're going to be very happy that we did this deal."
