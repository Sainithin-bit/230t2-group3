 ST. LOUIS  (Reuters) - Stress in the subprime mortgage market does not look great enough to derail consumer spending, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said on Friday. 

 "There's probably a ways to go, but unless the pressure becomes much more severe, the problems would not impact consumer spending or credit quality more generally," Poole told reporters after speaking to a real estate group. Problems in the broader housing market will continue to be a drag on U.S. growth as inventories of unsold homes remain bloated, he said. There are also more home foreclosures ahead, as loans made in 2006 reset at higher interest rates, he added. But bank capital has not been impaired by problems among home loans made to borrowers with shaky credit, referred to as subprime mortgages, or declines in homebuilding and buying activity, he said. SWIFT, HARSH, WITHOUT PREJUDICE Poole's comments come against a backdrop of rising delinquencies and foreclosures among subprime mortgage loans. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday losses from subprime loans that borrowers have been unable to repay could add up to $50 billion to $100 billion. Subprime mortgage losses have rattled financial markets, as information comes to light of wide exposure to bad loans. Some tightening of lending has added to the slowdown in U.S. housing markets, which has weighed on overall U.S. economic growth. Poole said the Fed is monitoring the performance of nonprime loans carefully for any further signs of deterioration. Nonprime loans include subprime loans as well as loans made to borrowers unable to show a steady income stream, known as "Alt-A" loans. But Poole said the mortgage losses were heavily affecting lenders who tried to take advantage of unsophisticated borrowers or who took questionable lending risks. "The market's punishment of unsound financial arrangements has been swift, harsh and without prejudice," he said. IMPRUDENT LENDING Poole said it is surprising that adjustable-rate loans were made so extensively to borrowers with shaky credit around 2004, when policy-makers were sending unmistakable signals that higher interest rates were around the corner. "It was imprudent for mortgage brokers and lenders to approve borrowers who likely could not service the loans when rates rose," he said. Poole said the non-prime mortgage market, with originations in 2006 of about $1 trillion, is "clearly large enough to affect aggregate home-building activity and consumer spending." "We should take this responsibility seriously, and we are gathering information now to determine what else we should do to modify disclosure and other regulations," he added. Fed officials have said there is little evidence that credit is drying up for other borrowers. Bank regulators are preparing new rules aimed at protecting borrowers against deceptive lending practices. Poole, however, warned that oversight agencies should not overreact in writing new rules for mortgage lending. "We need to search for ways to strengthen borrower protections without so increasing regulatory costs and risks to lenders that they withdraw from the non-prime market," he said.
