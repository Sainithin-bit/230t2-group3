 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China could take action on Friday to cool its red-hot economy by raising interest rates or scrapping a withholding tax on interest income, analysts said on Friday. 

 Data on Thursday showing that annual economic growth in the second quarter surged to 11.9 percent -- the strongest rate in almost 12 years -- confirmed for many that policy action was imminent to cool the world's fastest growing major economy. The latest figures also showed that consumer prices in June surged 4.4 percent from a year earlier, the fastest rise in 33 months. Most June data, including for industrial output, retail sales and investment in urban areas, was stronger than expected.  "Officials have been repeatedly saying in the past that they are waiting for the updated indicators to make the final decision. And now they got enough evidence to act," said Li Huiyong, chief economist at Shenyin & Wanguo Securities in Shanghai. "I think they can't afford to hesitate any more and an interest rate rise could be seen even this afternoon or over the weekend," he said. China's stock market jumped 3 percent on Friday, having already factored in concerns of tighter policies to slow down the economy, dealers said. The yuan rose to 7.5607 per dollar, its highest level since China abandoned a dollar peg and revalued the currency by 2.1 percent in July 2005. China's economy has expanded at a double-digit clip for four years in a row despite a raft of measures to curb growth, such as investments restrictions and cuts in rebates on export tax. The financial and economic affairs committee of the country's rubber stamp parliament said on Tuesday the economy was showing increasing signs of overheating, phrasing that Li said was a euphemism for overheating. Economists said Beijing needed to boost real returns on bank deposits to prevent a big exodus of household savings into the stock market, which has risen more than 250 percent since the start of 2006. One-year certificates of deposit pay 3.06 percent, well below the annual inflation rate of 4.4 percent. In addition, interest income is taxed at 20 percent. Some analysts said they expected the government to scrap or cut the withholding tax. "I think there is a 6 out of 10 chance that the Ministry of Finance will announce the suspension of tax on interest income today," said Gao Shanwen, chief economist at Essence Securities in Shanghai. Zhu Baoliang, chief economist at State Information Center, a key government think-tank, agreed. "There are no obstacles for this since the parliament has authorised the State Council to do this. I think it could be abolished anytime soon," Zhu said. A rate rise would be Beijing's third this year and the fifth since last April. The central bank has also raised bank reserve requirements five times this year, leaving commercial banks with less to lend out, in the hopes of braking the economy's momentum. The central bank last raised rates on May 18, when it also raised bank reserve requirements and widened the yuan's trading band against the dollar to 0.5 percent, either side of a mid point, from 0.3 percent.
