 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group and the United Auto Workers union on Friday marked the start of a summer of crucial contract negotiations under intense pressure to break the model of business as usual for Detroit. 

 Chrysler, which is being spun off by German parent DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE in a $7.4-billion deal, was the first of the three U.S. automakers to reach a deal with the UAW during the last round of labor talks in 2003. Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda shook hands with UAW President Ron Gettelfinger at Chrysler's Auburn Hills, Michigan, headquarters in a choreographed photo opportunity that ushered in a period of deep uncertainty and heightened expectations for the U.S. auto industry. "Negotiations are all difficult, and this one is no exception," LaSorda told reporters, adding that Chrysler would look to "reexamine every part of our business model." Chrysler and larger rivals Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and General Motors Corp.( GM.N ) say they need a game-changing deal with the UAW this summer to keep production in the United States and avoid adding to the roughly 80,000 factory jobs they have cut over the past two years. The union and Chrysler had been in negotiations over retiree health care costs that were initially aimed at giving Chrysler a cost-saving deal of the kind the UAW granted Ford and GM because of their own deteriorating finances. But LaSorda said that discussion would now be wrapped into the overarching contract talks that began on Friday. Chrysler, which lost $1.4 billion in 2006, has said it needs sweeping concessions from the UAW to eliminate a cost gap with more efficient Japanese rivals. On the cusp of its acquisition by Cerberus Capital Management, Chrysler's hourly labor costs are an industry-leading $75.86, higher than GM at $73.26 or Ford at $70.51, according to data compiled by the automaker. Chrysler estimates that its U.S. wages are 60 percent above those of Toyota, which overtook it last year as the No. 3 player in the U.S. market. The company has also said Japan's weak yen gives Toyota and others a further cost advantage. Chrysler also pays its 26,000 UAW-represented workers over $30 per hour more than Japan's own Big Three -- Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) and Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) -- pay their American workers. Much of that gap represents the cost of higher pensions and retiree health care costs, issues expected to be at the center of negotiations to replace the current four-year deal expiring at midnight on September 14. Automakers and the UAW have urged reform of the U.S. health care system, which leaves most costs on employers as opposed to the nationalized systems in Japan, Canada and elsewhere. Many analysts expect the UAW to consider establishing a union-aligned trust fund for retiree health care, if it can reach agreement with the automakers on how fully to fund it. Such a move, which would follow a model established by Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co GT.N and bankrupt auto parts supplier Dana Corp.DCNAQ.PK, could shift billions in annual costs from the automakers. UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said the UAW's decision to sanction the creation of the trust fund for Dana retirees should not be read as a precedent for the major automakers. He declined to say whether the UAW had begun working with investment bank Lazard Ltd. ( LAZ.N ) to consider its options on retiree health care as reported by the Wall Street Journal on Friday. "We're not going to get into the specifics of any negotiations," he said. "We're going to deal with the negotiations in the proper forum -- at the negotiating table." In response to the automakers, UAW argues that labor costs represent only about 8 percent of the price of an average new car and points out that many UAW-represented factories rank among the most productive, according to the most recent annual study by Harbour Consulting. Cerberus Chairman John Snow said last week that Chrysler's current leadership team under LaSorda would lead negotiations, but he made clear that the stakes were high. "Finding answers to close the competitive gaps are crucial to the U.S. auto industry," he told reporters. "If it's going to survive and prosper, we need to close the gap." Ceremonial handshakes between Gettelfinger and executives to mark the start of contract talks at GM and Ford are scheduled for Monday. The UAW is expected to ask its members for strike authorization at some point in the two months of talks ahead. Most analysts consider a UAW strike a remote prospect because of the risk that such a work stoppage could force one of the money-losing Detroit-based automakers into bankruptcy.
