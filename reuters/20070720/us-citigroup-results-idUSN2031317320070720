 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, said on Friday that strong international and investment banking growth fueled a higher-than-expected 18 percent increase in quarterly profit. 

 Revenue rose faster than expenses for a second straight quarter. Credit losses soared, as they have at rival banks. Nearly half of profit and revenue came internationally, where Citigroup has made 10 acquisitions since October. Chief Executive Charles Prince, nearing the end of his fourth year at the helm of New York-based Citigroup, has been trying to cut costs and boost revenue, especially overseas, amid pressure from shareholders demanding a higher stock price. "You've got to think this buys Chuck Prince more time," said Lee Delaporte, a portfolio manager at Dreman Value Management LLC in Jersey City, New Jersey, which invests $22 billion and owns Citigroup stock. "They're showing improvements not just on the expense side, but on the revenue side." Second-quarter net income rose to $6.23 billion, or $1.24 per share, from $5.27 billion, or $1.05, a year earlier. Excluding items, profit was $1.18 per share, according to Reuters Estimates, 5 cents above the average analyst forecast. Revenue rose 20 percent to $26.63 billion, versus the average $24.88 billion estimate, while operating costs rose 16 percent. Citigroup said it has eliminated one-third of the 17,000 jobs planned in a cost-cutting program announced in April. Return on equity rose to 20.1 percent from 18.6 percent. "I am more and more confident of the path we're on," Prince said on a conference call. LOAN EXPOSURE Citigroup nevertheless said revenue was hurt because it was stuck at the end of June with four leveraged loans, often used in corporate acquisitions, on its balance sheet. This occurred as investors grew more leery of buying riskier debt. In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Gary Crittenden said "it's likely, given market conditions, we're going to have to change some of the terms" on other offerings this quarter. Asked on the conference call if the third-quarter revenue impact could be larger, he said "yes, it certainly could." Citigroup shares fell as much as 1.9 percent. In late afternoon trading, they were down 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $50.87 on the New York Stock Exchange. The Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX was down 1.2 percent. Earlier this week, Citigroup's main rivals Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) reported quarterly profit increases of 5 percent and 20 percent, respectively. INTERNATIONAL, INVESTMENT BANKING SURGE International profit increased 35 percent to $3.04 billion, while revenue rose 34 percent to $12.56 billion, representing 49 percent and 47 percent of overall totals. Prince wants to generate 60 percent of business outside the United States. "There's more risk, especially in less developed countries, but there's also rapid growth," said Anton Schutz, a portfolio manager at Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New York. Credit costs rose $934 million, including an increase of $259 million in net credit losses and a $465 million charge to boost loss reserves. The bank set aside $2.52 billion for loan losses, up 75 percent from a year earlier. That compares with an 80 percent increase at Bank of America and a tripling at JPMorgan. Profit in consumer banking, Citigroup's largest business, fell 15 percent to $2.7 billion, as credit quality weakened. Revenue increased 8 percent to $13.66 billion, but just 3 percent in the United States. Corporate and investment banking profit surged 64 percent to $2.83 billion, as revenue rose 33 percent to $8.96 billion. Revenue rose 24 percent in fixed income markets, 67 percent in equity markets and 28 percent in investment banking. Wealth management profit, including the Smith Barney brokerage and private bank, rose 48 percent to $514 million. Alternative investments profit rose 77 percent to $456 million. Citigroup ended June with $2.22 trillion in assets. (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
