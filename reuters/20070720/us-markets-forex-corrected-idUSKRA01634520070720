 (Corrects New Zealand interest rate in paragraph 9 to ... 8.0 percent ..., not 8.25 percent) 

 By  Naomi Tajitsu TOKYO  (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a record low against the euro on Friday due to continuing concerns about weakness in the U.S. housing market and its impact on the broader economy. High-yielding currencies gained, with the New Zealand dollar hitting a 22-year high against the dollar and a 21-year high against the low-yielding yen, while the Australian dollar touched a 16-year high versus the Japanese currency. The dollar limped after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday said that losses on subprime loans -- those to customers with poor credit -- could hit $100 billion and threaten consumer spending, while also reiterating that inflation is the central bank's biggest concern. Bernanke's testimony to the U.S. Senate Banking Committee supported the market's view that the Fed is unlikely to lower interest rates from 5.25 percent this year. Minutes from the central bank's June policy meeting were largely in line with market expectations, showing that officials see the housing sector as the biggest risk to growth and that core inflation is "relatively subdued". "There were no surprises in Bernanke's testimony and the FOMC minutes," said Tomoko Fujii, senior economist and strategist at Bank of America. "There's no major incentive to sell (the dollar aggressively) at the moment." The euro was flat at $1.3795  EUR= , within range of a record high of $1.3834 hit earlier this week, when the dollar came under broad selling pressure on news that the value of two Bear Stearns hedge funds that bet heavily on subprime loans had evaporated. The New Zealand dollar  NZD=D4  climbed to around $0.7950, its strongest since the country's central bank floated the currency in 1985. The kiwi was well supported by its 8.0 percent yield, the highest among industrialized nations. The dollar inched up slightly to 122.20 yen  JPY= , supported as the low-yielding yen stayed under selling pressure due to ongoing demand to use it to buy assets in higher-yielding currencies in what is known as the carry trade. "The dollar/yen has been largely steady because both the dollar and the yen have been weak," said Shogo Nagaya, forex manager at Nomura Securities. "But the dollar-selling trend against other currencies will continue, and we may see it fall lower next week." Both the dollar and the yen were underperformers in a market that has continued to favor high-yielding currencies with prospects of rising interest rates. The high-yielding Australian dollar inched up 0.2 percent to around 107.65 yen AUDJPY=R, its strongest since September 1991, while the New Zealand dollar climbed 0.35 percent to 97.20 yen NZDJPY=R, a level not seen in 21 years. The single European currency inched up 0.15 percent to 168.60 yen EURJPY=R, creeping closer to the record high of 168.95 yen hit a week ago. Traders were on the lookout to see whether China's central bank will lift rates after data on Thursday showed that growth in the country jumped to an 11 1/2-year high in the second quarter. Analysts say a rise, which would be the third this year, may come as soon as Friday, but some said that such a move was likely to have limited effect on other currencies, as traders say that strength in China's economy is already factored into the market. Market participants were also awaiting a speech by St. Louis Fed President William Poole on subprime mortgages at 1430 GMT. Tokyo traders were starting to focus on Japanese elections on July 29, in which Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition is expected to lose its majority in the upper house, which would make it difficult for the government to enact laws. A poll published by the Asahi Shimbun on Friday showed that Abe's Liberal Democratic Party may suffer bigger losses that previously expected, which some analysts said may initially weigh on the yen after the votes are counted.
