 DETROIT  (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger said on Friday a decision by the union to allow bankrupt auto supplier Dana Corp. DCNAQ.PK to establish a trust fund for retiree health care was not a precedent for the union's upcoming talks with major automakers. 

 "The settlement at Dana is not a precursor for any other set of negotiations," Gettelfinger told reporters at an event to mark the start of the UAW's talks with Chrysler Group. Gettelfinger said Chrysler and the other automakers could take steps to improve competitiveness outside of cutting labor costs and said the union was heading into the talks determined to "look after the best interests" of workers and retirees. Gettelfinger also said he expects the U.S. automakers to emerge from the contract talks as "strong, viable companies."
