 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury will run out of money to pay its bills by August 2. But Democratic and Republican lawmakers are nowhere near a deal to raise the $14.3 trillion debt limit that would allow the government to borrow funds and avoid default. 

 On average, the U.S. Treasury borrows $125 billion every month to meet Washington's financial obligations, such as interest on the U.S. debt and Social Security payments to elderly and disabled Americans. Following are Treasury's spending commitments after the August deadline, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. August 3 * $32 billion, including $23 billion to Social Security recipients August 4 * $10 billion, including $3.1 billion in Medicaid and Medicare health care expenses for the elderly and disabled * $90 billion in maturing U.S. debt, according to the Treasury Department. August 5 * $12 billion, including $3.4 billion in federal salaries and $2 billion in defense spending August 8 * $11 billion, including $1.4 billion in defense spending and $2.2 billion in healthcare payments August 9 * $11 billion, including $2.5 billion in Medicaid and Medicare payments and $1.5 billion to the Department of Education August 10 * $19 billion, including $8.5 billion in Social Security payments August 11 * $11 billion, including $3 billion in Medicaid and Medicare payments August 12 * $9 billion, including $2.2 billion in health care payments and $3 billion in welfare and unemployment benefits August 15 * $41 billion, including at least $29 billion in interest payments on U.S. debt.
