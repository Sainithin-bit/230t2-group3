 (Reuters) - TD Ameritrade Holding's ( AMTD.O ) directors plan to discuss at a meeting Tuesday the possibility of trying to buy rival online broker E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ), the Wall Street Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The expected talks do not necessarily mean that TD Ameritrade will make an offer for E*Trade, the newspaper said. E*Trade Financial's largest shareholder, Citadel LLC, last week pressed the online brokerage to consider a sale of its business. An Ameritrade spokeswoman told the Journal on Sunday that the company will "often look at opportunities in the marketplace in terms of the financial or strategic value they could add to our firm and will continue to do so." She declined to comment to the paper on Tuesday's meeting. Ameritrade was not immediately available for comment outside of regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore)
