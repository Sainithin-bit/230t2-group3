 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama, taking a combative tone in a standoff with congressional Republicans over the U.S. debt, said the country cannot deal with its budget problems through spending cuts alone. 

 "Both parties have a responsibility to come together and solve the problem and make sure the American people are not hurt on this issue," Obama said in a speech at the National Council of La Raza. "I've already said I'm willing to cut spending that we don't need by historic amounts to reduce our long-term deficit and make sure that we can invest in our children's future," he said. "But we can't just close our deficits by cutting spending." (Reporting by  Caren Bohan  and  Alister Bull ; Editing by  Jackie Frank )
