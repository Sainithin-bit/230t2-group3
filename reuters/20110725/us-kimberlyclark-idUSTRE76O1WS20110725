 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kimberly-Clark Corp ( KMB.N ) reported second-quarter earnings that beat estimates but said full-year profit could come in toward the low end of its forecast, as costs for oil-based materials keep rising for the maker of Kleenex tissues and Huggies diapers. 

 Kimberly-Clark said on Monday that it expected to pay an extra $650 million to $750 million for materials such as polymer resin, superabsorbents, adhesives and other packaging materials this year. Back in January, input costs were expected to rise only $200 million to $250 million and be fully offset by cost-cutting. Then in April, the company forecast $450 million to $550 million in additional costs. Kimberly-Clark said it expects to find more economies in areas such as supply chain and sourcing, and will keep raising some prices. However, the company will hold off on raising North American prices on its Huggies diapers until later this year due to some packaging changes taking hold in the industry. Shares of Kimberly-Clark, whose results kicked off earnings reports from major U.S. household products makers, fell 2 percent to $66.56 in afternoon trading. Chief Executive Tom Falk said he is not interested in "big, transformational M&A," after being asked about whether his company might want to bid for Clorox Co ( CLX.N ), which was put in play by investor Carl Icahn this month. Icahn, whose current offer for Clorox stands at $80 per share, suggested others such as Kimberly should offer more. "We would consider Clorox to be a well-managed company and so, as we look at it, it's hard to see how you come in and do a whole lot better job of it," Falk said on a conference call. HUGGIES LOSE SHARE, PRICE HIKE DELAYED Kimberly-Clark's Huggies diapers lost some market share in North America during the quarter. A lower birth rate, along with stepped-up competition from Procter & Gamble Co ( PG.N ) and store brands, has put pressure on that business. Kimberly-Clark had planned to raise Huggies prices in North America by 3 percent to 7 percent. [ID:nN17149585] It is now holding off, likely until October, as it moves larger packs from cardboard boxes into plastic bags after talks with retailers. Getting rid of the cardboard should also lead to "slight cost savings," Falk told Reuters. P&G might have to delay its 7 percent price increase on Pampers to maintain competitive price gaps, said Wells Fargo analyst Tim Conder. P&G would not comment on its plans. It announced a price increase back in April. PROFIT FALLS Kimberly-Clark's profit fell to $408 million, or $1.03 per share, from $498 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings per share were $1.18, coming in ahead of the analysts' $1.14 forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Kimberly-Clark, which also makes Kotex feminine care products and Scott paper goods, said sales rose 8.3 percent to $5.26 billion, topping analysts' forecast of $5.13 billion. But five percentage points of the rise in sales came from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The volume of goods sold rose just 2 percent, and prices were up 1 percent. Kimberly-Clark still expects to earn $4.80 per share to $5.05 per share this year, excluding special items. However, without some moderation in input costs, its profit is more likely to be in the lower half of that range, Falk said. The company is heavily exposed to material costs, with products such as tissues and diapers making up a large chunk of its business. While commodity costs have also risen for rivals such as P&G, their portfolios are more diversified. Kimberly-Clark plans to offset some of the higher costs by cutting more expenses. It now expects to save $300 million to $350 million this year, up $50 million from a prior target. The company now expects sales to rise 5 percent to 7 percent, up from a prior forecast of 4 percent to 6 percent, aided by strengthening foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.
