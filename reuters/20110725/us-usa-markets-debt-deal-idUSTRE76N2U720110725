 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A sharply divided Congress pursued rival budget plans on Sunday that appeared unlikely to win broad support, pushing the United States closer to a debt default that would reverberate around the world. 

 With time running out, Democrats and Republicans split into two camps and held talks among themselves. Both sides appeared unwilling to compromise to head off a default that could trigger global economic calamity and strip America of its coveted Triple-A credit rating. COMMENTS: KENRO KAWANO SENIOR INTEREST-RATE STRATEGIST AT CREDIT SUISSE The biggest problem here is that the unpredictable shock in case the planned annual expenses are delayed, in case the debt ceiling isn't raised and the negative impact on economic sentiment. There are worries that as the situation becomes increasingly unclear, the yields on bonds would rise, but another factor that has to be taken very seriously into consideration is the impact on the already fragile economy coming from a potential financial shock following steep falls in stock prices. In other words, what I'm worried about is not the rise in the bond yields, but the following drop in them. ...I don't think the yields on bonds would rise even if we have more belt-tightening and if there's a lot of uncertainty surrounding these issues. This problem may have an impact on stocks, and through stocks on the JGB market, but it wouldn't cause a rise in JGB yields. I think it is likely to push the yen higher, so unlike the U.S. curve, downward pressure may emerge on long-term JGBs. FUKOKU CAPITAL MANAGEMENT CEO YUUKI SAKURAI ...They may have a technical default but I don't think that will mean that people will stop buying treasuries or stop buying dollars because you don't have alternative investment tools... But we may see some yield pick up in American government bonds and maybe some hike in interest rates we may see some fall in US equities and also a fall in US dollars. We have people worrying about the strong yen when it went short of 80 yen. But same thing happened in the past when the dollar hit 100 yen and most people said it was the end of the Japanese economy. Same discussion with 95 yen, 90 yen and so on. So most people said there could be some profit decreased for exporters. But this is not the end of the Japanese economy. KENNETH AKINTEWE, A FUND MANAGER AT ABERDEEN WHO HELPS MANAGE $6.8 BILLION IN ASIAN FIXED INCOME Markets still believe that there is going to be a last minute deal on this even though we might be pushing really close to the line on this and that is the reason why Asian trading have been largely sanguine today morning. Even if there is a U.S. technical default, we would have to see the impact of it, in terms of which U.S. bonds get downgraded and other technical aspects. We will see risk premiums at elevated levels this week and markets being more choppy, but I don't see this changing the bigger picture on flows toward Asia or altering current investment holdings within the region. An impact on Asian bonds, if any, would be limited to the two most correlated markets to the U.S. -- Singapore and HK. And there are two ways of looking at this. If U.S. gets downgraded, then this would have a ripple impact on these markets and we could see an underperformance in them, especially on the short end of the yield curves. Secondly, if they do manage to avert a default, then it would mean the last of the risks for markets in the near term apart from the Greek crisis is allayed for now. This would be a huge positive for risky assets in the second half and may lead to bond underperformance in these markets." CHUN SUNG-MOON, A FUND MANAGER AT WOORI ASSET MANAGEMENT The overall view is that the U.S. debt problems will not develop into a worst case scenario. It's more of political confrontation delaying the final decision on the debt ceiling issue. but they will eventually end up reaching an agreement to avoid disaster. Financial markets have been relatively resilient, which reflects investors' confidence over the issue. Institutional investors see it more as a short-term event that provides buying opportunity. They are snapping up shares when the market retreats. It's also based on a lesson they've learned from recent eurozone debt problems. There had been lots of skepticism that they would fail to offer aid to Greece, but in the end European leaders agreed to extend rescue package. Many expect the same sort of difficult tit for tat to take hold in much of the process resolving the U.S. debt problems." GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST WITH JANNEY MONTGOMERY SCOTT IN PHILADELPHIA. Any progress is welcome here, and judging by the headlines, it's a relatively timely one that might be enough to avert crisis. Still, Reid's proposal is clearly heavy on concept and short on detail, so we'll have to see whether those details are acceptable to his party. As for the balanced-budget amendment, that's impractical and extremely unlikely to pass given the massive, broad support any Constitutional amendment requires. It seems more like political posturing on the part of Boehner. ROBERT TIPP, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST at PRUDENTIAL FIXED INCOME IN NEWARK, NEW JERSEY With tax revenues recently coming in ahead of expectations, there's a possibility the deadline could be pushed out. Nonetheless, given the "approach avoidance zigzag" course the negotiations continue to be on, the prospects for a big deal look slim. The most likely scenario, I'd say, is a small deal, no default, but a downgrade to high double AA within a month. I think that's what the agencies have signaled, and therefore that's what the markets are expecting. The unproductive course in DC may result in continued volatility, especially now that the focus is turning away from Europe, and back to the US. On the off chance the negotiations return to a 3-plus trillion dollar deal, this'd be a big plus for markets all around." DAVID KEEBLE, GLOBAL HEAD OF INTEREST RATE STRATEGY WITH CREDIT AGRICOLE SECURITIES (USA) Inc. IN NEW YORK The Senator Reid proposals show a shift in the position for the Democrats and perhaps this will enable the GOP to get on board. The most important aspect is to avoid a downgrade or failure to mail out the Social Security checks. Such a situation could prove catastrophic for the fragile recovery and via many linked channels cause a virtual seizure of repo markets and quite possibly even the Treasury market. Unfortunately, my guess is that $2.5 trillion in savings is simply too small an amount to avoid a slap across the wrists from the ratings agencies, and one of the major agencies will likely take away the triple-A rating. A single notch ratings cut should not overwhelm the market, the usual reaction to such a move is a sudden drop in Treasury prices, then a recovery. STEVEN ENGLANDER, HEAD OF G10 FX STRATEGY, CITIGROUP, NEW YORK Ninety percent of Wall Street, including myself, expected them to come to a deal right at the last minute. The fact that they seem to be jumping from one type of proposal to another and not converging on anything is beginning to worry markets. The other thing is that when this started, the focus was the debt ceiling. Now the issue is that the ratings agencies have said they need to have a credible deficit-reduction program in place for them to take away the threat of a downgrade. The dollar may get a bounce if they converge on a plan but if the program looks vague and won't satisfy the ratings agencies, we'll go back to dollar selling. Politically, it's beginning to damage both sides. If the U.S. loses its AAA rating because Congress couldn't decide on an adequate program, I think all of Congress will get the blame. I also think damage is being done by setting deadlines that aren't going to be met." BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, GFT FOREX, NEW YORK I think markets are going to take a wait-and-see attitude. Swiss franc was stronger across the board but it is nowhere near the type of panic we've seen in the past. Markets are still hoping some deal is going to get done. The dollar is under mild pressure, but we don't see severe panic. If by the end of the day tomorrow there's no progress, though, that's when anxiety is going to escalate. For now, there's still a shred of hope. If they go that route and the debt ceiling is lifted, there will be a relief rally but it could be very shortlived, especially if the ratings agencies act on a downgrade. If they don't produce a substantiative deal like the Europeans did, it could get messy.
