 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, Monday dismissed a plan offered by Senate Democrats to cut the deficit and raise the $14.3 trillion debt limit as full of "gimmicks." 

 The Senate plan calls for $2.7 trillion in spending cuts, including $1 trillion in savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Boehner said the plan offered by Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid failed to make any real changes in the government's spending and does not address the Medicare and Medicaid health programs for the elderly and poor or other benefit programs.
