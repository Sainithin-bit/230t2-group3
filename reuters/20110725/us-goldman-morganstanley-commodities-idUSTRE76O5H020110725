 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - At the once-feared commodity trading arms of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the pressure to do better in the second half of this year has never been more intense. 

 Long admired for their scale, savvy and unrivalled expertise that lifted them leagues above rivals, the two investment banking titans on Wall Street reported last week a significant drop in commodity revenue in the second quarter. Subpar trading results have left the door open for others to muscle into the turf they have long dominated, and now JPMorgan Chase is challenging them as the dominant commodities firm on Wall Street. Commodities usually account for a relatively small share of trading income at Wall Street banks, compared with equities, currencies and bonds. But at Goldman and Morgan Stanley, they can make up as much as a tenth of their multibillion dollar profits. But by singling out the business in the second quarter, the two showed how much commodities had weighed on their bottom line, and led some to question whether the glory days of Goldman's J. Aron franchise and Morgan's vast physical oil empire may be over as the heat of intensified competition and tougher regulation catches up with them. Meanwhile, JPMorgan, which used to trade mostly metals before pushing into oil three years ago, could pick up top place in commodity revenues as a series of risky acquisitions and hires start to pay off. The bank is reported to have enjoyed bumper commodity revenues in the second quarter that bolstered its overall results. While one quarter does not a trend make, a close examination of Goldman and Morgan Stanley's results shows their quarterly commodity revenues shrank more often than they grew since 2008. "The pedigree that was once the almost exclusive constituency of Goldman Sachs is now being more evenly spread out," said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, who manages a commodity mutual fund and holds stock in both Goldman and JP Morgan. Initially dismissed by some as the result of less risky trading ahead of a regulatory crack-down, revenues are now eroding even as both banks put more of their own funds in play while also expanding into less glamorous commodity related businesses that don't require as much leverage or capital. According to a study conducted by Reuters of 10 quarterly statements since the start of 2009, Goldman reported its commodity performance was down or flat year-on-year six times; Morgan Stanley only mentioned the sector positively three times in that period.
