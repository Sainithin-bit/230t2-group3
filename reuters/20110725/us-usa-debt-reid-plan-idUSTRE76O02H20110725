 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner's plan to raise the debt limit to cover a few months of borrowing activity is a "nonstarter," Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said on Sunday. 

 "Speaker Boehner's plan, no matter how he tries to dress it up, is simply a short-term plan, and is therefore a non-starter in the Senate and with the president," Reid said in a prepared statement. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan  and  Richard Cowan ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
