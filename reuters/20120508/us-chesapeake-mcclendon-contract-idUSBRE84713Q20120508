 (Reuters) - Chesapeake Energy CEO Aubrey McClendon's work contract has been revised or re-issued nearly a dozen times over the past 15 years, including several changes that granted him progressively greater leeway to engage in business ventures outside of the company, according to a review of the company's filings. 
 The current iteration of his multi-year contract, in effect since January 2009 and revised only once, in March of that year, included a new section that spelled out a range of permissible and impermissible activities in far greater detail than before, including a ban on owning or running a hedge fund. It also gave him explicit approval to trade commodities. The following are verbatim sections of text extracted from his work contracts as filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) in chronological order, prefaced by a short explanation of relevant changes between versions. A short timeline of the dates for his contracts appears thereafter. July 1, 1997 - First contract text available. ** TEXT: "Other Activities. Except for the activities (the 'Permitted Activities') expressly permitted by paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 of this Agreement, or the prior written approval of the board of directors of the Company, the Executive will not: (a) engage in business independent of the Executive's employment by the Company which requires any substantial portion of the Executive's time; (b) serve as an officer, general partner or member in any corporation, partnership, company, or firm; (c) directly or indirectly invest in, participate in or acquire an interest in any oil and gas business, including, without limitation, (i) producing oil and gas, (ii) drilling, owning or operating oil and gas leases or wells, (iii) providing services or materials to the oil and gas industry, (iv) marketing or refining oil or gas, or (v) owning any interest in any corporation, partnership, company or entity which conducts any of the foregoing activities.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Executive will be permitted to participate in the following activities which will be deemed to be approved by the Company, if such activities are undertaken in strict compliance with this Agreement." July 1, 2001 -- Revises (b) to limit ban on holding office to 'public' enterprises (previously stated as 'any corporation, partnership, company or firm'); adds (c) to state executive may serve as general partner or member of any enterprise so long as it is a 'passive investment' that involves 'minimal' time. ** TEXT: "Other Activities. Except for the activities (the 'Permitted Activities') expressly permitted by paragraphs 3.1 and 3.2 of this Agreement or approved by the board of directors of the Company, the Executive will not: (a) engage in business independent of the Executive's employment by the Company which requires any substantial portion of the Executive's time; (b) serve as an officer or director of any public corporation, partnership, company, or firm; (c) except for passive investments that do not violate this Agreement and require a minimal portion of the Executive's time, serve as a general partner or member of any corporation, partnership, company or firm; or (d)..."
