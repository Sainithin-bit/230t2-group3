 May 8 - Mexico's stock index fell more than 2 percent, led by a 6 percent drop in shares of America Movil, which announced a European phone investment on Monday. 
 America Movil ( AMXL.MX ), controlled by billionaire Carlos Slim, said on Monday that it has offered to buy a stake worth up to 3.2 billion euros ($4.2 billion) in Netherlands-based KPN NV ( KPN.AS ), eyeing it as a base for potential expansion in Europe. <ID: nL5E8G81SH> (Reporting Mexico City Newsroom; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
