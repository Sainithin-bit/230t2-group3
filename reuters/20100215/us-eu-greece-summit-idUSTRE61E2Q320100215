 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The following are comments by euro zone finance ministers and EU officials on Monday ahead of a two-day meeting in Brussels to discuss the Greek fiscal crisis. 

 GREEK FINANCE MINISTER GEORGE PAPACONSTANTINOU "The biggest problem Greece faces is a credibility deficit. You lose credibility fast, you regain it slowly." "The Greek pension system is not viable as it stands." "My argument is yes, we are doing enough, yes will be able to do it." "We are trying to change the course of the Titanic, it cannot be done in a day." "If additional fiscal measures are needed, we will take them." "Today it is Greece, tomorrow it can be another country. Any European country can be prey to speculative forces." "We are beginning to show that step-by-step, we are following words with action." MONETARY AFFAIRS COMMISSIONER OLLI REHN "The Eurogroup (of finance ministers from the euro zone) will work on the basis of the declaration of the European Council. "We support efforts of the Greek government to achieve objectives of the stability program, especially the target of a four percent reduction of the public-sector deficit. "In that context, we expect that in due course the Greek government will take necessary additional measures to reach that target. Our view is that risks related to the implementation and macro-economy and markets are materializing. "And therefore there is a clear case for additional measures." EUROGROUP CHAIRMAN JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER "We will have a discussion on the basis of what the European Council agreed upon and there it is clearly mentioned that Greece has to make sure that it cuts it budget deficit for 2010 by four percent and we have to check if this is possible or not and it will all depend on the answers given to that crucial question." SPANISH ECONOMY MINISTER ELENA SALGADO Asked if the ministers will ask Greece to take additional measures to cut deficit: "This is something that has to be discussed tomorrow." Asked if Portugal's central bank governor Vitor Constancio is the frontrunner for the job of European Central Bank vice president: "In Spain and Portugal we share the commitment to help the other country."
