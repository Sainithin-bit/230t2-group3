 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norway's Yara ( YAR.OL ) agreed to buy Terra Industries TRA.N for $4.1 billion to create the world's biggest mineral fertilizer producer and boost its U.S. presence, as rivals look to join forces to gain size and reach. 

 Norway's biggest-ever foreign takeover announcement came on Monday, a month after U.S.-based CF Industries Holdings Inc ( CF.N ) withdrew its year-long hostile bid to buy Terra. CF Industries is itself subject to a hostile offer from Canadian fertilizer maker Agrium ( AGU.TO ), which said last week it was committed to its bid. These and other M&A battles have kept the fertilizer sector in investors' sights, despite a sharp fall in prices last year as the global economic crisis hit. Analysts and producers expect a major rebound in demand this year as farmers rush to replenish their soil nutrient levels, stoking M&A. Yara Chief Executive Joergen Ole Haslestad said the all-cash Terra purchase "will create a clear global No. 1 in the fertilizer industry." "We expect the U.S. markets to pick up in a big way," he told reporters. Energy-intensive fertilizer producers in North America have become increasingly attractive, Yara said, due to "structural changes" in U.S. energy markets as a boom in unconventional gas output curbs U.S. natural gas prices. Yara said production costs for urea - the main component of nitrogen-based fertilizer - inherited from the Terra deal would be half the $1,500 per metric ton it would cost to build new capacity in, for example, the Middle East where energy costs are low. The deal also allows it to tap Terra's logistics in the United States. Terra has a strong presence in the Midwest, while Yara's U.S. operations are mainly based on the East coast. The enlarged company will be No. 1 in production volumes of ammonia and UAN (a mix of ammonia and urea), although some potash-based fertilizer producers have larger market capitalizations. INDUSTRY TREND Analysts say that consolidation across the nitrogen-based fertilizer industry would continue as leading players seek to benefit from bigger scale and wider geographical reach. "There are still many players in the fertilizer industry and a company like Yara seeks to reduce that number by increasing their own stake and earnings," First Securities analyst Hans Erik Jacobsen said. Yara's offer values Terra at $41.1 per share and represents a premium of 23.6 percent compared with Friday's closing price. Yara said it is planning a rights issue worth between $2 billion and $2.5 billion to help fund the deal. The Norwegian government, which owns 36.2 percent of Yara, would participate. The enlarged company will have about 30 percent of the U.S. fertilizer market and an 8 percent global market share. Yara said it expects some $60 million annual synergies from the deal. Yara, spun out from Norwegian group Norsk Hydro ( NHY.OL ) in 2004, has long said it seeks a 10 percent global market share. Several takeovers by Haslestad and his predecessor Thorleif Enger have doubled Yara's production since 2004. The deal could be the largest-ever takeover of a fertilizer company, according to Thomson Reuters data, although it could be topped by Agrium's near-$5 billion tilt at CF Industries. It is also set to be the largest foreign takeover by a Norwegian company, and the share sale could be the country's biggest, if it tops bank DnB NOR's DNBNOR.OL $2.45 billion December issue, Thomson Reuters data shows. Agilis Faerder analyst Are Grongstad said the bid was "strategically the right thing to do." Shares in Yara were down 5.4 percent at 229.3 crowns at 1359 GMT on a steady Oslo bourse .OSEBX. European potash-based fertilizer group K+S was up 1.5 percent.

Yara said it does not see any regulatory problems with the acquisition, which it expects to close in June. Norway's national insurance fund Folketrygdfondet, which holds 6.57 percent in Yara, has agreed to underwrite and subscribe its pro-rata share of the rights issue. The remaining part of the rights issue is underwritten by Citigroup ( C.N ), Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and Nordea ( NDA.ST ). Citi is the financial adviser to Yara, while Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) advised Terra. (Additional reporting by  Quentin Webb  in London; Editing by Erica Billingham)
