 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's top government spokesman said on Monday that the nation's growth figures improved in October-December but the situation remains severe 

 "We still think the economy and its trend remain severe," Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirofumi Hirano told a news conference. Japan's economy expanded at the fastest pace in two quarters in October-December as a recovery in exports spurred capital spending, but analysts say growth will slow on cuts in public works spending and as consumption tapers off.
