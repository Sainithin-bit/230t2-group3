 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Greece must cut its budget deficit by 4 percentage points this year and if it doesn't, additional measures could be called for, Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Monday. 

 "We will have a discussion on the basis of what the European Council agreed upon... Greece has to make sure that it cuts it budget deficit for 2010 by 4 percent and we have to check if this is possible or not, and it will all depend on the answers given to that crucial question," he told reporters as he arrived for a meeting of euro zone finance ministers in Brussels.
