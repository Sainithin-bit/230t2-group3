 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - India's Tata Motors ( TAMO.BO ) has appointed Carl-Peter Forster, a former General Motors GM.UL executive, as the group chief executive officer, the company said on Monday. 

 Forster, who was head of GM, Europe, will have overall responsibility of Tata Motors globally, including that of its British unit Jaguar and Land Rover, it said. Ravi Kant, who oversaw Tata Motors's global and domestic operations, had moved last year to non-executive vice chairman. (Reporting by  Janaki Krishnan ; Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan)
