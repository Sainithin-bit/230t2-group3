 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N said on Monday it had just over 90 percent acceptances from Cadbury Plc CBRY.L shareholders in its takeover of the British confectioner. 

 Kraft, after a prolonged battle for the company, said it would start a compulsory purchase of the remaining shares to close out the deal. The $18.4 billion takeover will create the world's biggest confectionery group, following a near five-month takeover fight. (Reporting by  Paul Thomasch , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
