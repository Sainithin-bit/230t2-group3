 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds inched down on Monday with the benchmark 10-year yield staying at a four-month high as investors were concerned bond yields could rise further in the coming months. 

 JGBs have been under pressure as rekindled supply worries have boosted the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yield to a nine-month peak, while Tokyo's Nikkei stock average  .N225  climbed to its highest in 18 months last week on a fall in the yen against the dollar. Persistent jitters that Japan's fiscal health may stay poor also make investors worry that JGB yields could climb further in the new fiscal year starting this Thursday, analysts said. The nation's public debt is now around 200 percent of its gross domestic product, the highest among industrialized economies. Media polls have pointed to a steady slide in public support for the current government, prompting people to believe it is getting harder for Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama to make unpopular policy decisions, such as tax hikes, to fix Japan's debt problem. Investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude ahead of the Bank of Japan tankan quarterly survey of corporate sentiment on Thursday and the U.S. Labor Department's monthly employment data on Friday. Bond losses were limited, however, as market players are well aware investors have a chunk of money in their hands as the new financial year starts soon and that they are likely to pour funds into the JGB market if the Nikkei shows signs of peaking out. "Market participants are eyeing what investors will do in the new year," said Katsutoshi Inadome, a fixed-income strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "Investors are expected to start moving later on this week when big economic events may set direction for the market." June 10-year JGB futures dipped 0.03 point to 138.30, staying within sight of a four-month trough of 138.16 struck on Friday. The benchmark 10-year yield rose 1 basis point to 1.385 percent, a four-month peak first hit on Friday. The five-year yield was unchanged on the day at 0.545 percent. The yield on Friday climbed as high as 0.550 percent, its highest since late November. The BOJ's closely watched tankan poll is likely to show confidence at Japanese firms improved for a fourth consecutive quarter as exports drive an economic recovery, a Reuters poll showed. Japanese retail sales rose 4.2 percent in February from a year earlier, more than a median market forecast for a 1.8 percent annual increase, government data showed on Monday.
