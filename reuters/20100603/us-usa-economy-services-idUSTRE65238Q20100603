 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. non-manufacturing sector grew in May for a fifth consecutive month and added workers for the first time since December 2007, according to an industry report released on Thursday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index stood at 55.4 last month, unchanged from April. The median forecast of 68 economists surveyed by Reuters was a reading of 55.5. Most activity measured by the index came from the dominant services sector. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. The employment component edged up to 50.4 from 49.5 in April, while the business activity component rose to 61.1 from 60.3. (Reporting by  Steven C. Johnson ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
