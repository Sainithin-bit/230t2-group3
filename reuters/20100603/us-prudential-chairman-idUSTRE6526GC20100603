 LONDON  (Reuters) - Prudential's ( PRU.L ) management team is under no pressure to step down over the British insurer's failed $35.5 billion bid to buy AIG's Asian life unit, Chairman Harvey McGrath said in an interview published on Friday. 

 Prudential's botched takeover effort has left its management open to criticism, with Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam and McGrath seen as having personally spearheaded the plan that would have made it Asia's largest foreign-owned insurer. McGrath told the Financial Times in an interview the majority of investors were supportive of him and Thiam. "The board is completely behind the management team. No one has offered to resign and no one has been asked to resign," McGrath said. "There are a couple of shareholders calling for change, but they are outliers. The vast majority of our biggest investors are saying they don't want to see change at the top." (Reporting by  Caroline Copley ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
