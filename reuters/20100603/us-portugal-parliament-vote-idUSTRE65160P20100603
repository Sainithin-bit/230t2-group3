 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal's parliament approved on Wednesday the general guidelines of an austerity package, delivering the government a victory in its drive to cut the budget deficit, as expected. 

 Parliament approved the austerity plan by the minority Socialist government thanks to the support of the opposition center-right Social Democrats, which had promised to back the legislation due to the euro zone debt crisis. The plan, announced on May 13, aims to speed up a reduction in Portugal's budget deficit to 7.3 percent of gross domestic product this year and 4.6 percent in 2011, down from 9.4 percent in 2009. It will raise income and value-added taxes and cut the wages of some top-paid civil servants. "These measures highlight structural reforms and the effort they significantly contribute to balancing the public accounts, promoting competitiveness and returning confidence and financial stability to markets," Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos told parliament ahead of the vote. A second round of voting on the plan, which now goes back to the commissions, is tentatively scheduled for next Wednesday. (Reporting by  Axel Bugge )
