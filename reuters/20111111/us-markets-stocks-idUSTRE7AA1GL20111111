 European stocks were up 0.6 percent in morning trade, led by shares in euro zone banks, such as BNP Paribas and UniCredit, rising on expectation political developments in Greece and Italy could pave the way for tough austerity measures seen as crucial to contain the euro zone's two-year-old debt crisis.

A Reuters poll found a forecast for a reading of 61.5 compared with 60.9 in the final October release. U.S. stocks bounced back on Thursday from the previous session's steep losses as investors latched onto positive corporate and economic news, in the absence of a clear worsening in Europe's debt crisis.
