 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama leaves on Friday for a 9-day Asia-Pacific tour aimed at deepening U.S. economic and security ties in the region, a top foreign policy goal of his administration. 
 Nervous about China's rising clout, U.S. allies such as Japan and South Korea will seek reassurances from Obama about America's staying power in the Pacific at a time of economic sluggishness and declining defense budgets. He will fly to his native city of Honolulu on Friday to host the two-day Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. Obama will hold several bilateral meetings on the sidelines of APEC, including one with Chinese President Hu Jintao on Saturday. On Tuesday, Obama will fly to Australia to highlight military ties with a staunch ally. He will visit Canberra, the Australian capital, and Darwin in the country's Northern Territory.
