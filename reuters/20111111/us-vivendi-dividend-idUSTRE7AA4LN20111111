 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's Vivendi will raise its dividend even as it acquires EMI's recorded music division, Vivendi's chief executive told a conference call on Friday. 
 "We are happy to confirm that we intend to increase our dividend," Jean-Bernard Levy said. "We are very confident that this transaction will be approved by regulators," he added. (Reporting By Lionel Laurent; Editing by Will Waterman)
