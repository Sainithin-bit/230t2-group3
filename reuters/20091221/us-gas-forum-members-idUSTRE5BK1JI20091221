 LONDON  (Reuters) - Cartel opponents Australia, Canada and the Netherlands are unlikely to join an OPEC-like gas group, despite Russian claims that they might. 

 Russian officials heading the GECF, whose 11 members control nearly three-quarters of the world's proven gas reserves, said last Tuesday the GECF could become a price-influencing group like OPEC. It said the Netherlands was in talks to participate, and that Canada and Australia could get involved later. The prospect of the Netherlands, the biggest gas producer in the European Union, or Canada -- the biggest supplier to the United States -- colluding with the Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) would startle consumers already concerned about prices and uncertain supply. But all three countries are long-standing proponents of free markets and opponents of supply controlling groups like Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries, so Russian claims they could join a group hoping to supporting fuel prices through collaboration seem hollow. "I think it's very unlikely...It would go counter to the prevailing ideology that they espouse," Paul Stevens, senior research fellow for energy at Chatham House in London said, adding the GECF would find it difficult to influence gas prices like OPEC does oil. "The whole concept is doubtful." Norway, which is Europe's second-biggest gas supplier, is an observer at GECF meetings, as it is with the oil exporters group OPEC. But it does not plan to collude with other suppliers to control supply at any time. "We are not interested in taking part in something like a gas-OPEC," a spokeswoman at Norway's Petroleum and Energy Ministry said. "We are of course monitoring what is happening and want to have a good dialogue with (other) gas producers." The Netherlands has also been granted "observer status" at GECF meetings. But a spokeswoman for the Dutch government said the country would stop participating if the loose grouping of gas exporters ever began to look like a cartel. As part of the OECD of wealthy industrialized countries, Canada, Australia, Norway and the Netherlands are members of the International Energy Agency (IEA) which strongly opposes any type of controls on production or pricing. "The IEA believes that a cartel is always bad news for consumers and consumer countries," the IEA says of plans for a "gas OPEC" on its website. "Cartels distort behavior and do not strengthen security of supply." NO GOPEC Canada is the world's second biggest gas exporter, behind Russia. But all its exports go to the United States by pipeline. Starving its powerful neighbor of fuel in a bid to push up prices would be unthinkable on both sides of the border and there would be no one else to sell its gas to either. Australia is also a committed disciple of free-markets and is highly unlikely to let any of its competitors in the emerging global market in liquefied natural gas (LNG) tell its private sector gas producers what to do with their reserves. Australia's vast potential resources and small population make it perhaps the biggest threat to the GECF countries already facing a huge supply glut that is expected to last for several years. The GECF -- Algeria, Bolivia, Equatorial Guinea, Egypt, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Russia, Trinidad and Tobago and Venezuela -- does not need the IEA countries on board to act like OPEC. But even if they were to join, the fragmented gas market is much more difficult influence, as most gas is delivered through pipelines on contracts lasting for decades, physically tying suppliers to their customers, while oil is more often sold globally to the highest bidder. "The gas market is not an international market, you have regional markets. So it might be feasible to talk about regional cooperation," Stevens said. "The problem is that a lot of the gas is already delivered on the basis of long term contracts."
