 (Reuters) - The fate of Swedish auto brand Saab hangs in the balance as a Monday evening deadline looms for General Motors (GM) to decide on a renewed bid from Dutch luxury carmaker Spyker. 

 Following are key events in Saab's history: 1946 - Svenska Aeroplan Aktiebolaget (SAAB), founded in Sweden in 1937 to produce high-performance aircraft, starts to produce cars. 1969 - Saab AB and truck manufacturer Scania-Vabis AB merge under the name Saab Scania AB. 1990 - The Saab car division is restructured into an independent company. Investor AB and GM each own 50 percent. 2000 - GM takes 100 percent ownership of Saab. January 11, 2009 - GM says it has been in talks to sell Saab. January 12 - Sweden says it will not take a stake in Saab or give more aid. February 20 - A Swedish court grants Saab protection from creditors as it tries to find a new partner and raise fresh funds. February 23 - Sweden says it can guarantee a European Investment Bank loan to Saab if a new owner emerges that can cover half the necessary financing. August 18 - Swedish sports carmaker Koenigsegg agrees to terms with GM on a deal to buy Saab. September 9 - Chinese state-run company Beijing Automotive Industry Holdings (BAIC) inks deal to take a minority stake in Koenigsegg as part of the deal to buy Saab. November 24 - Koenigsegg says it has pulled out of talks to buy Saab. Sweden effectively rules out a state bailout. November 25 - BAIC says it is reviewing its options. November 27 - GM says it is talking to possible buyers of Saab, four days before a GM board meeting considers whether to attempt to revive a sale process or eliminate the 60-year-old Swedish auto brand. November 30 - BAIC says might still be interested in buying Saab. December 1 - GM board says it will consider offers on the brand until the end of December and will then decide whether to close Saab if it appears the unit cannot be sold. December 3 - Saab has sold the production equipment for its old 9-5 sedan models to BAIC, Sweden's Ny Teknik newspaper reports. December 7 - GM in talks with BAIC about a partial sale of Saab assets, including tooling and technology. December 14 - BAIC says it has acquired some Saab assets, including intellectual property for the 9-5 and 9-3 sedan platforms and some equipment to produce the models. December 18 - GM says it will start an orderly wind-down of saab, saying the Spyker deal could not be completed in reasonable time. December 20 - Spyker submits a new, fast-track bid for Saab and, separately, GM says it will evaluate several new expressions of interest.
