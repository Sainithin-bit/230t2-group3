 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate's Republican leader on Tuesday spoke strongly against a Democratic financial regulation reform bill that will soon be introduced in the full Senate for formal debate and a vote. 

 "We must not pass the financial reform bill that's about to hit the floor. The fact is, this bill wouldn't solve the problems that led to the financial crisis. It would make them worse," said Senator Mitch McConnell in floor remarks. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
