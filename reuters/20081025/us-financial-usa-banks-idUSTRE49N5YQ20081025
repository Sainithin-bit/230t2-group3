 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government is expected to shortly announce a list of about 20 banks in the next round of companies receiving capital injections under a $700 billion rescue package, according to a source familiar with the U.S. Treasury Department's thinking. 

 The Treasury in recent days has detailed a plan to directly inject $250 billion of capital into U.S. banks in exchange for preferred shares. Nine of the largest U.S. banks were essentially arm-twisted last week into signing on for the first $125 billion in capital infusions. Neel Kashkari, Treasury's interim manager for the rescue program, told lawmakers on Thursday that more banks are expected to receive capital infusions within a few weeks, meaning that Treasury is expected to announce those banks in the coming days. The announcement of an additional 20 to 22 banks receiving capital is expected as soon as today, the source said. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
