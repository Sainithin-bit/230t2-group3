 (Reuters) - Following are some of the key priorities of G20 states attending a London summit Thursday. 

 ARGENTINA - Seeks more IMF voting power for emerging economies; fewer conditions and longer terms for IMF loans; increased effectiveness of IMF oversight mechanisms. AUSTRALIA - IMF resources should be at least doubled and China should get a more central role; G20 should play more prominent role in global affairs. BRAZIL - Seeks big increase in IMF funds and creation of $100 billion Fund credit line for international trade; rich nations should accept responsibility for bringing about the crisis; stronger voice for emerging economies; conclusion of Doha Round of trade talks. BRITAIN - Prime Minister Gordon Brown says summit must do "whatever is necessary to restore the world economy to the growth it needs"; priorities are reform of global banking system and creation of jobs. Wants G20 to reaffirm opposition to protectionism and clamp down on tax havens. CANADA - Seeks measures to restore global growth; commitment against protectionism; stronger banking regulation; boost to IMF resources. CHINA - Demands more IMF voting rights and firmer international financial regulation; last week it floated the idea of a new global reserve currency based on IMF special drawing rights, but this drew a cool response. EU - Favors more resources for IMF and more effective financial regulation; resistant to calls for new stimulus measures. FRANCE - With Germany, believes the need is not for more stimulus but tighter regulation, enshrined in a new global financial architecture; favors clamping down on hedge funds and tax havens. GERMANY - "All financial markets, products and participants, without exception" -- notably hedge funds -- should be subject to appropriate supervision or regulation; favors modified bank capital adequacy rules, reform of IMF. INDIA - With Brazil, Russia and China, wants more lending to emerging economies hit by collapse of private capital, and urgent reforms to improve their representation in IMF. Wants to implement confidence-building measures in world economy and discourage protectionism. INDONESIA - Wants G20 to state general principles on fiscal stimulus measures, with guidance on appropriate size in relation to GDP. Continues to demand a Global Expenditure Support Fund to help developing countries weather the crisis and continue to grow; wants to make IMF more representative of new world order. ITALY - Backs reform of global financial system and cooperation on regulation between the G8 (which it chairs) and G20. JAPAN - Says leaders should focus on saving the world economy rather than on longer-term efforts to improve financial regulation. "Although we are ready to discuss capital adequacy ratio regulations, we have to decide which problem has the priority," Finance Minister Kaoru Yosano said this month. MEXICO - Wants G20 to strengthen international financial organizations and bolster their support for emerging economies, and to coordinate fiscal measures against the global crisis. RUSSIA - Wants reform of IMF and World Bank; more say -- and more voting power -- for emerging economies SAUDI ARABIA - Seeks reform of IMF; any increased contributions must be matched by greater influence; wants to avoid the global crisis further undermining demand for oil. SOUTH AFRICA - Wants stronger role and better resources for IMF, World Bank and regional development banks. SOUTH KOREA - Wants stronger commitment against erecting trade barriers, and agreement on how much fiscal stimulus is needed to counter recession. TURKEY - Seeks stronger European commitment to stimulate economies; pledges to avoid protectionism; rich nations should deliver on aid promises. UNITED STATES - Seeks "robust approach" to stimulus measures, approach to dealing with toxic assets, agreement on regulatory reform to prevent repeat of crisis. Backs greater transparency by tax havens.
