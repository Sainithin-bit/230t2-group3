 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC has reached an agreement on a framework of a global alliance with Italian automaker Fiat SpA ( FIA.MI ) that has the support of the U.S. Treasury, Chrysler's CEO Bob Nardelli said on Monday. 

 "We appreciate the willingness of the (autos) Task Force, along with industry and financial experts, to consult closely with us in order to achieve this significant step," Nardelli said in a statement. Chrysler, owned by private equity Cerberus Capital Management, was deemed by the task force to be not viable as a stand-alone company and was given 30 days to complete an alliance with Fiat or be cut off from U.S. government funding. If Chrysler can complete an alliance with Fiat and cost-saving arrangements with creditors and its major union, the U.S. Treasury would consider investing up to another $6 billion. The boards of Chrysler and Fiat have given executives approval to complete an alliance that now hinges on the terms for additional aid for Chrysler, people with knowledge of the discussions have said. Nardelli said that Chrysler has had a series constructive discussions, including weekly face-to-face meetings with the U.S. auto task force. "I want to personally assure all of our customers, dealers, suppliers and employees that Chrysler will operate 'business as usual' over the next 30 days," he said.
