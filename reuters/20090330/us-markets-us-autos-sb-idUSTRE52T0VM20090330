 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures extended losses on Monday and U.S. Treasury futures climbed after a government task force rejected the viability plans of General Motors ( GM.N ) and Chrysler, saying bankruptcy for both companies remained an option. 

 The news spurred selling of stocks across Asian markets as investors shed riskier assets, cutting short a two-week rally. Futures on the S&P 500 were down 1.7 percent on the day, or 13.9 points, from Friday's close. Treasury 10-year futures extended gains to climb 14/32, while higher-yielding currencies fell against the yen. (Reporting by  Eric Burroughs ; Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
