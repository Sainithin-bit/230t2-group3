 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Defense Minister Franz Josef Jung said on Monday he was hopeful that countries would agree on what to do about the Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A400M military transport plane program in April. 

 "My hopes are that we can have clarity in April, but we have agreed on the three month period," Jung told reporters, referring to a three-month moratorium which aims to prevent individual nations walking away from the project. Seven countries -- Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Luxembourg and Turkey -- have ordered a total of 180 of the A400M planes and many have expressed anger over four-year delays in delivering the plane.
