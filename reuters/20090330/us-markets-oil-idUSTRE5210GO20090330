 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil dropped by more than 7 percent to below $49 a barrel on Monday, weighed down by the stronger U.S. dollar and weaker stock markets. 

 U.S. oil for May delivery settled at $48.41 a barrel, down $3.97. The contract fell $1.96 to settle at $52.38 a barrel on Friday, pulling back from Thursday's four-month high. London Brent crude settled $47.99 a barrel, down $3.99. "The weaker stock market, the stronger dollar -- those are the two main factors in crude's big fall today," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. The dollar rallied on Monday as fears of bankruptcy for U.S. automakers GM ( GM.N ) and Chrysler prompted anxious investors to seek safety in the U.S. currency. A White House task force rejected restructuring plans from the two automakers and instead forced out General Motors' chief executive and pushed Chrysler toward a merger. U.S. stocks dropped on the news of the Obama administration's rejection of GM and Chrysler's turnaround plans, dragging down oil prices further. Bank bailouts by three European governments also pressured stocks. WEAK GLOBAL ECONOMY Weakness in the global economy continued to be one of the underlying factors pressuring oil prices. Industrial output from Japan, the world's No. 3 energy consumer, fell by a greater-than-expected 9.4 percent in February, as weak demand weighed on the country's economy. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Sunday that unemployment rates were set to reach double digits in many developing and advanced countries. However, analysts said any signs the U.S. economy was stabilizing offered some underlying support for oil. U.S. President Barack Obama said in an interview published on Sunday he saw "glimmers of stabilization" in some areas of the U.S. economy, including pockets of the domestic housing market. Leaders of the Group of 20 developed and developing nations meet on April 2, with OPEC hoping it will agree on measures to shore up the global economy and bolster oil demand. Gulf OPEC producers see an oil price of about $50 a barrel as good enough given the global economic slowdown and the seasonal fall in fuel demand, a senior Gulf OPEC delegate said on Monday.
