 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Central bankers are becoming favorable toward introducing a simple leverage cap for banks to curb the excessive risk-taking that led to the financial crisis, a top banking supervisor said on Monday. 

 "We are changing our minds now," Nout Wellink, chairman of the Basel Committee of Banking Supervisors, said. "I am a convert and I would advise you to do the same," Wellink told the European Parliament's economic and monetary affairs committee. Such a cap could conflict with a more sophisticated risk-based approach to limiting leverage but it would be possible to find a balance between the two, Wellink said. The Basel Committee will come forward with such a proposal by the end of the year, said Wellink, who is also president of the Dutch central bank and a member of the European Central Bank's Governing Council. A summit of the G20 countries in London on Thursday is expected to back more stringent capital requirements for banks and put pressure on them to build reserves in good times to cushion downturns without resorting to taxpayer cash. Wellink backed the building of such reserves on top of more stringent day-to-day capital. "Our objective will be to arrive at a total level and quality of capital that is higher than the current ... frameworks and appropriate to promote the stability of the banking sector over the long run," Wellink said. "This effort will be phased in over a timeframe that will not aggravate the current stress," Wellink said. Giving greater clarity to the future shape of regulation will help restore near-term confidence and cut the risk of unfair competition, Wellink said. A bank's so-called Tier 1 core capital must be based on a clear, international definition that is transparent, Wellink said. He cautioned that the so-called Basel II globally agreed standards on bank capital that are now being reformed were a "living framework" that will adapt to changing circumstances.
