 (Reuters) - The largest 15 global banks are expected to further shrink their balance sheet by about $2 trillion in 2009 and longer-term return on equity (ROEs) will remain subdued for the next two years, Morgan Stanley and Oliver Wyman said in a joint report. 

 The balance sheet shrinkage will continue to have a huge impact on liquidity and provision of capital, hence it is critical confidence is restored soon, in particular to help real money investors buy credit assets, the analysts from both the firms wrote in a note to clients. A rebound in profit before provisions and markdowns is expected in 2009 and will be led by rates, foreign exchange, flow credit and commodities, even though the industry was likely to see "material" writedowns, the analysts said. Post markdowns, the analysts expect 2009 net revenue to be around the levels seen in 2003-2004, but said they were concerned that further to 2010 the revenue rebuild in 2009 is unlikely to have real momentum. "We anticipate some of the repricing will calm a little, the volatility markets will come off the record highs, some of the hedging in the credit markets will have played out and the equity markets will require more time to rebound," they said. The financial crisis has forced banks including Citigroup ( C.N ) to Bank of America ( BAC.N ), UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) and Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) to fire thousands of workers and take billions of dollars in government aid because of debt writedowns. Morgan Stanley, which has an "equal-weight" rating on Citigroup ( C.N ) stock, said it expects Citi to benefit more than peers if the environment improves, but added that the company has the largest legacy portfolio of risky assets in the brokerage's coverage group. For Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Morgan Stanley analysts see large consumer exposure, particularly from the Countrywide acquisition, where they estimate an additional $6 billion in credit costs over Bank of America's mark to market. The brokerage said its top European pick remained Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ) saying the bank has better potential for book value growth than the majority of banks under its coverage. Morgan Stanley also added Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) to its best ideas model portfolio and upgraded the stock to "overweight." The report predicts the revenue pool shifting back to United States in the near term helped by localization trends. The US will become a more important pool of revenue at the expense of Asia and the more leveraged emerging economies of Europe, the analysts wrote.
