 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The United States rejected rescue plans from General Motors and Chrysler and ousted GM's chief executive Rick Wagoner, rekindling concern the automakers could go bankrupt. 

 The following is a compilation of analyst notes and their initial reactions to the taskforce findings: JOHN MURPHY AND JOHN LOVALLO II, RESEARCH ANALYSTS AT BANK OF AMERICA/MERRILL LYNCH, NEW YORK (Incoming CEO Fritz) Henderson may take a more hard line approach with stake holders, (but) we don't believe the change will provide a quick fix for the huge structural problems plaguing GM. These will likely only be solved by a bankruptcy judge and new management perspective such as that of (Ford CEO) Alan Mulally. Specifically, the debt burden including commitments to labor is about $62 billion, which in the most optimistic cram-down scenario would be reduced to about $33 billion. However, the government loans GM has already received plus those requested would bring the total debt burden to at least $65 billion. Yes, that is more than GM initially had before requesting government aid, and if the cram-down is not successful total debt could approach $100 billion. This is the major reason we believe that (Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection) is the likely outcome for GM despite the best efforts of the Auto Task Force to avoid court. ROD LACHE, RESEARCH ANALYST AT DEUTSCHE BANK, NEW YORK Auto and auto parts stocks have outperformed over the past two weeks, as investors have begun to conclude that the Administration will seek to avoid the bankruptcy process. But expectations of additional support have also had negative consequences, such as reducing pressure on creditors to agree to concessions, despite continued investor skepticism surrounding GM's...ability to support even the reorganized cost and liability structures. We believe that the U.S. Auto task force understands the dynamic that's taking place amongst various stakeholders, and that they will attempt to reassert the view that: 1) dramatic change needs to happen quickly, and; 2) there are negative consequences from failure. JEREMY ANWYL, CEO, EDMUNDS.COM, DETROIT In the end, this is less of an indictment of Rick's tenure as CEO and more about the political need for a scapegoat before unpopular loans could be offered. NAGAYUKI YAMAGISHI, STRATEGIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ SECURITIES, TOKYO First, this is just a suggestion, and nothing concrete has been decided about whether GM will actually be forced into bankruptcy. Mainly this came at a bad time for the Japanese market, which rose so sharply last week, providing investors with a good chance to take profits. Banks fell as well on worry about the overall impact of a possible GM failure. DAVID SPRY, RESEARCH MANAGER, F.W. HOLST, SYDNEY Anything that spells of rejection in terms of bailout these days is not treated very well. We've seen threats of this before on other things, and it tends to spook the market a bit. CHO SOO-HONG, ANALYST AT HYUNDAI SECURITIES, SEOUL Despite the rejection, it's unlikely the U.S. government will let carmakers go bankrupt. Authorities will try to get more out of the automakers' restructuring plans and from the unions. In the end, it is still likely they will come up with a support plan. Struggles in the U.S. attempts to save their carmakers will put Asian makers in a relatively better position. But even if Asian makers can increase their market shares, a recovery in car demand is difficult to forecast given the current economic conditions and high jobless rates.
