 (Reuters) - General Motors Corp CEO Wagoner is to be replaced, at least on interim basis, by chief operating officer Fritz Henderson, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

 Wagoner was asked to step down on Friday by Steven Rattner, according to the Journal. It is unlikely the auto team would push for the removal of Chrysler Chief Executive Robert Nardelli, the paper is reporting, citing an administration official.
