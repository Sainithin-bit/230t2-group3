 (Reuters) - The U.S. taskforce overseeing the restructuring of the auto industry on Monday said the plans submitted by General Motors Corp and Chrysler failed to show how they could be viable, a stunning reversal for management at both automakers and for GM investors and creditors who had bet on a softer line. 

 Asian shares and U.S. stock futures fell while safe-haven U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen gained after news. The following are analysts' initial reactions to the taskforce findings: NAGAYUKI YAMAGISHI, STRATEGIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ SECURITIES, TOKYO "First, this is just a suggestion, and nothing concrete has been decided about whether GM will actually be forced into bankruptcy. "Mainly this came at a bad time for the Japanese market, which rose so sharply last week, providing investors with a good chance to take profits. "Banks fell as well on worry about the overall impact of a possible GM failure." DAVID SPRY, RESEARCH MANAGER, F.W. HOLST, SYDNEY "Anything that spells of rejection in terms of bailout these days is not treated very well. We've seen threats of this before on other things, and it tends to spook the market a bit." CHO SOO-HONG, ANALYST AT HYUNDAI SECURITIES, SEOUL "Despite the rejection, it's unlikely the U.S. government will let carmakers go bankrupt. Authorities will try to get more out of the automakers' restructuring plans and from the unions. In the end, it is still likely they will come up with a support plan. "Struggles in the U.S. attempts to save their carmakers will put Asian makers in a relatively better position. But even if Asian makers can increase their market shares, a recovery in car demand is difficult to forecast given the current economic conditions and high jobless rates." STEPHEN ROBERTS, ECONOMIST, NOMURA, SYDNEY "This kind of news always leads to a spike in risk aversion and consequently the Aussie (dollar) tends to get sold off. Also, we are coming to the end of the month and since we have had a big rally in the Aussie, a lot of fund managers would like to lock into profits. "We are still not out of the woods as far as the economic landscape goes. Job losses are mounting in the U.S. and I feel the developments of late represent the economy is just coming off the bottom."
