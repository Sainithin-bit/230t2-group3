 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankruptcy risk for all three U.S. automakers remains high after the government forced the ouster of General Motors Corp's chief executive as part of a new rescue plan, Standard & Poor's lead auto analyst said on Monday. 

 "Given where the industry is, these highly unprecedented actions are consistent with the unprecedented times we're in," S&P's Robert Schulz said in an interview. "We think the bankruptcy risk is high and remains high, for Ford, GM and Chrysler." (Reporting by  Walden Siew ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
