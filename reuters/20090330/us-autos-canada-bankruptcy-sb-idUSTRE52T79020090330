 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian government joined the tough talk from the Obama administration about the auto industry on Monday, saying no automaker is too big to fail and warning unions that bankruptcy protection might force them to make more concessions. 

 Industry Minister Tony Clement said President Barack Obama had shifted the goal posts in the negotiations with General Motors Corp and Chrysler LLC and made more sacrifices necessary in Canada. "The old rulebook is thrown out the window. I don't think anything is too big to fail, but we're going to give it our best shot at having a restructured auto sector and this is all part of it," Clement told CBC television.
