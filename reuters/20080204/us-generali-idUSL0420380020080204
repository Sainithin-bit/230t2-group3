 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italy's biggest insurer Generali ( GASI.MI ) has defended its interest in acquisitions in the United States after criticism from a shareholder fund over its policy and governance. 

 Generali, responding in a letter to Franklin Mutual Advisers, said: "From a tactical perspective, we have ... identified the United States as a potential area of interest in light of current currency and market conditions". The remarks were made available on Monday. The letter, from co-Chief Executive Giovanni Perissinotto, added: "Any potential new undertakings will not detract from our pursuit of ... objectives." Franklin Mutual Advisers, a subsidiary of Franklin Templeton, wrote to Generali last month saying it agreed with the sentiments of fund Algebris, which criticized the insurer in October 2007, the Financial Times had reported. Franklin had also commented on Generali's "well-documented deficiencies in corporate governance and management compensation matters", the newspaper quoted the letter as saying. The newspaper said Franklin holds 0.3 percent of Generali. Franklin's letter said acquisitions in English-speaking markets "could only undermine the company's efforts to institute operational improvements which ... are crucial to ... maintaining and enhancing its position in its core markets", the Financial Times reported. Generali has made no secret of its interest in the United States for niche markets. Last week Perissinotto's peer, Sergio Balbinot, said the insurer was "following (the U.S. market) with a selective approach to specialized segments". On Monday, Generali said "in some fast-growing specialist business areas (the United States) could still provide the potential to create value. Clearly, management should not ignore any such opportunities if they exist". The Italian insurer is interested in acquiring a firm active in the "third life" sector in the United States, say analysts, offering investment products to senior citizens, which has become a fast-growing and lucrative niche to the main life and pensions market. GOVERNANCE GRIPES Generali also stood by its governance structure, which unusually among Europe's biggest insurers has an executive chairman and two co-CEOs. "While our (governance) structure remains somewhat different from other organizations ... we think it provides us with an effective way to manage our organization," the letter to Franklin said. Franklin's letter referred to "the company's well-documented deficiencies in corporate governance and management compensation matters", according to the Financial Times. Franklin in London could not immediately be reached for comment. Algebris had said Generali should have a non-executive chairman and added that chairman Antoine Bernheim's age, 83, was a hindrance to setting long-term strategy. Bernheim has the backing of Generali's board and his mandate, which was renewed last year, runs until 2010. He has vowed to stay. Algebris's criticism triggered speculation of a shake-up at Generali, which initially spurred the shares higher. Since then, its stock has lost about 7.6 percent but has outperformed the DJ Stoxx index of European insurers .SXIP by about 11 percent. Generali shares were trading up about 1.23 percent to 28.73 euros by 3:08 a.m. EST as other European insurers gained 0.85 percent. Generali shares have outperformed its sector rivals by around 18 percent since the beginning of October, partly on hopes of a shake-up and partly on a perception it has less exposure to the subprime crisis than other insurers.
