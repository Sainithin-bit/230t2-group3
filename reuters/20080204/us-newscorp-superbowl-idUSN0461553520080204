 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - News Corp's NWSa.N Fox network generated about $250 million from Super Bowl television advertising revenue, Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch said. 

 "The $250 million yesterday, that was for the television network from when we started up in the morning until we closed up the house in the evening," Murdoch said. He described the proceeds from the February 4 football game as "the biggest day in our company's history." (Reporting by  Gina Keating ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
