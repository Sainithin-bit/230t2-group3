 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Well before he engineered Beijing's biggest overseas investment as the head of Aluminum Corp of China (Chinalco), Xiao Yaqing showed a competitive drive that was nearly unrivalled among state-owned enterprises. 

 After taking the helm in 2004, Xiao embarked on an expansion drive to use Chinalco's position as the chief alumina importer to become the country's dominant aluminum producer, piling price pressure on smaller rivals that it hoped to buy. Analysts gave that effort mixed reviews -- while Chinalco strengthened its domestic position, his tactics also led to the creation of a host of independent companies making the raw material alumina, undercutting Chinalco's pricing power. They're less divided about his biggest and boldest move, the purchase of 12 percent of Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) together with former partner Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) for $14 billion. With one deft move Xiao has taken a big step toward realizing his vision of a "multi-national, multi-metals" conglomerate, while also throwing a spanner into BHP Billiton's ( BLT.L )( BHP.AX ) efforts to buy Rio Tinto, a consolidation of raw material production that Beijing fears could inflate costs. The question now is whether Friday's move -- his second strategic initiative in four years -- is an end in itself or a stepping stone. Xiao, 49, is playing it close. "We are happy with our 12 percent stake," the tall, thin Xiao said in Sydney on Monday. Even among his peers, the first generation of Chinese business leaders to be educated after the Cultural Revolution, Xiao was known as ambitious and ruthless, and made little secret of his big aims for the company. As recently as October, Xiao conceded there were three big obstacles to his plan: "Copper will be hard for us, because BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and Anglo American are already there." Less than a month later, BHP made a surprise proposal to take over Rio Tinto in a 3-for-1 all-share deal that Rio said was too low. If successful, the merged company would dwarf Chinalco and its listed unit Chalco ( 2600.HK )( 601600.SS )( ACH.N ), which last year produced 12 percent of the world's alumina and a tenth of its aluminum. But under Xiao, the company has made clear it wants to tap into faster-growing areas of the industry. "If you are only focused on aluminum, there's not much room to develop," said Yang Changhua, copper analyst for Beijing-based consultancy Antaike. A combined BHP-Rio would control 13.5 percent of the world's copper concentrate market plus a quarter of the world's bauxite, the raw material for alumina. Chinalco, with profits last year of about $2.8 billion, is punching above its weight. Rio is expected to book $7.13 billion in full-year profit and BHP $14.5 billion.  When Xiao made his countermove last week, the Chinese metal industry cheered. "I think it's absolutely beautiful," said Li Xinchuang, the head of an industry research group and an outspoken champion for the consolidation of China's steel mills into internationally competitive giants. AMBITION When Xiao began college in 1978, he was among the gifted crop of students first to return to school after the devastating Cultural Revolution, when universities were closed and intellectuals purged. After graduation from Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy in Changsha, Hunan Province, he was assigned to Northeast Light aluminum Co. He rose through the ranks over the next 17 years, from engineer to general manager, before transferring to Southwest aluminum Group as chairman and CEO. Savvy and intense, Xiao oversaw Southwest Aluminium's restructuring and integration into Chinalco. Four years later, in 2004, he became Chinalco's party boss, chairman and CEO, and the head of its listed arm, Chalco. Where other Chinese executives have only moved slowly to meet stricter environmental standards, Xiao speaks at length of the long-term cost savings to Chinalco of installing equipment that saves water and reduces emissions. But his environmental advocacy also has a competitive edge -- Chinalco is responsible for setting emissions standards for its rivals in the aluminum business. Success at leveraging Chinalco into a true multinational might help further future prospects for Xiao, who is already an alternate member of the Communist Party's elite Central Committee. "He might be best placed for now to remain in a corporate setting. He has already proven himself in the competitive business environment, whereas government officials tend to be insulated from commercial pressure," Li said. (Editing by  Jonathan Leff )
