 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) is still receiving parts from Plastech Engineered Products Inc, which has filed for bankruptcy court protection, a Ford spokesman said on Monday. 

 "We're working with Plastech to make sure that we have continuity of parts and components to keep our factories operating," Ford spokesman Todd Nissen said. "We've not had any production disruptions and don't expect any." Chrysler LLC has closed four of its U.S. plants due to a dispute with Plastech. The supplier makes a number of different parts for Ford, its largest customer, including plastic interior and exterior parts for such vehicles as the Ford F-150 pickup truck and the Ford Edge crossover vehicle.
