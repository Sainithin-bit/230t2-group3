 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) on Monday said sales rose 3.8 percent in January at stores open at least a year, as the drugstore chain filled more prescriptions. 

 Walgreen, one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, said same-store pharmacy sales were up 4.2 percent, while sales of general merchandise, or "front end" sales, rose 3.1 percent on a same-store basis. Introductions of generic drugs in the past year cut 4.2 percentage points off same-store pharmacy sales growth, Walgreen said. While generic drugs are typically more profitable for pharmacies, the lower price on the drugs cuts into sales. Cough and cold product sales continued to be weak due to a mild flu season, though there was some improvement over December, Walgreen said, The mild flu season was one reason drugstore chains cited for weak December sales, along with sluggish sales of seasonal items. Walgreen shares closed at $36.32 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 4.6 percent this year, compared with rival CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ), which is nearly unchanged.
