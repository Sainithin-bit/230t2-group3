 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks hit a 2-1/2 week high on Monday and the low-yielding yen slipped as last week's news of major company deals eased concerns that the credit crisis might be hurting corporate and economic activity. 

 Wall Street showed its best weekly performance in almost five years last week and looks set to extend gains later on Monday. Investor optimism has grown since Friday's news that China teamed up with U.S. aluminum producer Alcoa ( AA.N ) to buy a $14 billion stake in Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) and a move by Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) to bid $44.6 billion for Yahoo ( YHOO.O ). "With a decent equity rally... in general it's a broadly risk positive story that we're seeing," said Adrian Schmidt, analyst at RBS Global Banking. The FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 0.8 percent on the day while the MSCI main world equity index was up 0.7 percent, hitting highs last seen in mid-January. S&P futures were up slightly on the day, indicating a firmer start on Wall Street later. The credit crisis, which started in earnest in August, has raised the cost of credit and prompted the Federal Reserve to cut U.S. interest rates several times, including an emergency 75 basis point rate cut in January. The yen, which tends to outperforms in times of greater risk aversion, fell 0.4 percent against the euro to 158.37. It also lost 0.2 percent against the dollar to 106.88. The Australian dollar hit a three-month high against the U.S. currency before Australia's expected increase in benchmark interest rates to an 11-year peak of 7.0 percent this week. US RECESSION RISKS In a sign that investor mood is certainly improving, the interest rate markets have pushed back the chance that the Fed will cut interest rates again by 50 basis points in March to 58 percent, compared with around 90 percent last week. "The market continues to behave broadly as if it is backing off from extreme recession pricing in U.S. assets and trading alongside," Goldman Sachs said in a note to clients. Goldman expects negative U.S. economic growth in the first two quarters of this year, before experiencing a renewed slowdown in 2009. Emerging stocks and Asian stocks were both up more than 2 percent. Emerging sovereign spreads tightened 3 basis points. The March Bund future was down 27 ticks. U.S. light crude oil fell 0.6 percent to $88.42 a barrel as U.S. recession concerns persisted. Gold fell to $902 an ounce after hitting record highs on Friday, while platinum jumped to all-time highs of $1,788.00 an ounce.
