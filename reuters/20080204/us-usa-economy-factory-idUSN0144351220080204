 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at U.S. factories rose a less-than-expected 2.3 percent in December, the steepest gain since July, on strong aircraft sales, a government report showed on Monday. 

 Orders for durable goods, items intended to last three years or longer, jumped 5 percent, also the biggest gain since July, as civilian aircraft orders climbed 11.7 percent, the Commerce Department said. Durables orders were revised down from the 5.2 percent gain originally reported last week. When transportation was stripped out, orders rose a more modest 0.7 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 2.5 percent gain in factory orders and a 5 percent rise in durable goods orders. Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, considered a gauge of business spending, climbed 4.5 percent, the largest increase since March. That was greater than the 4.4 percent rise previously reported. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal , Editing by Andrea Ricci)
