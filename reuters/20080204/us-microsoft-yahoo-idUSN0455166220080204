 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Monday its $44.6 billion unsolicited offer for Yahoo Inc was priced to make it easy for the company to accept, and it expects Yahoo's board and shareholders to agree to the buyout quickly. 

 "We think it's a generous one," Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a presentation to investors. "We trust the Yahoo board and the Yahoo shareholders will join with us quickly in deciding to move down an integrated path."
