 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp may borrow for the first time in its history to fund a portion of its $44.6 billion cash and stock offer for Yahoo Inc, its chief financial officer said on Monday. 

 "If you look at the cash component, that's going to be over $20 billion in cash," CFO Chris Liddell said in an investor presentation. "We could fund most of that through our cash holdings, but it's likely we're actually going to borrow for the first time." "It's going to be a mixture of the cash we have on hand plus debt," he said.
