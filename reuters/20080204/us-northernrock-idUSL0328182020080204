 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investment firm Olivant quit the race to rescue ailing British bank Northern Rock Plc NRK.L on Monday to leave just two suitors in the running -- Richard Branson's Virgin Group and an "in-house" management team. 

 In a dramatic one-hour period after a government-set deadline late on Monday, Olivant exited the high-profile battle, Virgin VA.UL said it would stay in, and Northern Rock pitched its proposal to be considered alongside the external bidder. Olivant's departure raised the risk that the government would decide that none of the proposals met its requirements to repay about 25 billion pounds ($49.4 billion) of taxpayer loans and that the bank would be temporarily nationalized. The government is eager to pick a private sector rescuer. The crisis, which four months ago sparked the first run on the deposits of a major British bank for over 140 years, has contributed to a slump in Prime Minister Gordon Brown's popularity and threatens to remain a thorn in his side. Northern Rock's second-biggest shareholder told Reuters it supports the "in-house" proposal over Virgin's. Hedge fund RAB Capital, with a stake of just under 8 percent, said the management team should assume it has RAB's support for a planned rights issue of at least 500 million pounds. But although shareholders may get a say in the outcome, the final decision is likely to rest with Brown and his government. Luqman Arnold, head of Olivant and former Abbey CEO, said he had been unable to make an offer that met his investment criteria and also a government-backed financing plan and the interests of other stakeholders. Northern Rock's shares turned sharply lower after the news of Olivant's withdrawal. The shares closed down 8 percent at 88 pence, having been up over 10 percent earlier in the day, valuing the bank's equity at just over 370 million pounds. BROWN'S DILEMMA No surprise bidders made late offers, people familiar with the situation said, leaving just Virgin and the in-house team. Virgin said it would inject 1.25 billion pounds of fresh equity capital into Northern Rock, Britain's fifth biggest mortgage lender. Its proposal includes merging Virgin Money, valued at 250 million pounds, with the bank, and raising 500 million in a rights issue at 25p per share. Existing investors would receive rights for 4.7 new shares for each one owned. Virgin would provide the remaining 500 million pounds and rebrand the enlarged business Virgin Bank. It has an experienced finance director lined up to work with its planned Chief Executive Officer Jayne-Anne Gadhia, it said. Virgin would provide the government with a warrant over part of the bank's share capital to take the sting out of accusations that it could make a hefty profit while taxpayers were providing the near-term financing. Northern Rock said its plan to raise new equity and rebuild the bank would be led by ex-insurance executive Paul Thompson, who would shrink its assets and reorganize its operations to "a significantly lower risk mortgage and savings bank." It would repay the government loan in full, embarking on a "phase 2" plan of modest growth. All of the bank's suitors had been expected to pursue low-risk strategies that would see them shrink Northern Rock's mortgage book to give it a more stable footing. Any more aggressive plans to compete for new lending would likely be on hold until the government loan was paid off, to ensure that European regulators would not block a government-backed funding package. Rival lenders are watching to ensure that Northern Rock does not gain a competitive financing advantage from the government's guarantee. Virgin has been reported to be the government's preferred choice, as it offers the cleanest break from the crisis. But Virgin had been reluctant to sweeten its offer to make it less dilutive to win the support of the bank's top two shareholders, RAB and SRM, another hedge fund, a person familiar with the situation said. It plans to take a 55 percent stake. The government needs to choose which is the best option for the bank's future as well as for British taxpayers. It could still opt for a nationalization should none of the offers stack up. The government could take until the end of the month to choose its preferred offer. It needs approval from the European Commission by March 17, the cut-off date for the current emergency funding. The final decision is likely to rest with Brown. The government has been criticized over its handling of the crisis since the bank was forced to seek emergency loans from the Bank of England in mid-September, after a global credit crisis caused its business model to collapse. A spokesman for Brown said the decision on the rescue rests with the Treasury, in consultation with the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and Northern Rock's board. The government is guaranteeing financing being made available to all bidders, meaning the bank's fortunes will be tied to the state for several years. Virgin is headed by Branson, one of the world's highest-profile businessmen and estimated to be Britain's 11th richest person, with a 3.1 billion pound fortune. The consortium also includes buyout firm WL Ross, investment group Toscafund and Hong Kong-based investment group First Eastern.
