 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.N is set to propose 
to its management and regulators that it be allowed to create 
and sell bonds backed by multifamily mortgages, a move that 
would help it expand into apartment financing, The Wall Street 
Journal reported on Monday. 

  The report said the second-largest U.S. provider of home 
loan financing, under the proposal, would buy mortgages secured 
by apartment units from a network of lenders, and sell them as 
loans or securities backed by those loans.  The proposal must be approved by senior management and its 
regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, 
it said.  The company was not immediately available for comment.
