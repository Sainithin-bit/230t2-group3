 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A bankruptcy court judge set a hearing 
date on Monday of February 13 to weigh arguments between 
Chrysler LLC and one of its suppliers, Plastech Engineered 
Products Inc, in a dispute that has already led the automaker 
to close four assembly plants. 

  Judge Phillip Shefferly of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the 
Eastern District of Michigan in downtown Detroit set a deadline 
of February 11 for all parties to file their pleadings in the 
dispute. The judge said he has set aside time to hear arguments 
on February 13 and 14.  Chrysler, which terminated its contracts with Plastech, 
wants the court to allow it to take control of tooling 
equipment it tried to seize on Friday before Plastech filed for 
bankruptcy protection to stop the automaker.  Chrysler said in court filings and in an official statement 
that it already has closed four assembly plants and the rest of 
its operations could quickly grind to a halt if it does not get 
that equipment to other suppliers.  Plastech said in court documents that many of the moldings 
Chrysler wants to take are attached to entire assembly lines 
used to build parts for other customers.  (Reporting by  Nick Carey , writing by Ben Klayman; Editing
