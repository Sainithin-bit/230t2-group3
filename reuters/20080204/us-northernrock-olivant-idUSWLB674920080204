 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investment firm Olivant quit the race to rescue ailing British bank Northern Rock NRK.L on Monday, saying it was unable to put together a proposal that met its investment criteria and that of other stakeholders. 

 Former investment banker Luqman Arnold, head of Olivant, said in a statement: "Despite working intensively, we have been unable to formulate a value creation proposal which meets our investment criteria whilst also respecting HM Government's proposed financing terms and the interests of other stakeholders in the company." Olivant's withdrawal leaves billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Group VA.UL and an "in-house" management team as the only suitors expected to submit proposals by today's government set deadline.
