 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) said group vehicle sales fell 22 percent to 16,935 in the United States in January but said it expected retail sales there to rise slightly in 2008 compared to last year. 

 "Sales were impacted by lower than normal inventory levels due to a very strong retail performance in December and high demand for all-wheel drive models," BMW of North America said in a statement on Monday. BMW brand sales were down 26.7 percent to 14,475 vehicles, compared to 19,761 vehicles sold during January 2007, BMW added. The Mini brand reported a 20 percent increase in January sales to 2,460 cars in the U.S., compared to 2,050 cars sold in the same period a year ago, the carmaker said.
