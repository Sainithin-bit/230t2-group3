 LONDON  (Reuters) - Crude oil shipments from Libya, the world's 12th-largest exporter, have almost halted because of reduced production, a lack of staff at ports and security concerns, industry sources said. 

 A violent uprising against leader Muammar Gaddafi's 41-year rule has deterred some shippers from sailing to Libya, with some vessels refusing to dock at Libyan ports or turning back en route. Bad weather in the Mediterranean has also disrupted operations, the sources said. "It is a combination of disruptions and bad weather," said an oil trader with an oil company that buys Libyan oil. The turmoil in Libya and the prospect of the loss of its 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil exports have sent oil prices soaring. Brent crude rose to almost $120 a barrel on Thursday, the highest since 2008. "The captain of the tanker we chartered refused to go to Libya," said a source with a major oil company. "He said he was concerned about the security of the port." "You can't get into those ports. There is zero communication," said another buyer of Libyan crude. "We've heard reports of vessels turning around." Libya exports crude from ports and terminals including Ras Lanuf, Zuetina, Marsa el Hariga, Brega, Bouri, Es Sider, Zawia and Mellitah. Industry sources said on Friday that the Es Sider terminal was in operation and some sources said that the Zawia terminal and Mellitah were operating, but closed due to the weather. Libya normally produces about 1.6 million bpd of high-quality oil, or almost 2 percent of world output. Between 30 percent and 75 percent of output has been shut down due to the turmoil in the country.
