 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German government expressed doubts on Friday whether a U.S. decision to award a multi-billion dollar contract for refueling planes to EADS rival Boeing was fair. 

 "The decision leaves a bitter aftertaste because it is not entirely clear whether there was a fair procedure at the third tender," Deputy Economy Minister Peter Hintze told Reuters. (Reporter: Gernot Heller; Writing by Soeren Amelang)
