 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing has won a fiercely contested contract to supply air-to-air refueling tankers to the U.S. Air Force, in a defeat for Airbus parent EADS. 

 Here are some highlights of the winning and losing offers. WINNER Boeing said its KC-46A tanker would support 50,000 total U.S. jobs with Boeing and 800 suppliers in more than 40 states. An initial development contract worth $3.5 billion calls for 18 tankers by 2017. But barring an unexpected reversal this is expected to lead to a production contract for more planes bringing the total to 179, worth more than $30 billion. Boeing had offered the Air Force an updated 767-based "NewGen" tanker with a digital flight deck from its 787 Dreamliner and a new fly-by-wire refueling boom. It has said the new twin-engined tanker would burn 24 percent less fuel than the Airbus A330-based tanker. Analysts say the 767, about 159 feet long with a wingspan of 156 feet, should be cheaper to build than the larger A330. It is expected to have Pratt & Whitney engines. In the last competition, Boeing's 767 tanker would have carried 190 passengers and 19 pallets of cargo. The maximum fuel capacity would have been over 202,000 pounds, compared to around 250,000 pounds for the A330. Boeing plans to build its 767 airplanes in Everett, Washington and modify them for military use in Wichita, Kansas. An earlier design of 767 tanker was ordered by Italy and Japan. Japan has received all four of its Boeing tankers and they are in operational use. The Italian tankers were delayed for several years after running into problems with wing "flutter" and integration of the hose and drogue refueling pods. LOSER Europe's EADS had offered a tanker plane based on the two-engined Airbus A330-200, which is larger than the 767. EADS said the plane is a version of the "KC-45" platform with which it won a previous competition together with Northrop Grumman in 2008. That award was thrown out on appeal from Boeing and Northrop pulled out of the current rematch. The KC-45 was EADS's name for a proposed U.S. military version of the A330-based MRTT, or Multi Role Tanker Transport. A total of 28 such tankers have been ordered by Australia, the UAE, Britain and Saudi Arabia. Delivery of the first Australian tanker has been delayed to later this year. EADS says the plane's fly-by-wire refueling boom system has a fuel offload rate of 1,200 U.S. gallons per minute. Part of the boom on a plane being developed for Australia was lost in mid-air during testing in January. The Airbus plane has a wingspan of just under 198 feet and is almost 193 feet long. It would have had engines from General Electric. EADS had promised to build the plane in Alabama. (Compiled by Andrea Shalal-Esa, Tim Hepher)
