 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Swedish truck maker Scania on Friday stood by its rejection of German rival MAN's hostile bid, as it raised the prospect of further extra shareholder payouts and warned of job losses in Sweden. 

 Scania's second rejection of the 10.3 billion euro ($13.4 billion) offer was the latest salvo in a long war of words between the Swedish company, backed by key shareholder Investor , and its unwelcome suitor. Scania rejected the bid when it was first announced in October. This second rejection comes after MAN released its formal offer document and prospectus last week. "The board confirms that it continues to unanimously recommend Scania shareholders not to accept the offer ... The board of Scania is of the firm view that the offer from MAN substantially undervalues Scania," it said in a statement. Scania in October said it would be able to make a payout to shareholders of 35 crowns a share this year. On Friday, it said it also saw scope for an additional payment in 2007. "Scania's management is of the opinion that the company would be in the position to distribute an additional amount of up to SEK 10 billion ($1.4 billion) (including ordinary dividend), equivalent to SEK 50 per share," Scania said. MAN responded to Scania's fresh rebuttal by saying it was continuing talks with the Swedish firm. Investor and Scania have said they are in contact with MAN but have offered no details. "We don't think this is good," a MAN spokesman said of Scania's planned extra payout. "The money should rather be invested in the company's growth. This (MAN's bid) would also be more sustainable for the shareholders," he added, saying the bid was very good and fair. Major Scania shareholder Investor, the Wallenberg family vehicle that has also rejected MAN's offer, backed the dividend. "Capital structure is an important factor to create value and we believe that the companies in our portfolio should have as effective capital structures as possible," Investor spokesman Fredrik Lindgren said. "This is a good way to do it and we welcome Scania's suggestion for an extra dividend." Volkswagen, which holds stakes in both MAN and Scania, had no immediate comment. NOT A NECESSITY Scania shares closed up 2.15 percent at 475 crowns, while MAN shares were down 2.18 percent at 69.94 euros. When asked about concerns the dividend could hurt Scania's standing with ratings agencies, spokeswoman Cecilia Edstrom said Scania could accept a "somewhat" downgraded rating, although this may push up borrowing costs in future. She said the dividends are part of Scania's defense. "It's important that our shareholders get a clear view of what the share is worth, and by making these dividends they get a better opportunity to make up their minds," Edstrom added. A merged MAN-Scania would become the European truck leader, better able to compete with global giants such as DaimlerChrysler and Volvo due to scale advantages in purchasing, spare parts distribution, customer finance and service networks. Scania said a merger could yield possible long-term synergies but only if carefully executed and managed. "However, short-term these synergies may be widely overstated," it added. "To Scania, consolidation is an opportunity, not a necessity, and the current offer substantially undervalues Scania," said board spokesperson Peggy Bruzelius. The Swedish firm also reiterated its view that, because of strong guarantees for workers in deals between MAN and German unions, any job cutbacks would fall heavily in Sweden. MAN on Thursday dismissed the idea of any reductions in production staff at Swedish sites. Ultimately the deal will come down to the support, or lack thereof, from Scania's two largest shareholders, Volkswagen and the Wallenberg family. VW supports the tie-up in principle but has left all options open in case MAN and Scania cannot agree on terms.
