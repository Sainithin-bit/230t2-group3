 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - The pension fund for Ontario's teachers said on Thursday it will buy four North American marine container terminals from Orient Overseas (International) Ltd. ( 0316.HK ) for $2.4 billion. 

 The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan said it is the sole purchaser of New York Container Terminal on Staten Island in New York City, the Global Terminal and Container Systems, Inc in Bayonne, New Jersey, and TSI Terminal Systems Inc., which operates the Deltaport and Vanterm facilities in Vancouver. Vancouver is Canada's largest port. Trading in Orient's shares had been halted on Wednesday amid speculation about the pending sale of the Hong Kong firm's North American operations, although the Ontario group was not listed among the likely buyers in media reports. Orient Overseas had said that it wanted to sell the terminals to reinvest the money in its shipping business. It had announced in October that it would buy four container ships for $477 million. The pension plan said the terminals had combined annual sales of about $500 million. They will be included in the fund's infrastructure and timber portfolio, which will have assets of about $6.5 billion with this acquisition. Container freight rates have gradually recovered from the lows of earlier in the year, but there are concerns that looming overcapacity and slower economic growth in the United States and elsewhere will continue to put pressure on the shipping industry. The fund, one of Canada's largest, with assets of about $84 billion, administers the pensions of 163,000 elementary and secondary school teachers and 101,000 retired teachers in the Canadian province of Ontario. The deal is subject to regulatory approval in both the United States and Canada. ($1=$1.14 Canadian)
