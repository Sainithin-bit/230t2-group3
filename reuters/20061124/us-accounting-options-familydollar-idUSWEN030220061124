 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Family Dollar Stores Inc. ( FDO.N ) said on Friday that it would be unable to file its annual report for 2006 by the November 24 extended due date, citing an ongoing investigation of its stock option granting practices. 

 The company is a defendant in a lawsuit alleging that some of its stock option grants were backdated, and a special board committee has not completed its review, Family Dollar said in a statement.
