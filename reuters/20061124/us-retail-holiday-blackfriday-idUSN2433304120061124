 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - This year's "Black Friday" could be the strongest opening to the holiday shopping season in years if the droves of Americans eager to exploit early-bird specials are any guide. 

 Terry Lundgren, chief executive of Federated Department Stores Inc., told Reuters he arrived at the company's flagship Macy's store in Manhattan at 5:30 a.m. to find lines wrapped completely around the building, which takes up a whole city block. "I've been coming here for many years at the same time on this particular day, and this looks like the largest crowd we've seen in years," Lundgren said. The sunny, cold weather was good for shopping, especially for coats and cashmere sweaters, he added. Early shoppers were treated to deals such as a five-piece luggage set for $49.99 and a one-carat diamond circle pendant for less than $100, Lundgren said. Consumers see the day after the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday -- called "Black Friday" because it once marked the day many retailers turned a profit, or went into the black, for the year -- as the first day of the holiday shopping season and a time to snag bargains, freebies and sales. It used to be the year's busiest shopping day, but people looking for last-minute gifts have transferred that honor to the Saturday before Christmas. Still, the Thanksgiving weekend accounts for up to 10 percent of holiday sales, according to analyst Dana Telsey of independent research firm Telsey Group. "We were extremely surprised by how promotional the circulars and the advertisements have been," said Ellen Davis, senior director of the National Retail Federation. "Retailers really went all-out to offer some substantial discounts this weekend to bring people into their stores." "Everything we've seen indicates that consumers are responding," Davis said, adding that people were lined up across the country, trying to get bargains on toys, electronics and accessories. Britt Beemer, chairman of America's Research Group, said 64 percent of respondents in a survey he conducted said they planned to shop early, lured by a flurry of early-bird specials, up from 48 percent last year. People even spent the night outside the Mall of America, near Minneapolis, Minnesota, in order to grab gift-bags offered to the first 250 people in line at the mall's gingerbread house. The enthusiasm even extended online. Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s Web site saw a bigger-than-expected traffic surge early on Friday that caused temporary problems accessing the site. But a spokeswoman said that Friday-only deals that originally had been slated to end at 11 a.m. PST would be extended through midnight. Toys "R" Us Chief Executive Gerald Storch said this year's hot toys -- such as T.M.X. Elmo and video-game consoles Sony PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Wii -- made for more exciting selections than in years past. He said Toys "R" Us, which opened at 5 a.m., started the day with thousands of plush Elmo toys, but a sales associate at the company's flagship store in New York's Times Square said just after 6:30 a.m. that it had sold out. About Nintendo's game console, which launched on November 19, Storch said the store had already sold tens of thousands and would have tens of thousands more available soon. "It may not be in stock every hour of every day at every store," Storch told Reuters. "But we are constantly getting replenishment of Nintendo Wiis." Laura Richardson, an analyst at BB&T Capital Markets, said the stocks of companies that sell electronics, including Best Buy Co. Inc., Circuit City Stores Inc. and Staples Inc. would be among the winners this season. "Best Buy was just unbelievable," Richardson said of the crowds at the Tysons Corner, Virginia, outpost of the retailer. "It was so bad I couldn't even wait in the line." Best Buy is selling a 42-inch Panasonic Plasma high-definition television for just under $1,000. Retailers this year used special promotions and longer hours to attract consumers, some of whom have been spending less because of higher interest rates. In some cases, long lines to get into stores and at check-out counters caused some shoppers to have second thoughts. Monique Hand and a friend left home in Paterson, New Jersey, at 2:30 a.m., bound for New York's Woodbury Common outlet center, which opened at midnight. But when they arrived two hours later, the crowds, lines and a full parking lot were too much to handle, Hand said. The women headed back to New Jersey's Westfield Garden State Plaza, which did not open until 7 a.m. but promised free coffee and massages to early birds. "I'll never do this again," said Hand's companion, who preferred not to give her name. Disney Stores, many of which opened at 5 a.m., were discounting their entire stock by 20 percent until 10 a.m. And Manhattan's famed toy emporium FAO Schwarz didn't bother to wait until Friday. It opened its doors on Thanksgiving Day. Jeff Dugan, an office technology manager who came shopping with his wife at the Garden State Mall after they could not get into the parking lot of a Best Buy in West Paterson, New Jersey, at 6 a.m., said getting up so early was not worth it. "Our plan didn't work ... we came out too late at 6 a.m.," Dugan said. Trading in retail stocks was thin on Friday, with the Standard & Poor's Retail index closing down less than 1 percent. Best Buy shares closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $55.08, down 76 cents, while Wal-Mart closed at $47.90, down 13 cents.
