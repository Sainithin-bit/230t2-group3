 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - European shares fell on Friday as the euro rallied to a 1-1/2-year high, hurting the export reliant car sector, while investor sold off insurers on fading sector consolidation hopes. 

 The biggest sector loser was the DJ Stoxx auto sector index .SXAP, which fell almost 2 percent as heavyweights DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE, BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and Peugeot ( PEUP.PA ) all took a hit. Among other standout decliners were insurers, such as Prudential ( PRU.L ) and Old Mutual ( OML.L ), dropping about 2 percent as traders cite the dropping off of bid speculation that has swirled the sector in recent weeks. By 1232 GMT the pan-European FTSEurofirst index  .FTEU3  of 300 leading shares fell 1 percent to 1,447.38 points, after hitting a three-week intraday low, while the index is still up almost 15 percent since the start of the year. Around Europe, London's FTSE 100  .FTSE  was down 0.8 percent, while the French CAC 40  .FCHI  dropped 0.9 percent and Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  was down 1.3 percent. Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, analyst at Germany's Postbank, said the long-term view was still positive. "The reaction is too strong, and that's because Wall Street is missing," he said, adding that he expects U.S. market volumes to be low a day after Thanksgiving holiday. "I interpret this as a healthy correction," Frank Schallenberger, market analyst at German state bank LBBW, said. "When the dollar gets a dizzy spell, obviously everything to do with exports suffers, especially cars," he said. The euro rose to a 1-1/2 year high versus the dollar , extending gains rapidly after breaching the key $1.30 level. By 1224 GMT, the euro had risen as high as $1.3109  EUR= . The dollar also hit its lowest level against the yen in nearly three months at 115.62 yen  JPY= . "I think the euro could settle at around $1.30. As long was we don't go towards $1.40 this shouldn't be a big burden," Schallenberger said. Gerard Piasko, Chief Investment Officer at Julius Baer Private Banking, added: "I don't think it will go to $1.40." The strong euro, which gained on Thursday on the back of a rise in Germany's business confidence, increased the likelihood of more monetary tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB). European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ) shed 1.2 percent after an industry source said disagreement over the funding of a $10-billion new plane project at Airbus forced the parent firm EADS to cancel a Friday board meeting. Shares in Britain's Fuller, Smith & Turner Plc ( FSTA.L ), the brewer of London Pride, fell more than 4 percent after its chief executive said they would consider making larger acquisitions following the successful purchase of George & Co in 2005. German industrial firm Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) fell 2 percent after its labor union said a deal to support employees of its former mobile phone unit, which it had sold to Taiwan's BenQ, would cost the firm around 140 million euros following the insolvency of BenQ's German mobile business. On the up side, Italian airline Eurofly EEZ.MI rose 9 percent, extending gains driven by speculation about a tie-up, traders said. French energy services group Technip ( TECF.PA ) rose 8 percent after newspapers reported that Saipem ( SPMI.MI ), a unit of Italian energy firm Eni ( ENI.MI ), could launch a 6 billion euro bid for it. Technip said it had not been contacted by Saipem or Eni. Ailing German retailer Karstadt KARG.DE rose 6 percent on talk it might be split up and its mail order business might be sold, traders said.
