 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar plummeted on Friday, denting Wall Street stocks but triggering a flight into safe-haven assets, such as U.S. Treasuries and gold. 

 U.S. stocks slipped on "Black Friday" -- the day after Thanksgiving that traditionally marks the start of the holiday shopping season -- as the fall in the dollar reignited concern over inflation. These losses were partly offset earlier by a rally in mining shares on a rally in the gold price, which gained over 1 percent as the dollar sank across the board. "We're seeing some real weakness for the dollar, so that's kind of spooking investors" said Anthony Chan, chief economist at JPMorgan Private Client Services in New York. The greenback hit its lowest level in over eighteen months against the euro, while the British pound neared two-year highs as concern over foreign central banks paring back their dollar holdings and the dollar's narrowing yield advantage over other currencies weighed heavily. The U.S. currency's fourth consecutive session of weakness was a culmination of a host of dollar-negative developments over the past few weeks, including surprisingly soft U.S. economic data and comments from Asian and Middle East central banks. Buoyed by signs of solid euro zone economic growth and likely higher interest rates, the euro broke through the psychological barrier of $1.30 for the first time in 1-1/2 years as the dollar weakened across the board. Britain's pound was up over 0.8 percent at a near two-year high above $1.93, while the dollar was down 1.2 percent against the Swiss franc and down 0.3 percent against the yen at 115.8 yen. "We've had some pretty good numbers out of Europe, and so the risk for me is that, over the next few weeks, we get some more sloppy data out of the United States in the manufacturing and housing sectors," said Shaun Osborne, chief currency strategist with TD Securities in Toronto. U.S. government bond prices, meanwhile, edged modestly higher, leaving yields near nine-month lows, even though traders said the flight-to-quality flows could dry up if the dollar continues to fall as this would undermine the value of any dollar-denominated assets. "The dollar's plunge on a day when many U.S. trading desks are thinly staffed is not a catalyst for foreign accounts to start shifting money out of Treasuries yet, as the U.S. government bond rally appears to confirm," said George Goncalves, Treasury and agency trading strategist with Banc of America Securities in New York. The benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR was up 7/32 at 100 19/32 in price for a yield of 4.55 percent, having hit a low of 4.53 percent earlier in the day. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 46.78 points, or 0.38 percent, to end at 12,280.17. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 5.14 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,400.95. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  declined 5.72 points, or 0.23 percent, to close at 2,460.26. The stock market closed early after the Thursday's Thanksgiving holiday. U.S. stocks were already off to a shaky start after European stock indexes shed well over 1 percent on worries about exporters' future earnings with the surge in the euro. Prospects of a slowdown in the U.S. economy and potentially lower U.S. interest rates have combined with concerns about fundamental economic imbalances to put the dollar under pressure. However, if the current decline lasts, a soaring euro could lower the horizon for European Central Bank interest rate rises. The stronger yen also hurt Japanese stocks with the Nikkei ending down 1.13 percent. In U.S. futures trading, the December gold contract GCZ6 at the COMEX division of the New York Mercantile Exchange jumped $9.60 to trade at $638.60 an ounce. Gold often moves in the opposite direction from the dollar and is also widely viewed as a hedge against inflation.
