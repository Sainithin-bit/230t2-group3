 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell on Friday, pointing to a weaker start on Wall Street in line with a fall in European and Asian markets as U.S. markets resume trading after the Thanksgiving holiday. 

 Exporters are expected to be in focus after the euro shot above $1.30 for the first time since April last year, extending sharp gains this week after upbeat German data reinforced expectations the European Central Bank would raise interest rates into next year. By 1115 GMT, U.S. stock index futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were down between 0.4 and 0.7 percent. Dealers said thin volumes might exaggerate movements in the market, with European stocks already taking a hit. The dollar tumbled across the board, hitting its lowest level against sterling in almost two years. Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, Inc. ( ASX.N ), the world's largest microchip packaging firm, might also be in focus after it said it had received takeover interest from a consortium led by U.S. buyout firm Carlyle Group. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 index  .SPX  hit a six-year intra-day high of 1,407.9, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose to a fresh all-time high of 12,361.0 and the tech-laced Nasdaq  .IXIC  gained 0.45 percent to end at 2,465.9.
