 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Quest Software Inc. QSFT.O said on Friday that its senior vice president of corporate development resigned after he declined to be interviewed by the special committee investigating the company's stock options dating practices. 

 Quest said in a statement that the resignation of the executive, M. Brinkley Morse, was effective immediately. Morse was responsible for the company's investment and acquisition strategy. He had been in the job since 2005, and previously was Quest's chief financial officer from January 2001 to April 2005. Before that, he was a senior executive at BMC Software Inc. BMC.N and a member of that company's executive committee, according to a biography posted on Quest's Web site. Quest spokesman Joe Horine said the special committee is attempting to finish the review as soon as possible, but that no deadline has been set. The Aliso Viejo, California-based company has said it plans to restate some previous financial results because of its stock options awards practices. It said in June that it had received an informal inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission related to option grants.
