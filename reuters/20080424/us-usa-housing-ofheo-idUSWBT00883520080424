 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. home prices rose about 0.6 percent from January to February while prices fell 2.4 percent during the 12-month period ended in February, a federal housing regulator said on Tuesday. 

 The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) said its index of home prices is down 3.1 percent since a peak in April 2007. Prices were up in all but two of the nine regions tracked in this index. They were down 0.6 percent in the Mountain region: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico Utah and Wyoming. Prices fell 0.2 percent in the South Atlantic region: Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and the District of Columbia. The OFHEO index is calculated using purchase prices of houses financed with mortgages that have been sold to or guaranteed by Fannie Mae FNM.N or Freddie Mac FRE.N. The index was introduced in the fourth quarter of 2007. (Reporting By Joanne Morrison; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
