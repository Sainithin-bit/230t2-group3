 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ), the world's top appliance maker, reported lower first-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by declining U.S. sales and rising oil-based and steel costs, and it cut its full-year earnings forecast. 

 Earnings came to $94 million, or $1.22 a share, compared with $117 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier. Whirlpool also said it now expected a steeper drop in industry appliance shipments this year in North America, its biggest market. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
