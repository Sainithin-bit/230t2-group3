 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) on Thursday posted first-quarter profit that met Wall Street expectations, helped by higher membership, and the health insurer backed its 2008 profit forecast. 

 The No. 3 U.S. health insurer also raised its enrollment projection for 2008. Net income fell to $431.6 million, or 85 cents per share, from $434.6 million, or 81 cents per share, a year earlier. Net income was hurt by investment losses. Excluding items, operating earnings were 92 cents per share, in line with the average estimate of analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 16 percent to $7.7 billion. Membership at the end of March soared 11 percent to about 17.5 million from a year ago, and rose 3.6 percent from the end of 2007. Aetna continues to expect operating earnings of $4 per share. The company also boosted its full-year membership growth target by 50,000 to a range of 850,000 to 900,000. Already this quarter, rivals UnitedHealth Group ( UNH.N ) and WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) have slashed their 2008 profit forecasts, WellPoint for the second time since March. Some analysts believe the industry may be mired in a downturn. Aetna shares have fallen 25 percent this year. But unlike rivals, Aetna has not issued profit warnings for 2008, and its shares so far this year have outperformed a 33 percent drop for the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO.
