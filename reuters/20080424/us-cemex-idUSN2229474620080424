 MONTERREY, Mexico  (Reuters) - Mexico's Cemex, the biggest cement and ready-mix company in the United States, warned on Tuesday it believes the U.S. housing market will continue its downward trend for the rest of 2008, but at a slower pace. 

 Cemex ( CX.N ) ( CMXCPO.MX ), the world's third-largest cement maker, expects demand in the U.S. residential sector for its cement to drop this year by some 24 percent, planning and finance chief Hector Medina told an analysts' conference call. Medina reduced his 2008 forecasts for cement and concrete sales volumes for the U.S. market, where Cemex increased its exposure last year with its $16 billion takeover of Australia's Rinker. "In 2008, we now expect our (overall U.S.) cement volume to decline by about 9 percent, our ready-mix volume to decline by about 13 percent and our aggregates volume to decline by about 10 percent," Medina said. In January, Medina forecast cement volumes to drop 7 percent, ready-mix concrete to fall 9 percent and aggregates -- materials like sand and gravel -- to decrease 6 percent. "This will of course have an impact on our (EBITDA) margins in the United States," Medina added, also blaming higher energy and transportation costs. Cemex, which operates in more than 50 countries, is facing a slump in residential construction following a subprime crisis that is pushing the United States into a recession. For Cemex, which competes globally with Switzerland's Holcim ( HOLN.VX ) and France's Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ), the fall in housing construction has been particularly severe in its high-growth markets such as Florida. MAINTAINING EBITDA But Monterrey-based Cemex said it was standing by its forecast of full-year EBITDA of around $5.6 billion despite the U.S. market, amid skepticism from analysts. Credit Suisse analyst Marcelo Telles said he expected Cemex's EBITDA to reach $5.18 billion this year. The company cited cost benefits due to Rinker, aggressive cost-cutting across the company, recent cement price rises, booming Eastern European operations and a strong euro. "We do feel we are on track to reach 5.6 billion (dollars), everything considered," said Chief Financial Officer Rodrigo Trevino, who declined to say if Cemex would make new price hikes this year. The company also expects Mexico's delayed government infrastructure program to help EBITDA from the third quarter. On Monday, Cemex posted an 18 percent rise in first-quarter net profit to $470 million, slightly above analysts' expectations, despite the U.S. housing slowdown. The earnings were helped by Cemex's sale of its 9.5 percent stake in local telecoms company Axtel ( AXTELCPO.MX ) in late March for $257 million. Cemex said its January-to-March revenues rose 26 percent to $5.4 billion. However, the higher net profit also came because of the inclusion of the Rinker operations. Cemex acquired Rinker in June last year and began including those operations in the third quarter of 2007. Shares of Cemex rallied more than 2 percent on the results but slipped back in morning trading, rising 0.52 percent on Tuesday to 29.04 pesos. Its New York traded stock moved up 0.47 percent to $27.51.
