 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - 3M Co ( MMM.N ), a diversified manufacturer whose products include Scotch tape and Post-It notes, reported lower first-quarter profit on Thursday but beat analysts' estimates as strong international sales offset economic challenges in the United States. 

 Net income fell to $988 million, or $1.38 per share, from $1.4 billion, or $1.85 per share, a year earlier. Analysts' average earnings forecast was $1.35 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The year-earlier results included a one-time gain of 57 cents per share from the sale of the company's branded drug business in Europe. Sales rose 8.9 percent to $6.5 billion, topping analysts' forecast of $6.32 billion. (Reporting by  Helen Chernikoff ; editing by John Wallace)
