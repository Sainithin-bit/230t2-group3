 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said on Thursday it is being "cautious" on the economy, but its wide range of products and geographic diversity will support the company's earnings. 

 "We're being cautious just like everybody else," Liddell said in an interview with Reuters. His comments came on the heels of earnings estimates for the current quarter that disappointed some investors, sending its shares down 5 percent in after-hours trade. Liddell, who declined to comment on the company's takeover bid of Yahoo Inc ( YHOO.O ), said Windows revenue was lower than the company's expectations due in part to inventory build-up of computers but added that those issues were "quarter specific."
