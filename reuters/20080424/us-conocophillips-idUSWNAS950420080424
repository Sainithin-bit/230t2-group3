 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), the third-largest U.S. oil company, said on Thursday its first-quarter earnings rose 17 percent as much higher oil and natural gas prices outweighed weak profits from gasoline production. 

 Oil prices have increased nearly six-fold since 2002 on surging demand from emerging economies, supply concerns and the weak dollar. Net income in the quarter rose to $4.14 billion, or $2.62 a share, from $3.55 billion, or $2.12 a share, in the year earlier period. Revenue in the quarter rose 33 percent to $54.88 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned about $2.56 a share. Analysts, on average, had expected it to bring in about $2.41 a share in the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Gene Pisasale, who helps manage $12 billion at PNC Capital Advisors, said the company's exploration and production (E&P) results were a "blowout," and made up the difference between the reported results and analyst estimates. "The fundamentals for the industry are among the best ever on the upstream," Pisasale said, referring to the business. In refining and marketing, he said, "the challenge in the coming quarter will be to try to pass through most of the crude increases at the pump, but as we see prices increase and gasoline volumes decelerate that's going to continue to be a challenge." Benchmark U.S. oil prices averaged a record of nearly $98 a barrel during the quarter, up nearly 70 percent from a year earlier. But margins to produce gasoline have plummeted as refiners have struggled to push through the higher crude costs to customers. According to U.S. data, first-quarter gasoline prices rose only 33 percent year over year, less than half crude's climb. Profits from the company's exploration and production business rose 24 percent to $2.89 billion in the quarter. ConocoPhillips, the second-largest U.S. refiner, said earnings from its refining and marketing business fell nearly 55 percent to $520 million. Net income from the company's Lukoil stake nearly tripled to $710 million. Oil and gas production, excluding the company's 20 percent stake in Russia's Lukoil LMOH.MM, was down over 11 percent to 1.79 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, mostly due to the loss of projects that were taken over by the Venezuelan government. Conoco estimated its share of the Russian company's production was 459,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Shares of ConocoPhillips fell 86 cents, or 1 percent, to $83.62 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Through Wednesday's close, the company's shares were down about 4.3 percent this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX which was up about 3 percent over the same period.
