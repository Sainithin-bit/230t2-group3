 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A New York state judge on Thursday made no immediate ruling on a group of banks' request to dismiss a lawsuit seeking to force them to fund the $20 billion leveraged buyout of Clear Channel Communications Inc ( CCU.N ). 

 After hearing an hour of oral arguments, New York State Supreme Court Judge Helen Freedman did not indicate when she would rule on the request. A May 5 trial date in the case may be delayed, the judge said. "Don't look too forward to May 5," she said. "I might have to extend it a few days after." Private equity firms Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital Partners sued the banks -- Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ), Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ), and Wachovia Corp WB.N -- to force them to fund the buyout of Clear Channel. The banks are accused of balking at providing financing after credit markets deteriorated last year. (Reporting by  Leslie Gevirtz )
