 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wendy's International Inc WEN.N is set to announce a transaction with billionaire investor Nelson Peltz on Thursday, though the deal's specific details were unclear, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a person familiar with the situation. 

 The hamburger chain operator's board, which has been weighing a sale for months, voted on Wednesday to approve the transaction, the Journal said. The deal is subject to shareholder approval, the report added. Peltz, who is a major shareholder in Wendy's, has been pushing for better financial performance at the company. Recently, Peltz's Triarc Cos Inc TRY.N and Trian Fund Management proposed combining Wendy's and Arby's, a sandwich chain owned by Triarc. They also offered to buy 100 percent of Wendy's, according to a letter included in a recent regulatory filing, but Wendy's Chairman James Pickett said Trian and Triarc failed to reveal how the proposed deals would value Wendy's, which rejected the offers. Wendy's and Triarc were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by  David Holmes )
