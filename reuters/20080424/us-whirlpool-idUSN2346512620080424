 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ), the world's top appliance maker, posted first-quarter profit well below Wall Street estimates on Thursday on declining U.S. sales and rising oil and steel costs, and it slashed its full-year earnings outlook, sending its shares as much as 11 percent. 

 Soaring costs for oil and metals are compounding conditions for appliance makers, which have already been wrestling with weak results in the key U.S. market as the housing slump and rising food and gasoline prices cause consumers to curb big-ticket purchases. Shares of Sweden-based rival Electrolux AB ( ELUXb.ST ) fell 4.5 percent, while LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) shares rose 1.4 percent. "The combination of unprecedented material cost increases and seven consecutive quarters of lower U.S. demand have resulted in one of the most challenging operating environments we have seen in three decades," Whirlpool Chairman Jeff Fettig said in a statement. The maker of Maytag, KitchenAid and Amana appliances also forecast a steeper drop in industry appliance shipments this year in North America, its biggest market. Tool makers Black & Decker Corp BDK.N and Stanley Works ( SWK.N ) also posted weaker results, underscoring the impact of the U.S. housing downturn and the reluctance of home owners to undertake major improvements on houses that are worth less than they were a year ago. Whirlpool's quarterly profit fell 20 percent to $94 million, or $1.22 a share, from $117 million, or $1.46 a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected $1.57 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5 percent to $4.6 billion, better than the $4.46 billion analysts expected, on strength in Europe, Latin America and Asia. But sales fell 3 percent in North America as U.S. industrywide shipments of appliance units declined about 9 percent. "Whirlpool's sales are really a barometer for the economy," said Mirko Mikelic, a portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management. "Right now people are holding back on any major purchases." Whirlpool expects U.S. industry unit shipments to fall 5 percent to 6 percent this year, a steeper drop than its February forecast of a 3 percent to 5 percent decline. Sales rose 13 percent in Europe, 24 percent in Latin America and 19 percent in Asia. Whirlpool expects industrywide appliance shipments in Europe to fall 2 percent to 3 percent this year, while it had previously forecast no change. The Benton Harbor, Michigan, manufacturer forecast full-year profit of $7 to $7.50 a share from continuing operations, down from its February outlook of $8.50 to $9. Analysts expected $8.58 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Whirlpool also said its board approved a new $500 million share repurchase program. The company's shares dropped $6.94, or 8.4 percent, to $74.10 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares have fallen 28 percent in the past year.
