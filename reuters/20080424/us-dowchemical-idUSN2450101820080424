 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) posted better-than-expected first-quarter earnings on Thursday, as strong overseas markets, improved pricing and gains from its agricultural business helped offset some of the impact of soaring raw material costs. 

 The largest U.S. chemical maker also said it expects a good second quarter on the back of strong results from its joint ventures, a strong market presence outside the United States and a continued focus on raising prices. "On the positive side you have better-than-expected results in ag and you have strong international growth," said HSBC analyst Hassan Ahmed, adding that strong earnings from Dow's affiliates, given soaring raw material costs, are also a positive. However, Ahmed noted that yet again Dow's specialty chemicals and its plastics businesses saw profits hurt by weakness in the North American construction and automotive sectors and soaring crude oil and natural gas costs. Dow reported a $2.2 billion year-over-year increase in energy and raw material costs, while pricing improvements only offset a part of the cost escalation, noted Morningstar analyst Ben Johnson. "Given the way just those costs are going up there's just no way for any of these producers to be able to fully buffer themselves against that rising cost line," said Johnson. The Midland, Michigan-based company's first-quarter net income fell to $941 million, or 99 cents a share, from $973 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier, hurt by lower volumes in North America and soaring raw material costs. Sales in the quarter rose 19 percent to $14.8 billion, spurred by double-digit price increases in all regions and 6 percent volume growth in emerging economies. Analysts, on average, had forecast first-quarter earnings of 95 cents a share, on revenue of $13.64 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Dow shares were up 52 cents at $39.74 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. AG BOOSTS QUARTER Dow's agricultural business posted a 17 percent increase in earnings before interest and taxes, driven by improved pricing, increased volumes and strong demand for its crop protection chemicals. Growing food demands from developing countries and global mandates for the increasing use of biofuels have led to soaring grain prices that have encouraged farmers to use more high-yielding biotech seeds and increase their usage of fertilizer and crop protection chemicals. "The rising ag tide is lifting all boats, even the Dows of the world that don't have significant exposure, or a particularly advantaged product portfolio in the (ag) space," said Morningstar's Johnson. In the quarter, more than 80 percent of Dow's sales from its agrosciences business came from the sale of crop protection chemicals, which are not as profitable as biotech seeds sales. Dow's competitors Monsanto Co ( MON.N ) and DuPont Co ( DD.N ) are among the world's biggest sellers of biotech seeds and have recently reaped bumper profits, due to the booming agricultural sector. CHALLENGES AHEAD Dow is facing stiff competition from Middle Eastern chemical makers, which enjoy access to cheap crude oil and natural gas. Additional ethylene capacity that is due to come on line in the region later this year is likely to put even more pressure on Dow's profit margins. Dow has adopted a joint-venture strategy to counter this threat, signing agreements with companies in the Middle East and North Africa that will give it access to cheaper feedstocks. Some of these partnerships, however, are still a few years away from production. Strong demand in Asia and other regions is likely to offset any weakness in North America and Western Europe, said Chief Executive Andrew Liveris, in an interview with Reuters. "Unless Asia catches pneumonia from the U.S. flu, which we haven't seen and don't see," it is unlikely that we will see a major global downturn, he said. The demand for plastics is normally 1.5 to 2 times a country's gross domestic product (GDP) growth, hence even if China or India's GDP growth slows by 2 percent the demand growth is still huge, said Liveris. Shares of the company have risen 2.8 percent in the last three months, while the Standard & Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM has gained about 2.9 percent.
