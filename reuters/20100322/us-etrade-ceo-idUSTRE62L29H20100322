 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ), an online broker emerging from painful mortgage lending problems, named former Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) executive Steven Freiberg as its new CEO and said it plans a reverse stock split. 

 Freiberg, 53, will take the reins from interim Chief Executive Robert Druskin on April 1, capping the search for a successor to former chief Donald Layton. E*Trade previously said Druskin, former Citigroup chief operating officer, was not a CEO candidate. Analysts said the moves could stoke takeover speculation that has dogged E*Trade since the prospect of bankruptcy loomed early last year. The company's shares dropped as much as 7.6 percent just after the opening bell on Monday but then rebounded. They were up a penny to $1.58 in late-morning trade. "Some people could have thought it's less likely they would just roll into a deal now that they've named a CEO," said Sandler O'Neill analyst Richard Repetto. Other observers said the 1-for-10 reverse stock split could clear the way for a merger. "Getting their share price higher is going to help them because it's probably going to reduce the churn on their stock," said Aite Group senior analyst Adam Honore. "I still hold that they're ripe for a takeover." Freiberg -- former co-CEO of Citigroup's global consumer group and former head of the bank's credit card unit -- will earn an annual base salary of $1 million and is eligible for a $3 million cash performance bonus, according to a regulatory filing by E*Trade. His severance would jump under a merger, the filing said. If his four-year contract is terminated due to a change of control of the company, "his severance would be increased to two times his annual compensation," it said E*Trade has been increasingly rumored in recent months to be a takeover target, with larger rivals TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ( AMTD.O ) and Charles Schwab Corp ( SCHW.N ) seen as possible suitors. Freiberg retired from Citigroup on July 31. E*Trade said the reverse stock split, which requires shareholder approval, would decrease the number of authorized common shares to 400 million. Shareholders will vote on the split at the May 13 annual meeting. The company's shares were selling for more than $25 in 2007, before loan losses in its mortgage portfolio set in. E*Trade said the reverse split is "a logical next step for the company as we complete our financial and managerial restructuring." E*Trade has posted losses in 10 straight quarters. It is not expected to get back into the black until the third quarter this year, when analysts on average expect a profit of 2 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The reverse stock split would give the perception of more robust per-share earnings, said Repetto. The company could also be worried that its marketing to new individual trading clients could be undermined by shares worth less than $2, the analyst added. Under regulatory pressure, E*Trade aggressively raised capital last year with the backing of major stakeholder Citadel Investment Group, and it is showing signs of recovery. In December it announced plans to exit local market trading outside the United States. Freiberg said in a statement, "I look forward to the opportunity to work with the company's talented management team to build on that momentum and help drive E*Trade's future growth and profitability." Freiberg will also join E*Trade's board of directors. (Reporting by Jonathan Spicer; editing by John Wallace)
