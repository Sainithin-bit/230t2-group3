 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ) Chief Executive Tom Albanese said he was respectfully awaiting the outcome of China's trial of four of the company's employees, which began on Monday. 

 "This issue is obviously of great concern to us, as it would be for any company operating in China. I can only say we respectfully await the outcome of the Chinese legal process," he said on Monday in remarks prepared for the China Development Forum in Beijing, and emailed to Reuters by the company.
