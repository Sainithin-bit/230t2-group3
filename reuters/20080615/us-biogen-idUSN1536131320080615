 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Shareholders of Biogen Idec Inc ( BIIB.O ) will meet shortly to decide whether one of the world's biggest and oldest biotechnology companies should remain independent or be put up for sale by billionaire investor Carl Icahn. 

 Shareholders will vote at their annual meeting on June 19 either to back Biogen's nominees for its board, or to support an alternate three-member slate proposed by Icahn, who owns roughly 4 percent of the company's stock and whose goal is to unlock its value through a sale. For now, Biogen is tipped to win. Last week three proxy advisory firms issued reports backing Biogen, and while investors do not always follow the advice of the advisers, their recommendations make an Icahn victory less likely. "If I had to handicap the outcome I'd lean a little more towards Biogen's slate," said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. At stake is the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company's future as an independent entity. Icahn is seeking to permanently limit the board to 12 members to prevent the company from expanding the board and diluting his power. Currently the company would be allowed to expand the board beyond 12 members. "When you make this vote you decide either for Biogen as an ongoing concern because you believe in its products, or you opt for a disruptive board that would probably create headwinds for the ongoing business, in return for a sales premium if the company were to be sold," Conover said. Biogen, which sells the multiple sclerosis drugs Avonex and Tysabri and the cancer drug Rituxan, tried and failed last year to sell itself. Icahn, who urged the sale, claims Biogen deliberately sabotaged it by conducting a flawed auction. But Icahn could have a tough time convincing investors of the company's incompetence. Biogen's shares have risen about 50 percent over the past five years, compared to a gain of about 8 percent in the Nasdaq Biotech Index.NBI. It has a market value of more than $17 billion and generated more than $3 billion in sales in 2007. Even those who support Icahn's nominees, such as Argent Capital, are doubtful he will win. "Management has made a solid case for laying out their growth goals and it's hard to argue from an execution standpoint that they haven't been doing a good job," said Scott Harrison, an analyst at Argent, which has nearly $1 billion under management and owns 350,000 Biogen shares. Argent believes Icahn can increase shareholder value faster than Biogen, a view Icahn's team says is shared by others. "We are receiving support from a number of large shareholders, especially those with expertise in biotech and those whose experience tells them to be appropriately skeptical of such a strange sales process," said Alexander Denner, managing director of the Icahn investment vehicle Icahn Partners and Icahn's lead nominee to the board. He was referring to the auction that Biogen ran last year and that Icahn believed was flawed. Biogen spokeswoman Naomi Aoki said the company is confident it will prevail and that "shareholders who look at Biogen Idec's performance and record of value creation over the past five years will support the Board's slate." Some believe investors will benefit either way. William Butler, who helps manage about $650 million in assets for high net worth individuals and small institutions at Tirschwell & Loewy, said that while his company is not holding Biogen for a quick turnover, and has a favorable view of its long term prospects as a stand-alone company, if Icahn manages to effect a sale of the company his clients would not be hurt. "It's a win-win situation," he said. "You either get a quick premium today or long-term steady earnings growth and price appreciation." (Reporting by Toni Clarke; editing by Carol Bishopric)
