 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manchester United ( MANU.N ) shares started trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday at $14.05, slightly above its initial public offering price. 
 The IPO priced at $14, below the $16-20 range the club's bankers had been seeking. It valued the 19-times English champions at $2.3 billion and shaved as much as $100 million off the proceeds expected for the team and its owners. (Reporting by  Angela Moon ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
