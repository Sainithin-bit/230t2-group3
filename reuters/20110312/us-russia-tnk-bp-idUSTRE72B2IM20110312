 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - BP's partners in Russian joint venture TNK-BP have rejected a peace proposal by the British oil major to involve them in talks on joining a disputed BP alliance with Russia's Rosneft. 

 The TNK-BP board met in Paris on Saturday to consider a new proposal from BP's representatives concerning a partnership with Rosneft, Russia's top crude producer. "A proposal by BP's nominated directors which would have allowed TNK-BP to hold initial discussions with Rosneft about pursuing the Arctic opportunity, was rejected by Alfa, Access and Renova (AAR)," BP said in a statement on Saturday. TNK-BP board is made up of four BP-nominated directors, four representatives of the Russia-connected billionaires who hold shares in the venture as the AAR consortium, and three independent directors. AAR is seeking to prevent BP's deal with Rosneft going ahead and obtained a court injunction in London which required the two sides to enter into arbitration on the issue.
