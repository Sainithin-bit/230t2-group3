 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer, has apologized for selling duck meat past its expiry date in a store in southwest China's Chongqing region, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Saturday. 

 A store in the Jiulongpo district was caught by a local market regulator selling smoked tea ducks using the meat. The market regulator was tipped off by a consumer late in February, Xinhua said. Wal-Mart would pay the victims 10 times the price of the ducks as a penalty, the firm told the municipal consumers' association in a statement. In January, China fined Wal-Mart and France's Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) supermarket chain for lying about the price of their goods. (Reporting by  Melanie Lee ; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)
