 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Representatives of General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and the United Auto Workers union closed in on a tentative labor agreement on Saturday that would slash health care costs for the top U.S. automaker. 

 In a breakthrough after eight weeks of negotiations, GM and the union have agreed on the broad terms for a deal that would allow GM to shift responsibility for retiree health care to a new trust fund, two people familiar with the talks said. GM and the union have brought in a third party to audit the deal and are devoting Saturday to a review of funding earmarked for the plan, according to the two sources, who asked not to be identified because of the confidential nature of the talks. A contract would have to be ratified by a majority of GM's 73,000 union workers. Local union leaders could be summoned as soon as Sunday for a briefing on the terms of deal, one of those briefed on the progress of talks said. Wall Street analysts have said a health care deal with the UAW could cut GM's costs by $3 billion annually in exchange for a one-time payment expected to top $30 billion. The health care issue has dominated GM's negotiations with the union and the signs of progress came as the UAW struck a more conciliatory note in an update for its members. "It is our desire to reach an agreement without a strike, and we have demonstrated this by staying at the bargaining table up to this point," UAW President Ron Gettelfinger and the union's chief GM negotiator Cal Rapson said in an e-mail to union local leaders on Friday. High-level GM and UAW officials have been in talks for 19 days straight. Negotiations kicked into high gear a week ago when the union named GM as its strike target just before a 4-year deal on wages and benefits was set to expire. MAKE-OR-BREAK CONTRACT The outcome of the contract talks is seen as crucial to efforts by the three Detroit-based automakers -- GM, Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler LLC -- to recover from combined losses of $15 billion last year and sales difficulties that have driven their share of the U.S. market below 50 percent. Talks with GM had snagged on how fully GM would have to fund a special trust -- known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association, or VEBA -- in exchange for shifting a $50 billion liability for retiree health care to such a fund. Earlier this year, the UAW agreed to a VEBA for bankrupt auto supplier Dana Corp. funded at 71 percent of its liabilities, a level considered a benchmark in the GM talks. One person familiar with the UAW's bargaining stance said the union expected a VEBA deal with GM would give it leverage to extract similar agreements from Ford and Chrysler. That would create a pool of funds UAW leaders see as giving the union a powerful stake in the growing debate on reforming the costly and private-sector dominated U.S. health care system, the person said. Representatives from the UAW and GM have declined to comment on the content of the talks under standing orders from both negotiating teams. GM, Ford and Chrysler are seeking sweeping concessions from the UAW to close a labor cost gap with Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) and other Japanese automakers operating in the United States that they say amounts to more than $30 per hour for the average factory worker. The UAW and the Detroit-based automakers clinched contract agreements in 2003 within days of the expiration of the prior contract. That deal allowed the Detroit-based automakers to shutter roughly a dozen plants in exchange for leaving health care benefits largely intact. In 1999, the UAW represented more than 380,000 U.S. auto workers, but a wave of restructuring has taken that number down to 180,000 in the current round of talks.
