 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The federal regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Friday said growth limits placed on the two biggest providers of money for U.S. residential mortgages may be lifted as early as February. 

 Elimination of investment caps placed on the companies after billions of dollars in accounting errors would allow them to boost their portfolios, already at a combined $1.4 trillion. The companies have been lobbying for flexibility in buying mortgages, asserting that their greater participation could help stabilize turmoil in U.S. mortgage and housing markets. "Under the consent agreement with Fannie Mae and the voluntary agreement with Freddie Mac, it is possible that the portfolio caps could be lifted with the publication of the Enterprises' 2007 financial statements" -- with a clean audit opinion and no material weaknesses -- in February 2008, James Lockhart, director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, said in a statement. OFHEO on Wednesday agreed to relax restrictions on the portfolios, though it kept caps in place. Fannie Mae Chief Executive Daniel Mudd and Freddie Mac Chief Executive Richard Syron a day later appealed to Congress for the ability to expand more. Rep. Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee and a Massachusetts Democrat, also said OFHEO's offering was not enough. OFHEO's statement may show a softening of the Bush administration's views on the government-chartered companies, which derive some three-quarters of revenue from interest earned on the portfolios. The companies earn less money from fees for guaranteeing monthly payments on the mortgage-backed securities they issue, a business that have critics said goes farther in providing money, or liquidity, for housing. Net income at Freddie Mac fell to $764 million in the second quarter from $1.4 billion in same period last year. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Thursday dropped some of their resistance to expanding the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The two, who have long held that the sheer sizes of the portfolios could destabilize U.S. financial markets during times of stress, in testimony offered support for expanding the size of mortgages the companies could buy. Lockhart has said the companies must provide current and timely financial reports before he would consider them fit. The two companies have been overhauling financial reporting and accounting systems for more than three years. "As much could change between now and (February), the decision will be made at that time by OFHEO," Lockhart said. Poor underwriting practices during the U.S. housing boom and falling home prices have sparked a crisis in the mortgage markets, most deeply felt in the riskiest, subprime loans where Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac do limited business. Investors have sharply cut back on purchases of assets tied to mortgages and more recently riskier corporate debt, forcing lenders to deny funding to many borrowers. Changes proposed by OFHEO would allow Fannie Mae to grow its portfolio by no more than 0.5 percent each quarter, a move seen as too small to help a mortgage market exceeding $10 trillion. The increased flexibility would allow additional mortgage asset purchases of $20 billion for Freddie Mac and about $10 billion for Fannie Mae, according to Jim Vogel, an analyst at FTN Financial in Memphis, Tennessee. Overall mortgage debt outstanding has increased by 8 percent since 2006, Vogel said.
