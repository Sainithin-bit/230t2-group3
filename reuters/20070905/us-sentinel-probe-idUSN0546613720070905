 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Regulators probing the collapse of fund manager Sentinel said an examination had revealed that more than $500 million was missing from its accounts, the Financial Times reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 

 Dan Roth, president of the National Futures Association, said the NFA had discovered a $505 million shortfall in Sentinel's books, the report said. The development could raise questions over a settlement reached last month in conjunction with hedge fund Citadel Investment Group involving some of Sentinel's creditors, the report said. Sentinel representatives were not immediately available. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf )
