 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting Radian Group's ( RDN.N ) debt against default rose sharply on Wednesday after the bond insurer and mortgage insurer MGIC Investment Corp. ( MTG.N ) agreed to terminate their merger. 

 Credit default swaps on Radian widened to about 650 basis points on Wednesday, out from about 458 basis points on Tuesday night, according to data from CMA DataVision.
