 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Governor Edward Gramlich, who warned early on about the need to tighten oversight of higher-risk mortgage lending, died on Wednesday. He was 68. 

 Gramlich, a tall and courtly figure, served as a U.S. central bank governor from 1997 to 2005. His death was announced by the Urban Institute, a policy research group where Gramlich became a senior fellow in 2006 after spending a year as interim provost at the University of Michigan. It was known that he suffered from an often deadly form of leukemia and tributes to him were being offered even before his death was confirmed on Wednesday morning. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, after the announcement, said Gramlich had played a significant role in framing consumer protection rules as well as in making monetary policy while at the U.S. central bank. "But those who knew him will miss not only his penetrating insight and shining intelligence but also his great wit and warmth," Bernanke added. Robert Reischauer, who heads the Urban Institute, said Gramlich was an exceptionally versatile policy analyst who provided valuable service as an economist, an academic and a senior official at the Congressional Budget Office. "It is very unusual that you find someone who is first rate in such a wide variety of roles," Reischauer commented. He added that Gramlich particularly wanted to contribute to finding a solution to credit troubles stemming from problems with subprime mortgage loans to less credit-worthy borrowers who now are defaulting in growing numbers. "In the subprime area, he pointed out that one of the problems that low-income people had had is finding affordable apartments and houses that are close to the job opportunities, many of which remain inside cities," Reischauer said. Gramlich thought that local housing authorities should consider buying foreclosed properties and turning them into rentals for lower-income people. Gramlich's involvement with the Federal Reserve began early, with a stint in its research division from 1965 to 1970. While he was a governor from 1997 to 2005, he chaired its consumer and community affairs committee and, after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, headed the Air Transportation Stabilization Board that oversaw their recovery to operating health. Gramlich was friendly and tolerant but had a strong-minded streak that showed in a relatively rare dissent in a September 2002, meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee where he argued for a cut in the federal funds rate but was overruled by a majority vote that kept it at 1.75 percent. Dissents were infrequent during the tenure of former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and were noted for that reason. Gramlich was a sportsman who was staff director in 1992 for a Major League baseball commission and published articles and books on varied topics, including one in June on problems in the subprime mortgage lending industry. In 1994-96 during the former Clinton administration, he headed an advisory council on Social Security reform and, a year later, was nominated by the Clinton White House as a Fed governor. Gramlich held a doctorate in economics from Yale University. He leaves his wife Ruth and two married children, Sarah and Robert.
