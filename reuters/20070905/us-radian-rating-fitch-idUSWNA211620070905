 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Wednesday downgraded its rating on mortgage insurer Radian Group Inc. ( RDN.N ), citing news that its merger with MGIC Investment Corp. ( MTG.N ) had been scrapped. 

 Fitch cut Radian's long-term debt rating to "A-minus," the seventh-highest investment grade, from "A." It said the outlook is negative, which indicates another downgrade is likely over the next one to two years.
