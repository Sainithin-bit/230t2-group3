 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) financial analyst and her husband, an ex-hedge fund analyst at ING Group ( ING.AS ), pleaded guilty to insider trading charges on Wednesday. 

 Jennifer Wang and Ruopian Chen, of Englishtown, New Jersey, pleaded guilty to conspiracy and insider trading charges during a hearing at U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Wang and Chen were arrested in May and released on bail. Federal prosecutors accused them of trading based on material, nonpublic information that Wang obtained from Morgan Stanley.
