 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer J. Crew Group Inc JCG.N on Wednesday posted a second-quarter net profit, helped by robust sales and higher gross margins. 

 The seller of preppy, colorful clothing posted a quarterly net profit of $20.6 million, or 32 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $2.8 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street, on average, had expected earnings of 29 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. But a 13 percent rise in sales to $304.7 million was shy of analysts' average estimate of $308.7 million. Gross margins were 43.7 percent of revenues compared with 42.1 percent of revenues a year earlier, the company said. J. Crew said its long-term annual financial targets were for earnings per share to increase by more than 20 percent and same-store sales to rise in the mid-single-digit range. It said direct sales were expected to rise in the high-single digits and that net square footage would expand by between 7 percent and 9 percent. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage )
