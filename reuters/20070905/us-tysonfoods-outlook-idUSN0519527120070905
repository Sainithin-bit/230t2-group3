 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) cut its 2007 earnings outlook on Wednesday primarily because of higher-than-expected live cattle and hog costs and a decline in beef revenue due to a disruption in South Korean beef trade. 

 The largest U.S. meat company, whose stock fell 13 percent, also lost chicken sales volume when it raised prices this year, Tyson said in remarks prepared for an investor conference. Tyson expects fiscal year 2007 earnings of 72 cents to 80 cents a share, compared with its prior view of 82 cents to 92 cents a share. It is now in the last month of fiscal 2007. Analysts had expected the company to earn 90 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. At the investor conference, the company said it has a goal of $30 billion in sales in fiscal year 2010, versus fiscal 2006 sales of $25.6 billion, and planned to trim its debt by more than $1 billion to below $2 billion by the end of this decade. South Korea suspended trade with plants owned by Tyson and Cargill Inc CARG.UL in June when some beef meant for U.S. consumption was wrongly shipped to the Asian country, but said later that month it was allowing beef trade to resume. Tyson also said it has had about $300 million in additional costs for grain, which is used in animal feed, this year. Like many food companies, Tyson has raised prices to try to pass on some of those costs. The Springdale, Arkansas-based company has also cut costs, closing two prepared foods plants and three beef plants and selling two poultry plants, while it also said it closed three other beef plants to improve capacity utilization. The company said it has embarked on a new program that is expected to further streamline its business and may lead to the reduction of some layers of management. The evaluation process under the program is expected to continue through mid-October. The focus on trimming operational costs is a sound strategy, wrote Wachovia analyst Jonathan Feeney in a note to clients. But investors don't know when it will bear fruit. "With livestock and feed costs pressuring margins for the foreseeable future, it is difficult to determine when current strategic and operating initiatives will enhance profitability," Feeney said. An unexpected rise in hog prices this summer amid talk that China was going to buy pork was part of the reason for Tyson lowering fiscal 2007 earnings guidance, Chief Executive Richard Bond said during the Lehman Brothers investor conference. The price increase happened so quickly the company was unable to raise pork prices enough to offset it, he said. "It was a short-term effect, but it did affect more than half of the (fourth) quarter," Bond said. "But by and large it has corrected itself. Live hog prices have come down, they haven't come down all that they went up, but we have been able to get our margins close to back in line." Tyson buys the cattle and hogs it processes into beef and pork, but raises the chickens it processes. Bond said in addition to a goal of $30 billion in sales in fiscal year 2010, Tyson aims to have total debt under $2 billion by then, compared with a debt of $3.2 billion in fiscal year 2006, and to have fiscal year earnings of $2 per share. Tyson shares fell 12.9 percent to $19.17 on Wednesday. (Reporting by  Bob Burgdorfer , with additional reporting by Brad Dorfman in Chicago and Sweta Singh in Bangalore)
