 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N raised its 2007 earnings forecast on Wednesday, citing a lower-than-expected tax rate, the pace of share repurchases, and increased confidence in its growth initiatives. 

 The largest North American packaged foods maker said it now expects 2007 earnings of $1.80 to $1.82 a share before one-time items, compared with its previous forecast of $1.75 to $1.80. Kraft, which makes products ranging from Oreo cookies to Oscar Mayer bacon, plans to spend an additional $300 million to $400 million in 2007 on new product development, improvements to existing products, and increased marketing as it tries to boost sales and improve profit margins. The company is also trying to streamline its corporate structure, sharing services across different parts of the business. Like most food companies, Kraft has been grappling with higher costs for ingredients like wheat, milk and nuts while it increases marketing spending. In August, the company said that less than half of its revenue comes from businesses that are increasing their market share. Kraft shares were up 32 cents, or 1 percent, at $32.47 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 9 percent this year, compared with a 2.4 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's packaged foods index . (See  here  for "Shop Talk" -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog)
