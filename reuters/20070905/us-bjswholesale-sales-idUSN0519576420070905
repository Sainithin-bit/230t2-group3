 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - No. 3 U.S. warehouse club operator BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N said on Wednesday that its August sales at its clubs open at least a year rose 1.4 percent, meeting analysts' expectations. 

 The results came the same day that Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ), the largest U.S. warehouse club, reported a weaker-than-expected 2 percent rise in August same-store sales, hurt in part by a decline in customer traffic, especially in its California clubs. While Costco blamed "extreme high temperatures" in California for the decline, the results raised worries that the deteriorating housing market in that state could be affecting shoppers' propensity to spend. BJ's does not operate clubs in California and is in the middle of a turnaround plan aimed at getting its business back on track after a string of disappointing sales results. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs retail conference in New York on Wednesday, Chief Executive Herbert Zarkin said his clubs tend to cater to higher-income shoppers, who are somewhat insulated from the deteriorating housing market. While BJ's does operate a number of clubs in Florida, where the housing market is struggling, Zarkin said: "It's not something we can't manage." He also said the retailer, which is working to improve its merchandise, expects a "very, very good fourth quarter," assuming normal weather conditions. BJ's said total sales for the four weeks ended September 1 increased 6.4 percent to $661.7 million from $622.2 million. The retailer, which operates 175 BJ's clubs in 16 states, said that on a comparable club basis, food sales increased by approximately 5 percent, while general merchandise sales rose by roughly 3 percent. It said departments with strong sales increases compared with a year ago included air conditioners, frozen food, meat, milk, office supplies, soda and televisions. BJ's said weaker departments included cigarettes, electronics, furniture, tires and toys. Shares closed down 16 cents at $34.52 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri )
