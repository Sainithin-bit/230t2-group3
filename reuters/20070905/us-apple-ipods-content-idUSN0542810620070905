 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc Chief Executive Steve Jobs said on Wednesday he hoped that former content partners such as NBC Universal would reconsider their decisions to not sell some songs and videos on the iTunes Web store. 

 "We hope they'll reconsider their decisions over time and maybe find out that iTunes and iPods are a great way to digitally distribute their content to tens or maybe hundreds of millions of customers around the world," Jobs said in an interview. He added that there was a "lot more room to grow" for iPod music and video players.
