 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc is developing an advertising and public relations plan to address a recent series of recalls as the toymaker heads into the key holiday toy selling season. 

 "Advertising and PR campaigns that are specific to the recall are currently in development," Mattel spokeswoman Michele Sturdivant said Wednesday, declining to give further details because the plans were still being developed. "We are a marketing driven company, so it would be safe to assume that we absolutely need to address this during the holiday season," Sturdivant said.
