 VANCOUVER, British Columbia  (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd ( CP.TO ) agreed to buy Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corp for at least $1.5 billion, a move that could give CP access to the coal-rich Powder River Basin that the regional U.S. carrier had struggled to reach. 

 A decision on expanding into the lucrative coal fields is at least a year away, but the purchase of the largest U.S. regional rail carrier will boost earnings at Canada's No. 2 railway either way, chief executive Fred Green said. "I look at the (Powder River Basin) as the icing on the cake... You've got this great enterprise that is already doing well and has growth within it in the ethanol business," Green said on Wednesday. Calgary, Alberta-based CP has extensive U.S. operations, but buying privately-held DM&E will boost its network by about 2,500 miles. The deal includes DM&E subsidiary, the Iowa, Chicago & Eastern and requires regulatory approval. CP will pay $1.48 billion for DM&E including assumed debt. It will make $1 billion in contingency payments if it pursues construction of the 280-mile rail line from South Dakota into Wyoming and reaches certain shipping targets by 2025. Sioux Falls, South Dakota-based DM&E, which operates in eight U.S. states, has pursued a goal of being the third rail carrier in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB), North America's largest and fastest growing low-cost, low-sulphur coal source. Union Pacific Corp ( UNP.N ) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp BNI.N, the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. railroads respectively, are now the only rail companies hauling coal out of the basin. The DM&E has regulatory approvals for the expansion, but began looking for a buyer after the Federal Railroad Administration in February rejected its application for $2.3 billion in government funding. If CP pursues the project, construction would take two to three years, Green said. Analysts have said it would cost about $6 billion, but CP executives called that estimate too high. "If it takes us 12 months (to decide) or 30 months, that's okay too. What's important is can we create a set of conditions that make this a fantastic next-step investment," Green said. The coal plan has faced political opposition, but a group upset about more rail traffic near the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota said it looks forward to meeting with CP. CP SHARES DROP Canadian Pacific shares were off C$2.92 at C$70.55 late on Wednesday. Anthony Hatch, a railroad analyst at New York-based ABH Consulting, said CP Rail was paying a "hefty price" for DM&E, reflecting not only its existing network but also the "real value of its project potential." CP was itself the focus of interest from private equity buyers this summer, but Bear Sterns Analyst Ed Wolfe said this deal "effectively removes CP as a potential LBO candidate." "The issue is whether on top of the large price paid for DM&E, CP can also fund an estimated $3 billion build in to the PRB and still make a profit 4-5 years from now," he said. DM&E was created in the 1980s from lines rejected as uneconomical by Chicago & North Western Railway, now owned by Union Pacific. Green acknowledged Union Pacific still has a right of first refusal in DM&E, but said that would not block this deal or its expansion into Wyoming. CP will spend $300 million to upgrade DM&E infrastructure even if the coal plan is not pursued, but Green rejected suggestions the track was in poor condition. Minority DM&E shareholder L.B. Foster Co ( FSTR.O ) said it expects to receive $151.5 million from the deal, while Candover Investments Plc ( CDI.L ) valued its investment at 27.4 million pounds sterling. Up to $350 million more will be paid to Electra Private Equity if the expansion goes forward. (Additional reporting by  Nick Carey  and  Lewis Krauskopf )
