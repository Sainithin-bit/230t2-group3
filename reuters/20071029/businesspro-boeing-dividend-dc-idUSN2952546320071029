 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Monday it 
would buy up to $7 billion of its own stock, one of the 
plane-maker's largest repurchase plans on record, but kept its 
cash dividend unchanged.  The announcement comes amid a three-month slide in Boeing 
shares, which have lost about 10 percent of their value after 
hitting an all-time high in July, as production problems have 
delayed the company's new 787 Dreamliner.  Boeing's shares added to gains shortly after the 
announcement, and closed up 97 cents at $96.99 in afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They hit their all-time 
high of $107.80 on July 25.  The plan allows the repurchase of about 9 percent of 
Boeing's outstanding shares at current prices. Boeing's biggest 
plan on record authorized the repurchase of about 15 percent of 
outstanding shares in 1998, the year after it took over rival 
McDonnell Douglas Corp.  Boeing suspended stock buybacks after the attacks of 
September 11 and resumed only in 2004. Since then, it has 
bought about $8 billion of its own stock. Its last repurchase 
authorization, which is nearing completion, was for $3 billion 
worth of stock, set in August 2006. The new authorization has 
no specified time limit.  "Our strong financial performance allows us to return value 
to our shareholders while continuing to invest in our growth 
and becoming more productive," said Boeing Chief Executive Jim 
McNerney, in a statement. "We are executing a balanced cash 
deployment strategy that's serving Boeing and its shareholders 
well."  The Chicago-based company reported third-quarter profits up 
almost 60 percent to $1.1 billion last week, helped by brisk 
sales of its commercial jets. But it scaled back its revenue 
forecast for next year due to delays on its 787 Dreamliner and 
slowing growth at its defense unit.  The world's biggest-selling jet maker, which is also the 
No. 2 U.S. defense contractor, earlier this month said its 
hot-selling 787 would be at least six months late as it 
wrestles with uncompleted work from suppliers, integrating the 
plane's software and an acute shortage of bolts.  Boeing, which vies with Europe's Airbus ( EAD.PA ) for 
control of the jetliner market, said it was still addressing 
"challenges" as it builds the first batch of 787s.  The company kept its regular quarterly dividend unchanged 
on Monday, at 35 cents per share. The next dividend is payable 
December 7 to shareholders of record as of November 9.  (Reporting by Bill Rigby)
