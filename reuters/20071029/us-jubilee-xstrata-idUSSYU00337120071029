 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata XTA.L offered A$3.1 billion ($2.8 billion) on Monday for Australia's fifth-largest nickel producer Jubilee Mines NL JBM.AX, the latest outback miner to catch the eye of a big international firm as metal prices soar. 

 Jubilee shares jumped 42 percent to record A$24.25, above the A$23.00 offer price, suggesting investors think a higher offer may emerge after Jubilee said it had entertained multiple expressions of interest. Potential counter suitors include BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ), which already buys all of Jubilee's ore for smelting, Brazil's CVRD ( VALE5.SA )( RIO.N ) and Russia's Norilsk, which outbid Xstrata earlier this year for another Australia nickel miner, analysts said. "There have been expectations of consolidation in the sector for a long time," said Rob Craigie, a mining analyst with F.W. Holst & Co in Melbourne. "I wouldn't be surprised if there were others who might look at Jubilee or some of the other smaller nickel stocks." Australia's abundance of iron ore, nickel, gold and other minerals is attracting a swelling brigade of overseas investors betting that a global raw materials boom will go on for years. At A$23 a share, Xstrata is offering a 35 percent premium to Jubilee's Friday close. The bid values Jubilee at nearly 18 times its forecast 2007/08 earnings of about A$175 million, according to Reuters Estimates, compared with PE's of about 15 for BHP Billiton and nearly 17 for Rio Tinto. Jubilee mines around 12,000 tonnes of nickel a year, which is less than 1 percent of global output, from its Cosmos nickel mine in Western Australia, and plans to develop a second project, taking annual output to 22,000 tonnes a year in the next three or four years. Xstrata's nickel division, headquartered in Toronto, is the world's fourth largest, with yearly output of more than 110,000 tonnes of refined nickel. Global nickel MNI3 prices have risen to around $32,000 per tonne on expectations of stronger demand for stainless steel after hitting a one-year low of $25,060 in August. Jubilee's board, including the single largest company shareholder, Executive Chairman Kerry Harmanis, has given its blessing to the offer. Harmanis, whose roughly 15 percent stake is worth around A$450 million, said it was a good time to sell the company, which he helped build over two decades. "I feel comfortable I can let go of it. The price helped." Australian-listed Consolidated Minerals Ltd CSM.AX, a miner of manganese and nickel, is the target of competing A$1 billion-plus bids by South African and Ukranian private equity groups. Chinese companies, such as Baosteel ( 600019.SS ), Sinosteel and Chalco ( 2600.HK ) ( 601600.SS ) are taking stakes or funding infrastructure work in emerging iron ore and aluminum firms, while also helping underwrite new offshore gas fields. Also on Monday, Canada's Northgate NGX.TO launched a A$282 million takeover for Perseverance Corp PSV.AX, which produces about 190,000 ounces of gold a year in Australia. Jubilee is not the first Australian nickel miner Xstrata has wanted to buy, although its exposure is so far limited to its part-owner Glencore International AG's growing interest in Minara Resources Ltd MRE.AX, with three times Jubilee's production. Glencore last week lifted its stake in Minara 1.4 percent to 52.2 percent. Earlier this year, Xstrata was outbid for mid-tier nickel miner LionOre Mining by Russia's Norilsk ( GMKN.MM ), which eventually paid $6.79 billion. STRONG INTEREST Xstrata has agreed to buy 17.5 percent of Jubilee's shares from shareholders and optionholders. Harmanis said the company had opened its doors to several parties after receiving a number of expressions of interest, but believed Xstrata's offer was the best. "Jubilee is ... at an important stage and will benefit from the deeper capabilities and balance sheet of a major mining company such as Xstrata to maximize the potential of its resource base," he said. The Jubilee offer drove up the shares of other miners, with Sally Malay SMY.AX up 16 percent and Oxiana Resources OXR.AX up 7 percent. "If one big player gets a bit of a kick from a consolidation point of view, then everybody else seems to get it as well," said James Wilson, an analyst at broker DJ Carmichael. Xstrata Nickel Chief Executive Ian Pearce would not rule out pushing the Jubilee mines harder and said he would keep his ears open for more opportunities in Western Australia, where Xstrata was labeled "a enemy of the state" in 2005 by the then-premier Geoff Gallop over its handling of the closing of a vanadium mine. From a small, steel alloy producer known as Sudelektra in the late 1990s, Xstrata has grown rapidly to challenge the world's biggest miners. This month the go sign was given to the $3.8 billion development of the Koniambo nickel mine in New Caledonia, which it acquired after paying around $18 billion in 2006 for Canada's Falconbridge.
