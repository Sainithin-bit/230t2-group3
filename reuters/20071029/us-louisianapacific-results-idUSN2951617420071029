 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Louisiana-Pacific Corp ( LPX.N ), a building products maker, on Monday posted a worse-than-anticipated third-quarter loss as the slump in the U.S. housing market hurt demand and pricing for its products. 

 The company, whose shares fell 4 percent, reported a net loss of $67.8 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $9.5 million, or 9 cents a share. Excluding special items, the company lost 24 cents a share, Analysts, on average, had forecast a loss of 17 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "The continued deterioration in the market for new residential construction and the rising Canadian dollar drove our third-quarter operating results down," Chief Executive Rick Frost said in a statement. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company has numerous manufacturing facilities in Canada that export to the United States. The strengthening Canadian dollar has hurt U.S. demand for imports from Canada. Revenue in the quarter fell more than 10 percent to $472.5 million but beat the average Wall Street forecast of $449.01 million. Revenue was primarily hurt by a slump in sales of oriented strand board (OSB), an engineered wood product, which fell more than 17 percent to $228 million. Longbow Research analyst Joshua Zaret said the results were worse than expected mainly due to the poor OSB sales. "It is a very volatile sector, so it doesn't take much to swing the earnings significantly ... and OSB has been bouncing around the bottom," said Zaret. Earlier this month, the National Association of Home Builders said U.S. home builder sentiment had fallen to a record low in October. The share of U.S. residents who own their own home fell to 68.1 percent in the third quarter, the lowest level in over four years, according to a government report last week. Louisiana-Pacific, which is in the process of trimming operations, recently announced the sale of a plant in Idaho and the shut-down of a mill in Texas. Earlier this month it said it would take a $47 million charge in the third quarter related to the shutdown of operations at an OSB mill in Canada. The company's shares were down 66 cents to $15.51 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Euan Rocha )
