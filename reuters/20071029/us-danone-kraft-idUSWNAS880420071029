   CHICAGO (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N on Monday said it has signed final agreements to acquire Groupe Danone's ( DANO.PA ) global biscuit business for 5.3 billion euros (about $7.63 billion), a deal first announced in July. 

 Danone's board approved the deal after the recent conclusion of consultations with Danone's works council, which is required under French law. The two companies expect the deal to close by the end of the year, Kraft said. ($1=0.6933 euro)
