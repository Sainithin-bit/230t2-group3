 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp ( RSH.N ) reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit on Monday as it cut costs, and the electronics retailer said it expects improved earnings for the current quarter, sending its shares up as much as 9 percent. 

 But third-quarter sales fell amid intense competition from Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) and other chains. "Earnings have been improving because of the cost savings that have been implemented in the past year and a half," said Tiffany Co, director and credit analyst with Fitch Ratings. But she added that cost cuts can only help so much as time passes. "What is worrisome is if the company can't at least stabilize the sales trends ... negative sales trends will eat into the margins," she said. Third-quarter net income came to $46.3 million, or 34 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $16.3 million, or 12 cents a share. Analysts had expected 26 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 9.4 percent to $960.3 million, short of analysts' estimates of $988.1 million as tracked by Reuters Estimates. RadioShack's quarterly sales have declined for the past year. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key measure of retail performance, dropped 8.6 percent. The company said weaker sales trends in post-paid wireless was partly offset by strength in prepaid wireless phone and navigation systems. Gross margin expanded to 51 percent from 46.1 percent a year earlier, aided by improved inventory management. RadioShack has been closing unprofitable stores and reducing staff since Julian Day, a turnaround veteran, became chief executive last year. But weakening sales have raised concern as competition increases amid a slowing environment for consumer spending. "Best Buy is pretty much capturing market share from the other operators," Co said. "The one thing that RadioShack has to its advantage is that it's still very convenient" in terms of store location. Selling, general and administrative expenses fell 13 percent in the third quarter as the company kept down costs for payroll and professional fees. Cash balances rose $417 million at the end of the third quarter, up $141 million from a year earlier. The retailer said it expects improved fourth-quarter earnings but added that conditions would be "challenging." RadioShack repurchased $162 million of stock in the third quarter. RadioShack shares were up $1.20, or 6 percent, to $20.82 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year the shares have risen 25 percent.
