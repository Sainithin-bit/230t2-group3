 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker on Monday dismissed repeated rumors that the media company would be sold by parent General Electric ( GE.N ). 

 Speaking at an event in New York, Zucker said GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt had been "very clear" about NBC Universal's role within the company. "He has said numerous times that NBCU is not for sale," Zucker said. "It is not for sale after the Olympics." The latest report to circulate about NBC Universal's status appeared earlier this month in the Financial Times, which wrote that the fate of the media company would be decided after the Beijing Olympics. Zucker said some of the rumors about a sale had "quieted down" as NBC Universal's performance has improved. "If we don't perform, GE should sell NBCU," Zucker said during a media event sponsored by Syracuse's S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. "Fact is, we've performed." NBC Universal is majority owned by GE. Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) holds a 20 percent stake. (Reporting by  Paul Thomasch )
