 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Humana Inc ( HUM.N ) posted sharply higher quarterly profit on Monday, above Wall Street's average estimate, on strength in its Medicare health plans for the elderly and its plans for employers, and forecast 2008 earnings ahead of analysts' expectations. 

 The health insurer said it would add at least 200,000 members to its full-service Medicare Advantage plans in 2008, exceeding many analysts' projections. But Humana shares, after rising nearly 8 percent and reaching an all-time high in opening trading, were off 3 percent in afternoon dealings. David Heupel, a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management, said investors continue to fret about possible legislative changes to Medicare, the U.S. government health program for the elderly, that would crimp reimbursements to insurers. Humana is one of the largest Medicare providers, aggressively expanding its business as it takes advantage of a larger private-sector role. Heupel also noted the strong recent performance of Humana's stock, which has outperformed other large health insurers this year. "I think (investors are) going to keep these stocks somewhat contained," he said. At the same time, Heupel said there was nothing to point to in Humana's report that would hurt the stock. Third-quarter net income rose to $302.4 million, or $1.78 per share, from $159.2 million, or 95 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings of $1.53 per share beat analysts' average forecast by 5 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The Louisville, Kentucky-based company said improvements in its Medicare prescription-drug plans and commercial plans for employers helped results beat expectations. Revenue increased 12 percent to $6.32 billion. "Humana is the latest in a string of companies to report higher Medicare earnings and an optimistic 2008 Medicare outlook," CIBC analyst Carl McDonald said in a research note. Membership in the company's Medicare Advantage plans grew to 1.14 million at September 30, up 145,000 from a year earlier. Humana, one of the largest Medicare providers, projected enrolling 200,000 to 250,000 more Medicare Advantage members during 2008. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch called the 2008 outlook "very strong," with the Medicare Advantage enrollment projections exceeding his expectations. Membership in Medicare plans offering only prescription drug benefits totaled 3.46 million at the end of the third quarter, down about 60,000 from a year earlier but up 20,000 from the second quarter. The company's medical expense ratio, a key profitability measure of premium revenue spent on medical costs, improved to 81.3 percent from 84.1 percent a year earlier. Excluding special items, Humana estimated full-year 2007 earnings of $4.50 to $4.55 per share, ahead of analysts' target of $4.52. It forecast 2008 earnings of $5.30 to $5.50, against Wall Street's expectations of $5.20. The forecast puts Humana on a pace to boost annual earnings per share by more than 2.5 times from 2005 through 2008. Humana shares were down $2.46 to $73.10 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares earlier rose as high as $81.44. The stock has climbed 34 percent this year, outpacing a 10.5 percent rise in the Morgan Stanley Healthcare Payor index .HMO, a broad gauge of health-insurer stocks.
