 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Host Hotels & Resorts Inc ( HST.N ) said on Monday Chief Financial Officer W. Edward Walter will become its new chief executive after Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) poached its current CEO to run recently acquired Hilton Hotels Corp. 

 The sudden management change comes with the U.S. hotel industry showing signs of a slowdown after years of booming growth. Robust demand and limited construction of new hotels allowed hotel owners to steadily raise rates, but growth, especially in the United States, has been slowing. Shares of Host Hotels, which owns more than 120 hotels under brand names such as Marriott, Hilton and Four Seasons, fell nearly 3 percent. Walter, 52, will succeed Christopher Nassetta, who will leave Host Hotels at the end of November to become chief executive of Hilton. "We believe the company is fundamentally in good hands with Mr. Walter at the reins," said Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Woronka in a note. "We wouldn't look for any material changes in Host Hotels' strategic direction as a result of the change in leadership." Walter has been CFO at Host Hotels, the largest U.S. hotel real estate investment trust, since 2003. He joined the company, previously known as Host Marriott, in 1996. NEW HILTON HEAD Nassetta, 45, will be charged with accelerating the expansion of Hilton's brands, which include Doubletree, Hampton Inn and Waldorf-Astoria, especially outside the United States, where Hilton is relatively under represented and growth prospects are better. Blackstone, which financed the Hilton acquisition with $20.6 billion in debt, said it has no plans to sell any of Hilton's brands or major assets. At Hilton, Nassetta succeeds Stephen Bollenbach, who retired, as planned, with the completion of Blackstone's acquisition of Hilton. His appointment came at the expense of Matthew Hart, who had previously been designated to become Hilton's CEO. Blackstone said Hart will step down as Hilton's president and chief operating officer but will continue to serve on the company's board. Host Hotels shares, which have fallen about 23 percent since hitting a 10-year high of $28.98 on February 13, fell 62 cents to $21.75 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
