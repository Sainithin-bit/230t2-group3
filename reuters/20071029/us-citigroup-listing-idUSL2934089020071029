 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) said on Monday it had received approval to list shares in Tokyo early next month, as the largest U.S. bank continues to boost its presence in the world's second-largest economy. 

 The listing may be the final step in the bank's campaign to rebrand itself as a local lender after spending more than 100 years as a niche player in Tokyo. Citigroup said earlier this month it would buy out minority shareholders in Nikko Cordial Corp 8603.T, Japan's third-largest brokerage, for $4.6 billion. That would give the U.S. firm full control of more than 100 brokerage outlets and a name well known to domestic investors. "Our (Tokyo Stock Exchange) listing, along with localizing our banking operations and forming our strategic alliance with Nikko Cordial, move us even closer to becoming the leading comprehensive banking and securities group in Japan," Doug Peterson, Citigroup's chief executive in Japan, said in a statement. Citigroup has been offering its own shares to buy the remaining 32 percent in did not own in Nikko, with the intention of listing itself of the Tokyo exchange. The U.S. bank has also been expanding its retail branch network, looking to tap into Japan's millions of wealthy individuals and the country's estimated $13 trillion in household assets. Earlier this year it became the first foreign lender to receive approval to operate as a local entity. Shares of Citigroup will begin trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange on November 5 under the name "Citi", the company said.
