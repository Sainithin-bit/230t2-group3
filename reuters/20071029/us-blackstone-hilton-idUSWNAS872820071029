 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) said on Monday it plans to invest in recently acquired Hilton Hotels Corp and has no plans to sell any of the company's brands or major assets. 

 Blackstone also said Matthew Hart, previously designated to become Hilton's CEO after the retirement of Stephen Bollenbach, will step down as Hilton president and chief operating officer. Hart will continue to serve on the company's board. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter )
