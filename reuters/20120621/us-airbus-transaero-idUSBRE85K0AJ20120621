 ST PETERSBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Russia's second-biggest airline Transaero has signed a deal to buy four Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A380 superjumbo planes worth a combined $1.7 billion at list prices, and placed an order for Russian-made Superjet-100s. 
 Deliveries will begin in 2015, Transaero Chief Executive Officer Olga Pleshakova told reporters on Thursday. The privately-owned airline secured financing from state bank VEB after reaching a provisional agreement to buy the aircraft last year. The long-haul A380 jets, to carry up to 700 passengers, will operate on Asian, Central American and European routes, said Pleshakova. Transaero also agreed to buy six Sukhoi Superjet-100 planes, with deliveries in 2015-2017, worth $212.4 million, and signed an option to acquire 10 more. The plane, built using Western technology, is Russia's first civil aircraft designed after the fall of the Soviet Union. A Sukhoi Superjet crashed during a demonstration flight in Indonesia last month killing 45 people, which industry experts said could dent the plane maker's ambitious plans to compete internationally with Brazil's Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) and Canada's Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ). Transaero is the number two carrier behind state-controlled Aeroflot ( AFLT.MM ).
