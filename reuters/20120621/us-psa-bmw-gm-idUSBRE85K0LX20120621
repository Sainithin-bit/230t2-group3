 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) said Thursday it was examining the impact of its alliance with General Motors ( GM.N ) on their project with BMW ( BMWG.DE ) to make hybrid cars. 
 A company spokesman told Reuters: "We are examining the impact of our alliance with GM on the joint venture...It's clear the alliance changes the conditions of our partnership." An article in La Tribune posted on the website Wednesday said that BMW wanted to buy out PSA's stake in the joint venture because it did not like the PSA's recent alliance with GM and was worried about the French carmaker's financial stability.
