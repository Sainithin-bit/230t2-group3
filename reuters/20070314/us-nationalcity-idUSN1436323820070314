 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National City Corp. NCC.N, the No. 9 U.S. bank, on Wednesday said it wrote off $11 million stemming from subprime home loans, expects to write off more, and may boost reserves by $50 million because an insurer is rejecting mortgage-related claims. 


 The losses caused some analysts to reduce their first-quarter profit forecasts for the Cleveland-based bank. National City's losses are the latest stemming from the troubled subprime sector. Defaults are rising among borrowers with poor credit histories, threatening some lenders' survival. The bank in December sold its First Franklin Financial Corp. subprime unit to Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N for $1.3 billion, but kept some loans. In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, National City said it may boost reserves by $50 million because an unnamed insurance carrier "has been rejecting a meaningful number of claims" related to a $2.2 billion portfolio of second mortgages. National City believes the rejections are inappropriate and said it may seek contractual or judicial relief. A second carrier has been paying claims, the bank said. The $11 million write-down stems from the bank's inability to sell $1.6 billion of First Franklin loans at a fair price because of "adverse market conditions." National City said it will keep the loans, but "a further write-down is likely." Separately, National City said it incurred a $45 million pretax loss in January and February from hedging related to mortgage servicing rights. Friedman Billings Ramsey & Co. analyst Gary Townsend reduced his first-quarter profit forecast to 61 cents per share from 69 cents. Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst Lori Appelbaum reduced her forecast to 63 cents per share from 70 cents. "Mortgage results remain extremely challenging," wrote Appelbaum, who rates National City "neutral." Townsend rates it "market perform." National City has reduced its dependency on mortgages. In the last four months, it spent $2.1 billion to buy two Florida banks, Fidelity Bankshares Inc. and Harbor Florida Bancshares Inc., to add exposure in the fast-growing state, and outside its slower-growing Midwest base. National City took $172 million of fourth-quarter charges, or 28 cents per share, for credit losses related to First Franklin. Last month, it said it was running off its remaining $7.5 billion First Franklin-originated loan portfolio. In afternoon trading, National City shares fell 31 cents to $35.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at $36.56.
