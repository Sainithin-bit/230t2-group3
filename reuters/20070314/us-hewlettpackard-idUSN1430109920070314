 SANTA CLARA, Calif  (Reuters) - Hours before Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) shareholders convened their annual meeting on Wednesday, a judge dismissed charges against HP's former chairman, Patricia Dunn, for her role in a boardroom spying scandal. 


 The California judge, in a ruling that triggered concerns about whether U.S. privacy law is strong enough to protect individuals, cited health concerns in dismissing the case against Dunn, who is battling breast cancer. He also offered three other defendants the same result if they completed 96 hours of community service and paid restitution. The world's largest maker of personal computers came under state and federal scrutiny because of the tactics used to find the source of media leaks in 2005 and 2006. HP hired investigators who impersonated reporters, board members and employees to obtain private telephone records. The quick end to the state case came just hours before HP shareholders met to assess the state of the company after one of the most tumultuous years in its history. "It shows how difficult it is to vindicate privacy rights given the state of American law right now," said Joel Reidenberg, a Fordham University School of Law professor and privacy law expert. "There is very wide consensus that what HP did was wrongful -- the company has admitted it was wrongful." "Yet privacy law does not give an easy redress right now." Last October, former California Attorney General Bill Lockyer filed criminal charges against Dunn, who resigned on September 22, and four others, saying "one of our state's most venerable corporate institutions lost its way." On Wednesday, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Ray Cunningham dismissed the case against Dunn. He also refused "no contest" pleas from former HP executive Kevin Hunsaker and private investigators Ronald DeLia and Matthew DePante, and offered to dismiss the case against them if they complete the community service and pay restitution by September 12. In January, Bryan Wagner, a Colorado private investigator, pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiracy charges, the first conviction in the case. The end to the criminal cases in California does not preclude separate federal charges in the future, the California Attorney General's office said. HUNTING MEDIA LEAKS The probes, which came to light last September, sullied the reputation of a Silicon Valley stalwart that prided itself on doing things the "HP way." But investors have seen matters differently, and the company's share price is up 19 percent from a year ago thanks to strong sales in its personal computing business. Dunn, who also appeared before the U.S. Congress to testify about the HP probe, had said she regretted the way the investigation was handled but did not accept personal responsibility for any deceptive tactics. "I am pleased that this matter has been resolved fairly," Dunn said in a statement on Wednesday. "I have always had faith that the truth would win out and justice would be served -- and it has been." Hunsaker's lawyer, Tom Nolan, said there would be no acknowledgment of guilt or responsibility by Hunsaker and the other defendants. (Additional reporting by Jason Bennert and  Michael Kahn )
