 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rebounded on Wednesday as hard-hit financial shares recovered on the view that fears of the subprime mortgage problem spreading were overblown and had left stocks looking inexpensive. 


 The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 57.12 points, or 0.48 percent, at 12,133.40. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 9.22 points, or 0.67 percent, at 1,387.17. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 21.17 points, or 0.90 percent, at 2,371.74.
