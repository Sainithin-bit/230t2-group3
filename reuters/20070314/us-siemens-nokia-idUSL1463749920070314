 FRANKFURT/HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Finnish handset maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and German conglomerate Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) will start operations of their telecoms-network joint venture on April 1, they both said on Wednesday. 


 The 50-50 joint venture, which will be the world's second-biggest mobile-networks company and the third-biggest in fixed-line infrastructure, had been due to begin at the start of 2007 but was delayed by a corruption investigation at Siemens. Nokia and Siemens said based on the results of a pre-closing compliance review they agreed on compliance and control process, which would be based on Nokia's system and practices as the Finnish firm will consolidate the results of the venture. Some market players expected the companies to miss also their stated end-Q1 target due to ongoing investigations at Siemens. The venture aims to cut annual costs by 1.5 billion euros, in part through cutting 10-15 percent of initial staff of 60,000 during the first four years of business. The companies said they had agreed to increase their respective net asset contributions to Nokia Siemens Networks, with Siemens contributing 2.4 billion euros ($3.17 billion) and Nokia 1.7 billion euros. "In taking this step, we are dramatically strengthening our market position and creating sustainable value," Siemens Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld said in a statement. Earlier, the both firm's had set to put in net assets worth 1.6 billion euros. The companies said Nokia's Chief Executive Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo would become the chairman of the new company's board, which would have 4 members from Nokia and 3 from Siemens.
