 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The case against former Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) Chairman Patricia Dunn, who ultimately resigned amid a board-leak spying scandal, was dismissed on Wednesday. 


 The three other defendants, Kevin Hunsaker, a former HP executive, and private investigators Ronald DeLia and Matthew DePante pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of fraudulent wire communications, their lawyers said in court. Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Ray Cunningham dismissed the case against Dunn, citing her health concerns. The cases against the other defendants will be dismissed if they complete 96 hours of community service and pay restitution by September 12, the judge said. Earlier, ahead of the court appearance, the California attorney general's office issued a statement that said Dunn, Hunsaker, DeLia and DePante would plead guilty to one misdemeanor count of fraudulent wire communications. In 2005 and 2006, HP's board, then led by Dunn, undertook an investigation to find the source of boardroom leaks to the media. The tactics used in the investigation included impersonating HP board members, employees and journalists to obtain their private telephone record. The practice is known as "pretexting." "It is a vindication of Pattie Dunn in every sense of the word," James Brosnahan, Dunn's lawyer, said outside court. Hunsaker's lawyer, Tom Nolan, said that there would be no acknowledgment of guilt or responsibility by Hunsaker and the other defendants. "We simply do not believe they committed a crime," Nolan said. The dismissal of Dunn's case and the plea by the other three defendants come on the same day as HP's annual shareholders meeting, to be held in Santa Clara, California.
