 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Oil services company Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ), which plans to move its chief executive to Dubai, said it will add more than 13,000 new employees in 2007. 


 In a memo sent to workers on Tuesday, Chief Operating Officer Andrew Lane wrote: "It is our expectation that our planned growth for 2007 to 2009 will mean that we will hire more than 13,000 new employees in 2007. This will include growth in our Houston employment numbers." The plans were first reported by the Associated Press. That growth pace is similar to 2006, when the company added more than 13,000 employees, Halliburton said. On Sunday, Halliburton said CEO David Lesar will open a corporate headquarters in Dubai. The move, which has generated political controversy, is aimed at expanding the Houston-based company's business in the Eastern Hemisphere. Wall Street analysts have said having its top executive in the region will lend Halliburton an edge when negotiating contracts in the oil-rich Middle East. But the company said it will maintain its legal registration in the United States and it does not expect any tax benefits from the move to UAE. Halliburton, which was led by Vice President Dick Cheney from 1995-2000, has drawn scrutiny from auditors, congressional Democrats and the Justice Department for the quality and pricing of its KBR Inc. ( KBR.N ) unit's work for the U.S. army in Iraq. Halliburton is in the process of splitting off KBR into a separate company. KBR, which provides construction and logistics services and is the Pentagon's largest contractor, has long been a drag on Halliburton's bottom line. Halliburton shares fell 44 cents, or more than 1 percent, to $31.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.
