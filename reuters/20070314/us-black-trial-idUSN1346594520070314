 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Prospective jurors who would decide whether toppled media mogul Conrad Black and his associates stole millions of dollars were quizzed on Wednesday about their attitudes on big business and big wealth. 


 "I can tell you there's nothing wrong with making a lot of money -- can you be impartial?" Judge Amy St. Eve of the U.S. District Court asked a procession of potential jurors. Jurors face a four-month trial with pay of $40 a day to pass judgment on Black, who once controlled a holding company with $2 billion in annual revenue. The judge also questioned prospective jurors about their attitudes to corporate profits and taxes, and the lengths that big corporations go to in trying to pay fewer taxes. Canadian-born Black faces charges of fraud, racketeering, tax violations, obstruction of justice, and money laundering. Three former associates of Black's at Chicago-based Hollinger International Inc. and its Canadian holding companies face fewer counts. Black, 62, could receive a 101-year prison sentence and more than $50 million in fines if convicted. By mid-afternoon on the first day of the proceedings, St. Eve had questioned about a third of potential jurors from a pool of more than 100. She appeared to be on target for her plan to find a jury by Friday and start the trial with opening statements on Monday. A few potential jurors said they felt they could not trust big business. One man said, "I'm a small person in this world. Sometimes corporations think they are above the law." But most said they could be fair when it came to questions of money and what people do with it. A member of Britain's House of Lords since 2001, Black is accused of misusing his company's money to finance a lavish lifestyle that included extravagant parties attended by celebrities at his homes in London, New York and Florida. Charges include using a company plane to go to the South Seas for a vacation and company funds to throw a birthday party for his wife, conservative columnist Barbara Amiel Black. Conrad Black has branded the charges "a massive smear job" and pronounced himself ready for battle in the case, which is being prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald recently prosecuted the case against White House aide Lewis "Scooter" Libby. "I want to face these accusers and expose this case for what it is," Black said after one pretrial hearing. The defendants are accused of siphoning off $84 million from the sales of newspapers and magazines that prosecutors say belonged to shareholders of Hollinger, a media giant once controlled by Black. The company, since renamed Sun-Times Media Group, has sold off hundreds of Canadian and U.S. newspapers as well as London's Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post. Each of the four defendants had at least two lawyers, ready to rebut the prosecution's key witness, former Black partner David Radler, who has pleaded guilty. Mentioned as potential witnesses for or against Black are former Pentagon official and fellow neoconservative Richard Perle, Illinois Republican powerhouse and former governor James Thompson, former secretary of state Henry Kissinger. They were members of Hollinger's board of directors who were supposed to oversee payments to Black and his associates. The case grew out of institutional shareholders' objections to payments pocketed by Black and his co-defendants tied to non-compete agreements with media properties that they were selling off.
