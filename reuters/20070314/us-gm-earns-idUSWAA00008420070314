 (Corrects Reuters Estimate figure in 4th paragraph to $1.20 
from $1.18) 


 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Wednesday said it swung to a profit with its delayed fourth-quarter results as it cut costs through a sweeping restructuring and saw gains in its core auto operations. The world's largest automaker by sales posted net income of $950 million, or $1.68 per share, compared with a loss of $6.6 billion, or $11.63 per share, a year earlier. Revenue was $51.2 billion compared with $51.7 billion a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, GM earned $180 million, or 32 cents per share, in the latest quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected a fourth-quarter profit of $1.20 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. GM, which had delayed its results from January, also restated net earnings going back to 2002, as it had said it would do because of accounting errors.
