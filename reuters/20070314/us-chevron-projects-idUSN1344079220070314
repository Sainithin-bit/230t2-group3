 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) said on Tuesday its developing oil and natural gas projects could produce about 1.1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2011, but surging costs may threaten some of the ventures. 


 The second-largest U.S. oil company raised cost estimates for several of its huge projects and pulled previously disclosed cost projections for many others, as it evaluates those projects to see which are viable. "The projects that are still in the evaluation phase are clearly going to be impacted by higher costs and we have to make choices," Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said at the company's analyst meeting in New York. "We're not going to invest in projects unless we can create value from them," he said. Oil industry costs have soared in recent years as booming crude oil prices have fueled demand for drilling rigs, steel and other materials. The company raised its cost projections for projects including its Athabasca oil sands project expansion in Canada, as well as projects in Indonesia and Kazakhstan. It declined to give projections for 11 projects expected to start production by the end of 2012. One project for which it pulled a cost forecast was the Gorgon gas field offshore Australia. Last year, Chevron forecast that the project would cost the company $10.4 billion. O'Reilly said the company was reevaluating the Gorgon project due to the costs, but is confident that Chevron will eventually have a project there. MORE THAN 3 PCT PRODUCTION GROWTH Chevron said production from its developing projects will give the company average annual output growth of at least 3 percent through 2010. It is making progress on more than 30 oil and gas development projects in which it is investing at least $1 billion each. Those projects would contribute to an average proved reserves replacement rate of more than 100 percent for the next five years. "Chevron has a great slate of projects, but it is going to be very challenging to bring them all on line," said independent analyst Kurt Wulff. Chevron's total capital spending for 2007 is still expected to be $19.6 billion, with 39 percent of that in North America, 25 percent in Africa, 19 percent in Asia-Pacific, 7 percent in the Caspian region, and 10 percent in the rest of the world. Wulff pointed out that Chevron is spending nearly as much as its much larger rival Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), which plans to shell out about $20 billion in 2007. "Investors can expect more growth from Chevron," he said. Chevron also plans to keep exploration spending high in the coming years. Spending on exploration would be "at a higher level than it's been in the past," Bobby Ryan, vice president for global exploration, told analysts, although the estimated $2 billion in spending for 2007 would be less than in 2006. In its refining operations, Chevron is seeking to add flexibility to its plants to process heavier and higher-sulphur crude oils. The company said it plans to selectively divest assets, which will give it a more focused footprint with a strong presence in fewer locations. Shares of Chevron fell 99 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $67.84 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday as oil prices dipped about 1.3 percent. (Additional reporting by  Matt Daily )
