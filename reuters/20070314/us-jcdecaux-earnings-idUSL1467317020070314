 PARIS  (Reuters) - JCDecaux ( JCDX.PA ), the world's second-largest outdoor advertising company, beat expectations with a 4.1 percent rise in 2006 net profit on Wednesday helped by strong demand in its transport division. 


 The company, Europe's largest outdoor advertising group, forecast 2007 underlying revenue growth similar to last year's 7.7 percent, but said costs tied to new contracts would pinch margins at its street furniture division. JCDecaux shares fell 3.7 percent to 21.53 euros at 0804 GMT. Its share have gained 4.14 percent so far this year, outperforming a flat media sector .SXMP. The company also said it was keen on assets of its two rivals, the outdoor advertising units of U.S. media giants CBS Corp ( CBSa.N ) and Clear Channel <CCU.N. "We are interested in assets of both CBS and Clear Channel should they become available," co-CEO Jean-Francois Decaux told CNBC television. The company said 2006 net profit rose 4.1 percent to 201.1 million euros ($265.1 million) and announced a 5 percent dividend hike to 0.42 euros per share. Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) increased 10.9 percent to 331.9 million euros and EBITDA rose 12.6 percent to 533.6 million euros. Operating margin as a percentage of sales was 27.4 percent from 27.2 percent in 2005. A drop of 10 basis points in the street furniture division's operating margin was offset by a 250 basis points rise in the transport unit's margin and a 230 basis points rise in the billboard division's margin. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had forecast an average net profit of 213 million euros, EBIT of 336 million euros, and EBITDA of 520 million euros. "These are solid 2006 results, notably on billboards and the revenue growth guidance should please as it is above consensus expectations, and that despite a hit on the street furniture margin, which was expected," one sector analyst said. The company said contract renewals in France and new contract wins in some of its street furniture markets would hit the operating margin of the street furniture unit in 2007 but this would be offset by development in transport and billboard. JCDecaux achieved underlying sales growth of 7.6 percent in the fourth quarter 2006 and 7.7 percent for the full year. Free cash flow decreased 5.1 percent to 179.5 million euros, due to an increase in net capital expenditures and a negative working capital variation over the year. Last week, JCDecaux unveiled an asset swap with Germany's Group Wall AG and the creation of a 50-50 percent joint venture to sell ad space in Germany. The group also recently signed a 10-year self-service bicycle and street furniture contract with the City of Paris.
