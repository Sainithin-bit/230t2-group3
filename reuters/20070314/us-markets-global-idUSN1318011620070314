 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. and European stocks fell to fresh 2007 lows on Wednesday and bonds firmed on fears losses in the fast-deteriorating U.S. subprime mortgage market would spread to other assets and regions. 


 U.S. stocks had opened higher but turned lower in afternoon trade, with the Dow and broader S&P index down more than 1 percent at one point as investors fretted anew about troubles faced by lenders who make loans to borrowers with weak credit. The Dow fell below 12,000 for the first time since November. Investors fear the problems of lenders who make subprime loans to people with poor credit are spreading to mainstream financial firms and will worsen the U.S. housing slowdown. "A lot of attention continues to be on the subprime meltdown and the ripple effect throughout the economy," said Weston Boone, managing director of listed trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. Shares of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N fell after the investment bank announced record quarterly earnings, but said results were partially offset by weakness in the U.S. residential mortgage sector. H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ), the largest U.S. income tax preparer, also fell victim to the housing sector's woes. Its shares fell 2.5 percent to $19.52 after it said it expected to delay filing its quarterly results with regulators and that estimated losses related to its subprime lending unit were $29 million higher than previously estimated. The decline in U.S. share prices on Wednesday followed a sharp drop on Tuesday after a bankers' group reported the proportion of mortgages in the initial stages of foreclosure rose to a record. Major stock indexes in Asia and Europe fell more than 2 percent on Wednesday, with shares of financial services companies slumping the most. In midday trade, losing issues outnumbered gainers nearly a three-to-one ratio on the New York Stock Exchange. The blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 50 points, or 0.40 percent, at 12,028.54. The broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 0.15 percent, while the technology heavy Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 0.07 percent. Analysts said Friday's quarterly expiration and settlement of March futures and options contracts, known as quadruple witching, added another ingredient in the brew. The event tends to stir volatility and volume as investors window-dress portfolios or exercise derivative positions, analysts said. "The market is still in trouble," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. "We're in option expiration and that tends to distort things wildly." STOCKS DOWN, BONDS UP As equity losses steepened and widened at midday, U.S. Treasuries prices, which have served as haven for nervous investors in recent weeks, edged up. "(Treasuries prices are) trading almost minute-to-minute inversely to stocks," said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank Private Banking in New York. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes was up 1/32 in price for a yield of 4.49 percent. Meanwhile, the dollar extended broad losses while paring gains against the yen. The dollar had risen against the yen after a report showed the U.S. current account gap shrank to $195.7 billion in the fourth quarter, down from a revised $229.3 billion in the third quarter and the smallest gap since 2005. But concerns about the U.S. housing market capped the greenback's gains and analysts said the dollar was mainly focused on the U.S. equity markets. The dollar was priced at 116.11 yen. The euro traded at $1.3239. Commodity prices were mostly lower, with gold ending lower in Europe. U.S. light crude oil fell further on Wednesday, down 42 cents to $57.51 a barrel, as sinking U.S. stock indexes rekindled worries about the economy of the world's biggest energy consumer.
