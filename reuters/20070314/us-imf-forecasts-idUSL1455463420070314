 PARIS  (Reuters) - Global economic growth is likely to slip to 4.9 percent in 2007 and 2008 after last year's bumper 5.3 percent, with U.S. growth slowing to 2.6 percent this year but rebounding in 2008, according to draft IMF forecasts obtained by Reuters. 


 The figures, obtained before publication of the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook in mid-April, suggest the performance of the past few years, the best in three decades, looks set to continue despite a U.S. lull. The figures put U.S. growth at 2.6 percent in 2007 and 3.0 percent in 2008, both 0.3 percentage points lower than the IMF forecast back in September, and following a 3.4 percent rise in gross domestic product in 2006. That fits with predictions by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development this week of a U.S. slowdown that would be offset primarily by continued healthy growth in Europe in 2007. The IMF press office at its Washington headquarters declined comment on the figures. The forecasts envisage growth in the euro area of 2.3 percent this year and next year after 2.8 percent in 2006, which marked a major recovery and the best performance in six years. Those figures are a third of a percentage point higher than the IMF was forecasting previously for this year and higher by almost as much for 2008 -- showing the extent to which Europe may offset the drop in U.S. growth. The IMF put growth in Japan at 2.2 percent in 2007 and 1.9 percent in 2008, after 2.2 percent in 2006. Despite the prospect of healthy global growth, investors sold off shares for a second day running on Wednesday, in a renewed bout of risk aversion blamed on trouble in the U.S. mortgage market, where at least two dozen firms have closed shop amid rising defaults by borrowers with weak credit. The Dow Jones industrial shares index fell more than half of a percent in early U.S. trading after losses of well over two percent in Europe and Japan. WHAT TURMOIL? Within Europe, the IMF is counting for the moment on German growth of 1.8 percent in both 2007 and 2008 after 2.7 percent in 2006, according to the draft figures. The growth forecast for France is 1.9 percent this year and 2.3 percent in 2008, after 2.0 percent last year. Italy, third biggest economy in the euro zone after Germany and France respectively, is seen growing 1.8 percent this year and 1.7 percent next, after 1.9 in 2006. For Britain, the draft figures put growth at 2.9 percent this year -- the fastest for any G7 country -- and 2.7 percent in 2008, unchanged from 2006. For Canada, the GDP rise is put at 2.5 percent this year and 3.0 percent next year, after 2.8 percent in 2006. The IMF also includes Spain on its list of big players in the industrialized world, with the draft figures pointing to growth there of 3.4 percent in 2007 and 3.3 percent in 2008, after 3.8 in 2006. In the higher-growth world of emerging giants, Chinese GDP is seen expanding 10 percent in 2007 and 9.5 percent in 2008, in line with government plans there to slow the pace after growth of 10.7 percent growth in 2006. For India, the IMF's draft figures point to growth of 8.3 percent this year and 7.8 percent next year after 9.3 percent in 2006. Expansion in world trade is likely to slow to 6.9 percent in 2007 from 9.1 percent in 2006 and pick back up to 7.4 percent in 2008, according to the draft forecasts. The IMF's global GDP growth figure for last year, 5.3 percent, matches that of 2004 as the best since the early 1970s.
