 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) and Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N shareholders both overwhelmingly approved Freeport's $25.9 billion acquisition of rival miner Phelps on Wednesday, the companies said. 


 At each meeting, approximately 98 percent of the votes cast supported the transaction, which will create the world's largest publicly traded copper producer, they said in a joint statement. The transaction is expected to close on March 19. Under terms of the merger agreement, Phelps Dodge shareholders will receive $88 in cash and 0.67 of a share of Freeport's common stock for each Phelps share. That is the equivalent of $125.53 based on the closing price of Freeport's common stock on March 13, the companies said. The cash portion of $18 billion represents approximately 70 percent of the total consideration. Following completion of the transaction, there will be approximately 334 million shares outstanding. Freeport stockholders, meeting in Delaware, also approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of Freeport common stock from 423.6 million to 700.0 million. Phelps shareholders voted in Phoenix, Arizona, where the company is based and where the combined company will have headquarters; Freeport has been based in New Orleans. Upon closing, Freeport will operate a diverse portfolio of copper, gold and molybdenum reserves. The Grasberg, Indonesia, mine, the world's largest copper and gold mine in terms of reserves, will be the key asset of the combined company. It will also operate significant mines in North and South America and proceed with development of the world-class Tenke Fungurume project in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In a bid to smooth the way for the votes, Freeport last week settled three class-action suits by Phelps shareholders who were concerned that Freeport would sell off valuable assets after the deal's close. On Monday, a market source familiar with the sale said that Freeport had set price talk on a $6 billion three-part note sale to help finance the acquisition. Both companies' stocks slipped on Wednesday partly because metals markets continued to feel the impact of Tuesday's sell-off in U.S. equities. U.S. copper futures pared earlier losses to trade slightly higher. In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Freeport shares were down 62 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $55.40. Phelps' were 32 cents lower at $124.93.
