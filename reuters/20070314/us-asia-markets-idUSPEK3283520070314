 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian stocks and bonds, back in a downswing triggered by a deepening U.S. mortgage lending crisis, are expected to extend losses as investors shun risky assets and export firms. 


 The biggest danger, as always in Asia, is that a U.S. economic slowdown would weaken demand for Asian goods in their No. 1 target market, investors said on Wednesday. Barring that, bearish investor sentiment alone could lead to a sell-off in emerging markets -- a scenario that played out just two weeks ago. "This kind of news flow will probably keep sentiment low for a while until we get a better handle on the actual damage," said Binay Chandgothia, chief investment officer for Principal Asset Management's Hong Kong operation. It doesn't help that many Asia bourses not long ago were at record highs and emerging market bond spreads are razor thin by historical standards, raising the prospects of a rout as investors scramble to take money off the table. Asian shares slumped on Wednesday, tracking heavy falls on Wall Street triggered by growing losses at subprime lending firms -- those operating at the riskier end of the home loan market. "Any problems within any part of the credit market should have broader implications. It's just a function of time before this weaves through the markets," said Moe Ibrahim, fund manager Asia Debt Fund, which manages about $275 million in assets. "In this environment you want to be defensive, and the way you do that is by picking the better quality names." There are ways to mitigate losses: Buy Asia companies that depend on domestic markets such as telecoms and utilities; move into high-quality debt; and load up on the Japanese yen as investors unwind "carry trades" funded by taking out low-interest yen loans to buy other currencies, analysts said. And markets could quickly turn tail. A possible trigger would be a surprise rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve much like it did to contain the 1998 financial mini-crisis sparked by Russia's defaulting on its debt and the demise of the big LTCM hedge fund. WATCH OUT The big worry is that the U.S. subprime woes ripple through the economy and depress the housing market, causing consumers to stop taking out second mortgages to finance big ticket purchases. "The whole export segment needs to be watched closely," said Anthony Muh, executive director at AT Asset Management, which manages about $1 billion in Asian equities. Major Japanese exporters such as Canon Inc. and Honda Motor were the biggest drag on Tokyo's Nikkei average on Wednesday. "People are going to be worried about global growth, they'll worry about those sectors most exposed to the global economy and also the energy sector," said Tim Rocks, equity strategist at Macquarie Securities. "Other than that, watch those various selective financials but not the overall sector. HSBC has obviously got a direct exposure, but that's pretty much the only one." MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan is now about 7 percent below a record high on February 26. Even so, valuations aren't cheap: These stocks trade at about 14 times 2007 earnings, versus 15.4 times for U.S. stocks and 13.2 times for European shares. The JPMorgan Asia Credit Index (JACI) shows spreads over U.S. Treasuries widened out to 135 basis points as of Tuesday, compared with the all-time low of 118 bps struck on February 6. High grade bonds having have weathered the storm better than the volatile high-yield segment. Spreads on conglomerate Hutchison Whampoa's bonds due in 2033, a popular high grade benchmark, have moved to 148/146 basis points above U.S. Treasuries from 135/130 bps. By contrast, Agile Property Holdings Ltd. bonds due in 2013, which are below investment grade, have widened out to 420/400 basis points over Treasuries from 368/353. SILVER LINING Some investors see upside if the subprime problems prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut rates. That would be positive for Asian banks and property plays, they said. "I certainly wouldn't have a blanket sale in banks across the region," said Macquarie's Rocks. "The unwinding of the carry trade will be fantastic for parts of Asia because if the yen goes higher, the other exporters in Asia, particularly Korea and Taiwan, improve competitiveness. They've been underperformers in the past 12 months." Others warn long-term investors might want to think twice about selling. "A good strategy would be to buy on dips. Corporates are particularly healthy in Asia and my presumption is the U.S. gets through this OK," said Malcolm Wood, regional equity strategist at Morgan Stanley.
