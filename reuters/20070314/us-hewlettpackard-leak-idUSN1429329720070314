 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Former Hewlett-Packard Co. Chairman Patricia Dunn and three other defendants involved in the HP board spying scandal that forced Dunn to resign will plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of fraudulent wire communications, the California Attorney General's office said on Wednesday. 


 Dunn, former HP executive Kevin Hunsaker and private investigators Ronald DeLia and Matthew DePante were to plead guilty on  Wednesday morning in Santa Clara County Superior Court, according to a statement from the Attorney General's office. The AG's office said it was likely Hunsaker, DeLia and DePante would be required to complete 96 hours of community service and "make restitution as necessary." If the three defendants satisfy those conditions by a court-ordered dateline, the court will dismiss the case against them, the AG's office said. The AG's office said the court would likely waive the community service requirement for Dunn in light of a medical condition. It is expected the court will choose to dismiss the case against Dunn, according to the AG's office. Lawyers for the defendants were not immediately available for comment. In 2005 and 2006, HP's board, led by Dunn at the time, undertook an investigation to find the source of boardroom leaks to the media. The tactics used in the investigation included impersonating HP board members, employees and journalists to obtain their private telephone record. The practice is known as "pretexting." The pleas by the defendants come on the same day as HP's annual shareholders meeting, to be held in Santa Clara, California.
