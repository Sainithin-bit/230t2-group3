 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N said on Wednesday first quarter earnings rose 6 percent, beating analyst expectations as equities trading revenues helped offset weakness in its subprime mortgage business. 


 Investors fretted about Lehman's mortgage exposure for most of the session, sending Lehman's shares down as much as 5.5 percent, but late in the day the company's shares took back most of those losses as the broader market rose. Lehman, which makes home loans to people with bad credit, and packages the loans into bonds, told investors on a conference call that it has minimal U.S. subprime mortgage exposure, and that the global economy remains healthy. "We see the subprime situation as being relatively contained," said Chris O'Meara, Lehman's Chief Financial Officer, on a conference call to investors. The comments may have helped soothe investors. "If you were selling Lehman Brothers because you were concerned subprime would blow a hole in their balance sheet, you can buy back the stock now," said James Ellman, president of Seacliff Capital in San Francisco, which owns Lehman shares. Lehman, the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank by market value, said net income rose to $1.15 billion, or $1.96 a share, for its first quarter ended February 28, from $1.1 billion, or $1.83 a share, a year earlier. Excluding a $47 million one-time gain in the year ago period from an accounting change, results rose 10 percent. The results beat analyst estimates by a penny a share, but fell short of Goldman Sachs Group's ( GS.N ) 29 percent increase in net income reported Tuesday, which beat analyst's expectations by $1.70 a share. Lehman's revenue rose 13 percent to $5.05 billion, and its investment banking pipeline swelled to a record $389 billion. Revenue from equity trading rose nearly $400 million to $1.34 billion, helped by prime brokerage. The company is also taking slightly more risk with its own capital, said O'Meara. A RELATIVELY SMALL BUSINESS Lehman Brothers was one of the first investment banks to underwrite mortgage loans on its own, including loans to borrowers with weak credit, and package the loans into bonds to sell to investors. Its success in that business has come back to haunt it in recent weeks, as concerns about subprime defaults have dragged the company's shares down more than 15 percent since their all-time peak in February. But making subprime loans, packaging them into bonds, and trading the bonds only accounted for 3 percent of Lehman's revenues, in each of the last six quarters, on average, said Lehman CFO O'Meara. Many investors were concerned that Lehman held on to portions of the mortgages that it packaged into bonds, and could be forced to write down those assets. But O'Meara said the risk from any residual mortgage holdings was essentially transferred to other parties through instruments like derivatives. If concerns about the subprime mortgage sector bleed into other markets and result in economic slowdown, Lehman could also be hurt. Earlier this month, Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz wrote in a research note that Lehman's pretax earnings could fall 20 percent in that worst-case scenario but O'Meara said he expects the subprime crisis to be relatively contained. VALUATION Lehman Brothers shares closed at $71.72 on the New York Stock Exchange, down 28 cents after dropping as low as $68.07. The shares are trading at about 2 times the firm's per-share book value of $35.15. Joe Dickerson, an analyst at independent research firm Atlantic Equities in London, says the company's relatively high return on equity justifies a higher price-to-book ratio and a share price closer to $100. Lehman's shares reached an all-time high closing level of $85.80 in early February, but through Wednesday's close were down 16 percent. The Amex Securities Broker-Dealer index .XBD fell 11 percent during that period. Lehman's return on average common equity fell 2.3 percentage points to 24.4 percent.
