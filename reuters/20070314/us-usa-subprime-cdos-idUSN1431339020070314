 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New sales of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) have surged 90 percent in the first two months of 2007, compared with the year-earlier period, some of which may be due to managers rushing to get some deals to market in February because of weakness in subprime mortgages. 


 "In the face of the meltdown in the subprime housing sector and the consequent massive spread widening in the ABS market, there have clearly been jitters in the ABS CDO market," Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a report on Wednesday. "We think the spurt in structured finance CDO issuance, in large part, is a reaction to the underlying market conditions as dealers hasten to price deals," Morgan Stanley said. CDOs package assets such as bonds, loans and asset-backed securities are divided into layers of varying risk, known as tranches. "Given the market conditions and based on the visible CDO pipeline in the market, we expect ABS CDO issuance to slow relative to the pace of last year," the bank said. "Anecdotally, we have heard of some CDO warehouses liquidating and/or taking mark-to-market losses in transactions in their ramp-up phase." In anticipation of selling a CDO, dealers accumulate, or warehouse, the assets that will underpin the deal. Around $59 billion of new CDOs were sold in February, bringing the year-to-date total to $80.8 billion, Morgan Stanley analysts said in the report. Nearly half of February's CDO sales were structured finance CDOs, which include asset-backed securities. Of this total $13 billion was mezzanine-level CDOs backed by asset-backed securities, and $11.6 billion was backed by high-grade ABS. Mezzanine-level CDOs, which is the most exposed to lower-quality subprime loans, have traditionally been among the most popular deals. Credit spreads of CDO tranches have widened significantly since the beginning of February, with junior "AAA"-rated tranches widening by around 53 basis points, "AA" tranches by about 119 basis points, "A" tranches by 185 basis points and "BBB" tranches by 350 basis points. The weighted average funding costs of mezzanine ABS CDOs has also gone up by about 45 basis points over the same period, Morgan Stanley said. "We also note that it is becoming increasingly hard to rely on coupon spreads on new issue tranches as an indication where deals are being priced," the bank added. "Unfortunately, spreads that take into account below-par prices are often not visible. As such, the spreads quoted above are our best guesses where new issues are being priced, adjusted for discounts," Morgan Stanley said.
