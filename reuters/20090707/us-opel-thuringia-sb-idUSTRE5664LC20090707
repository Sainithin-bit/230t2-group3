 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German state of Thuringia which is helping finance GM's GMGMQ.PK Opel operations, strictly opposed a plan by Beijing Automotive (BAIC) to take over the carmaker using 2.64 billion euros ($3.69 billion) loaned and guaranteed in part by the German government. 

 According to a non-binding offer from BAIC, the Chinese carmaker would temporarily cease production in Opel's Eisenach plant in Thuringia until 2012, rendering all of the staff out of work for years but still on the company's payroll. "The BAIC offer is completely out of the question," Economics Minister Juergen Reinholz told Reuters on Tuesday. "Germany has made it clear that state loan guarantees will only be offered if all plants are kept open. Even a temporary closure is not an option." He said he continues to see Canadian auto parts supplier Magna MGa.TO as the favorite to acquire control of Opel. (Reporting by Rene Wagner, writing by Christiaan Hetzner)
