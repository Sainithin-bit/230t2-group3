 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said on Tuesday that it was not clear that the U.S. economy needed another stimulus boost to jolt it out of recession. 

 "As far as I am concerned there is no showing to me that another stimulus is needed," Reid told reporters, adding that there were signs of economic growth after the initial $787 stimulus package approved in February, and that only a small amount of that money had been spent so far.
