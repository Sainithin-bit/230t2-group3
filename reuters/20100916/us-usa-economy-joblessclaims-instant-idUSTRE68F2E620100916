 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, dropping to a two-month low, according a government report on Thursday that hinted at some stability in the labor market. 

 PRODUCER PRICE INDEX: U.S. producer prices rose slightly more than expected in August as energy prices recorded their first increase since March, calming fears of deflation for now. KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits slipped 3,000 to a seasonally adjusted 450,000, the lowest since the week ended July 10, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast claims rising to 460,000 from the previously reported 451,000 the prior week, which was slightly revised up to 453,000 in Thursday's report. * A Labor Department official said data for only two states had been estimated for last week's report. The four-week average of new jobless claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market trends, dropped 13,500 to 464,750. * The Labor Department said the seasonally adjusted index for prices paid at the farm and factory gate increased 0.4 percent, the largest increase in five months, after gaining 0.2 percent in July. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected producer prices to rise 0.3 percent last month. In the 12 months to August, producer prices increased 3.1 percent, slowing from the prior month's 4.2 percent increase. COMMENTS: BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, HEAD OF RESEARCH, GFT FOREX, NEW YORK "We're starting to see signs that the economy is coming off the precipice of a double dip recession. Recovery is never a straight line, but I think you're seeing now some stabilization in labor markets. We still face a tremendous amount of problems, but if you can say we found a level of equilibrium here and that the economy keeps growing, that's good news." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "New jobless claims are lower than they were which is an encouraging sign that labor markets aren't getting worst but claims are still consistent with a soft economy. We probably need to see weekly new claims numbers to drop below 400,000 to have a clear sign that the economy is getting stronger again. "We're seeing a little increase in wholesale inflation but still relatively modest. In commodities we're starting to see a little more inflation. Crude goods prices were up a little more than finished goods prices. If commodity markets remain strong, we could see a little more inflation and less fear of deflation before the end of the year. "These numbers should reduce concerns about deflation a bit, but it probably won't take the discussion about further easing off the table." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK JOBLESS CLAIMS: "On the surface if these are actually measured numbers the most important thing is we are a full week after the holiday and we didn't get a bounce. That's really good news. "It looks like the biggest declines in claims were in Florida and New York and Michigan. The drop in Michigan is probably the auto industry and production there is really solid...It looks like there was a drop in extended benefits and emergency benefits -- that's good too. On the face of it  looks like the job market is perking up a bit in September. PPI: "The core rise of 0.1 is right on the trend. So no worries there. The headline is a tenth higher than expected but I think it's all in energy and if it is that's no big deal because energy prices are falling in September. "While the August number is higher than the recent trend, the price increases are already reversing in September. It's not an indication of inflation pressure it's really just volatility in commodity prices. "I would expect that the market reaction has more to do with the claims. Treasury yields are up three basis points after the number. The claims are much better than expected considering the trend was around 475,000 a few weeks ago and now it's firmly established at 450,000." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Initial claims continued to improve in the form of a reduction in layoffs which is unambiguous good news. It looks like the labor market's underlying condition has not deteriorated as seemed to be the case in July and August. That indicates that business confidence might be stronger than previously thought. The economy will not run away, but at least it's not shriveling. "The Producer Price index continued to show a very stable trend in core inflation which is encouraging in the sense that there is no immediate powerful momentum toward deflation." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST WITH RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "At face value the claims numbers are pretty good and moving in the right direction, but you get some distortions with the holidays in this period. "The big problem with the labor market is the lack of new hiring and that doesn't really show up in these numbers. (On the PPI data) "You are not really seeing much inflation pressure out there." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO: "Claims were pretty much right in line with last week and better than expected, but even when we have better than expected numbers they're not good because they remain so high. "I don't think anyone is too worried about inflation right now, maybe in commodities, but essentially I think it'll be pretty tame so I'm not too interested in the PPI data. "Overall, it doesn't look like there's anything here that will give the bears room to take over today. We've had a drift up since Monday but we're in something of a pause. I don't see anything changing that. I think we'll just be testing the highs from June and August." SACHA TIHANYI, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "The data is all very close to expectations so essentially very neutral impact on the market."
