 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate on Thursday passed a long-stalled measure that would boost lending to small businesses, giving President Barack Obama's Democrats one of their last chances to show voters they are working to revive the sluggish economy. 

 The 61 to 38 vote sends the measure back to the House of Representatives, which has passed a similar bill and is expected to quickly approve the Senate's version. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan  and  Kim Dixon )
