 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The current account deficit widened in the second quarter to $123.3 billion, or 3.4 percent of gross domestic product, as imports of capital goods, automotive products and consumer goods rose, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Thursday. 

 It was the fourth consecutive quarterly increase from a low of $84.4 billion in the second quarter of 2009, when world trade fell sharply because of the global recession. Wall Street analysts had expected the second quarter deficit to widen to $125.0 billion. Commerce revised the first quarter deficit slightly to $109.2 billion.
