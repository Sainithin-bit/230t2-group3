 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will tell lawmakers that China's yuan currency has risen too slowly and he is examining what tools may be needed to persuade Beijing to move faster. 

 "We are concerned, as are many of China's trading partners, that the pace of appreciation has been too slow and the extent of appreciation too limited," Geithner said in prepared testimony to the Senate Banking Committee to be delivered on Thursday. "We will take China's actions into account as we prepare the next Foreign Exchange Report, and we are examining the important question of what mix of tools, those available to the United States and multilateral approaches, might help encourage the Chinese authorities to move more quickly." Geithner said China's undervalued yuan, or renminbi, has boosted China's exports and has encouraged the outsourcing of production and jobs from the United States. "China needs to allow significant, sustained appreciation over time to correct this undervaluation and allow the exchange rate to fully reflect market forces," Geithner said in his testimony." He said China's progress on this should be judged on both the pace and extent of appreciation and the ongoing level of intervention by Chinese authorities to slow the pace of appreciation. The yuan has risen only 1.25 percent against the dollar since Beijing announced in June that it was ending a currency peg. Geithner said the Obama administration also was encouraging China to rely more on its own domestic demand for growth and end discriminatory trade and investment measures.
