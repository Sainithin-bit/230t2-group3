 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O posted a fiscal first-quarter profit that rose a better-than-expected 36 percent, helped by strong sales of new business software and faster than expected growth of its fledgling hardware business. 

 Its shares rose 3 percent in after-hours trade. Commentary: AJAYKUMAR KASARGOD, ANALYST, MORGAN, KEEGAN & CO "My focus point are software license sales of 25 percent, well ahead of expectations. License sales tends to be a good indicator of forward momentum. The new software license sales grew 25 percent and they had guided their license growth of 2-12 percent. "Overall, they beat their expectations on financial metrics across the board from revenue to earnings. It highlights they're not only accelerating growth but meeting expectations regarding the Sun acquisition. "Only thing I would note, we would estimate 2 cents of the upside they reported was due to a lower tax rate, but it still exceeded their guidance. They had a little bit of a lower tax rate and that affected EPS by 2 cents. But even with that, it was still a strong beat." PETER GOLDMACHER, ANALYST, COWEN & CO "Oracle continues to execute, they're doing a nice job. "The stocks had a big move after they announced (the hire of) Mark Hurd, and I think it's OK, I think it's relatively decent follow-through. "On a day-to-day side, it looks like organic growth was probably mid- to low-single-digits ... excluding the contributions from Sun." JEFF GAGGIN, ANALYST, AVIAN SECURITIES "The results look fantastic. There was very nice upside on the database license sales which came in above our forecast. The applications business was in line with our estimate. I would say we had been looking for margin upside and we got it. It really says how Oracle's been able to optimize the Sun business." MICHAEL YOSHIKAMI, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, YCMNET ADVISORS "Despite the fact that the economy is having difficulties, for Oracle it continues to show that their consolidated strategy continues to pay off. "Oracle continues to be one of the very surprising stories in terms of mergers and acquisitions that actually seem to be creating synergy. Companies talk about that all the time, Oracle has actually shown it can do it." KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP "I would say they did very well. I'm looking at the new software licenses, which seem strong on a year over year basis. That's a key indicator of the health of the company because a lot of their revenue comes in the form of the maintenance fees, and ongoing fees from existing customer. "It looks like they had a good first quarter. Strong revenue this year in maintenance means strong revenue in the future for maintenance -- you're paying to get an upgrade in the future. It's a zero-cost line item. "The overperformance on revenue isn't due to currency -- always reassuring." (Reporting by Liana Baker in New York and  Alex Dobuzinskis  in Los Angeles)
