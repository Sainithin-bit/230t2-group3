 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Honeywell International is aiming to ride on the back of China's fast-clip growth and has no limit to its potential investments in the country, a top executive said on Thursday. 

 Honeywell sees its China sales growing 15 to 20 percent a year over the next five years, driven by the country's booming aerospace and automotive sectors and an increased focus on energy efficiency and environment control. "China is the most strategic market for Honeywell," Shane Tedjarati, Honeywell's head of China and India operations, told Reuters in an interview. "We continue to see 15 plus percent, 15 to 20 percent growth coming out of China," Tedjarati said, adding that China was the single largest market outside the United States. Honeywell, a diversified manufacturer that is global market leader in cockpit electronics, is also on the lookout for acquisitions and partnerships in China. The firm currently has a partnership agreement with Lonon Industry, a Chinese manufacturer of electrical switches. Tedjarati said more partnerships or buys could be in the works as the firm had no investment cap in China. "In a game where we get very good returns on investment, we have no limit, we have no limit in cash, in the size of investment; as long as the investments are good and they pass our threshold," he said. Honeywell, which employs 9,000 people in China, has already seen its China 2010 automotive sales target beaten by 50 percent, Tedjarati said. Honeywell reported in July a 4 percent rise in quarterly profit and boosted its full-year forecast, citing rebounding demand for its industrial and automotive products. The companies targeted for buyouts or partnerships will most likely be small, under $100 million, with good technology and a good management team. Honeywell has won four contracts in China's C919 civil aircraft programme, he said, including its flight management system, which should bring in over $10 billion in revenue during the programme's lifespan. "Unless something comes to a screeching halt, our GDP matches China's GDP so well," said Tedjarati. (Reporting by Melanie Lee; Editing by Will Waterman)
