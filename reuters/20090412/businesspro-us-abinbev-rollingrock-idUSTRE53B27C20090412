 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev INTB.BR, the world's largest brewer, is considering selling its Rolling Rock brand, The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 InBev sold Anheuser-Busch the iconic Rolling Rock brand for $82 million in May 2006 and reacquired it when it bought Anheuser-Busch for about $52 billion last year. The Journal, citing one person familiar with the matter, said AB InBev looked at bids for the brand earlier this year using investment bank Lazard Ltd. ( LAZ.N ), but wasn't satisfied with the offers. The paper said the brewer remains interested in selling Rolling Rock.
