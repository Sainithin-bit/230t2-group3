 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Wells Fargo & Co( WFC.N ), which rose by about a third last week, could head even higher as the bank's acquisition of Wachovia begins to pan out, Barron's said in its April 13 edition. 

 Last week, the San Francisco-based company said it expects to post a record first-quarter profit of $3 billion, up about 50 percent from a year earlier, citing a better-than-expected performance from Wachovia and a solid performance in mortgage lending. Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Andrew Marquardt said Wells Fargo will continue "to manage through this credit cycle better than most," Barron's reported. On Thursday, Wells Fargo shares closed at $19.61 on the New York Stock Exchange. Marquardt has a target of $38, Barron's said. Some question whether Wells may need to further boost its loan-loss reserves, which could eat into future profits, Barron's said. But compared with its rivals, these concerns may simply prove to be short-term issues, Barron's said. (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
