 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - China's Geely Automobile Holdings has approached Magna International about a potential partnership on car maker Opel, a source familiar with the matter said. 

 Talks between the Chinese automaker and the Canadian auto parts supplier included the possibility of Geely taking a stake in Opel, but Magna is refraining from any such partnership for now, said the source, who declined to be identified because the talks were private. General Motors' board has recommended the sale of a majority stake in Opel to a consortium led by Magna International. GM's Chief Executive Fritz Henderson said on Wednesday he expects to sign the deal next month. (Reporting by Jui Chakravorty Das, Editing by Ian Geoghegan)
