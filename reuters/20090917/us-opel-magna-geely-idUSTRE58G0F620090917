 NEW YORK/SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China's Geely Group has approached Magna International about a potential production partnership on Opel, a source familiar with the matter said, as China chases Western brands and the technology it needs to drive future growth. Talks between the parent company of Geely Automobile Holdings and the Canadian auto parts supplier included the possibility of Geely taking a stake in car maker Opel, but Magna is refraining from any such partnership for now, the source said. The person declined to be identified because the talks were private. General Motors agreed earlier this month to sell a 55 percent stake in Opel to a group led by Magna, a deal that GM Chief Executive Fritz Henderson expects to be finalized next month. GM will keep 35 percent of Opel, with Magna and Russian state bank Sberbank each taking 27.5 percent. Lawrence Ang, executive director at Geely Automobile, said the listed firm had never approached Magna on Opel. Geely had also repeatedly denied media reports that said it was in talks with Ford Motor Co to buy Volvo, but earlier this month said its parent is considering a bid for the Swedish brand. Magna was not immediately available for comment. A spokesman for Opel said there was no new information on the matter. Separately, Geely's Hong Kong-traded shares were suspended on Wednesday pending an announcement on a convertible bond issue, which Ang said was not related to Volvo. The China Business News said Geely planned to issue convertible bonds and warrants worth $250 million. GLOBAL PLAYER Geely Automobile has growing ambitions as a global player and has said its parent may also team up with a local government-backed investor to jointly bid for Volvo, which media reports have valued at nearly $2 billion. But analysts said Chinese automakers, already battling in their home market -- the world's largest -- against foreign brands made at local joint ventures, will struggle to manage overseas auto assets given their limited international exposure. Another Chinese automaker, Beijing Automotive, had bid for a stake in Opel, but conceded defeat in July after failing to agree with GM on intellectual property issues. "I think it will be hard for Geely to have a piece of the Opel deal in the first place," said Li Mengtao, an analyst with Sinolink Securities. "Magna's already got a Russian partner and involvement from a Chinese firm will make it very complicated." "It also makes little sense for Geely if it ends up being a minority shareholder with little access to the technologies it desperately needs." Sberbank has said it has no plans to remain a strategic investor in Opel, and a high-level Sberbank source told Reuters there were four possible candidates to take over its stake. All four were Russian, and analysts have said the stake could end up with GAZ, controlled by Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska. Chinese automakers have attempted a few overseas acquisitions in recent years with limited success. SAIC Motor Corp, China's biggest automaker, bought 51 percent of South Korea's loss-making Ssangyong Motor, but was later forced to write off its investment. "What the Chinese can actually get are mostly distressed assets that few really want," said Zhang Xin, an analyst with Guotai Junan Securities. "They may not cost much at the moment but you never know how deep a hole the automakers would be dragged into later on."
