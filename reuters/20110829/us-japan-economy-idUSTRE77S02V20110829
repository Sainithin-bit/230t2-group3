 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Monday that yen moves have been somewhat one-sided, repeating the government's warning to markets against pushing up the currency too much. 

 Kan, who is set to be replaced as prime minister, with a new ruling party head to be decided on Monday, also said a strong yen has both demerits and merits for the economy, adding that Japan should try to benefit from yen rises by accelerating overseas investment from companies.
