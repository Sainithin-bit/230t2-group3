 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pier 1 Imports ( PIR.N ) posted a 19.4 percent jump in March same-store sales, helping to send its shares to their highest level in almost three years, as consumers spent more freely on furnishing their homes. 

 The company also showed a substantial rise in quarterly margins, helped by stronger pricing for its wares, which range from wicker chairs to rugs and wine glasses. Its shares rose 13.6 percent midday to $8.25 after hitting a high of $8.47. Just one year ago, the stock was trading at 61 cents. Pier 1's rise in March sales at stores open at least a year comes on top of a 6.5 percent reported increase for its fourth quarter, which ended in late February. "Everyone is very excited that the pace is significantly accelerated in the first quarter," said Keybanc Capital markets analyst Bradley Thomas. An early Easter holiday that helped other retailers only boosted same-store sales at Pier 1 by 3 percent to 4 percent in March, he estimated. Pier 1's fourth-quarter net income was $35 million, or 30 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $29.4 million, or 33 cents a share. Excluding items, the company earned 32 cents a share, in line with the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 1.7 percent to about $396 million. Merchandise margins for the fourth quarter ended February 27 rose to 55.8 percent from 44.3 percent a year earlier. HOME GOODS HIATUS Like larger rivals Williams-Sonoma ( WSM.N ) and Bed Bath & Beyond ( BBBY.O ), Pier 1 is benefiting from renewed demand for home goods after a long consumer hiatus. On Wednesday, Bed Bath & Beyond reported earnings that beat expectations. Its shares were up 4.3 percent on Thursday. "It has long been apparent that we can control costs and expand merchandise margin," Pier 1 Chief Executive Officer Alex Smith said in a statement. "Now with a slightly more active economy, we are starting to see top-line improvements." He also said the company had more room to increase sales, as sales per square foot were well below the company's peak. "Even though the economy has improved a little, our customers are still not spending as freely as they did before the recession," Smith said during a call with analysts. The company is now sporting more pieces of decorative items like end tables and side tables rather than bulky couches and armoires. And unlike prior years when it offered fewer items in large numbers, Pier 1 is also giving shoppers more choices. "We view well above-plan March sales and margin as another indication that new merchandising at Pier 1 is resonating with customers," Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said in a note to clients. Pier 1 "represents the most compelling operating margin recovery story among small-cap hardlines."
