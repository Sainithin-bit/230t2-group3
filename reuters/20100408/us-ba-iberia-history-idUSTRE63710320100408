 (Reuters) - British Airways and Spain's Iberia have signed a long-awaited merger deal. 

 Here is some history on the airlines, whose liveries became associated with some of the 20th century's best-known icons. * BRITISH AIRWAYS -- In 1919, British Airways' forerunner Aircraft Transport and Travel (AT&T), launched the world's first daily international scheduled air service between London and Paris. -- In 1924, Britain's four main airlines, which had by then evolved into Instone, Handley Page, The Daimler Airway and British Marine Air Navigation Company, merged to form Imperial Airways Limited. -- Imperial Airways and British Airways were nationalized in 1939 to form British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). -- Post-war, BOAC continued to operate long-haul services, and shorter routes were flown by a new airline, British European Airways (BEA). The Beatles song "Back in the USSR" (released in 1968) begins with the line "Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC." -- The airlines came together as British Airways in 1974. -- BA began Concorde services in 1976, ushering in over two decades of supersonic travel for the rich and famous. -- Lord King, dubbed Margaret Thatcher's favorite businessman, was appointed Chairman in 1981 to restore the company to profitability and prepare it for privatization. -- In 1993 BA apologized to Richard Branson over a dirty tricks campaign against his Virgin Atlantic Airways. -- In 2000 BA halted Concorde operations after the loss of an Air France jet near Paris. It flew again in July 2001 before economic fallout from September 11 attacks in the United States forced both BA and Air France to end services from Oct 2003. -- BA announced a plan in October 2009 to cut 1,700 staff in Britain and implement a two-year freeze in basic pay for cabin crew. A bitter clash with unions saw cabin crew stage 2 strikes. * IBERIA -- Iberia was founded in 1927 by Horacio Echeberrieta, becoming Spain's first airline. It started as an air mail transport service between Madrid and Barcelona. King Alfonso XIII was a passenger on the inaugural flight. -- Other famous passengers over the decades included Eva Peron, Mikhail Gorbachev, Maria Callas and Salvador Dali. -- Among those to feature on the passenger lists of both Iberia and BA's forerunners were the Beatles and John Paul II. -- In its early years Iberia was forcibly merged with other airlines for a period of state ownership under Primo de Rivera, but became a domestic airline after the Civil War, only to be nationalized once more in 1944 under Franco. -- In 1946 it opened air links from Europe to South America. -- In 1981 Iberia flew Picasso's iconic war painting Guernica from New York to its final home in Spain.
