 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) on Thursday said it delivered 108 commercial planes in the first quarter of 2010, compared with 121 planes in the same period a year earlier. 

 The company said 86 of its deliveries were of its 737 Next Generation. Shares of Boeing were down 47 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $71.67 on the New York Stock Exchange. Boeing said last month it will accelerate planned increases in production of two of its popular wide-body planes to accommodate heightened demand from airlines that had curbed orders in the last two years because of the economic crisis. The improved outlook by the world's No. 2 planemaker may represent the start of a rebound in demand for Boeing and Airbus ( EAD.PA ) planes as the global airline industry recovers from a downturn.
