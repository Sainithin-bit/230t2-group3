 (Reuters) - British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia on Thursday said they had signed a merger agreement to seal a long-awaited deal to create Europe's second largest airline by passenger kilometers. 

 Following are some key facts about the new carrier: TERMS -- Deal will create new holding company called International Airlines Group that will own both existing airlines with dual hubs in London and Madrid. -- BA shareholders currently stand to receive 55 percent of the new company and Iberia 45 percent. Once the two companies are put under the same holding, their treasury stock and cross-shareholdings will be canceled, meaning BA shareholders will receive 56 percent and Iberia 44 percent. This is in accordance with what was agreed in November, 2009. THE MERGED AIRLINE: -- CEO: British Airways' Willie Walsh; Chairman: Iberia's Antonio Vazquez. -- 14-member board with each company appointing 7 members -- Combined market value of around $8 billion. -- Headquarters to be in London. -- Operations: The two will still fly under existing brands, run from dual hubs in Madrid and London. -- Aircraft: 408 aircraft. -- Destinations: 200 airports. -- Passengers per year: 58 million. -- Flights per day: 1,700. -- Staff: 60,282. -- Turnover: about 15 billion euros ($20.2 billion). FINANCIAL FORECASTS -- Pretax profit (2009/10): $1 billion loss (BA expected to report average FY pretax loss of 578 million sterling according to Reuters poll of 17 analysts; Iberia posted 435 million euro pretax loss in 2009). -- Iberia declined to give 2010 forecasts with its 2009 results, saying its main goal this year was to stop losing money. RATIONALE -- Greater financial muscle and more routes to compete with European giants Air France-KLM and Lufthansa -- Cost savings and greater buying power on fuel, aircraft, IT and other products that analysts estimate is worth some 550 million euros a year through to 2015. -- Very few overlapping routes. Iberia has the biggest share of the Europe-Latin America market, while BA is the leading airline on North Atlantic routes and has strong Europe-Asia connections. -- Ends BA's long chase for Iberia. Fulfils Iberia's long-time desire for consolidation.
