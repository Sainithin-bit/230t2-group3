 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee held interest rates at 0.5 percent and left its total 200 billion pounds of quantitative easing purchases unchanged on Thursday, as widely expected. 

 All 64 economists polled by Reuters reckoned the central bank would keep rates at their record low for the 13th month running, and many think policy will not be changed until after a national election on May 6, when the fiscal outlook is clearer. ANALYST REACTION LAI WAH CO, HEAD OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, CONFEDERATION OF BRITISH INDUSTRY "We weren't expecting the Bank to change interest rates or its quantitative easing policy this month, as the MPC is waiting to see how the balance of risks to the economic outlook plays out. "Growth in the economy looks to have held up over the first quarter, albeit at a slow rate, but there are still uncertainties about the strength and sustainability of the recovery this year. "At last month's MPC meeting, some members were more concerned about the upward risk to inflation from higher energy prices and weak sterling, so it will be interesting to see how the Bank re-evaluates its inflation outlook when it publishes new forecasts next month." JAMES KNIGHTLEY, ING "We continue to believe that rates will remain on hold through this year despite the better tone to the recent economic data. "Both the household sector and government sector are unlikely to contribute much to growth this year. Household incomes may fall given limited wage growth, flat unemployment and higher taxes meaning the savings rate will need to drop substantially to provide cash to spend to generate growth. "The poor fiscal position will intensify the downside risks to growth with government spending set to be cut aggressively from 2011." HOWARD ARCHER, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT "The May 6 general election essentially precluded the Bank of England from changing interest rates or Quantitative Easing given the bank's need to be seen to be politically neutral and independent, but the Monetary Policy Committee were never going to act anyway. There are very sound economic grounds for the MPC to keep policy on hold and to remain in "wait and see" mode. For a start, the MPC will be keen to see if there are any significant changes to fiscal policy following the general election. "Despite some recent improved data, we suspect that interest rates will stay at 0.50 percent for many more months to come given probable ongoing uncertainties within the MPC over the medium and longer-term strength of the recovery. Indeed, we still believe that interest rates are likely to stay down at 0.50 percent until the start of 2011. "Meanwhile, we expect the Bank of England to keep the stock of Quantitative Easing unchanged at 200 billion pounds for the rest of 2010 before starting to gradually reverse the process in the first half of 2011." PHILIP SHAW, INVESTEC "No change, no surprises. In what was the last Monetary Policy Committee meeting ahead of the General Election, the MPC left monetary policy on hold today. "This was precisely in line with expectations and hence there was no discernible market reaction. The MPC did not release an accompanying statement to explain today's decision, but in any case this was not really necessary. "With the recovery unfolding gradually there seems little need for additional QE, and it remains too early to start tightening. The current super-easy stance of policy is therefore still appropriate." Comments obtained before the decision: DAVID KERN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE "We support the MPC's decision to continue with the current holding approach, but it should consider new techniques aimed at improving the effectiveness of the QE program. "A fragile recovery is now underway, but the upturn must be nurtured to counter risks of a relapse. Despite the upward revision to GDP in the fourth quarter of 2009, and the prospect of positive growth in the first quarter of this year, the economy remains weak and vulnerable to a setback. Businesses remain under serious pressure and there is absolutely no room for complacency. "It would be wrong to contemplate raising interest rates or reducing QE at present. Given the dangers still facing the economy, it is important that the MPC perseveres with an expansionary strategy. Threats of a double-dip recession remain more serious in the near future than risks of higher inflation." LEE HOPLEY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION "The decision to hold rates and the asset purchase program was expected given the economic and electoral uncertainty. However, the big economic questions have still to be addressed and the MPC's stance is right until those have been answered."
