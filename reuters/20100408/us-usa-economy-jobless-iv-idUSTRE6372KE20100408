 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for unemployment insurance rose unexpectedly last week, reflecting seasonal volatility, according to a government report on Thursday. 

 KEY POINTS: * Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 460,000, the Labor Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters expected claims to edge down to 435,000 from a previously reported 439,000 the prior week. * A Labor Department official attributed the rise in claims to seasonal volatility, mainly from the Easter holiday, and noted there were shutdowns in two states. * A holiday on March 31 in California also had an effect on claims, he said. COMMENTS: WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "The jobless claims are a little disappointing. Based on the recent news we've had from the service industries, you'd expect that we would begin to see hiring right about now. The backlog of orders in the services industries was the highest since August 2007, so at a point, employers are going to have to make the decision to add employees or risk losing business. Obviously they can't tell people to wait a long time to get their needs fulfilled. So the claims data is disappointing. We are in the time when we need to see jobs created or the unemployment rate start to come down." LINDSAY PIEGZA, ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "It's really surprising because we did have such a strong March non-farm payroll report which did suggest the labor market had turned around. It certainly doesn't reverse the improving trend we've seen over the past few weeks but it is troubling that we aren't continuing this trend. "This does question the idea that perhaps the March report was an anomaly, perhaps a bit too strong. "This is certainly the firs look at the April jobs market and it does not start off the second quarter on a positive note. "Looking at continuing claims we did take a larger step down in continuing claims. What this suggests is there are still several different variables pushing against each other. We're going to continue to see struggles in the labor market as all of these different factors come into play. "I think the market's going to take this with a grain of salt and wait until there's more information." WIN THIN, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN, NEW YORK: "It looks mixed. Think people will be looking more toward the retail sales data next week. That and the inflation data are the big data points. The market is comfortable with the U.S. labor market. Greece and to a lesser extent China are back in the forefront right now. The U.S. is going to outperform the rest of the world."
