 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. banks and financial service companies with banking operations are cutting tens of thousands of jobs. 

 Some have said they are reducing staffing to lower their costs. Others are doing so because interest rate changes have made it more difficult to profit from lending. Still others are reacting to tightening credit conditions, especially for mortgage lending operations. The following are some companies that have announced job cuts this year or are otherwise reducing staffing: BEAR STEARNS BSC.N Bear Stearns Cos Inc said November 28 that it would cut 650 jobs -- 4 percent of its global work force -- as the investment bank seeks to lower costs after losing bets on risky subprime mortgages.

BANK OF AMERICA ( BAC.N ) Bank of America Corp, the No. 2 U.S. bank, said October 24 it was cutting 3,000 jobs, a majority of them in corporate and investment banking, and the rest elsewhere.

It said on October 16 that it expected a $125 million to $150 million pretax restructuring charge from the move. HSBC HOLDINGS PLC ( HSBA.L ) The bank's U.S. mortgage unit said on September 5 it would cut about 600 jobs.

On October 2, it said it would restructure its residential mortgage business and cut about 600 employees.
