 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Earnings at U.S. banks and thrifts tumbled 24.7 percent in the third quarter from a year ago to a level not seen since late 2002 as institutions set aside more money to cover expected loan losses. 

 Weighing heavily on earnings, loan loss provisions more than doubled to $16.6 billion from $7.5 billion, surging to a 20-year high, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said on Wednesday. The latest figure for loan loss provisions represents the highest level since the second quarter of 1987, when it was $23.8 billion, according to the FDIC. In another sign that banks still face problems with the ability of borrowers to repay loans, payments late 90 days or more grew for the sixth straight quarter. Noncurrent loans and leases totaled $83 billion in the third quarter, up 23.8 percent from the second quarter and up 57.9 percent from the third quarter of 2006, according to FDIC data. "Third quarter was not a particularly good one for banks and thrifts," FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair said at a briefing with reporters. She said weaknesses in the residential real estate and financial markets took a heavy toll on banks, adding that the troubled credit market will worsen before it improves. "Going forward, the outlook for the industry depends on the severity of the housing downturn and the extent to which it spills over into the broader economy," Bair said. EARNINGS DROP LARGEST IN MORE THAN FOUR YEARS The downturn in the housing market, coupled with more than 2 million borrowers holding mortgages with interest rates starting to spike, has led to turmoil in the global financial markets. Banks have said they expect $50 billion of mortgage-related write-downs in the third and fourth quarters. Banks' earnings in the third quarter totaled $28.7 billion, down a steep 24.7 percent from a year earlier and off 21.8 percent from the second quarter. FDIC officials said the third-quarter earnings were the lowest quarterly total in more than four years; banks reported profits of $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2002. It is the first time bank earnings have fallen below $30 billion since the first quarter of 2003, when profits were $29.5 billion, the FDIC said. Income from noninterest items fell 5.1 percent from a year earlier to $3.2 billion because of a sharp drop in trading revenue at large banks. But Bair said that that after enjoying years of record earnings, banks have strong risk-management programs in place, remain well diversified, and hold high capital levels. "So, I think they can handle what's coming at them," she said. The American Bankers Association trade group said banks have enough capital and reserves to weather the financial turmoil. "Banks are adjusting to the economic stress in the housing market and are taking the necessary steps to put the losses behind them," ABA chief economist James Chessen said. "This will be an ongoing process. The FDIC, which insures deposits at more than 8,500 banks, said its "problem list" of institutions grew to 65 from 61 in the third quarter, but the combined assets of those institutions dropped to $18.5 billion from $23.8 billion. Bair warned that the current conditions in the housing market underline an urgent need to modify loans to help many borrowers holding adjustable-rate and subprime mortgages who face losing their homes over the next year. "I am hopeful that lenders and servicers will see that it is in their own best interest," she said. (Reporting by John Poirier; editing by John Wallace)
