 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - By declaring an impasse in the financial reform debate, Senator Christopher Dodd will speed movement toward a vote and force the hand of Republicans, Representative Barney Frank told Reuters on Friday. 

 "Chris is forcing the pace here. He gave them plenty of time, but at some point people are going to have to vote on this. It's going to be a test of the Republicans," said Frank, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, in an interview. Dodd, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Friday that he is at an impasse with his Republican counterpart, Senator Richard Shelby. Dodd said he intends to move ahead with legislation. Frank said he is still confident there will be a House-Senate conference before summer to agree on a single bill to send to President Barack Obama. "What Senator Dodd is doing is perfectly reasonable on all fronts," Frank said.
