 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp is seeking to recall its third-generation Prius hybrid cars in Japan to fix a software glitch related to braking, a source with knowledge of its discussions with safety authorities said. 

 Japan's top automaker has sold about 200,000 units of the new Prius model since its debut last May in Japan, and another 103,200 units cumulatively in the United States. Toyota said it was currently discussing how to deal with the issue with Japan's transport ministry, as well as U.S. safety authorities. Under Japanese regulations, automakers can request a recall filing even if the transport ministry does not deem the problem to be a safety hazard. (Reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo)
