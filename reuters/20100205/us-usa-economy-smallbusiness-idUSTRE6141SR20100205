 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will soon announce a new program to help small businesses create jobs, White House economic adviser Christina Romer told cable channel CNBC on Friday. 

 "Today, he's going to be announcing another lending program for small businesses through the Small Business Administration," she said. Romer said that the $787 billion stimulus plan passed last year had helped to bring about "stabilization and the start of recovery." Despite Friday's Labor Department report that the country's unemployment rate fell to 9.7 percent last month, she said, Obama will continue to press Congress to pass a second stimulus plan known as the "jobs bill." "He has made it very clear he wants legislation on his desk to make sure we have that we get this unemployment number coming down even faster," she said.
