 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - EU leaders met in Brussels for talks intended to try to bridge deep differences over plans for a banking union. 
 Their meeting, which will resume later on Friday, was the fourth for EU leaders this year and the 22nd summit held since the crisis erupted in Greece in late 2009. (Brussels newsroom)
