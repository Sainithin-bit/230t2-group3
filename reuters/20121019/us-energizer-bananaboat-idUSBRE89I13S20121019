 (Reuters) - Energizer Holdings Inc ( ENR.N ) on Friday said it is pulling 23 Banana Boat UltraMist sunscreen products from the market because of a potential risk that the products will ignite on a person's skin if they touch a flame or spark before the spray dries completely. 
 There have been four reports of burns from using Banana Boat UltraMist Sport SPF 30 and 50 products in the United States and one in Canada, Energizer said. The company said it believes that the issue is related to the size of the spray valve opening, which dispenses more sunscreen than is typical in the industry. Energizer said it is telling retailers to stop selling the products and plans to sell new Banana Boat continuous spray products shortly. (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl  in Chicago; Editing by Gerald E.
