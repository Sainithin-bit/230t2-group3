 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N shares fell more than 12.5 percent on Monday following reports it was being investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for possible securities fraud. 

 The decline came amid growing fears that Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), which agreed in January to buy the largest U.S. mortgage lender for $4 billion, might renegotiate or abandon the purchase, which it has said it expected to close in the third quarter. Scott Silvestri, a Bank of America spokesman, on Monday said: "the transaction is on track." Bank of America is the second-largest U.S. bank. Countrywide, based in Calabasas, California, is being investigated for whether it misrepresented its financial condition and the quality of its loans in securities filings, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times said this weekend, citing people with knowledge of the case. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment. Countrywide has said it was unaware of any such investigation. In afternoon trading, Countrywide shares were down 61 cents, or 12 percent, at $4.46, after earlier falling to $4.38. Bank of America shares fell 95 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $35.79. Stocks of large U.S. financial companies broadly declined. Countrywide already faces a wide array of lawsuits and regulatory probes into its lending practices. Like many mortgage lenders, Countrywide has suffered from falling home prices, soaring defaults, tighter capital markets, and a plunge in investor demand for many of its home loans. Its February monthly operating report, expected within the next week, may show how well Countrywide weathered new capital market disruptions that began during the month. Even before Monday, Countrywide shares were trading roughly one-fourth below where they should, indicating that some investors expect Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America to renegotiate the merger or walk away. Under the merger agreement, Countrywide shareholders would receive 0.1822 of a Bank of America share for each of their shares. Based on Bank of America's Friday closing price of $36.74, that would value Countrywide shares at $6.69 each. Countrywide's shares closed on Friday at $5.07. Some critics have also faulted Bank of America for planning to install David Sambol, Countrywide's chief operating officer, as head of the combined company's mortgage operations. The bank had no immediate comment on that plan. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
