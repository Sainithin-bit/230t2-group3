 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N purchased Betten Financial News BV as part of a global expansion of its Dow Jones Newswires operation. 

 Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Betten covers real-time financial and economic news in the Dutch language. The deal will expand Dow Jones's existing Dutch-language news service, the company said on Monday. "We're dedicated to increasing our coverage of local markets in local languages, and this acquisition helps us to better serve the needs of our European customers," Clare Hart, president of Dow Jones enterprise media group, said in a statement. Murdoch, whose company purchased Dow Jones for an estimated $5.6 billion late last year, has said he plans an aggressive expansion of Dow Jones, led by its flagship Wall Street Journal newspaper.
