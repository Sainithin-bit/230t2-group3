 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) said on Monday it expects that Michael Dolan will be elected as a senior vice president of the largest U.S. company. 

 Senior vice president is a top position at Exxon Mobil, just one step below Chief Executive Rex Tillerson. There are currently three other senior vice presidents. No details were immediately available as to what responsibilities Dolan will take on in his new position. But Stephen Simon, the senior vice president in charge of Exxon's refining and chemicals operations, is approaching retirement age. Exxon Mobil declined comment on Dolan's future duties. Dolan, 54, is currently president of Exxon Mobil's chemical company. (Reporting by  Michael Erman )
