 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Shares in German sports goods maker Adidas ADSG.DE rose as much as 3 percent on Monday, with traders citing market talk of takeover interest from U.S. rival Nike ( NKE.N ) 

 "That's why the shares are rising," said one Frankfurt-based trader, adding: "I can't imagine that two so big players would be allowed to get together." Adidas and Nike both declined to comment. Adidas shares closed up 1.5 percent at 40.60 euros in Frankfurt while Nike shares eased 0.6 percent to $57.89 in New York by 1:15 p.m. EST. Adidas, with a market capitalization of around $12.5 billion, is the number two in the industry after Nike. A merger could prove to be problematic, industry sources say, as such a tie-up would most likely not get a green light from cartel authorities. In October, Nike agreed to buy England soccer-kit maker Umbro UMB.L in a deal that valued the British sportswear firm at 285 million pounds ($575.4 million).
