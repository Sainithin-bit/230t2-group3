 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp NWSa.N Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch said he has become "more pessimistic" in the past month about the U.S. economy. 

 Speaking to investors at the Bear Stearns annual media conference, he said his company, which owns Dow Jones & Co and 20th Century Fox movies studio, is well positioned to gird against an economic slowdown as its reliance on advertising has decreased to about 20 percent from 41 percent.
