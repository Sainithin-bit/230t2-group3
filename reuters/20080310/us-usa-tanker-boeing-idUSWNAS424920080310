 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Monday it would formally challenge a decision by the U.S. Air Force to award a $35 billion aerial tanker program to a team led by Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and Europe's EADS ( EAD.PA ). 

 "This is an extraordinary step rarely taken by our company, and one we take very seriously," said Jim McNerney, Boeing chairman, president and chief executive officer, in a statement. Boeing said it would ask the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, to review the February 29 decision that has triggered outrage from some U.S. lawmakers. Boeing said on Friday it had "significant concerns" about the contract decision after an Air Force briefing on why it lost the contract award. Under the program, the Northrop/EADS team is to supply 179 tankers over 15 years. The Air Force plans to eventually replace more than 500 of its aging fleet of KC-135 Boeing tankers. Boeing had offered a tanker based on its 767 commercial jetliner but the Air Force picked the Northrop proposal for a modified Airbus A330 airliner.
