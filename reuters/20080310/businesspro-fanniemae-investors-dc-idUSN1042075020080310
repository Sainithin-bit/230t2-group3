 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Daniel Mudd, Chief Executive of Fannie 
Mae FNM.N, the largest U.S. home funding company, is taking a 
10-day visit to investors in Asia and Europe, according to the 
Wall Street Journal on Monday. 

  The news comes as worries mount that Fannie Mae may soon 
need a government bailout after being hit by falling home 
prices and soaring defaults in the credit markets.  The Journal reported Mudd as saying in an interview that 
the company isn't working on a capital-raising transaction but 
didn't rule out the possibility.  No-one at Fannie Mae was immediately available for comment.  (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by  David Holmes )
