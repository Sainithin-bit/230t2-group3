 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It is difficult to prevent events in one part of the capital markets from being felt elsewhere, a senior U.S. Treasury official said on Monday, in reference to violent asset price swings seen in recent months. 

 "Our capital markets are so integrated that it is hard to suggest that you can isolate one sector, one asset class," Treasury Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets Anthony Ryan told the National Association of State Treasurers. "Excesses had built up and we are in the process of working through them today," Ryan said in response to a question about ongoing strains in financial markets caused by the collapse of the U.S subprime market and ensuing credit crunch.
