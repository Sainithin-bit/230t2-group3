 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service said on Monday it has not taken any new rating action on Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N corporate debt rating. 

 The credit agency's last rating action on the investment firm took place on December 20, 2007, when Moody's cut Bear Stearns' long-term debt rating to "A2" from "A1". Bear Stearns' current ratings outlook is stable, Moody's said. (Reporting by Caryn Trokie; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
