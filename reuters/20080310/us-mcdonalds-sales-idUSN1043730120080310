 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) on Monday said same-store sales rose 11.7 percent globally in February on strong coffee sales in the United States and new sandwich offerings in Europe, sending shares up as much as 4.6 percent. 

 Closely watched U.S. sales rose 8.3 percent in February, despite a slowdown in consumer spending and rising food prices, to top bearish forecasts. The world's largest hamburger chain said the leap year, which added an extra day to February sales, boosted regional results 3.5 to 4.2 percentage points. McDonald's shares were up 3.6 percent at $54.19 at midday on the New York Stock exchange and were the biggest percentage gainers in the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI . "McDonald's is extremely well positioned relative to the competition. It's a strong brand name, very closely tied to value," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois, which owns McDonald's stock. "And their strong food distribution system guarantees not just quality, but also gives them pricing power." FBR Capital Markets analyst Howard Penney said McDonald's shares trade at a premium, reflecting the company's competitive position. Still, he and other analysts said economic concerns would continue to be a factor. "We expect the operating environment to remain challenging and see few significant sales drivers in 2008," Penney said in a client note on Monday. Analysts said McDonald's U.S. same-store sales were up about 4.3 percent, excluding the leap year benefit, outpacing February 2006's growth of 3.1 percent. Sales at European outlets open at least 13 months rose 15.4 percent, while the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa division posted comparable sales growth of 10.9 percent. Same-store sales are a key gauge of performance at restaurants and retail stores. Some analysts and investors were expecting softer U.S. same-store sales growth of 1 percent to 2 percent in February, excluding the impact of the additional day in February. McDonald's "had an unexpectedly weak number in December. Maybe some people figured they had reached their peak, but McDonald's said it was an aberration," Jankovskis said. "It looks like McDonald's was right." McDonald's January same-store sales grew 1.9 percent in the United States, 8.2 percent in Europe and 7.8 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit. Overall, same-store sales were up 5.7 percent during the month. Investors, who were cautious following the company's report of flat comparable U.S. sales in December, breathed a sigh of relief and sparked a rally in the hamburger chain's shares when the January results were issued on February 8.
