 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some credit traders are betting that 
MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) will default over the next year, but the 
company's chief executive said anyone believing the world's 
largest bond insurer is close to missing a payment on its own 
debt is wrong. 

  The cost of protecting MBIA debt against default for a year 
in the credit derivatives market has surged, though some 
spreads have declined since January as MBIA has raised more 
than $2.6 billion of capital and preserved the top ratings at 
its main insurance unit.  MBIA has just $80 million of interest payments due over the 
next year, and no scheduled principal repayments, compared with 
at least $500 million in cash to cover that obligation, Chief 
Executive Jay Brown said in a March 9 letter to shareholders.  The company has even more funds available considering lines 
of credit and other items, Brown wrote.  "I think even our most vocal critics will agree that $500 
million-plus of cash should be enough to pay $80 million in 
holding company financial payments," Brown wrote.  MBIA does not have any principal payments pending on debt 
until 2010, when it has a $100 million obligation coming due, 
Brown wrote.  In fact, buying credit protection for one year costs much 
more per year than buying five-year protection, Brown wrote.  "Given our robust financial position at MBIA Inc, I would 
certainly argue that the existing spread in the short-term is 
illogical," Brown wrote.  Protecting MBIA obligations against default for one year 
cost about 1,690 basis points on Friday, or $1.69 million for 
every $10 million protected, according to Markit, which 
administers credit derivatives indexes. That's up from about 
152 basis points at the end of July but down from a peak of 
3,375 basis points on January 21.  (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
