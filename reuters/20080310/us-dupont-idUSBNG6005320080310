 (Reuters) - U.S. chemical maker DuPont Co ( DD.N ) said it expects large growth opportunities for seed business in Eastern Europe and its unit, Pioneer Hi-Bred, will be a key growth engine for the company. 

 DuPont expects to rapidly expand in the high-growth Eastern Europe agriculture markets, Vice President and General Manager Paul Schickler said at a Credit Suisse conference. Eastern Europe accounts for close to 60 percent of the corn acres in Europe. Pioneer's volume of seed corn has grown by 39 percent during that time while total hectares planted to corn have remained relatively stable. Schickler said Pioneer, which recorded revenue of $3.3 billion in 2007, is also seeing strong demand for its high-yielding products in North America and that the business was on track to hold corn market share and grow soybean seed market share in 2008.
