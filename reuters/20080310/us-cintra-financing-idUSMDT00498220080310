 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's Cintra CCIT.MC on Monday said it had closed financing to build segments 5 and 6 of its SH-130 toll road between San Antonio and Austin, Texas in the United States in which it will invest $1.36 billion. 

 In a statement to Spain's stock market, Cintra said $197 million of the investment came from consortium partners and the rest from a bank loan and debt from the U.S. Department of Transport.
