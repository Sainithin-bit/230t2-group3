 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) has successfully raised 5.5 billion euros ($8.45 billion) in a largely oversubscribed rights issue, business daily La Tribune reported on its Web site on Monday. 

 The capital raising is meant to prop up SocGen's balance sheet after the bank was hit by a combination of tough markets and large losses it said was produced by a rogue trader. Societe Generale declined to comment but said it would issue a statement before the market opened on Tuesday. La Tribune said the subscription rate for SocGen's offer was 180 percent. At the end of February, sources close to the deal had said they expected a take-up rate of close to 100 percent. SocGen launched a deeply discounted one-for-four rights issue at 47.50 euros a share after suffering $7 billion of losses it blamed on a single trader. Institutional shareholders had said they were keen to subscribe, given the large discount. SocGen Chairman Daniel Bouton also took part, investing 1.5 million euros, the sources said late last month.
