 LONDON  (Reuters) - John Lipsky, acting head of the International Monetary Fund, said the latest plan to help Greece did not envisage debt restructuring. 

 "We've announced last Friday that together with our European partners and the Greek authorities, that we'd reached understanding on a policy package that would together put the current program on track," he told reporters in London. "Still to be confirmed are the financing needs associated with that and right now the program that we are supporting, that has been approved and which the latest package is intended to put back on track, does not contemplate debt restructuring."
