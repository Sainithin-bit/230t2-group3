 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barclays Capital BARCBC.UL has appointed Greg Dalvito and Richard Hardegree to co-head its technology mergers and acquisitions group, according to a memo obtained by Reuters on Monday. 

 A Barclays spokesman confirmed the contents of the memo. Dalvito, who has headed media M&A at Barclays for nearly five years, will be based in New York. At Barclays, he most recently advised Mediacom's special committee in the $3.9 billion take-private transaction; Vivendi VIVVE.UL in the sale of its $6 billion stake in NBC Universal; and Scripps Networks Interactive Inc ( SNI.N ) in the $1 billion acquisition of The Travel Channel. Hardegree has spent the last five years as a senior member of the technology M&A team. Based in Menlo Park, California, he has advised on over 50 technology transactions, including Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ), Advanced Micro Devices Inc ( AMD.N ), Nokia Siemens Networks NOKI.UL, Avago Technologies Inc ( AVGO.O ) and KLA-Tencor Corp ( KLAC.O ). Barry Boniface will head the communications and Media M&A team at Barclays. Boniface has over 20 years of industry experience and has been Chairman and head of the bank's communications M&A business for 4 years. Boniface has advised clients on numerous high-profile transactions, including CenturyLink Inc's ( CTL.N ) acquisition of Qwest and AT&T Inc's ( T.N ) acquisition of Centennial. In May, JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) hired Barclays Capital's former head of technology mergers and acquisitions, Drago Rajkovic. At JPMorgan, Rajkovic is heading up the technology M&A group based in San Francisco. (Reporting by Nadia Damouni; editing by  Andre Grenon )
