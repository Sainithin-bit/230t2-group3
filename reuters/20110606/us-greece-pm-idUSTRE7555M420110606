 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Negotiations between Greece and its international lenders on a new bailout package are not yet complete and the coming days and weeks are critical to the country's future, Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Monday. 

 "Today our decisions and our stance on the way to the (EU) summit will decide the future of our country, as negotiations with our partners have not been completed," a statement quoted Papandreou as telling a cabinet meeting. "The following days and weeks are critical." Papandreou told the cabinet he would push for legislation that would allow the government to hold referendums, an option that would enable him to achieve the widest possible consensus on crucial decisions.
