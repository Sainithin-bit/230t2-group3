 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Double-dip recession or not, people will still pay any price to have lunch with Warren Buffett. 

 The annual charity auction for lunch with the legendary 80-year-old investor began on Sunday night, and by midday on Monday, bids already topped $2 million. The six bids placed thus far have come from two anonymous bidders. Last year's winner paid $2.63 million for the right to dine with Buffett at the Manhattan steakhouse Smith & Wollensky. The price nearly tripled on the last day, as nine qualified bidders made 77 bids. Proceeds of the auction benefit the San Francisco charity GLIDE, which runs programs including meals and healthcare for the poor and homeless. Buffett, chief executive officer of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway and often called the "Oracle of Omaha," was introduced to GLIDE by his late first wife Susan. The auction began at 10:30 p.m. EDT on Sunday and runs through the same time this Friday. Bidders can qualify and bid through the website www.LunchWithWarrenBuffett.com.
