 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The unexpected plunge in stocks on May 6, followed by a last-minute $1 trillion package to save the euro, has investors looking for ways to hedge against surging volatility across markets. 

 Stocks have been whiplashed since the plunge that momentarily wiped away $1 trillion of value last week, and Wall Street's fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index .VIX, has rocketed from trading in the mid-teens at the end of April to 42 on May 7. One-month euro/dollar volatility, a key gauge of fear in the currency market, had surged to a more than one-year peak at 17.0 percent hit last Thursday at the height of the meltdown in global financial markets. On Friday, it fell to around 14.40 percent. Gold, a favorite safe haven in uncertain times, rose to a record high of $1,248.95 an ounce on Friday in London. Safe-haven flows also moved into U.S. Treasuries. Last Thursday, the stampede into U.S. government bonds pushed the spot CBOT 30-year Treasury futures contract to its highest in more than a year. The following are some strategies on how to take advantage of market volatility: SPDR GOLD TRUST Analysts expect to see further market volatility and more record highs fueled by strong demand pouring into the gold market from investors seeking safety against the possible spread of sovereign debt problems in the euro zone. Scott Fullman, director of derivative investment strategy at broker-dealer WJB Capital Group, recommends the purchase of a one-for-two ratio call spread in the SPDR Gold Trust ( GLD.P ) to capture a potential 8.2 percent gain in the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund for the rest of the quarter. The trade uses June 2010 options that expire on a quarterly basis with a GLD share price of $120.10 traded on Friday. Fullman says buy a GLD June call option at a lower $121 strike and sell twice as many calls at the higher strike of $130, resulting in a $1.28 net debit. The investor can make money between the trade's two break-even points of $122.28 and $137.72 by the end of June. The maximum potential profit is if the shares reach $130 at June quarterly expiration. The trade would begin to lose money if the fund's price exceeds $137.72, Fullman said. EURO/DOLLAR The $1 trillion European Union package has reduced the "extreme tail risks" that investors feared, said Aditya Bagaria, currency derivative strategist at Credit Suisse in London. But he cautions that short-term uncertainty should linger, keeping euro volatility elevated over the next three months. Overall, he thinks the euro will remain under pressure against the dollar in the near term at least. "The euro hasn't rallied a whole lot and we are in a consolidation phase right now. I would short volatility in euro/dollar because it is rich, but not on an outright basis given all the uncertainty that continue to linger," he said. Friday's level at 14.40 percent was still way above the 100-day moving average, which comes in at around 10.75 percent. Bagaria recommended a reverse knockout put structure in euro/dollar, a short-term bet against the euro zone currency. But it would have limited downside given the EU bailout. With this trade, an investor purchases a one-month euro/dollar put with, say, a strike of $1.23, but with a reverse knockout barrier at $1.20. This will make money if euro/dollar falls below $1.20, Bagaria said. Bagaria said the trade is premised on the view that the euro will trade between $1.23-1.20 over the next month, which he believes is a reasonable short-term outlook in the currency. But if euro/dollar were to fall to $1.20 over the next 30 days, then the investor would lose his put premium but not the entire investment in the trade. BETTING ON SPIDERS Steve Place, owner of Web information site InvestingWithOptions.com, recommends investors sell volatility irrespective of direction. Specifically, he said betting on SPDR S&P 500 fund ( SPY.P ), an ETF commonly known as the Spiders that tracks the S&P 500 benchmark  .SPX , is a good strategy since the ETF is now nearing a key resistance level at $118.50. "As long as by next week the SPDR S&P 500 fund is below that level it will be a profitable trade. This is a suitable way to fade the movement we've seen over the past week, while keeping proper risk management," he said. Specifically, an investor could sell May $118 call options and buy May $119 calls in advance of their expiration on May 21. This is a way to short the market but limits his upside. Currently this trade costs 44 cents, so the investor would receive a credit of 44 cents and be risking 56 cents. The break-even point is going to be the short strike plus the credit, which would be $118 plus 44 cents. The maximum risk the investor has is the distance between the strike prices, which would be $1.00 in this strategy. T-BOND STRANGLE Stock gyrations have kicked up volatility in Treasuries, as investors, who are nervous about the euro zone debt problem, have been flip-flopping between the two markets, said Michael Zarembski, senior futures analyst at optionsXpress Inc. A T-bond options trade to hedge against the bond swings is a short-term strangle in which a trader holds a position in a call and a put option with different strike prices. Zarembski suggests buying a July T-bond call at a strike price $1 to $2 above the current level of the Sept T-bond contract and a July put at a strike $1 to $2 below where the Sept T-bond is trading.
