 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp forecast a jump in annual operating profit as the Japanese consumer electronics maker drives flat television sales and launches 3D-capable video games, but the outlook fell short of market expectations. 

 Following are initial reactions of analysts and investors: RYOSUKE KATSURA, ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES, TOKYO "Sony's profit forecasts for 2010/11 are a good indication of its drive toward a growth path after a series of restructuring moves. "Sony is likely to benefit from the continuation of the eco-points program in Japan and the World Cup soccer games in the first half of this year, and its plan to launch a group-based sales campaign in June for 3D products may heighten the market's expectations. "But there is a risk that the company will face inventory buildups as competition heats up toward the year-end and if the economy slows down later this year." BAEK JONG-SUK, ANALYST, HYUNDAI SECURITIES, SEOUL "Sony is really pushing hard to boost TV sales, and with the Korean won getting stronger against the yen it's going to be a real threat to Korean makers like Samsung and LG this year. "Its LCD TV sales target of 25 million units matches that of its close rival LG and it shows Sony is serious about the business. "Sony's big push toward 3D TV will also get an additional boost from its gamings and entertainment businesses and could help it wage a successful fight against Korean rivals and win back some of the lost market share." BACKGROUND -- Sony plans to launch 3D LCD TVs and 3D-ready games in June to spur demand for its Bravia TVs and PlayStation 3. -- It has shed jobs and shut plants to better compete with nimbler global rivals such as Samsung Electronics Co and Apple Inc, and now hopes to reap the fruit of its restructuring. -- Sony, the world's No.2 LCD TV maker behind Samsung, has vowed to turn profitable this year its TV and game operations, two major earnings drags at Sony in recent years, by slashing manufacturing costs and boosting unit sales. -- Chief Executive Howard Stringer believes Sony is best positioned to benefit from growing consumer interest in 3D images as it holds a wide business portfolio spread across electronics and entertainment such as movie studios, theater-use projectors, professional-grade video cameras as well as games and TVs. -- Shares in Sony closed up 4.1 percent at 3,165 yen ahead of the announcement, outperforming a 2.4 percent rise in the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index.
