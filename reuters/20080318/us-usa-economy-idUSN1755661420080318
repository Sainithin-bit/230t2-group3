 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The troubled housing sector delivered mixed news on the flagging U.S. economy on Tuesday, while evidence of inflation pressures continued to lurk in the producer pipeline. 

 Despite noting that uncertainty over inflation had risen, the Federal Reserve slashed its short-term benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points to 2.25 percent as policy-makers scrambled to protect the economy from financial turmoil sparked by a housing downturn. U.S. producer prices rose by 0.3 percent in February as expected, but a key measure of core inflation at the producer level climbed at the fastest pace in well over a year, the Labor Department said. The number of housing starts declined 0.6 percent last month, the Commerce Department said. This worked out to an annual pace of 1.065 million units, which was higher than the 990,000 that had been forecast. But the reading was buoyed by a jump in multiple-family home construction, while single-family home starts fell sharply. "Regarding the housing starts, I wouldn't put anything in that little bounce. The housing industry is in a recession," said Josh Stiles, bond strategist at IDEAGlobal in New York. Building permit applications, a sign of future construction plans, slipped 7.8 percent to an annual pace of 978,000, the slowest since September 1991. "The keys to generating stability in the housing market are improved levels of affordability, a correction of the inventory imbalance, and a restoration of borrowers' ability to access mortgage credit at a reasonable cost," said Morgan Stanley economists David Greenlaw and Ted Wieseman. "In sum, we look for about a 10 percent drop in real home prices over the next year," they wrote in a note to clients. However, some economists saw a glimmer of hope in the data that housing market might finally be close to the bottom. HOPE "Since World War Two, housing starts during recessions seem to settle at a round the 1 million unit level. During the 1990-1991 housing recession, starts slumped to 1.014 units in 1991," said Bernard Baumohl at The Economic Outlook Group. "We're far from celebrating any recovery in housing. But there are some incipient signs that the worst in housing could be behind us," he said. Any such light remained at the far end of the tunnel. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Tuesday described the economy as being in "sharp decline," the closest he has come yet to conceding a recession has set in. "There's no doubt that the American people know that the economy has turned down sharply," he said in a television interview on NBC's Today Show. But he resisted calling the slip in growth a 'recession'. "To me much less important is the label that's placed on it today. Much more important is what we do about it," he said. Stocks soared as investors celebrated the Fed cut and took reassurance from better-than-expected investment bank earnings, which helped to ease solvency fears that have wracked the financial sector for weeks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  was up over 300 points in New York afternoon trading. The Fed said in a statement that consumer spending and labor markers had softened, while tighter credit conditions and the deepening housing contraction would weigh on economic growth over coming quarters. But policy-makers also stressed that inflation has been elevated and although it expected inflation pressures to moderate, it said that the outlook for this was uncertain. February core producer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs at the farm and factory gate, rose 0.5 percent versus estimates for a 0.2 percent gain. They were up 0.4 percent in January. The Labor Department said higher prices for cars, light trucks, pharmaceutical products and alcohol had helped push up the core reading, which notched the largest advance since November 2006, when it gained 0.9 percent. Overall producer prices, which jumped 1 percent in January, were dampened by a sharp 0.5 percent drop in food prices in February. On a year-on-year basis, producer prices were up 6.4 percent while core 12-month PPI increased by 2.4 percent, which was the fastest pace since October 2007.
