 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's government, with its central bank governor just a day away from retirement, put forward a second former finance ministry official to replace him, but opposition lawmakers looked set to wield their veto again. 

 Koji Tanami, the head of a state-funded lending agency, the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, was nominated to head the Bank of Japan, surprising economists who had not seen him as a potential replacement for retiring governor Toshihiko Fukui. Tanami, 68, told parliament he saw growing risks for the global economy, backing the view of some economists that he may be relatively dovish in the role. Politicians have been squabbling over who will replace Fukui despite pledges by Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda to avoid a BOJ leadership vacuum as major central banks work together to combat a global credit crisis and bring calm to turbulent markets. Tanami once held the same rank at the finance ministry as Toshiro Muto, the current deputy BOJ governor who was blocked last week because opposition parties that control parliament's upper house say he is too close to the government. Kenji Yamaoka, a senior lawmaker in the main opposition Democratic Party, said there was almost no chance Tanami would win upper house approval. "Personally, I think it is almost impossible," Yamaoka said, adding that his party would decide its stance later in the day. Parliament is expected to vote on the government's new nominations for governor and deputy governor on Wednesday. If Tanami is rejected it will bring the issue back to square one, raising the possibility that Masaaki Shirakawa, a retired BOJ official approved by parliament to be deputy governor, will stand in as temporary central bank head. GROWTH RISKS Tanami said Japan could sustain economic growth despite the global slowdown and fears of a U.S. recession, but he warned that clouds were gathering over the country. "Downside risks and uncertainties for Japan's economy are heightening at home and abroad," Tanami told lawmakers considering his nomination in parliament. "Under these circumstances, the BOJ needs to carefully analyze various risk factors and make policy decisions decisively without preconception." The credit crunch and fears of a U.S. recession briefly drove the dollar below 96 yen to a 13-year low on Monday and sent Japanese shares down nearly 4 percent. Stocks made up some lost ground on Tuesday, with the benchmark Nikkei average gaining 1.5 percent, while the dollar held just above 97 yen. Underlying the succession row is a traditional rotation of the job of heading the BOJ between career central bankers and former finance ministry officials. As Fukui is a career central banker, it is now the turn of a former ministry bureaucrat -- despite the misgivings of opposition lawmakers that such a governor would threaten the BOJ's independence from the government. "It's a different name but more or less the same kind of candidate. How come (Fukuda) is so determined to install a former vice finance minister? I'm disappointed," said Jun Azumi, the Democratic Party's deputy head of parliamentary affairs. Analysts just wanted the row to end. "What's most important for the market is that they decide on a new governor by tomorrow," said Yumi Nishimura, the manager of Daiwa Securities SMBC's investment advisory section. "Investors, especially foreign investors, don't like it that the government cannot decide on a new governor in this market environment, including unstable currency moves." Deadlock over Fukui's successor will not have a big impact on monetary policy, however, since Japan's interest rates are near rock bottom, analysts say. POLITICIANS UNPOPULAR The fight over who should succeed Fukui adds to the political paralysis in parliament, where the government has struggled to pass laws since the opposition won control of the upper house in an election last July. Political analysts said the BOJ fuss would likely further dent Fukuda's already sagging public support and might lead to calls to replace him. But any replacement will face the same divided parliament. A Yomiuri newspaper poll showed public support for Fukuda around 34 percent, with a disapproval rating of 54 percent. But the same poll showed 59 percent unhappy that the Democrat-led opposition parties had vetoed Muto for BOJ governor, showing voters were unhappy with both sides in the debate. The government named current BOJ board member Kiyohiko Nishimura to become a deputy governor at the central bank, and he appeared more likely to win parliamentary approval. If no new governor is found by Wednesday, the government can appoint a temporary head, most likely a deputy governor or by extending the term of Fukui.
