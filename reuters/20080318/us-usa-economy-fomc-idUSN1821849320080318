 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve slashed a key U.S. interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point on Tuesday, a substantial cut but smaller than many in financial markets had expected, as part of an effort to hold off a deep recession and financial meltdown. 

  KEY POINTS: * The Fed's action takes the bellwether federal funds rate to 2.25 percent, the lowest since February 2005. * Many in financial markets had expected the Fed to chop the overnight rate by a full point. * Fisher and Plosser preferred less aggressive action, the Fed said  COMMENTS:  BRET BARKER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, METROPOLITAN WEST ASSET  MANAGEMENT, LOS ANGELES: "The Fed decision was a non-event between 75 basis points and 100 basis points when the Fed is moving in such large chunks or increments. The muted rate reaction leads you to believe that the market was positioned for 75, and not 100, despite what fed-funds futures showed. The big move by the Fed is that policy makers already did some heavy-lifting over the weekend by cutting the discount rate by 25 basis points and adding the new lending facility."  DAVID JOY, MARKET STRATEGIST, RIVERSOURCE INVESTMENTS,  MINNEAPOLIS: "The mention of inflation seemed to be a little bit more heightened than in the past. The language still referred most heavily to the downside risk to growth. I don't think it's any change. But they did give a nod of acknowledgment to those who are concerned about inflation, including ourselves. But I think they left the door open for further rate cuts..." "We think it would be something of a mistake (more rate cuts), we don't think that's the issue at hand. We think it's more liquidity. We'd rather see them do more of the kinds of creative things they've been doing rather than lower the Fed funds rate. But that doesn't seem to be what their path is at the present time. "I think it's (credit crisis) still with us, confidence still has a long way to go to be fully restored. But I do think that some of the mechanisms they've initiated give us a path to the restoration of that confidence."  JOSEPH BALESTRINO, FIXED INCOME MARKET STRATEGIST, FEDERATED  INVESTORS, PITTSBURGH: "The market didn't quite know what to think. The reality is that it (75 basis points) is a lot on a historical basis. They are certainly still on the hunt to fix this thing. We kind of like the action overall. The worst is behind us. The reality is with a lag in monetary policy we haven't even seen the beneficial effects of the previous cuts."  JOSEPH FOSTER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, VAN ECK INTERNATIONAL  INVESTORS GOLD FUND, NEW YORK: "In the long term, none of what the Fed has done has cured some of the problems that have plagued the economy and the financial system. They are still with us. To me, the outlook for gold is still very positive." "And ultimately with the Fed's aggressive easing, eventually it's going to create inflationary pressures somewhere down the road. You can't keep dropping interest rate and not expect some kind of adverse reaction at some point."  CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW  YORK: "I think the statement was a little more hawkish than I would have expected with respect to inflation. "They highlighted inflation expectations creeping higher and that's in contrast to the inflation number we got on Friday. Also TIPS breakevens have come in quite a lot. "They are really highlighting dollar weakness and commodities strength as the source of their concern. "It's a bit surprising they weren't more dovish on inflation and that speaks to them wanting to help stabilize the dollar. It probably means they are looking to slow down the pace of rate cuts going forward. They saw this as a good time to disappoint the market with a smaller-than-expected cut given that they have given us so much in terms of liquidity provisions."  ARUN RAHA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "The Fed's action is yet another forceful move in its attempts to alleviate the liquidity crunch and to shore up a rapidly weakening economy. It clearly does not believe that the action it took last week to expand its securities lending program, or its emergency measures over the weekend to increase market liquidity are enough. The economy is in, or close to, a recession, but increasing oil prices have kept inflationary pressures from abating, complicating the Fed's task. However, inflation is expected to ease as economic activity slows, albeit with a lag, so the Fed is likely to cut further if the economy continues to weaken."  KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, GLOBAL WEALTH  MANAGEMENT, MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "I am a bit surprised. I would have thought that given the heightened levels of anxiety we have seen in financial markets the Fed would give us 100 basis points of cuts." "Treasuries are extending losses mostly in the front end. They are going to respond to how stocks respond."  STEPHEN SCHORK, EDITOR, THE SCHORK REPORT, VILLANOVA,  PENNSYLVANIA: "The rate cut has been priced into the market. I don't see we are getting an untoward reaction. The natural gas guys liked it more than the crude (oil) guys. The crude oil market is beginning to exhaust itself. The economic outlook is anything but positive."  K. DANIEL LIBBY, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SANDS BROTHERS  SELECT ACCESS FUND, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The market expected the Fed to cut the federal funds rate by 75 basis points and that's what the Fed did. The cut continued the Fed's efforts to calm the markets after the steps they took over the weekend with Bear Stearns and to calm the market's fears. "The market would have reacted negatively if the Fed had cut less and if the Fed had made a steeper cut, it would have caused unnecessary pounding on the dollar. "The Fed has shown that they are focused on getting the economy back on its feet first and foremost, and they will worry about inflation later. There can be no health in the economy until the banking system is working properly and to do that, the Fed has to get the yield curve positively sloped."  ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,  BOSTON: "A lot of people were hoping for a full percentage point, so a lot of people are probably disappointed. I don't think they should be. Inflation is an issue. If anything this move will probably flatten the yield curve a bit, if there is more concern about inflation then the long end will like that. Overall we are all sitting here waiting for the next crisis to hit and we will need a little bit more time of having no crisis before (markets) can really get closer to levels that make sense."  RON SIMPSON, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, ACTION ECONOMICS,  TAMPA, FLORIDA: "We had a mixed reaction in the dollar. It's an interesting statement where the Fed has increased its worry about U.S. growth prospects, but cited concerns about inflation. I guess we'll be hearing the word 'stagflation' more often now. Overall, I think any pop in the dollar will be short-lived. And people would be selling the dollar on rallies."  TIM EVANS, ANALYST, CITIGROUP FUTURES RESEARCH, NEW YORK: "I think the rate cuts may help to support the economy over the long term and that will be of interest to the oil market. But in terms of fundamentals, I think that's looking out to the second half of the year."  CHRIS JARVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, CAPROCK RISK MANAGEMENT, NEW  HAMPSHIRE: "The FOMC continues to pull out all the stops to mitigate the current credit crisis in an effort to maintain an orderly economic slowdown. Overall, the market will view a 75 basis point negatively as it is in line with what the street had expected prior to the Bear Stearns issues that made headlines last Friday and over the weekend."  ROBERT WEIDEMER, PRESIDENT BUSINESS VALUATION CENTER, RESTON,  VIRGINIA: "They're going to run out of room here pretty quick. My feeling is that, will this stabilize things for a while? Yes, but that while might only be a few weeks or months and we could have another shock."  TOM BENTZ, ANALYST, BNP PARIBAS COMMODITIES FUTURES INC., NEW  YORK: "Market was looking for full 1 point cut, so crude (oil) is paring the rise it had priced in earlier."  JONATHAN BASILE, ECONOMIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "It doesn't say they will stop because they still see risk to the downside. But it's not as dovish as the market had thought. The minority will get most of the coverage today. Until financial markets stabilizes, it's hard to predict when the Fed will stop lowering rates."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasuries on the short end extended losses * CURRENCIES: The dollar gains against the yen * STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes trim gains * RATE FUTURES: Fed funds futures plunge, see a 50 basis point cut at April meeting
