 LONDON  (Reuters) - Northern Rock unveiled plans to cut about 2,000 jobs and shrink its mortgage lending by half, as it seeks to win European regulatory support for its state rescue and repay billions of pounds of taxpayers' money. 

 Britain's biggest casualty of the global credit crisis, which was nationalized last month, said on Tuesday that it aimed to repay an estimated 25 billion pounds ($51 billion) of loans from the Bank of England within four years. Northern Rock needs to win support for its rescue plan from European regulators, which allow public support in some circumstances to prevent companies from going bust, but prohibit state aid that distorts competition. The rescue plan comes as banks across the world lurch into crisis following the stock collapse of Bear Stearns BSC.N. Ron Sandler, the troubleshooter running Northern Rock after it was taken under state control, said he will seek a "modest level" of new mortgages, sufficient to replenish a pool of new loans for its Granite securitization vehicle. The bank said it expects a "progressive repayment" of its Bank of England loans and the release of government guarantees over the next three to four years. Its asset base should shrink by about a half by 2011. The bank had assets of 113 billion pounds before its crisis and is Britain's fifth biggest mortgage lender . The Newcastle-based lender expects to cut about one-third of its 6,000 jobs by the same date, and said most redundancies are likely in the first year. The bank plans to increase its level of retail deposits but said it will close its savings operation for new customers in Denmark, its only overseas markets, and repay deposits to customers this year. Sandler needs to reassure European regulators that Northern Rock will not get a competitive advantage from being under state control and banks in Denmark had said they were concerned it would benefit. The European Commission, which generally requires firms that receive restructuring aid to cut operations to lessen their footprint and limit any advantage, is expected to open a formal probe, which could take weeks or months. UK banks have also said they will monitor the savings and mortgage rates the bank offers. Northern Rock said it will ensure it will not use its government support "to compete on an unfair basis". TOUGH MARKETS Sandler acknowledged he is attempting to revive the bank against a tough backdrop of a slowing housing market and economy and a global credit crunch. "Market conditions remain uncertain and a protracted downturn in the housing market would clearly present challenges to its (the plan's) achievement," Sandler said in a statement. The aim is to return "a smaller, more focused, financially viable mortgage and savings bank" to the private sector. Sandler said he will retain the Northern Rock brand and branch network, but it will seek further asset sales and withdraw from new unsecured lending. It also plans a "staged and cautious return" to the wholesale financing market. Northern Rock's over-reliance on wholesale funding left it unable to borrow in financial markets last September when credit markets froze. That prompted the first run on the deposits of a major British bank for over 140 years as it became the highest profile victim of a credit crunch that has since deepened and forced the rescue of U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns this week.
