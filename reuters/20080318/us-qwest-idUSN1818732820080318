 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qwest Communications International Inc ( Q.N ) said on Tuesday that it was cutting jobs due to a decline in customers for its traditional phone service. 

 The company, which operates in mostly rural states, said it was offering a "voluntary separation program" to employees that would affect less than 2 percent of its work force. Qwest had about 37,000 employees at the end of 2007. "Over the years, we have turned first to our natural attrition rate to balance the loss of traditional access lines," Bob Tregemba, Qwest's executive vice president of network operations, said in a statement. "This program is part of our continuing effort to match our work force to our work load," he said. The Denver-based company is suffering from a decline in sales of traditional phone lines and does not have a wireless unit to compensate, unlike top industry players AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ). Analysts also see Qwest as vulnerable to competition from cable service providers as its territory, which includes parts of Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming, is viewed as particularly difficult for deploying new broadband Internet services. Reed Roberts, an official at the Communications Workers of America, said the union had agreed to the plan as a viable solution. "The continued loss of access lines is a reality of the entire industry," he added. Qwest had 12.8 million access lines at the end of 2007, down 7.3 percent from a year earlier. The company's shares rose 11 cents, or 2.4 percent, to $4.61 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; editing by John Wallace and Lisa Von Ahn)
