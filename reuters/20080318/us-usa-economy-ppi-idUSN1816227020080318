 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices rose by 0.3 percent in February as expected, Labor Department data on Tuesday showed, but a key measure of core inflation at the producer level climbed at the fastest pace in well over a year. 

 U.S. home building projects started in February fell by 0.6 percent to a higher-than-expected annual rate while building permit activity, a sign of future construction plans, dropped off 7.8 percent, a government report on Tuesday showed.  KEY POINTS: * Core producer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs at the farm and factory gate, rose by 0.5 percent last month versus estimates for a 0.2 percent gain and after a 0.4 percent advance in January. * The Labor Department said higher prices for cars, light trucks, pharmaceutical products and alcohol had helped push up the core reading, which notched the largest advance since November 2006, when it gained 0.9 percent. * The Commerce Department said housing starts set an annual pace of 1.065 million units in February, higher than the 990,000 expected by economists. * The January starts figure was revised upward to 1.071 million from the 1.012 million originally reported  COMMENTS:  CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: HOUSING STARTS: "We are still close to 15-year lows. Housing is in the basement and we are going to staying there until people feel more secure with their financial standing. Stability is better than the freefall which is what we've seen this winter. Permits are still a problem. They will go lower still. Inventories are going down and have been for better part of a year. We are nibbling toward a bottom but we are far from it." PPI: "The rise in the core is a timing issue, rather than fundamental pressure on the producer level. The biggest increase in capital equipment which is up 0.5 percent. Normally it is up 0.1 to 0.2 percent, which was a reversal in the decline in January. There is little risk that the core increase will show up in the CPI report next month. We have some food price relief, which is also great news."  KURT KARL, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: HOUSING STARTS: "The housing market is down, but not a lot. The key number there, the most forward-looking one is the permits, which was down substantially, so it is still a softening construction market in the residential space. Overall it was better than expected, but down is down. One thing that you could say that is positive is that it seems to be reaching a trough, which is often near a million units. PPI: The year-on-year is not something that the Fed is going to be happy about. Six point four on the finished goods is not a fun number. However, the Fed will cut today and it very likely could be 100 basis points."  DAVID COARD, HEAD OF FIXED-INCOME SALES, WILLIAMS CAPITAL GROUP, NEW YORK: "There's been real anxiety around anymore problems coming out of the investment banking community so there's a relief sell-off in Treasuries as it were. Aside from that the inflation piece wasn't friendly, but the more important one is CPI. As for housing, I prefer to look at the building permits number, which is a leading indicator, and that was down."  JOSH STILES, BOND STRATEGIST, IDEAGLOBAL, NEW YORK: "I don't think the data is a big market mover. The PPI core is more elevated than expected, but the year-on-year trend is not going to be too alarming yet. Regarding the housing starts, I wouldn't put anything in that little bounce. The housing industry is in a recession."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasuries extend losses * CURRENCIES: The dollar holds gains against the yen * STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures hold gains * RATE FUTURES: Fed funds futures still price in 100 basis point rate cut on Tuesday
