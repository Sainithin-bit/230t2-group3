 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. phone company Qwest 
Communications International Inc ( Q.N ) said on Tuesday it was 
cutting jobs due to a fall in traditional phone customers. 

  The company, which operates in mostly rural areas, 
including parts of Arizona, Colorado and Wyoming, said it was 
offering a "voluntary separation program" that would affect 
less than 2 percent of its work force.  Qwest had about 37,000 employees at the end of 2007.  "Over the years, we have turned first to our natural 
attrition rate to balance the loss of traditional access 
lines," Bob Tregemba, Qwest's executive vice president of 
Network Operations, said in a statement.  "This program is part of our continuing effort to match our 
work force to our work load," he said.  Denver-based Qwest is suffering from a decline in sales of 
traditional phone lines and does not have a wireless unit to 
compensate, unlike the phone industry's top players, AT&T Inc 
( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ).  Qwest shares rose 7 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $4.57 in 
morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.  (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; editing by John Wallace)
