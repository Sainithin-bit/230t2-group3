 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's gas export monopoly Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ) may be asked to share some of its export revenues with independent gas producers for using their gas for export needs, a newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 Kommersant business daily quoted sources at Russia's anti-trust office as saying the proposals would be made before May, when the service is due to submit proposals on amendments to the law on gas exports from Russia. Under the law, Gazprom has been made Russia's gas export monopoly in 2006 and the newspaper said it will fight hard against the approval of such amendments, which could force it to pay an additional $6 billion to independent producers. The newspaper also quoted analysts as saying the monopoly, whose chairman, Dmitry Medvedev, was elected Russia's new president this month, has all the administrative means to persuade the government not to approve proposals from the anti-trust office. Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, supplies Europe with a quarter of its gas needs, earning around $40 billion a year on exports. Russia's top independent gas producers are Novatek ( NVTK.MM ) ( NVTKq.L ), Surgut ( SNGS.MM ), Russian-British firm TNK-BP TNBPI.RTS ( BP.L ) and LUKOIL ( LKOH.MM ).
