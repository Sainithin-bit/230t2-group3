 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines said on Tuesday it would enact deeper cost cuts if a plan announced earlier in the day is not sufficient to counter sharply higher fuel prices. 

 "If we need to, we'll go deeper," Ed Bastian told analysts at the JP Morgan aviation conference. Delta is looking to cut 1,300 rank-and-file jobs and 700 administrative and management posts through voluntary buyouts and attrition. It also aims to reduce capacity by an additional 5 percent by August. International business will grow and domestic capacity cuts will come out of point-to-point flying. No reductions will be seen in competitive markets, Bastian said. Delta anticipates overall liquidity will drop by about $100 million by year's end and did not rule out a modest profit for 2008.
