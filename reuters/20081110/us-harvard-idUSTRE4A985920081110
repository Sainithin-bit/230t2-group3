 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Harvard University is looking for ways to reduce spending, its president said on Monday, raising the prospect of cuts to programs and compensation at the world's richest university during the financial crisis. 

 "We must recognize that Harvard is not invulnerable to the seismic financial shocks in the larger world," Drew Faust wrote in an e-mail to faculty, staff, students and alumni. "Our own economic landscape has been significantly altered." Faust said Harvard must be prepared for "unprecedented" losses in its big endowment that funds a third of the Ivy League school's annual operating budget and swelled to a record $37 billion in the last fiscal year. "Our principal sources of revenue are all likely to be affected by these new economic forces," she said, citing a report by U.S. credit-rating agency Moody's Investors Service that projects a 30 percent drop in the value of college and university endowments this fiscal year. She said contributions from donors and foundations could shrink, while federal research grants and contracts will reflect "the intensified stress on the federal budget". "We have to think not just about what more we might wish to do, but what we might do at a different pace or do without," she said, adding that spending cuts need to be considered for this year and next. Like many institutions facing the prospect of a global recession, Harvard is examining the cost of its workforce -- comprised of some of the best-paying jobs in academia. "Changing financial realities will require us to look carefully at compensation costs, which account for nearly half the university's budget," she said. Harvard would resist big tuition increases, she suggested. And financial aid programs such as scholarships will be maintained at their current levels. Some U.S. colleges and universities, their endowments shrinking along with stock markets, are expected to raise tuition more than usual to compensate. Tuition would be kept to "moderate" increases, Faust said. A Harvard education costs $47,215 a year for tuition, room and board. Harvard was also assessing a multibillion-dollar campus expansion into Boston's Allston district across the Charles River from its main Cambridge campus that would include a science complex, museum, housing, parks and a public square. "We are assessing all aspects of our ambitious capital planning program, including the phasing and development of our campus in Allston," Faust said. (Editing by  Cynthia Osterman )
