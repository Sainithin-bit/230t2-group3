 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) on Monday said global sales at its fast-food restaurants open at least 13 months rose 8.2 percent in October. 

 Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail health, rose 5.3 percent in the United States, 9.8 percent in Europe and 11.5 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa division. McDonald's, which has more than 31,000 restaurants in more than 100 countries, has benefited for months from demand overseas even as U.S. economic conditions deteriorate. McDonald's has been one of the best performing fast-food chains, beating peers like Wendy's/Arby's Group Inc WEN.N and CKE Restaurants' CKR.N Carl's Jr. chain at driving customer traffic and keeping a lid on commodity costs. Still, rising prices for key ingredients like beef and cheese have prompted the company to consider changes to its popular Dollar Menu as the higher cost of making its flagship Double Cheeseburger pinches franchisees -- whose payments to McDonald's represent about two-thirds of company profits.
