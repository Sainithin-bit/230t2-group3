 BONN  (Reuters) - Deutsche Post aims to retain its current credit rating despite restructuring costs, its chief executive said on Monday. 

 "We feel comfortable with our credit rating," Frank Appel said. Deutsche Post said earlier on Monday restructuring costs for its U.S. express business would reach $3.9 billion, $1.9 billion more than previously planned. (Reporting by  Maria Sheahan )
