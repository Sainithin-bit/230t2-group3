 MADRID/LONDON  (Reuters) - Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) launched a shock $9.2 billion rights issue on Monday as traditionally strong banks joined ailing rivals in bolstering their capital in the face of recession. 

 The scale of a deepening global credit crisis was shown as the U.S. government raised its support for insurer AIG ( AIG.N ) to about $150 billion to prevent it collapsing, while U.S. mortgage funding provider Fannie Mae lost a record $29 billion. By contrast, Europe's biggest bank HSBC ( HSBA.L )OOO5.HK said third-quarter profits were up on a year ago as growth in Asia offset rising U.S. bad debts. It is confident Asia will continue to grow, but signaled it may take longer to turn round its U.S. business. Santander, the euro currency zone's biggest bank, said it was not planning any more acquisitions after picking up several assets during the credit crisis, and has postponed asset sales due to poor market conditions. It appeared to be fortifying itself as economies in Spain and Latin America deteriorate and analysts noted banks were storing up ever larger capital cushions against possible risks to come. "There's a new norm for capital adequacy standards in Europe," said Simon Maughan, analyst at MF Global in London. "We're dealing with a deep and nasty (economic) cycle and they are not immune to it." By 10:30 a.m. EST Santander shares were down 4.7 percent, the weakest performer in the DJ Stoxx European bank sector .SX7P, which was down 1 percent. HSBC shares dipped 1 percent. HSBC, the biggest bank outside China and another European bank to outperform rivals during the credit crisis due to its capital and liquidity advantages, said it was comfortable with its capital position. Europe's top three banks -- HSBC, Santander and France's BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) -- will have similar tier 1 ratios of just under 9 percent after fundraisings by Santander and BNP. ECONOMIC STIMULUS HSBC took a $4.3 billion hit for bad debts in its U.S. personal finance arm -- up $700 million from the previous quarter -- and wrote down the value of assets by $600 million, but said its focus on emerging markets and diversity left it better placed than rivals. "We're confident that Asia may well slow but it won't be impacted as much as other economies around the world," said Michael Geoghegan, HSBC's chief executive. An economic stimulus package unveiled by China over the weekend showed policymakers will step in to revive flagging growth, and China's economy should grow by 8 to 9 percent next year, he said. Investors had not expected a rights issue from Santander, which in recent months has swept up UK bank Alliance & Leicester and parts of Bradford & Bingley and is bidding for the remaining 75 percent of U.S. bank Sovereign SOV.N it does not already own. Rights issues can take months to complete and cash calls this year at Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and elsewhere have prompted violent share price reactions. Barclays ( BARC.L ) raised cash with Middle East investors last month as it said a rights issue was too risky. Santander's domestic rival BBVA ( BBVA.MC ) said it has no plans to raise capital. European banks are raising funds in a variety of ways and Britain's Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ) on Monday set terms to raise almost $5 billion from a two-part government-backed bond. Greek banks on Monday backed a government rescue plan, even though no lender has yet stepped up to take cash. Some banks still appear short of capital. Arturo de Frias, analyst at Dresdner, said France's Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), Italy's UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) and Ireland's three main banks are among those in need of funds. Lloyds also came under fire for its proposed takeover of HBOS HBOS.L. Two former chief executives of RBS and Bank of Scotland are attempting to scupper Lloyds' takeover of HBOS, although three top 10 HBOS investors told Reuters the proposals were unlikely to win much investor support.
