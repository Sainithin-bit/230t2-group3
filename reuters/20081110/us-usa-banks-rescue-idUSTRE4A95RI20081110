 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The government's emergency investments in the financial sector may actually slow the day of reckoning for mortgage losses, a panel of bankers said on Monday. 

 Investors at an industry conference agreed that the $250 billion in bank capital injections, part of a broader $700 billion bailout plan, was necessary to restore confidence in battered credit markets in the near term. However, the very presence of government cash, when coupled with a lack of clarity on when Treasury might actually make outright purchases of troubled assets, could mean the crisis will linger even longer, analysts said. "The presence of the capital infusion actually delays that process," said Jeffrey Rosenberg, head of credit strategy research at Bank of America Securities. The conference was sponsored by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, and was aimed at clearing up confusion about the extent and nature of government involvement in bailing out the nation's crumbling banks. MORE TO COME Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs, said global credit losses from the crisis would eventually total $1.4 trillion, of which only $800 billion have been realized to date. Worse yet, noted RBC managing director Gerard Cassidy, losses in the commercial real estate and leveraged loan sectors have only begun to scratch the surface. "The commercial real estate problems are going to be significant," he said. "The underwriting standards we believe were far weaker. That's going to lead to the same problems were having today on the residential side." But again, the panelists reinforced a sense that, despite the best of intentions, the government's increased role would have unforeseen side effects. "Direct capital injections will push off the price discovery process," said Greg Peters, chief U.S. credit strategist at Morgan Stanley. Looking on the bright side, Hatzius from Goldman said the lessons from Japan's protracted banking sector crisis had clearly been learned, suggesting U.S. financial institutions were poised to recover more quickly than did their Asian counterparts. The group of investors expressed dismay that the original intent of the Treasury Asset Relief Program, or TARP, has no offered clear guidelines on the timing of an eventual round of asset purchases by the federal government. "The markets do dislike uncertainty and ambiguity," Peters said, adding that fears surrounding the transition to a new administration was also making investors jittery. Asked about year-end funding pressures, Cassidy from RBC said he hoped the TARP would provide some cover for investors, but hardly bullet-proof protection. "You hope not but the reality is that we're going to see some enormous losses coming up in the fourth quarter," he said. (Reporting by Pedro Nicolaci da Costa; Editing by Tom Hals)
