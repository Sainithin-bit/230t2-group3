 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. meat producer Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) said it may post a loss in the current quarter, which ends in December, largely due to significant losses in its chicken unit. 

 Wall Street analysts had expected a profit for the period. "Given where leg quarter prices are and breast meat prices are, we are going to lose some significant dollars in Q1," Tyson Chief Executive Richard Bond told analysts during an earnings conference call. "It will be a negative quarter in chicken and most likely a negative quarter overall for our results," said Bond. Chicken producers have been hurt by low meat prices and higher feed costs this year. Wall Street analysts, on average, expected a first quarter profit of $41.66 million, or 13 cents a share. In morning trading, Tyson's shares were down 53 cents, or 7.1 percent, at $6.93 in New York Stock Exchange trading.
