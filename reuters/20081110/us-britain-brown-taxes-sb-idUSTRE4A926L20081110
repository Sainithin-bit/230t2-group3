 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said Monday that tax cuts could be used to help stimulate the British economy and it was a measure the government would be considering in the next few weeks. 

 "We will look at everything but that's a matter for the budget and the pre-budget report," he told Good Morning Television when asked about possible fiscal moves to help Britain out of an expected recession in the coming year. "What I am determined to do is to get all countries around the world ... to get their economies moving again and one way you can do that is by putting more money into the economy by tax cuts or by public spending rises, but that is something that we have got to look at in the next few weeks," he added.
