 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian auto industry is worth fighting for and more needs to be done to help it, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty said on Monday. 

 McGuinty, speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting between Canada's 10 premiers and federal Prime Minister Stephen Harper, also said there must be a good rationale behind any proposals to help the industry. Ontario is home to the bulk of Canada's auto industry. (Reporting by  David Ljunggren , writing by Randall Palmer; Editing by Peter Galloway)
