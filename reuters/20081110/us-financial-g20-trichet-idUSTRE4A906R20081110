 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - An agreement by the world's leading economies on ways to tackle the global financial crisis is encouraging but there is no room for complacency, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Sunday. 

 After Group of 20 meetings in Sao Paulo, Trichet told Brazilian television Globo News TV that official action taken on the financial crisis was having an impact but further work was needed. "There is a large deal of consensus and to the extent that the G20 represents an overwhelming proportion of global growth I think it is encouraging," he said in a TV interview broadcast. "But there is a lot of work to be done, and it is no time for complacency." (Reporting by  Krista Hughes )
