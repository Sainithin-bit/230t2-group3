 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DISH Network Corp ( DISH.O ), the No. 2 U.S. satellite TV provider, posted lower third-quarter profit on Monday, saying it took a big hit on its investments. 

 Net income fell to $92 million, or 20 cents per share, from $200 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. In its press release, the company did not specify what investments went sour. Revenue rose 5.1 percent to $2.94 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had been expecting profit of 58 cents a share on revenue of $2.91 billion. It was not immediately clear whether the profit estimate directly compared with what the company reported. DISH reported a net loss of 10,000 subscribers, compared with a year earlier, when it added 110,000. The Englewood, Colorado-based company, which faces stiff competition from cable companies' competitively priced "triple play" bundles of video, phone and Internet, had been forecast to add 50,000 net subscribers by Kaufman Bros analyst Todd Mitchell. DISH, which has previously done well with lower-income households, has been badly hit by weak economic conditions and promotional packages by all competitors, including larger satellite TV rival DirecTV Group ( DTV.O ).
