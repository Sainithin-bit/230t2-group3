 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Treasury Department said on Monday its $40 billion investment in American International Group was a one-off transaction that will not reduce the amount of capital that the Treasury plans to inject into U.S. banks. 

 A Treasury official also told reporters on a conference call that a member of President-elect Barack Obama's transition team was briefed on the transaction on Sunday night. "This is a one-off, created solely for AIG," the official said, adding that the funds would not come from the $250 billion bank capital purchase program.
