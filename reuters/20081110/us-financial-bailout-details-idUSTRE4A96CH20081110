 (Reuters) - The Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout plan, also known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), is one of the main U.S. tools to address the financial crisis. 

 The Treasury Department on October 14 set aside $250 billion of the program to buy senior preferred shares and warrants in banks, thrifts and other financial institutions. Half that money was allocated to nine big banks, the Treasury Department has said. Another $38 billion has since been earmarked for regional or small banks, according to statements from individual banks. On Monday, the department announced its single-biggest TARP investment -- $40 billion in American International Group -- which the government said would not come from the $250 billion bank capital program. The TARP has so far committed the following funding: AIG $40 billion JPMorgan $25 billion Citigroup $25 billion Wells Fargo $25 billion Bank of America $15 billion Merrill Lynch $10 billion /1 Goldman Sachs $10 billion Morgan Stanley $10 billion PNC Financial Services $7.7 billion Bank of New York Mellon $3 billion State Street Corp $2 billion Capital One Financial $3.55 billion Fifth Third Bancorp $3.45 billion Regions Financial $3.5 billion SunTrust Banks $3.5 billion BB&T Corp $3.1 billion KeyCorp $2.5 billion Comerica $2.25 billion Marshall & Ilsley Corp $1.7 billion Northern Trust Corp $1.5 billion Huntington Bancshares $1.4 billion Zions Bancorp $1.4 billion First Horizon National $866 million City National Corp $395 million Valley National Bancorp $330 million UCBH Holdings Inc $298 million Umpqua Holdings Corp $214 million Washington Federal $200 million First Niagara Financial $186 million HF Financial Corp $25 million Bank of Commerce $17 million TOTAL: $203.08 billion INSURANCE COMPANIES In addition to the TARP program's $40 billion capital injection into AIG, the Federal Reserve is providing the company with up to $112.5 billion in separate loans and funds for asset purchases. Aid to the huge insurance company came after counterparties and rating downgrades forced AIG to post large amounts of collateral for its credit derivatives positions. Some other insurers are interested in cash infusions, but must own a thrift or bank in order to qualify under the terms of Treasury's current capital injection program. BANKS, LENDERS The TARP program set a November 14 deadline for smaller banks to apply for capital injection funds remaining in the pool of $250 billion. The deadline will be extended for non-publicly traded banks. The government's preferred shares will pay dividends of 5 percent annually for the first five years and 9 percent after that until the institution repurchases them. Participating banks must comply with Treasury restrictions on executive compensation, which limit tax deductibility of senior executive pay to $500,000. They require bonuses to be "clawed back" if earnings statements or gains are later proven to be materially inaccurate and prohibit "golden parachute" payments to senior executives. OTHER COMPANIES Struggling automakers General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC have requested tens of billions of dollars in Treasury aid under TARP. However, the Bush administration says the TARP program was designed by Congress to help the financial service sector, not the auto industry. REMAINING TARP MONEY The remaining $350 billion in TARP funding can be accessed only after the White House formally notifies Congress. U.S. House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank has said that if the initial banks participating in the program do not use the money for lending, Congress could block authorization of the final funding. /1 Capital injection to Merrill Lynch deferred pending its merger with Bank of America, according to Treasury Department.
