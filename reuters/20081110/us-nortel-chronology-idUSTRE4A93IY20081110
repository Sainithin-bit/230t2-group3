 (Reuters) - Nortel Networks Corp, North America's biggest maker of telephone equipment, announced sweeping cost cuts on Monday that include another 1,300 layoffs after posting a $3.4 billion loss in its latest quarter.

October 17 - Motorola's No. 2 executive, Mike Zafirovski, is appointed CEO, promising renewed growth and focus. February 8, 2006 - Nortel says it will pay $2.47 billion to settle two class-action suits from its accounting scandal.

October 15 - Nortel pays $35 million to settle civil charges filed by the SEC related to its accounting scandal.

November 10 - Nortel announces 1,300 layoffs, a freeze on salary increases and a review of its real-estate portfolio after posting a $3.4 billion quarterly loss.
