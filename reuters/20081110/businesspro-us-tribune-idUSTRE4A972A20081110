 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co, the U.S. newspaper publisher and broadcaster trying to pay off billions of dollars in debt, reported a loss from continuing operations and a 10 percent revenue drop on Monday as advertising sales fell. 

 The privately held publisher of the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times reported a third-quarter loss from continuing operations of $124 million, compared with a profit of $84 million in the same quarter a year ago. Revenue fell 10 percent to $1 billion. "We are operating in an exceptionally difficult financial and economic environment," Zell, Tribune's chief executive, said in a statement. "The newspaper industry continues to see extraordinary declines in ad revenues and Tribune is no exception." Tribune, which took on about $13 billion of debt when it went private last year under a deal led by real estate mogul Sam Zell, is trying to sell off properties such as the Chicago Cubs baseball team to pay off its debt. It already sold the Newsday newspaper on Long Island, New York, to Cablevision Systems Corp ( CVC.N ). During the quarter, Tribune sold a 10 percent interest in online jobs site CareerBuilder.com to USA Today publisher Gannett Co Inc ( GCI.N ) for $135 million. Getting rid of that burden is proving difficult. Advertising revenue fell 19 percent during the quarter, leading to a 13 percent drop in publishing revenue to $653 million. Expenses rose 6 percent to $640 million. Ad revenue fell in every category, with classifieds falling 30 percent and online revenues falling 7 percent. Broadcast and entertainment revenue dropped 6 percent to $383 million. Tribune paid $888 million in debt during the quarter, with $218 million of that money coming from another credit line. For the balance, it used money from the Newsday and Careerbuilder deals. In the statement, Zell said Tribune continues to pursue its operating strategy and to manage what factors it can.
