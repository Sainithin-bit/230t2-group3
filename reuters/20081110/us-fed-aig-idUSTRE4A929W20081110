 WASHINGTOHN  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Monday the government would buy shares of insurer American International Group as part of a restructuring of a bail-out package intended to prevent the firm from collapsing. 

 The U.S. government would lower the interest rate on loans to the firm, and establish two facilities to buy mortgage-backed securities from AIG and collateralized debt obligations on which AIG has written credit default swap contracts, the Fed said in a statement.
