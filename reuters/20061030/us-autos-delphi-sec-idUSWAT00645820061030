 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Auto-parts supplier Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK and six individuals, including the company's former chief financial officer, settled fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the regulator said on Monday. 

 The company, which is under bankruptcy protection, was not subjected to a financial penalty and agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the charges, the SEC said. The commission said Delphi and former officers engaged in accounting improprieties that led to several years of restated earnings. The SEC settled with six individuals in the case and charged seven others with securities violations. An attorney for the company could not immediately be reached for comment. "The facts here are particularly troubling because of the number of fraudulent schemes engaged in by Delphi, the length of time over which they occurred, and the number of Delphi employees, including senior officers, who carried out the schemes," said Linda Thomsen, director of the SEC's division of enforcement, in a statement. The SEC charged that between 2000 and 2004, Delphi and some of its executives engaged in multiple schemes to misstate the company's financial condition in regulatory filings, press releases and other documents. The commission settled with Delphi's former CFO, Alan Dawes, who agreed to pay $687,000 and to a five-year ban on being a corporate officer or director. He settled without admitting or denying the charges. The company's former Chief Executive, J.T. Battenberg III, was charged with participating in or aiding and abetting Delphi's fraud but has not settled the charges, the SEC said. Attorneys for Dawes and Battenberg could not immediately be reached for comment. The SEC also charged the company's former chief accounting officer, former treasurer and settled with the company's former assistant treasurer and former director of financial accounting and reporting. "We have cooperated fully with the commission's investigation and will continue to do so," Delphi chief executive Robert Miller said in a statement. He added that the settlement was a key step in the company's "transformation process" as Delphi reorganizes itself under Chapter 11 protection of the federal bankruptcy law.
