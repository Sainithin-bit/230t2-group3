  (Adds background) 

 CHICAGO  Oct 30 (Reuters) - Food distributor Sysco Corp.
( SYY.N ) on Monday said quarterly earnings fell 9 percent,
partly because of a charge for accounting changes, while sales
rose.  Net income fell to $189 million, or 30 cents per share, in
the first quarter that ended on Sept. 30 from $208.5 million,
or 33 cents per share, a year earlier after accounting
changes.  Sysco said the accounting change, which led to a loss of
$39.7 million, stemmed from corporate-owned life insurance
policies that it took out on "key individuals" to fund
obligations under nonqualified executive retirement plans.  Stripping out that one-time loss, earnings were 37 cents
per share, beating by a penny the average forecast of analysts
polled by Reuters Estimates.  Shares of Sysco rose slightly in trading before the market
opened.  Sysco has suffered in recent months from soaring fuel
costs, which rose $9 million during the quarter. However, it
said pension costs had fallen $14 million and stock-based
compensation costs had declined by $11.7 million.  Sales rose to $8.67 billion from $8.01 billion. The company
said it had gained market share by increasing sales at a faster
pace than the industry.  Sysco has been reviewing thousands of its food distribution
contracts to find ways to boost sales. Sales to customers that
participated in the reviews continued to increase at a
mid-teens percentage rate on average.  The company has also been replacing and expanding its
distribution network and incurred $115.9 million in capital
expenditures in the quarter.  Sysco shares rose to $34.35 in thin electronic trade from
Friday's close of $34.28. The stock has gained about 10 percent
this year, compared with a 20 percent increase in the Dow Jones
U.S. Restaurant and Bars index .DJUSRU.
