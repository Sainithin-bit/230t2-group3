 BALTIMORE, Maryland  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is on solid enough ground to withstand further interest rate hikes if the Federal Reserve has to curb stubbornly high inflation, Richmond Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Lacker said in a speech on Monday. 

 "The economy is resilient enough right now to withstand further tightening," he said, adding that this comes despite the slowdown in the housing market. Lacker, who has had the lone dissenting vote on the Federal Open Market Committee's last three decisions to keep rates on hold, said his outlook for inflation is "discomforting." "The longer inflation remains elevated, the more difficult it will be to bring it back down," he said. "If the Fed allows inflation to remain above target for too long, expectations could become tightly centered around a higher rate. This danger is what prompted me to vote at recent FOMC meetings for tactics aimed at bringing inflation down more rapidly," he said. Lacker has been a stalwart supporter for more interest rate increases, even after the Fed raised the federal funds rate to 5.25 percent from 1 percent in the last two years. The core PCE price index, widely seen as the Fed's favored gauge of price pressures, rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate in September, down a touch from 2.5 percent in August, according to data released on Monday. The boom in housing was driven by fundamental factors that are still quite favorable, and that while some further retrenchment seems likely in the housing market, that pullback is not likely to result in a "catastrophic collapse," he said. Lacker also characterized the prospect for consumer spending as positive, driven by his outlook for higher income. Since the August policy meeting when the Fed injected some uncertainty into the market by keeping rates steady, financial market participants have weighed every phrase from policymakers for clues on the path of interest rates. Lacker said policymakers should do more to clarify the Fed's strategy and objectives. Markets in turn should pay more attention to strategy rather than what the Fed's policy actions will be. "Instead of (financial markets) focusing on what choices we are going to make, our communications might be more usefully focused on our strategy and our objectives," Lacker said in answer to a question after a speech.
