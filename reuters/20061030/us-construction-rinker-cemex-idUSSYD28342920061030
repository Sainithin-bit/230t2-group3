 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian building materials firm Rinker Group RIN.AX rejected a US$12 billion takeover bid from cement maker Cemex CEMEXCPO.MX ( CX.N ) as inadequate, and its stock soared as much as 29 percent as investors bet on a higher offer. 

 Mexico-based Cemex, the world's third-ranked cement maker with operations in 50 countries, offered $13 (A$17) cash per share on Friday in what would be the biggest takeover ever by a Mexican company. "We think we are fully valuing what Rinker is worth," Juan Pablo San Agustin, Cemex's senior vice president of planning and finance told a conference call in Sydney on Monday, adding he didn't think there would be a rival bid. "Regarding intentions by other people to jump in, we don't think that will be the case, no, because we think our offer is fully attractive to Rinker's shareholders," he said. Buying Rinker, which derives 80 percent of its earnings from the United States, would solidify Cemex's dominance in the U.S. market, open the door in Australia and give it a foothold in China, where Rinker has four plants. Australian shares of Rinker, which had already jumped 6 percent to A$14.70 on Friday, shot to a high of A$18.90 shortly after trade resumed on Monday. They were last trading at A$18.52, up 26 percent. The bid -- which represents a premium of 23 percent to Rinker's closing price on Thursday -- comes as a slumping U.S. housing sector slowed U.S. economic growth to its weakest in over three years in the third quarter. Rinker Chairman John Morschel said Cemex's proposed offer was "opportunistic and materially undervalues the company." The board advised shareholders to take no action. Analysts said Cemex, or perhaps other potential bidders such as larger rival global cement companies Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ) and Holcim ( HOLN.VX ), or CRH Plc ( CRH.I ), would have to raise the offer to be successful. "Rinker is deserving of a premium multiple. Cemex will obviously need to raise its offer to appease Rinker shareholders," said a report from Robert Norfleet, analyst at Davenport Equity Research. "Being bought is the likely outcome of this ordeal. That withstanding, we understand (Rinker) management's ... reluctance as this offer comes at a time when conditions in Rinker's markets are difficult with multiples having compressed in the face of a challenging operating environment," he said. U.S. SLOWDOWN Cemex's San Agustin acknowledged the difficulties in the U.S. market. "We think the Florida market will continue to decrease over the next year, then maybe will be flat the second year and will begin to see some recovery over the third and fourth year," he said, citing a UBS report predicting a 20 percent fall this year in housing starts in Florida. Shares in Rinker had retreated from a high of A$21.44 hit in April, in line with the U.S. slowdown. "The company's waning share price made them vulnerable to a hostile bid," said Norfleet, who described Rinker as "a world-class operator with extremely attractive assets, end markets, and a history of excellent financial performance." The Cemex bid price values Rinker at an earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple of 9.2 times, based on earnings reported for the 2006 fiscal year. Goldman Sachs JB Were analyst Matthew McNee said transactions in the sector had averaged a multiple of 8 between 1997 and 2006. "While the Cemex bid would seem to value Rinker at the top end of this range, we believe it significantly undervalues the company with Rinker offering Cemex significant potential synergy benefits," said McNee, who said Cemex would likely need to raise its bid to more than A$20 a share. "Its exceptionally strong market positions in high growth markets are unmatched," he said. Cemex said it expects around $130 million in cost synergies a year, before tax, by the third year following the acquisition of Rinker, a figure Norfleet said was "extremely conservative." The bid announcement drove Rinker's New-York traded ADRs up 33.15 percent to close at $71.10, putting them at about a 9 percent premium to the Cemex bid price. Rinker's ADRs represent 5 ordinary Rinker shares. Shres in fellow building materials groups also rose, with James Hardie Industries NV ( JHX.AX ) gaining 5.7 percent to A$8.03 and Boral Ltd. ( BLD.AX ) stock, which had fallen 3.8 percent on Friday after a profit warning, rebounding 1.3 percent to A$7.27. Rinker has appointed UBS ( UBSN.VX ) as its financial adviser. ($1=A$1.30)
