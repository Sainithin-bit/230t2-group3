 PARIS  (Reuters) - Shares on Wall Street are expected to lose ground early on Monday as investors brace for a key gauge of consumption and inflation after Friday's weak economic growth reading cast doubt on a 3-1/2-month rally. 

 Publication of the September personal income and consumption data, and the accompanying core PCE price index, will take center stage attention at 1330 GMT, overshadowing a thin corporate earnings diary headed by Verizon ( VZ.N ). The No. 2 U.S. telephone carrier will report along with a handful or other companies, including insurer MetLife ( MET.N ) and construction-materials maker Vulcan Materials ( VMC.N ). By 1050 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening losses of between 0.2 percent and 0.3 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slid 0.6 percent to 12,090.26, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 0.85 percent to 1,377.34, and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 1.2 percent to 2,350.62. "Overall earnings growth has been robust, but traders will be wary now of over-optimistic fourth-quarter outlooks following the bleak GDP figure," said Martin Slaney at spread betters GFT Global Markets, after data showed the U.S. economy expanded at its weakest rate in more than three years in the third quarter. The personal-income and spending report will give investors clues on the strength of the U.S. economy and inflationary pressures. The data should also help the Federal Reserve decide whether it should continue to hold interest rates. "With the U.S. economy apparently slowing much quicker than many would have liked, the Fed will still hold off easing whilst inflation is at current levels," Slaney said. "The risk is very much on the upside on the core PCE figure. The last thing the markets want is the increased threat of prolonged stagflation." Investor will also likely pay close attention to comments by Chicago Fed President Michael Moscow and Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker for clues on U.S. monetary policy. The highlight of the week for investors will be U.S. non-farm payrolls on Friday. Before then there will be action at the micro end of the economy, with more earnings reports and continuing news of or speculation about takeover activity. On Monday, French electrical equipment group Schneider Electric ( SCHN.PA ) said it had agreed to buy American Power Conversion APCC.O for $31 cash per a share, or about $6.1 billion, a 30-percent premium to APC's closing price on Friday. And the Tokyo Stock Exchange said it was in talks with the New York Stock Exchange NYX.N about a possible capital tie-up that could bring together the world's two largest equities markets as early as 2009. On the results front, U.S. health insurer Humana ( HUM.N ) reported a surge in quarterly net profit to $159.2 million, or 95 cents per share, from $46.8 million, or 28 cents per share, on higher enrolment in its Medicare Advantage plans and new stand-alone prescription-drug plans.
