 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. blue-chip stocks were little changed on Monday as a report showing weaker-than-expected sales at Wal-Mart Stores Inc.( WMT.N ) offset a sharp decline in oil prices. 

 But the Nasdaq finished the session higher, buoyed by gains in Yahoo Inc. YHOO.N after Merrill Lynch upgraded the stock to "buy." The Nasdaq 100 got its biggest lift from a jump in the shares of American Power Conversion APCC.O on acquisition news. Wal-Mart shares fell 2.4 percent, or $1.20, to $49.53 on the New York Stock Exchange and were the biggest drag on the blue-chip Dow average. The world's largest retailer blamed the lower sales growth on disappointing apparel demand and disruption from store remodeling projects.  "A drop in oil prices is always welcome, but the Wal-Mart report was bad enough to dampen some of the enthusiasm," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  slipped 3.76 points, or 0.03 percent, to end at 12,086.50. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up just 0.59 of a point, or 0.04 percent, to finish at 1,377.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 13.15 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 2,363.77. In news after the closing bell, Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ) said it agreed to buy biotech firm Sirna Therapeutrics Inc. RNAI.O for $1.1 billion in cash to boost its research and development efforts in areas such as cancer treatment. Shares of Sirna Therapeutics almost doubled in extended-hours electronic trading on Monday, jumping to $12.42 from a Nasdaq close at $6.45. But Merck, a Dow component, barely budged, bid at $45.63 after hours, down a penny from its close at $45.64 on the NYSE. In regular trading, Merck's stock lost 1 percent, or 45 cents. OIL SLIDES, BOEING FLIES During the regular session, diminished concern over a threat to Saudi Arabia's oil and economic installations helped crude oil prices fall. December crude CLZ6 dropping $2.39 to settle at $58.36 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) , the world's biggest publicly traded energy company, fell almost 1 percent, or 62 cents, to $70.84 on the NYSE. It was the heaviest weight on the S&P 500 and ranked among the Dow's biggest decliners. Shares of jet maker Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) rose 0.6 percent, or 48 cents, to $80.22 on the NYSE. Brazil's Gol airline said it increased its order for Boeing aircraft to 87 from 67. <ID:nN30375191> The stock, among the Dow's biggest gainers, helped curb its decline. But U.S. phone company Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), another Dow component, fell after news that its Internet subscriber growth disappointed some analysts. Verizon fell 3.1 percent, or $1.19, to $37.65 on the NYSE. The stock was the second-heaviest weight on both the Dow and the S&P 500. GOOD DAY FOR TECH STOCKS In Nasdaq trading, Yahoo gained 2.4 percent, or 61 cents, to $25.95 after Merrill Lynch upgraded the Internet media company's stock to "buy" from "neutral".  Merrill Lynch cited the stock's attractive price and the start of the strong holiday period. American Power Conversion shares jumped 26.4 percent, or $6.26, to $30.02 and gave the biggest lift to the Nasdaq 100 .NDX after French electrical engineering company Schneider Electric ( SCHN.PA ) said it had agreed to buy American Power. Earlier, American Power Conversion's stock hit a fresh 52-week high at $30.15. Software makers, including Oracle Corp. ORCL.O, and Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), the world's dominant chip maker, also rose, rebounding from Friday's heavy losses. Oracle rose 2.3 percent, or 42 cents, to $18.52, while Intel gained 0.8 percent, or 16 cents, to $21.26, both on the Nasdaq. The top-performing sector for both Nasdaq and S&P 500 stocks was systems software, while the semiconductor sector was the Nasdaq's second-best performer. Volume was moderately active on the NYSE, where about 1.43 billion shares changed hands, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion. On the Nasdaq, about 1.80 billion shares were traded, matching last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Advancers outpaced decliners on the Big Board by a ratio of about 6 to 5, while on the Nasdaq, more than eight stocks rose for every seven that fell.
