 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Mexico-based cement maker Cemex CEMEXCPO.MX ( CX.N ) said on Monday its US$12 billion take-over bid for Rinker Group Ltd. RIN.AX fully values the Australian building materials company. 

 "We think we are fully valuing what Rinker is worth", Juan Pablo San Agustin, Cemex's senior vice president of planning and finance, told a conference call in Sydney. Rinker earlier on Monday rejected the bid, saying it undervalued the company. ($1=A$1.30)
