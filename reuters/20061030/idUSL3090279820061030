  (Adds CEO and CFO comments, closing share price)      By  Marcel Michelson       PARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - French electrical equipment group Schneider Electric ( SCHN.PA ) said on Monday it had agreed to buy American Power Conversion APCC.O (APC) for about $6.1 billion in cash at $31 a share to grow in uninterrupted power supply.      APC was under pressure from a shareholder, Matrix Asset Advisors Inc, to sell itself because its share price did not reflect its intrinsic value. The price represents a 30 percent premium to APC's closing share price of Oct. 27.      Reuters data show Schneider is paying 36 times expected 2007 earnings per share and 2.44 times the expected 2007 sales of APC.       Schneider will finance the deal with a 4.5 billion euros  ($5.71 billion) syndicated loan, a share capital increase via a rights issue of some 1.2 billion and through the issue of bonds.      Schneider's stock closed 7.2 percent lower at 82 euros, following a 7.8 percent gain so far this year, underperforming a 0.7 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx industrial index .SXNP.      Analyst Olivier Esnou at Exane BNP Paribas said that at 30 times expected 2007 earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), the deal was 'very expensive' and the timing looked poor.      "Achieving a return will require turning around APC's large UPS business," he said. "But Schneider has little track record in turnarounds, and may be pursuing growth at too rapid a pace."      The group said the takeover, based on an enterprise value of about $5.5 billion, would make it a global leader in the market for critical power services, which ensure uninterrupted power supplies to data centres and production facilities.       The acquisition was expected to result in value creation in excess of $3 billion arising from a turnaround in large uninterrupted power supply systems, strong complementarity with Schneider's MGE UPS Systems subsidiary, and synergies with Schneider Electric's product offering.      It estimated synergy benefits of some $220 million, of which 70 percent would be achieved by 2009, and an increase in earnings per share from 2007, meeting Schneider's criteria for three-year return on capital employed for acquisitions.      Deutsche Bank analyst Martin Wilkie said the acquisition made sense if synergies could be achieved.      STRATEGIC MOVE      Chief Executive Jean-Pascal Tricoire called the acquisition "a significant strategic move", allowing Schneider to become stronger in its fastest growing segment -- electrical distribution.      At a news conference, he ruled out a similar-sized acquisition in the near future. "Our strategy is to make medium sized acquisitions to complement our growth platforms," he said.      Commenting on the financing of the takeover, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Bouchut said the company would still have "room for manoeuvre in the next two to three years ... to allow for external growth ... to continue to make acquistions ... of 500 to 800 million euros a year".      Lazard and Merrill Lynch & Co. are financial advisers to Schneider Electric, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP is legal counsel. Goldman Sachs & Co. is financial adviser to APC and Clifford Chance US LLP is legal counsel.   APC said in September it was cutting 4 percent of its global workforce, or about 330 jobs, as part of an ongoing cost-cutting programme. Combined with previously announced cuts, the company has plans to reduce about 7 percent of its work force.  In July, the company said that second-quarter net profit fell 41 percent as expenses rose.
