 BEIJING/TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers LEH.N said on Monday it is teaming up with International Business Machines ( IBM.N ) to form a $180 million joint venture to invest in a range of public and private Chinese companies. 

 Each partner will invest an initial $90 million. "The fund will offer Chinese businesses access to investment capital as well as best practice technology and business strategies," Michael Odrich, Lehman Brothers global head of private equity, said in a statement. Instead of focusing on early-stage technology companies, as many venture capital groups do, Lehman and IBM's fund will target more well-developed firms. The fund would exclude investment in real estate at least initially, Elias Mendoza, IBM's managing director of corporate development for Asia-Pacific, told a news conference in Beijing. "I think where our collaboration would be able to add the least value is in the real estate market," Mendoza said. "From an IBM perspective, we feel probably more comfortable contributing to industries that are in the operational and management and technology (fields), where they can take advantage of that more than the real estate sector can." Christopher Manning, a managing director of Lehman Brothers in private equity, said Lehman had investments in property in China through other funds and the exclusion of real estate from this one did not suggest the bank was negative on the sector. Manning named health care, consumer products, financial services and communications as sectors in which the fund had already begun reviewing opportunities. Except for real estate, start-ups and very small companies, all options were open. Typically, he said, the fund would aim to take 10-20 percent stakes. Private equity firms have been pouring into China, attracted by the country's 10 percent growth rate. In the January-August period of this year funds raised $1.73 billion to invest in China, well above $1.09 billion they gathered in the same period last year, according to researchers at Hong-Kong based AVCJ.
