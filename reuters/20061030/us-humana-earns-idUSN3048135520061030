 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer Humana Inc. ( HUM.N ) on Monday reported third-quarter earnings slightly below analysts' estimates as it saw weakness in one of its Medicare drug plans, and its shares fell 7 percent. 

 Although the company forecast 2007 profit above Wall Street estimates, analysts said the market had already expected such a bullish outlook. "Expectations going into this quarter, I think, were awfully high" for 2007, said David Heupel, a portfolio manager for Thrivent Investment Management. The stock "is reflecting a little bit less enthusiasm then it was going in." FTN Midwest analyst Peter Costa said Humana's forecast for Medicare enrollment growth next year also might have disappointed investors. Humana stands apart from other large U.S. insurers for its big bet on Medicare this year, when private companies took on a greater role in administering benefits for the federal health insurance program for the elderly and disabled. That bet has paid off for shareholders in 2006: Humana shares are still up about 12.5 percent, compared with a 12 percent decline for the S&P Managed Health Care index  .GSPHMO. Net income at the Louisville, Kentucky-based company rose to $159.2 million, or 95 cents per share, from $46.8 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier, when it recorded large expenses from a class-action settlement. Analysts on average expected earnings of 97 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 48 percent to $5.65 billion. Analysts had expected $5.9 billion. The company stuck with its outlook of 2006 earnings of $2.82 to $2.88 per share, compared with Wall Street's expectations of $2.82. For 2007, Humana forecast profit at $3.90 to $4.10 per share. Analysts were expecting $3.50. "Even though the earnings guidance for next year was strong, people were hoping for a strong number, and to some extent, you probably have people selling on the news," FTN Midwest's Costa said. Heupel said the share drop also could reflect investor concerns about the future role of companies in administering Medicare, ahead of next week's U.S. Congressional elections that could leave more power in the hands of Democrats. Humana Chief Executive Mike McCallister said on a conference call with analysts he didn't think anything will happen in 2007 or 2008 "from a real change perspective," regardless of the outcome of the elections. As Medicare encounters budget problems, McCallister said, "All of the things we're doing are going to be valuable to anyone trying to manage health care costs. Period." Third-quarter membership in the Medicare Advantage full-service insurance plans nearly doubled to 993,000 members from a year earlier. Enrollment was up by 33,200 members from the second quarter. Humana projected Medicare Advantage membership rising to between 1.1 million and 1.2 million members by the end of next year. Enrollment in its stand-alone Medicare plans that cover just prescription drugs -- new in 2006 -- reached 3.52 million, up 62,200 from the second quarter. Wachovia analyst Matt Perry said in a research note that the earnings miss stemmed from disappointing results at Humana's "Complete" plan, which offers the widest benefits of the company's three stand-alone drug-coverage plans. McCallister said Humana had addressed the problems with the Complete plan. For 2007, he said, "we expect all three plan offerings to be solid contributors to our earnings growth." Humana shares were down $4.60, or 7 percent, at $61.10 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. (Additional reporting by  Michael Flaherty )
