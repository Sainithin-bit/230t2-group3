 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. homeowners aspire to be greener and plan to spend more on home improvements as they favor staying in their existing homes, Doreen Woo Ho, president of Wells Fargo's consumer credit group, told Reuters in a recent interview. 

 Homeowners will spend now on environmental improvements that cut costs later, with spiking oil and gas prices fresh in mind. "Everyone is more environmentally conscious. It's creeping into all sorts of decisions, and we think that consumers are catching that message too," Woo Ho told Reuters on Wednesday. But owners also want state-of-the art kitchens and bathrooms, and are sensing that borrowing rates are stabilizing -- or even headed lower -- after two years of Federal Reserve interest rates hikes. These are some findings from Wells Fargo's third annual U.S. homeowner survey.  Woo Ho, who is based in San Francisco, was in New York to discuss the study and accept a U.S. Banker magazine award as one of the 25 most powerful women in banking. COCOONING, IMPROVING The housing market has been undergoing a dramatic shift, as the double-digit annual price surges of the first five years of the decade have given way to slower price appreciation or declines in some regions. "I think we all anticipate that the increase in values in the future is not going to be as rapid as in the past," said Woo Ho, who oversees a $98 billion portfolio of home equity, personal credit lines and loans as well as student loans. "The idea is that you didn't make a mistake unless you think you have to flip, and then, yes, you're at great risk." Eighty percent of those surveyed by Wells Fargo said they had no regret about buying their current home. "Consumers are still feeling good about values, which is good, because if everyone was panicking right now I think that would only cause a more dramatic shift in the market," said Woo Ho. Steadier interest rates, incentives to be greener, and a costly housing market that makes trading-up daunting all point to greater spending on home improvements. The survey also found that a vast majority of owners are happy with their location, even if they do not own the home of their dreams. They are more likely to improve than to move. Baby boomers are also moving near their childhood homes, due to aging parents or just getting back to their roots, she said. "If you're going to be closer to your family and friends, thinking of spending more time at home, the quality of the environment is more important. ... You want the space, the kitchens, the bathrooms, the bedrooms," she said. "That cocooning instinct is going to spur home improvement." EDUCATION Looming large for the industry also is a massive wave of interest-rate resets on adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs. Between $1.1 trillion and $1.5 trillion of ARMs are eligible to be reset next year, and most will do so at much higher interest rates or will be refinanced to other loan products, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. But the survey found that just 61 percent of ARM holders recalled their reset dates. "I think we're as much in the business of giving education and advice as we are in giving people money," Woo Ho said, especially amid the rapid innovation of loan products with varied risk levels. "We would certainly, from a marketing standpoint, be notifying them way in advance to give them the refinancing options," aiming to keep the borrower's business, she said.
