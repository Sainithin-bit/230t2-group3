 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) said on Monday it bought 5.5 million shares of discount retailer Target Corp. ( TGT.N ), and increased more than twelve-fold to 24.59 million shares its stake in health-care company Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ). 

 In separate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Berkshire said the Target stake was worth $268.8 million as of June 30, while the J&J stake was worth $1.47 billion as of that date. Berkshire had previously disclosed owning 1.97 million J&J shares as of March 31. Target shares closed Monday up 30 cents at $58.86, but rose as much as 1.3 percent to $59.65 in after-hours electronic trading after Berkshire disclosed the stake. J&J shares closed down 47 cents at $67.70, and were little changed after-hours. Regulators sometimes let Berkshire delay disclosing some holdings so investors can't mimic Buffett while Berkshire is adding to its portfolio. Berkshire is expected next month to disclose its stock holdings as of September 30. A Berkshire spokeswoman declined to comment. Based on reported shares outstanding, the Berkshire stakes account for 0.6 percent of Minneapolis-based Target's stock and 0.8 percent of New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J's stock. Berkshire is based in Omaha, Nebraska. Buffett, the world's second-richest person, prefers investing in industry-leading companies with stable, easy-to-understand businesses and strong management, and whose shares appear undervalued. Including Target and J&J, Berkshire ended June with more than $46 billion of equity investments, filings show. Berkshire previously disclosed owning about 19.94 million shares in Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's largest retailer and Target's main rival, as of June 30. It also owned 488,500 American depositary receipts in French drugmaker Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) as of that date.
