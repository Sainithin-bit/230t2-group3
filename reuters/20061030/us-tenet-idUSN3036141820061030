 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hospital chains Tenet Healthcare Corp. ( THC.N ) and Triad Hospitals Inc. ( TRI.N ) on Monday each said they had a disappointing quarter, blaming the impact of unpaid medical bills largely stemming from the rising numbers of patients without health insurance. 

 Tenet, the second-biggest U.S. hospital chain, forecast a third-quarter loss steeper than Wall Street expected, citing unpaid medical bills and fewer patient visits. Triad said profit fell 14 percent, after earlier this month shaving its forecast by nearly 20 cents per share. Tenet shares fell about 11 percent, while Triad shares fell about 1 percent, both on the New York Stock Exchange. The rising toll of unpaid medical bills has been eating into hospitals' profits in recent years and is taking up a bigger chunk of revenue. Bad debt is rising as the number of people in the United States without health insurance climbs. More than 46 million people -- or about 16 percent of the U.S. population -- lack medical insurance. "I'd like to tell you guys that we've got this thing under control ... but I can't do that," Triad Chief Executive Officer Denny Shelton told analysts on a conference call. "I know there are a lot of people out there that say 'why can't you collect?' This is a U.S. healthcare issue. It is not a Triad issue." Most hospital companies this quarter cited the unyielding toll of bad debt as marring profit in quarterly results. Most analysts had forecast that bad debt trends would not improve, but they hoped they would at least stabilize. "Underlying trends are probably about as bad or worse than we thought," SG Cowen analyst Kemp Dolliver said. The warning by Tenet, which has restated several years of earnings amid government investigations and shareholder lawsuits in recent years, "undermine the optimist view that they could get a turnaround going in this environment," Dolliver said. Dallas-based Tenet forecast an operating loss of 5 cents to 7 cents per share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates forecast, on average, a loss of 2 cents per share. It forecast a net loss of $82 million to $92 million, or 17 cents to 20 cents per share. Tenet said unpaid medical bills as a percentage of revenue grew to 16.4 percent in the third quarter from 14.9 percent a year earlier. Tenet said admissions in the third quarter fell 3.3 percent from a year earlier, excluding 10 hospitals the company has up for sale. The company, which will release full results on November 7, owns 66 hospitals, in California, Texas and throughout the Southeastern U.S. Publicly traded hospital companies run about 15 percent of the approximately 4,800 hospitals in U.S., with the remaining privately held, nonprofit or government-owned. While bad debt and the uninsured impacts all hospitals, the publicly traded companies are feeling the effects to a greater degree, in part because they are concentrated in states with greater rates of the uninsured, including Texas and Florida, according to analysts. TRIAD Plano, Texas-based Triad said net income fell to $39.8 million, or 46 cents per share, from $46.3 million, or 53 cents a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 47 cents a share, in line with its estimate when it trimmed projections earlier in October. Triad, which owns 52 hospitals mostly in the South and Eastern U.S., was spun off of No. 1 hospital company HCA Inc. ( HCA.N ) in 1999. HCA in July agreed to a $21 billion buyout from private equity groups, excluding debt. CEO Shelton repeated his comments that the company continues to be in discussions with private equity firms, but that he would prefer to remain a public company. "There is nothing imminent. It is a dialogue that is going to continue," he said. Still, he added, "I have met with two or three groups that I've been real impressed with." Admissions were a bright spot in Triad's results, rising about 3.7 percent, though margins contracted. Medical debt rose to 11.1 percent from 7.3 percent a year ago. Triad will recommend approval of a share repurchase program of up to $250 million at its board meeting November 2. Triad shares fell 43 cents to $37.39, while Tenet shares fell 89 cents to $7.41.
