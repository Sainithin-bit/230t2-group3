 NEW YORK  Oct 30 (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc.
( SPG.N ), the largest U.S. retail property owner, on Monday said
quarterly funds from operations, a key performance measure of
real estate investment trusts, rose 9.4 percent, as higher
rents and sales offset lower occupancy at the company's malls
and outlet centers.  "Strong growth in tenant sales and healthy re-leasing
spreads for both our regional mall and Premium Outlet platforms
are driving our results," David Simon, the company's chief
executive, said in a statement.  The company reported third-quarter funds from operations
(FFO) of $369.5 million, or $1.30 per share, beating Wall Street's
forecast of $1.28 per share and up from from $337.7 million, or
$1.19 per share, in the year-ago quarter.  The company again raised its outlook for the year.  During the quarter, total revenue rose nearly 5 percent to
$818.7 million.  Mall occupancy fell 10 basis points -- 100 basis points
equal one percentage point -- to 92.5 percent, while sales per
square foot at stores open more than a year rose 6.5 percent to
$474 per square foot and average rent rose 2.7 percent to
$35.23 per square foot.  At the company's Chelsea outlet centers, occupancy fell 30
basis points to 99.3 percent, while sales rose 6 percent to
$462 per square foot. Average rent rose 4.6 percent to $24.05
per square foot,  After the release of the company's third-quarter report,
Simon shares fell to $95.75 from its close of $97.22 on the New
York Stock Exchange.  "Given what we've seen of (concern) about the strength of
the consumer, put that with a fall across the board in
occupancy, you're just not seeing anything to get yourself
excited about the stock right now," said Shawn Campbell,
principal with Campbell Asset Management.  Simon again raised its outlook for 2006 to FFO in the range of
$5.36 per share, including a charge of $7 million, or 2 cents per
share, for the redemption of preferred stock, from its previously
raised forecast of $5.30 per share to $5.35 per share. Analysts
had expected $5.36 per share before Simon raised its forecast,
according to Reuters Estimates.  FFO, a widely accepted measure of REIT performance, removes
the profit-reducing effect that depreciation -- a noncash
accounting item -- has on earnings.  On a net basis, the company said net profit available to
common stockholders rose 27.2 percent to $94.6 million, or 43
cents per share, from $74.4 million or 34 cents per share.  After the release of the company's third-quarter report,
Simon shares fell to $95.75 from its close of $97.22 on the New
York Stock Exchange.  Since the beginning of the year, Simon shares are up 27
percent, while small rival Taubman Centers Inc. ( TCO.N ) are up 35
percent.
