 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bermuda-based reinsurer Max Re Capital Ltd. MXRE.O said its chief executive had resigned as it reopened a probe into two risk contracts and prepared to downgrade past profits. 

 It also said it would delay a quarterly earnings call that was due on Monday. The reinsurer, which has a stock market value of about $1.4 billion, said Robert Cooney resigned as chairman and chief executive officer and that Cooney would be available on a consulting basis until December 31, 2006. Max Re said its board appointed W. Marston Becker, a director, as chairman and acting CEO effective immediately. "After founding and leading Max Re for seven years, I have submitted my resignation because I believe it is in the best interests of the company to do so," said Cooney in a statement. Max Re said it would restate its financial statements for the years ending December 31, 2001 through 2005, and for the periods ended March 31, 2006 and June 30, 2006. Max Re said it expected the restatement would reduce retained earnings at June 30, 2006 by not more than $10 million, or 17 cents per share. The company said it now believed, subject to a review by auditors KPMG, that its net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2006 was $25 million, or 40 cents per diluted share, and $120 million, or $1.89 per diluted share, respectively. Max Re said its third quarter earnings call scheduled for Monday October 30 was postponed. It did not say whether the results themselves would be delayed. Nobody at the company was immediately available for comment. RISK TRANSFER The reinsurer said it was re-opening the probe into the way it had accounted for two risk contracts because it had received new information from a counter-party. It said the information raised questions about the findings of the original probe, which had determined that the contracts had enough risk transfer in them to be accounted for as reinsurance. Max Re also said that Peter Minton, chief risk officer, had assumed the additional role of chief operating officer, and that Angelo Guagliano, executive vice president of the company's operating subsidiary, Max Re Ltd., had assumed the role of chief underwriting officer.
