 LONDON  (Reuters) - Online gaming firm 888 Holdings Plc ( 888.L ) confirmed on Monday it has held talks with third parties since the United States effectively banned Internet gambling at the end of September. 

 In an unsourced report, The Sunday Times said 888 had held preliminary talks about a possible merger with rival PartyGaming  PRTY.L. In a statement 888 said it had held "various preliminary discussions with third parties following suspension of its U.S. activities," adding that there was no certainty that the discussions would proceed to an offer being made for the company or any other action. The newspaper said executives from the two companies -- which would have a joint market capitalization of almost 1.6 billion pounds ($3 billion) -- expected to hold further talks in the coming weeks as gaming firms consider options to combine their online pool of players in the wake of the U.S. changes. PartyGaming was not immediately available for comment.
