 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc. ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer, said on Monday that its earnings rose 33 percent in the third quarter, helped by record premiums. 

 New York City-based MetLife said earnings were $999 million or $1.29 a share, up from $742 million or 97 cents a share in the year earlier quarter. MetLife said operating earnings, which analysts use to measure performance because it excludes investment gains and losses, were $958 million or $1.24 a share. Analysts on average had expected the life insurer to earn $1.17 a share, according to Reuters estimates. In the year ago quarter, MetLife earned $780 million or $1.01 a share in operating earnings. MetLife sold its 80-acres of New York apartments on Manhattan's East Side earlier this month to a real estate venture and a private equity firm for $5.4 billion, nearly $500 million higher than most expected. The sale of the 11,000 apartments will result in a gain to MetLife of about $3 billion before the year ends, and analysts have predicted the company could use at least part of that for a share buyback or increase in the dividend.
