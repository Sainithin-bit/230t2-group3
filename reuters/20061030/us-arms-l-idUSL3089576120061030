 LONDON  (Reuters) - Defense contractor L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. ( LLL.N ). has said it is not seeking a buyer even though offers would be entertained, the Financial Times said on Monday. 

 Newly-appointed Chief Executive Michael Strianese told the newspaper in an interview he was not actively marketing the company and had not received any approaches, but said it was the board's duty to consider any bids, the newspaper reported. It did not provide a direct quote of this remark. The company is worth more than $9 billion, according to Reuters data. In an interview with Reuters last week, Strianese said L-3 was not actively looking to be acquired. Takeover speculation has surrounded the firm since its co-founder, Frank Lanza, died in June.
