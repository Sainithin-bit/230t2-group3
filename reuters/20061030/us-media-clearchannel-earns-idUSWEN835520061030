 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc. ( CCU.N ), which is in talks to go private, on Monday forecast strong fourth-quarter radio advertising sales and posted a 9.5 percent drop in third-quarter profit, reflecting the spinoff of its entertainment unit. 

 The largest U.S. radio operator did not comment on talks with private equity groups interested in buying the company. Clear Channel has said only that it is considering strategic alternatives, but sources have said discussions are at an advanced stage. Radio broadcasting revenue was up 5 percent to $962 million in the third quarter, fueled by higher national advertising and outpacing the industry as a whole thanks to the auto, retail and entertainment categories. Outdoor advertising revenue rose 8 percent to $720 million. Company officials on a conference call said fourth-quarter radio revenue, a key indicator of advertising sales, is currently pacing up 8.8 percent, compared with analysts' forecasts of 4 percent to 5 percent. Clear Channel said profit fell to $185.9 million in the third quarter from $205.5 million a year earlier, when $33.6 million of earnings came from operations no longer part of the company. Clear Channel last year spun off its concert promotion business, now called Live Nation Inc. Per-share earnings were unchanged at 38 cents because of a decrease in shares outstanding. Revenue increased 7 percent to $1.79 billion. The earnings per share met Wall Street expectations on a net basis and were a penny ahead, excluding some items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue had been targeted at $1.8 billion by analysts. Profit before discontinued operations rose 8 percent to $185.9 million, Clear Channel said. Clear Channel's stock was unchanged at $34.70 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock climbed 10 percent last week as buyout speculation swirled and the company confirmed it had hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives. Company officials forecast fourth-quarter outdoor advertising would rise 9.2 percent in its Americas division, which includes operations in both North and South America, and would be flat in its international division. Two private equity consortia are looking into making a bid for Clear Channel, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters last week. Analysts estimate an offer could approach $40 per share. Analysts widely believe the buyout groups are particularly interested in the outdoor advertising business, since the radio sector faces increased competition from new technologies like iPods, the Web and satellite radio. "Clear Channel Communications results were in line (with expectations), but outdoor was stronger ... highlighting our belief that private equity interest is more focused on outdoor," said Jonathan Jacoby, analyst with Bank of America. Kit Spring, analyst with Stifel, Nicolaus, said, "Billboards would be the crown jewel of the company because these private equity folks look out three to five years. You can count on the billboard company's cash flow, while radio is a little more questionable." "Part of Clear Channel's radio acceleration is due to easy comparisons to a year ago and also because Clear Channel is taking (market) shares from their peers," he said. In 2005, San Antonio, Texas-based Clear Channel bet on a strategy of cutting back commercial air time to boost ratings and prices. Radio sales dropped initially but have resumed rising in recent quarters. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg  in New York)
