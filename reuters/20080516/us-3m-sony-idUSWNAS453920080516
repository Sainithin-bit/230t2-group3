 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - 3M Co ( MMM.N ) and Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) have agreed to a licensing deal that gives Sony the right to use certain 3M optical film technologies for use in LCD television products, the companies said on Friday. 

 In a joint statement, the companies said the licensing deal covers prismatic films for use in making liquid-crystal display panels. Optical films are used to make electronic displays brighter than displays without enhancement films, which results in energy savings for devices using them.
