 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - InBev INTB.BR, the world's largest beer producer by volume, on Thursday beat market expectations with a 25 percent rise in third-quarter core profit, as sales leapt in Latin America and eastern Europe. 

 Its shares gained 3 percent at the opening, outperforming the Dow Jones Stoxx European food and beverage index .SX3P, which was up 0.9 percent. InBev, whose key brands include Stella Artois, Beck's and Brahma, said earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were 1.209 billion euros ($1.54 billion), compared with 966 million euros a year earlier. InBev said the like-for-like increase was 19.0 percent, while sales gained 10.9 percent, or 7.1 percent on a like-for-like basis, to 3.542 billion euros. InBev's profit was above the average forecast in a Reuters poll of 12 analysts for EBITDA of 1.144 billion euros. The average sales forecast was 3.54 billion euros. Volume growth of some 7.0 percent in Latin America and 14.2 percent in central and eastern Europe, with strong spikes in Russia and Ukraine, helped push up overall turnover. Consolidation of acquired units, Quinsa in Latin America and Fujian Sedrin in China, also helped. The company's savings program in western Europe swelled the bottom line by trimming costs by 26 million euros in the third quarter. The program is partly to offset sluggish regional volumes. They fell 2.3 percent in the third quarter. Volumes also dropped 2.5 percent in North America, another mature market. MARGIN IMPROVEMENT Margins improved in all zones, as did revenues per hectoliter, with the exception of those in the Asia Pacific. InBev has so far not given a 2006 forecast, saying only it is aiming for an EBITDA margin of 30 percent in 2007, a target set when Interbrew and AmBev merged to form InBev in 2004. The margin after nine months of this year was already 31.8 percent. Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said that, with one quarter left, InBev was confident of achieving the 30 percent target ahead of plan. "It's a good result. At the margin level it is a very impressive improvement," said KBC Securities analyst Wim Hoste, referring to growth of 34.1 percent in the third quarter from 30.2 percent a year earlier. "What is important is margin evolution and you know they have so much more to come," he added. KBC raised its share price target to 49 euros from 45. InBev plans to roll out its zero-based budgeting savings plans to eastern Europe and Asia. InBev also said its AmBev AMB4V.SAABV.N unit intended to make a voluntary offer to buy the shares it does not already own in Latin American brewer Quilmes Industrial SA LQU.N. It already has an economic interest of 91 percent. InBev shares have risen some 26 percent so far this year, outperforming the DJ Stoxx European food and beverage index, which is up 13 percent. SABMiller ( SAB.L ), the world's second-largest brewer and maker of Miller Lite, Castle and Peroni, also released figures on Thursday. Its half-year earnings grew 7 percent, in line with expectations. InBev trades at over 17 times forecast 2007 earnings, a slight premium to rivals such as Heineken ( HEIN.AS ) and SABMiller due in part to its exposure to fast-growing markets, notably Latin America.
