 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) said on Thursday it has agreed to sell its slow-growing global pharmaceuticals business for nearly $2.1 billion in a three-part transaction. 

 J.P. Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa said the selling price was lower then he expected, but added that he was glad to see the company dump a non-core asset. Graceway Pharmaceuticals Inc. will buy 3M's pharmaceutical operations in the United States, Canada and Latin America for $875 million. Graceway is a portfolio company of Chicago-based private equity firm GTCR Golder Rauner. Swedish drugs group Meda AB ( MEDAa.ST ) will buy 3M's pharmaceutical business in Europe for $857 million. Meda shares surged in Stockholm by 10 percent after the news. Australian private equity firms Ironbridge Capital and Archer Capital will acquire 3M's pharmaceutical operations in the Asia-Pacific region, including Australia and South Africa, for $349 million. In a research note, Tusa said the deals represented multiples of about nine times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and less than three times sales. That compares with average multiples of 10.5 and 3.7, respectively, in the pharmaceutical sector, he said. But the analyst, who has an "overweight" rating on 3M shares, added, "From a strategic perspective, however, the completion of the deals will be a meaningful step toward refocusing the portfolio around core technology strengths. Pharma did not fit well with the profile of the rest of the portfolio." 3M, known best as the maker of Scotch tape, Post-It notes, Thinsulate insulation and a host of other products, said the deals were expected to close in the fourth quarter. It said it would record a gain and charges as a result of the transactions. Of the 1,050 employees in the division, about 70 percent will be offered jobs with the acquiring companies, 3M said. 3M shares were off 46 cents at $79.06 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange and are up about 18 percent since hitting a 52-week low of $67.06 on July 25. BETTER OFF WITH SOMEONE ELSE On April 4, 3M said it was exploring the sale of the drug business, which develops and sells branded drug products related to dermatology, women's health, cardiology and respiratory medicine. To be competitive, 3M said, its drugs business needs a broad pipeline of new products and significant investment, and would fit better with a dedicated pharmaceutical company. Growth across the unit, which produces genital warts treatment Aldara, was slowing, analysts said. Its branded pharmaceuticals include Difflam, Duromine, Tambocor, Maxair, Metrogel-Vaginal and Minitran. 3M, which was advised by Goldman Sachs in the deals, does not disclose the division's annual sales, but Morningstar has estimated them at $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. Last December, St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M tapped George Buckley as chief executive, replacing James McNerney, who departed for Boeing Co. ( BA.N ). Analysts said at the time that they expected Buckley to prune some businesses. The drug business is part of 3M's health-care unit, which posted almost $4.4 billion in sales last year and is one of the company's six major units. (Additional reporting by  Ben Klayman  in Chicago)
