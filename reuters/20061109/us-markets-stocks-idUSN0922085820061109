 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell for the first time in three days on Thursday, led by a drop in the shares of big drug makers and health-care companies as investors worried that a Democrat-controlled Congress may move to curb prices. 

 A jump of more than 2 percent in crude oil prices and a weaker-than-expected reading in a gauge of consumer sentiment added to the weaker tone. Democrats' big victories in Tuesday's U.S. elections prompted concerns about more regulation in health-care and other industries. Thursday marked the second day of declines for the drug sector. Pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) and health-care products company Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) were the top negative influences on the Dow and among the biggest drags on the S&P 500. Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) also weighed heavily on the S&P 500. "Health care continues to get hurt because the notion of empowering HHS (the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) to negotiate drug prices is something the Democrats can get at fairly quickly," said Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment officer for Ryan, Beck & Co., in Yardley, Pennsylvania. After the closing bell, shares of American International Group ( AIG.N ) rose 1.5 percent to $69.05 in electronic composite trading after the world's largest insurer posted earnings that beat Wall Street estimates. For details, see <ID:nN09442837> AIG closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $68.04, down 0.5 percent, or 34 cents. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 73.24 points, or 0.60 percent, to close at 12,103.30. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 7.39 points, or 0.53 percent, to finish at 1,378.33. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 8.93 points, or 0.37 percent, to end at 2,376.01. DEMOCRATS AND THE DRUG SECTOR Late Thursday afternoon, Virginia Republican Sen. George Allen conceded defeat to Democrat James Webb, giving Democrats a majority in the U.S. Congress for the first time in 12 years. The sell-off "was in part due to the concession and the fact they now have both houses," said Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., in San Francisco, referring to the pivotal role of the Virginia Senate race to the Democrats' return to power in Congress. "But we were looking for a pullback anyway after the pre-election rally." Shares of Merck fell 3.3 percent, or $1.46, to $42.88, while shares of Pfizer slipped 2.9 percent, or 78 cents, to $25.84 and shares of Johnson & Johnson dropped 2.7 percent, or $1.84, to $66.15, all on the New York Stock Exchange. QUALCOMM'S TROUBLES Weighing on the Nasdaq were shares of Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) Japan's antitrust watchdog has told Qualcomm's Japanese subsidiary that it may investigate its licensing and chip business practices in Japan, Qualcomm said. Its shares fell 4 percent, or $1.45, to $34.83. The Nasdaq was higher earlier in the day, helped by gains in shares of leading network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ). The company late Wednesday reported stronger-than-expected profits. Cisco's shares rose 6.4 percent, or $1.61, to $26.71. Crude oil for December delivery CLZ6 rose $1.33 to settle at $61.66 a barrel in New York, following a deeper-than-expected drop in U.S. distillate stockpiles and supply cuts by the Organizaton of Petroleum Exporting Countries. On the economic front, the University of Michigan's preliminary reading on consumer sentiment in November came out at 92.3, down from October's reading of 93.6, raising worries about the spending outlook. <ID:nN09390309> But a narrower-than-expected September trade deficit was viewed positively as economists said it suggested U.S. companies and consumers were spending less on overseas oil. <ID:nN09390309> U.S. government bond prices pared gains and the dollar fell after China's central bank chief said the country has a clear plan to diversify its $1 trillion of foreign-exchange reserves. The news had little effect on stocks. Trading was heavy on the NYSE, with about 1.86 billion shares changing hands, above last year's daily average of 1.61 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.46 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of more than 3 to 2 on the NYSE and by 2 to 1 on Nasdaq.
