 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Lenovo Group Ltd. ( 0992.HK ) posted a worse-than-expected 16 percent quarterly earnings slide, as the world's No. 3 PC maker asked for patience while it struggled to make global headway after buying IBM's ( IBM.N ) PC arm. 

 Shares in the firm, which climbed 19 percent from July to September, ended Thursday 2 percent higher -- off morning peaks -- after nearly straying into negative territory in the afternoon when its results emerged. Lenovo's global business should stay weak for the foreseeable future -- in the fiscal second quarter, shipments in second-largest market the United States slid 9 percent -- as the company faces difficulty gaining brand recognition among consumers outside of its Asian stronghold, analysts said. It has been grappling with expenses arising from the US$1.25 billion purchase of IBM's PC arm, amid competition from bigger rivals Dell Inc. DELL.O and Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ): a burden that should persist into coming quarters, analysts said. And, like its rivals, it might have to contend with slower global PC shipment growth in 2006 and 2007. The firm, one of an increasing number of Chinese corporations trying to craft a global brand, earned US$38 million in the second fiscal quarter ended September, versus US$45.2 million a year ago, according to Reuters' calculations off previously reported data. That followed a sharp fourth-quarter loss and a slim US$5 million first-quarter profit. Lenovo vastly underperformed Acer Inc.'s ( 2353.TW ) 6 percent earnings dip over the same period. Its second-quarter result lagged a consensus forecast for a net profit of HK$335.3 million ($43.08 million), according to six analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. "The result is disappointing," said Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Chuang. "They just booked a $2 million restructuring cost so I expect more to come in the following quarters, and competition is a problem." "In terms of valuation, Lenovo is a lot more expensive (than rivals). There're better choices out there."

"The next step of improvement won't come from just synergies or job cuts, but a turnaround of our overseas business... fundamentally improving our product structure, sales model and competitiveness," Chairman Yang Yuanqing told reporters. "Reform is a painful experience and needs patience." Turnover edged 1.3 percent higher to about $3.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter. "Revenue is very much in line with my expectations, it's just the net profit" that is disappointing, said a JP Morgan analyst. Asian technology shares rose on Thursday in the wake of better-than-expected quarterly profit at Cisco Systems ( CSCO.O ). Lenovo's shares had gained nearly 4 percent on Thursday morning. Shares of the company -- the worst performer in Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index  .HSI  until September, when the firm was dropped from the benchmark gauge -- have recovered since posting better-than-expected first-quarter results. From July to September, its 19 percent gain outpaced a 7.8 percent gain in the Hang Seng and Acer's flat performance. But its stock now trades at a lofty 26 times prospective earnings, versus Acer's 13 and HP's 18, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite strength on its home turf -- Lenovo commands over a third of the Chinese PC market, the world's largest after the United States -- the firm is struggling to expand beyond Asia and ranks a distant third to Dell and HP with a near-8 percent global market share. Compounding its problems is an expected deceleration of growth worldwide amid swelling inventory and as the delayed release of Windows Vista spurs consumers to put off purchases. IDC expects 10.5 percent growth in PC shipments this year and 12 percent in 2007, versus 2005's 16 percent. Yuanqing told Reuters in September it would take at least three years to return to strong profitability. The firm's dominant share in Asia excluding Japan grew to 21 percent in the calendar third quarter from 19.9 percent in the previous quarter, according to IDC. HP ranked second with 12.9 percent, and Dell stood at No.3 with 9 percent.
