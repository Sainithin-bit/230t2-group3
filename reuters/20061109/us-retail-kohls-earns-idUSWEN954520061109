 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) on Thursday said its third quarter earnings jumped 45 percent, helped by strong sales at stores open at least a year and new store openings, and the retailer reaffirmed its fourth-quarter earnings forecast. 

 Kohl's, which runs a chain of mid-priced department stores, said third-quarter net income rose to $224.5 million, or 68 cents per share, from $155.1 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to earn 64 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Kohl's and rival J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) are increasing sales by stocking their shelves with more stylish and exclusive merchandise, and by opening more stores closer to their shoppers. Earlier in the day, J.C. Penney said strong sales of its private brand merchandise helped boost third-quarter profit 23 percent, and it raised its fourth-quarter earnings forecast. Kohl's said its quarterly sales rose 16.6 percent to $3.6 billion, which was above analysts expectations of $3.55 billion. Its comparable store sales -- a key retail gauge that measures sales at stores open at least one year -- increased 8.5 percent. Kohl's has added more contemporary and exclusive clothing brands like Chaps and Candie's to increase its sales and attract a wider range of shoppers to its stores. Next year, it will start selling an exclusive line of clothing and handbags by designer Vera Wang and a line of Food Network home goods. It also has opened more stores. On October 5, Kohl's opened 65 new stores -- the largest one-day opening in its history. It operated 814 stores in 45 states as of October 28, up from 731 stores in 41 states at the same time a year ago. Kohl's said it still expects fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of $1.36 to $1.42 per share. Analysts are expecting fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.41. Given its strong third-quarter results, Kohl's said it now expects full-year earnings of $3.16 to $3.24 per share, up from its previous target of $3.04 to $3.13 per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to earn $3.21 per share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Through Wednesday, Kohl's shares had risen 51 percent this year, while Penney's shares have advanced almost 41 percent and the Standard & Poor's Retailing Index .GSPMS has gained 8.4 percent.
