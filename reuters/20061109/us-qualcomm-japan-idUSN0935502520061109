 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Japan's antitrust watchdog has told Qualcomm Inc.'s ( QCOM.O ) Japanese subsidiary that it may investigate its licensing and chip business practices in Japan, Qualcomm said on Thursday, sending its shares down more than 3 percent. 

 Japan's Fair Trade Commission did not say when it might investigate the company or identify any complainant, Qualcomm said. Qualcomm President Steve Altman said the company would cooperate with the commission. The company's shares fell $1.27, or 3.5 percent to $32.01 on Nasdaq on Thursday afternoon. The news comes after sources said last week that the European Commission is likely to intensify its investigation of Qualcomm's patent licensing rates for a new generation of mobile phone technology. Qualcomm sells technology licenses and chips based on CDMA, the dominant technology standard for U.S. cell phones, as well as those for GSM, the world's most widely used cell phone technology. Its patents are also used in W-CDMA, known as the high-speed, third-generation (3G), standard that is more advanced than GSM. Some of the world's biggest wireless technology firms had complained to European regulators that Qualcomm was charging too much to license patents for the 3G equipment. Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 6752.T ), Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ), NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ), Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N and Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) have said Qualcomm's fees were far higher than the agreed-upon standard of "fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory." In the United States, Qualcomm has been locked in a bitter legal fight with rival Broadcom over chip patents. The two companies have accused each other of patent infringements.
