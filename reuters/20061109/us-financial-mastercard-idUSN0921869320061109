 Corrects 3rd paragraph to show Visa is larger than MasterCard, not smaller 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sam's Club is expected to announce on Thursday that it will start accepting MasterCard Inc. credit cards for the first time, the Wall Street Journal reported. Sam's Club previously accepted credit cards only from Discover Financial Services Inc. and its own in-house cards at its 589 stores in the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada. The chain does accept MasterCard and Visa credit cards for gasoline and online purchases. The agreement is a leg-up for MasterCard in its market share battle with larger rival Visa USA Inc., which is preparing to become a publicly traded company. Sam's Club, a division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is the No. 2 warehouse chain behind Costco Wholesale Corp.. MasterCard and Wal-Mart were not available for comment on the report.
