 TURIN, Italy  (Reuters) - Italian industrial group Fiat ( FIA.MI ) laid out ambitious growth and profit targets for its core Fiat Auto business on Thursday, mapping out a plan to extend the division's earnings rebound through 2010. 

 But its stock fell when Chief Executive Sergio Marchionne, architect of Fiat's escape from crisis, said he intended to let someone else run Fiat Auto next year while he remained at the helm of the group. "I think I'll do it in 2007 and I think there's enough talent in the group," he told analysts at a presentation of the group's 2007-2010 strategy at its head offices in Turin. "I won't hire anyone from outside the company." He said he would still follow Fiat Auto's progress closely. Marchionne said the group -- which also makes trucks, tractors and construction equipment -- expected to earn net income of between 3.4 billion and 3.6 billion euros on revenue of 67 billion euros in 2010. He said he favored share buybacks as long as earnings per share rose and the group could maintain a strong balance sheet. Fiat shares, which have been the best-performing stock this year in the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP, fell 1.7 percent to 14.95 euros by 1203 GMT while the index eased 0.7 percent. JP Morgan analyst Philippe Houchois said investors were likely to be taking profits following the stock's strong rise in the days ahead of the presentation. Marchionne told investors he would consider a strategic deal with another carmaker but no such transaction was imminent. "If one of the options in the medium to long term is an association with another (carmaker) that would guarantee the future (of Fiat Auto) we will look at it," he said, adding at this stage it was "foolish to speculate" on such a transaction. For 2010, Marchionne set a revenue target of 32.5 billion euros for the Fiat Auto division from 19.5 billion euros in 2005. No estimate was given for 2006. For the division's trading profit margin, he aimed for 4.5-5.3 percent in 2010 from an expected 0.8-1.3 percent for 2006. Fiat raised Fiat Auto's 2006 operating profit target to 275 million euros excluding one-off items from 250 million. Marchionne said Fiat Auto looked to increase its market share in western Europe to over 11 percent by 2010 from around 8 percent this year, adding its global new car registrations would rise to 3.5 million units by 2010 from 2.12 million in 2006. The forecasts exclude Fiat's light commercial vehicles business, while registrations include cars made by joint ventures. The Fiat Auto division aims to launch 23 new models by 2010 as it fuels profitable growth. Both its Lancia premium brand and sporty Alfa Romeo brands set sales targets of 300,000 units. Since a major restructuring overseen by Marchionne and the launch of new models like the Grande Punto, the division has had some of the strongest sales growth among European auto manufacturers this year. Fiat Auto stands to make good money once its production volume reaches 2.8 million units a year, Marchionne said. "The way to make money here is to increase utilization of the infrastructure. We start making decent money when we start doing about 2.8 million cars," he said.
