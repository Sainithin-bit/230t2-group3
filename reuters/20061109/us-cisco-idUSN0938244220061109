 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc.'s ( CSCO.O ) strong results suggest that rising consumer demand for Internet video and phone services is helping to offset slower spending by phone carriers as they merge, analysts said on Thursday. 

 Cisco and other network equipment makers may now have fewer clients due to consolidation, but orders for routers and switches remain strong as phone and cable providers upgrade their networks to cope with bandwidth-heavy services. The rising popularity of online video entertainment, such as the popular YouTube.com, as well as Web-based calling services, helped Cisco post a 25 percent jump in fiscal first quarter revenue on Wednesday. "Everyone was afraid of consolidation, and that it was going to hurt capital spending. But things are clearly moving in the opposite direction for Cisco," said Kenneth Muth at Robert W. Baird & Co. Cisco's shares rose 6.4 percent to close at $26.71 on Thursday, and shares of other telecommunication equipment makers also rose. Smaller rival Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR.O, for example, gained 5.1 percent to $19.65. While some investors are betting that the telecoms equipment sector is more resilient than expected, analysts warned that Cisco is taking market share from rivals like Juniper and Lucent Technologies Inc. LU.N. "Cisco (is) continuing to gain wallet share of overall IT spending... we believe end users are beginning to adopt Cisco's converged network product strategy," A.G. Edwards & Sons analyst Aaron Rakers said in a report. Even as companies like AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) merge with smaller carriers, Cisco said its sales to U.S. service providers rose 30 percent year-on-year in the quarter ended October 28. The growth was driven in part by strong sales of CRS-1, a high-capacity core router. CRS-1 orders rose 500 percent from a year ago to $150 million, the company said. Looking ahead, analysts said the recent launch of Internet-based television services, called "Internet protocol television (IPTV), by phone carriers would further drive Cisco's sales in coming years. Both AT&T and Verizon have launched such services, which feature high-definition video and various downloading options, bundling them with their phone and Internet services to compete with similar services offered by cable providers. In addition, analysts said Cisco's strength in overseas markets would likely help the company weather any impact from a slower U.S. economy. Japan is seen as being particularly crucial in the coming year as the country starts to build next-generation networks. Analysts also said Cisco's acquisition of cable set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta was another source of its strong growth and reflects the company's expansion into the consumer market from its business of making routers and switches. For the second quarter, Cisco said it expected year-on-year revenue growth of 24 percent to 25 percent, or 14 percent to 15 percent excluding Scientific Atlanta. "Cisco seems to be gleaning even more benefit from the Scientific Atlanta acquisition than we envisioned," said Ehud Gelblum, analyst at JP Morgan Research.
