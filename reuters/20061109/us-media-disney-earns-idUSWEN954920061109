 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) said on Thursday its quarterly profit more than doubled after strong results from its movie division, media networks and theme parks. 

 The results topped Wall Street expectations but Disney's shares, which hit their highest level since mid-2001 on Thursday, fell more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. Expectations for the company have risen in the year since Chief Executive Robert Iger took over and began an aggressive series of moves including buying Pixar Animation Studios, cutting production and staff at the film division, and offering TV shows and movies for sale on the Internet. In the fiscal fourth quarter, studio entertainment posted the biggest rise in revenue of all Disney units, growing 33 percent to $2.0 billion, and turned an operating profit of $214 million, compared with a $313 million loss a year earlier. In July, Disney cut about 20 percent of its studio workforce and said it would trim movie output by about half. Disney reported a fourth-quarter net profit of $782 million, or 36 cents per share, compared with $379 million, or 19 cents per share, a year before. Revenue rose 14 percent to $8.8 billion from $7.7 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, expected net earnings of 33 cents per share and revenue of $8.7 billion for the fourth quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Media networks revenue, boosted by higher advertising rates at sports network ESPN and for ABC primetime hits such as "Desperate Housewives" and "Grey's Anatomy," were up 10 percent and operating profit rose by 18 percent. Attendance rose at parks and resorts, along with per capita spending and hotel occupancy, driving up the division's revenue by 8 percent and operating income by 28 percent. Consumer products, which earns the smallest portion of Disney revenue and operating profit, grew revenue by 9 percent and operating profit rose just 1 percent over last year's fourth quarter. Disney shares rose 28 percent during fiscal 2006 as a bumper crop of strong movies and shows, including "Lost" and "Grey's Anatomy," "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," and "Cars", fueled growth in all its business units. "The big winner in the quarter was studio entertainment," analyst Jeff Logsdon of BMO Capital Markets said. "They had a phenomenal summer at the box office globally with 'Pirates', and 'Cars' domestically." The stock rose about 8 percent in the quarter and traded on Thursday at 19.6 times Disney's estimated fiscal 2007 profit, while shares of Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) traded at a multiple of 19.4 times forward earnings and Viacom Inc. VIA.N at 17.5. Shares of Disney fell 2.5 percent in after-hours trade to $32.74 from a close of $33.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.
