 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N, the largest U.S. tire maker, on Thursday posted better-than-expected quarterly results on higher prices and sales of more expensive tires, sending its shares up as much as 17 percent. 

 Goodyear, contending with a five-week-old strike by the United Steelworkers union in North America, revealed details of its latest contract offer, said it hoped to resume talks and remained committed to cutting North American production. The union said in a statement it was "pleased that the possibility of a different tone for our talks exists" and it would be prepared to resume talks if Goodyear abandoned plans to close plants covered by its contract and would fully fund proposed changes to retiree health care  . Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said Goodyear's third-quarter results were solid, noting the company's strategy of cutting back on sales of low-profit private-label replacement tires and concentrating on sales of more expensive Goodyear brand tires. "The hard work is ahead in terms of reducing capacity and aligning their cost structure in North America," Tynan added. "The strike, depending on how it plays out, will obviously be crucial to the company's cost structure." Excluding restructuring charges, a gain from a settlement with a supplier, and accelerated depreciation, Goodyear earned 42 cents per share in the quarter. Analysts' average forecast was 24 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5 percent to $5.28 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $5.25 billion. Goodyear posted a net loss of $48 million, or 27 cents per share, for the quarter. Raw materials costs rose 17 percent, or $249 million, but may have peaked, Goodyear said. Materials such as steel cord, natural and synthetic rubber, carbon black and fabric make up about 35 percent of the cost of goods sold. Volume fell 4.5 percent to 55.8 million tires worldwide as Goodyear cut back on the private-label tire business. But revenue generated from each tire rose 8 percent. In North America, sales rose 2.6 percent to $2.43 billion, but operating income fell to $19 million from $58 million a year earlier, reflecting weak consumer replacement demand, reduced private-label tire production, and higher costs. European Union unit sales rose 11.7 percent to $1.26 billion, and operating income rose $1 million to $81 million. In the fourth quarter, Goodyear said it expects market conditions in North America to continue to improve, largely on declining gasoline prices. It also expects continued strong winter tire sales in Europe due to early snow there. STRIKE IMPACT About 15,000 union workers at 16 Goodyear plants in the United States and Canada went on strike October 5 after rejecting the latest contract proposal from the Akron, Ohio-based company. The union opposes closing any plants, while Goodyear has said that in order to be competitive, it must cut a Tyler, Texas, plant covered by the union master agreement. The company has proposed protecting all other contract plants. Goodyear said it was losing $30 million to $35 million a week in operating income early in the strike, but losses are expected to ease as more production comes back on line. The company is using salaried and temporary workers for production at struck plants, has increased output at nonunion plants, and plans to bring in more tires from plants abroad. Present North American production is not quite half of pre-strike levels. Goodyear plans to cut more than $1 billion of costs through 2008 by closing high-cost plants, buying more materials from low-cost countries, and reducing other expenses. Goodyear's contract summary included details on benefits, job security, a proposed $660 million contribution to create a trust fund for retiree health care, and minimum investment of $447 million to master contract plants. Shares of Goodyear were up $2.42 at $17.59 on the New York Stock Exchange and reached $17.75 earlier, the highest level since late January. Before Thursday, the shares had risen more than 6 percent since the day before the strike began.
