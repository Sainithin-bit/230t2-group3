 (Reuters) - Shares of Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) touched a near three-year high in opening trade Thursday after the network equipment maker reported strong quarterly results and brokers raised their bullish view on the stock. 

 Cisco shares were trading up over 7 percent at $26.93 in morning trade after touching $27.44 in early trade, the highest level since January 2004. UBS raised its rating on the stock to "buy," while several other brokerages increased their price targets. UBS analyst Nikos Theodosopoulos said Cisco had executed the Scientific Atlantic acquisition well in addition to gaining share in its routing and switching markets. "As long as Cisco continues to exhibit solid operational and financial discipline, we believe it will be able to grow sales in the 15 percent to 16 percent year-on-year range for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, without compromising the business model," Theodosopoulos wrote in a research note. Credit Suisse said Cisco would continue to benefit from the convergence onto the Internet Protocol (IP) infrastructure by both service providers and enterprises given the company's dominant position in IP communications. The brokerage raised its price target on the stock to $32 from $26.50 and maintained an "outperform" rating. Prudential Equity Group said Cisco shares had benefited from strong company results along with a very strong rally in technology stocks. "We believe shares will likely continue ride the fourth quarter tech rally higher, however, year-on-year growth comparisons will become more challenging in the second half of 2007," Prudential's Inder Singh said in a note to clients. The brokerage raised its price target to $26 from $24. (Reporting by Renu Pariyadath in Bangalore)
