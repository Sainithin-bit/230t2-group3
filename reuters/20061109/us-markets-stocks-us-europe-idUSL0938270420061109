 PARIS  (Reuters) - U.S. shares headed for a mixed opening on Thursday, with Cisco ( CSCO.O ) seen lifting tech stocks after giving a strong outlook, but a raft of economic reports, including one on consumer confidence, will drive sentiment. 

 With uncertainty over the U.S. mid-term elections lifted, investors will focus again on economic data, which include September's international trade balance, weekly jobless claims, the preliminary November reading of consumer sentiment from the University of Michigan and September wholesale inventories. Corporate earnings will also take center stage as department store chains JC Penney ( JCP.N ) and Kohl's ( KSS.N ), and entertainment conglomerates Viacom VIA.N and Walt Disney ( DIS.N ) report quarterly profits. Insurer American Intl Group ( AIG.N ), Goodyear Tire & Rubber GT.N, drugmaker King Pharmaceuticals KG.N, microchip maker NVIDIA ( NVDA.O ), power utility TXU TXU.N and telecom company Windstream WIN.N also crowd a busy reporting diary. By 1050 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to an opening anywhere between 0.09 percent lower and 0.2 percent higher for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 0.16 percent to end at 12,176.54, a record closing high, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 0.21 percent at 1,385.72, and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 0.38 percent to close at 2,384.94. "Traders are cautious ahead of the University of Michigan figure and a low figure could well contribute to fears that the U.S. consumer will reign in spending and credit as fears over the housing slump hit confidence," said Martin Slaney, head of spread betting at GFT Global Markets. "In addition, the wholesale inventory figures are seen as a leading indicator of up-coming consumer activity as traders attempt to anticipate how demand in the key holiday season is likely to pan out." Oil prices back above $60 a barrel, supported by the prospect of further OPEC supply cuts and a decline in heating fuel stockpiles in the United States, could also unnerve inflation-wary investors, although it will lend support to heavily weighted energy stocks such as Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ). The technology sector could stand out after Cisco Systems reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and gave a strong outlook as Internet traffic growth boosted orders for network equipment, pushing its shares sharply higher in extended-hours trading. Shares of Amkor Technology ( AMKR.O ) rose after the closing bell after the microchip testing and packaging firm reversed a year-earlier loss and reported strong demand for wireless and other mobile products. Takeover activity could add to the market's momentum. Diversified manufacturer 3M ( MMM.N ) announced the sale of its global pharmaceuticals business for around $2.1 billion in a three-part transaction involving trade buyers and private equity firms. And Nasdaq Stock Markets ( NDAQ.O ) could react on talk it could make a new takeover approach for the London Stock Exchange  ( LSE.L ). Dealers said the talk centred on a possible imminent bid at around 1,400 pence from Nasdaq. The U.S. exchange has amassed a stake of just over 25 percent in the London exchange after having a $4.2 billion takeover offer rebuffed in March.
