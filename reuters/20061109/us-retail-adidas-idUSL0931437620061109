 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Sporting goods maker Adidas cut its 2007 profit outlook as it pours extra cash into its U.S. acquisition Reebok, triggering a sharp fall in its shares that wiped off a tenth of its market value on Thursday. 

 A 16 percent fall in orders at Reebok overshadowed an otherwise solid third quarter at Adidas, the world's second-largest sports goods firm after U.S. rival Nike. Brokers rushed to cut their recommendations on the stock, which is now this year's worst performer on Germany's DAX of top 30 shares. "More work is needed at Reebok," Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told reporters in a conference call. Adidas said net income growth would approach 15 percent in 2007 instead of a previously forecast 20 percent, blaming lower profit expectations at Reebok and investment in new products and advertising to beef up flagging sales. Adidas bought Reebok for $3.8 billion last year to take on Nike in its home turf, but it has yet to convince investors that the acquisition will pay off. Adidas said Reebok orders were unlikely to start rising before the second half of 2007, even though the U.S. firm would post profits this and next year. "The order decline is disappointing. We'll probably have to wait until the second half of 2007 to see noticeable improvements at Reebok," said fund manger Joerg Dehning at Pioneer Investments, Adidas' second-biggest investor according to Reuters data. Merck Finck analyst Nils Lesser, who cut the stock to hold from buy, was skeptical: "It will take longer to put Reebok on track." SHARES PLUNGE Adidas shares fell 11 percent in early trade and were down 8.4 percent at 37.56 euros at 1229 GMT, wiping out gains made in October on upbeat result expectations. The trading volume was 9 times above the 90-day average. Dehning said he would not use the fall to buy into the stock. "We'll keep Adidas shares for the time being. I don't see any reason to stock up despite the fall," he said. The Reebok news soured euphoria triggered by the soccer World Cup in Germany that helped Adidas's sales surge in the second quarter, and lifted the stock to above 43 euros in May. Adidas bought Reebok to complement its strength in classical sports wear such as soccer boots and its strong position in Europe with Reebok's focus on the U.S. market and lifestyle fashion, a segment tapped successfully by rival Puma But investors have been skeptical from the start about the Reebok deal, questioning Adidas's ability to ensure a smooth integration of a company on the other side of the Atlantic. Adidas has launched a revamp for Reebok's product line and sales strategy and said it stuck to its goal of achieving annual savings of 175 million euros from the takeover from 2009. But HVB analysts said no improvement at Reebok was in sight, cutting Adidas shares to "neutral" from "outperform" and lowering their price target to 39 euros from 45.50 euros. The problems at Reebok overshadowed a solid third quarter, with Adidas' net income rising 13 percent to 244 million euros, above the average forecast of 231 million in a Reuters poll. Quarterly sales rose by 53 percent to 2.949 billion euros, driven by growth in Europe, North America and Asia, above the average analyst forecast of 2.877 billion.
