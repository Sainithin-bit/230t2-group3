  By Dominique Vidalon PARIS  Nov 9 (Reuters) - Capgemini ( CAPP.PA ), Europe's
largest computer services company, raised its full-year
profitability and revenue growth goals on Thursday and said its
plan to improve margins at its outsourcing unit was on track.  The group cautioned that it could incur additional
provisions tied to losses on a large outsourcing contract with
electrical equipment supplier Schneider ( SCHN.PA ) but it
insisted this did not threaten its full-year goals.  By 1152 GMT, Capgemini shares -- which have gained 37
percent since the start of the year -- were off 2.4 percent at
45.68 euros, underperforming a 0.3 percent rise in the European
sector index .SX8P.  "Overall it's positive but good news has been largely
factored in the share price," Fideuram Wargny analyst Lionel
Pellicer said.  Chief Financial Officer Nicolas Dufourcq said consensus on
2006 operating margins was 5.64 to 5.7 percent. "We will be
within that consensus but not above it," he told a conference
call.  The group had forecast a margin of above 5.5 percent for
2006 against 3.2 percent in 2005.  "The third-quarter was extremely strong and the
fourth-quarter is looking good... So our target of 10 percent
(revenue growth) becomes 11 percent," Dufourcq said.  Last month Capgemini pre-released its third-quarter revenues
along with news it would buy technology services group Kanbay
International KBAY.O for $1.25 billion.  Third-quarter sales rose a forecast-beating 12.4 percent to
1.881 billion euros ($2.40 billion). Like-for-like sales growth
was 13.5 percent, with outsourcing up 20 percent. Outsourcing
accounted for 41 percent of group revenue in the quarter.  
  HALF-WAY ON OUTSOURCING MARGIN PLAN  A year ago, Capgemini launched a three-year plan to bolster
its outsourcing division margin. Although a strong contributor
to revenue growth, outsourcing has suffered from start-up costs
of several large contracts, including the Schneider contract.  Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin said the plan was on
track and that Capgemini was confident it would reach its
4-percent operating margin target for the division in 2006.  This would put Capgemini half-way to its goal to reach a
divisional margin of 8 percent by the end of the plan.  For 2007, Capgemini targets an operating margin for the
division of 5 to 5.5 percent, including the Schneider contract,
and of more than 7.5 percent excluding Schneider.  These targets -- which Capgemini calls the divisional margin
-- are before corporate costs and other administrative expenses.  "We have proven the benefits of a great year one of a three
year programme. If we have the same progress in 2007, which I am
expecting, we should be able to say business as usual, let's
move on," outsourcing chief Paul Spence told Reuters.  The plan includes changing the business mix towards more
value-added offerings, renegotiating some contracts with clients
or suppliers, rebalancing outsourcing contracts between large
and smaller-sized deals and focusing more on mid-sized deals.  It also includes cost-savings at production sites worldwide
and on support functions, speeding up outsourcing outside North
America to India and reducing purchasing spending and the use of
contractors.  Capgemini had said the plan would cost about 70 million
euros in 2006, a figure Hermelin confirmed during the call. It
is expected to cost around 35 million euros in 2007.
