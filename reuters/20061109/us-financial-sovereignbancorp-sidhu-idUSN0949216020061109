 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sovereign Bancorp Inc. SOV.N, the No. 2 U.S. savings and loan, said on Thursday it expects to incur a $29 million fourth-quarter pretax charge related to payments it is making to former chief executive Jay Sidhu. 

 Sidhu resigned last month in the face of a threatened firing without cause, the thrift has said. The circumstances entitled him to more than $44.4 million of payments, it has said. Sidhu remains nonexecutive chairman through year end. Sidhu left after criticism over his leadership and Sovereign's stagnant share price, including by the Philadelphia-based thrift's largest shareholder, Relational Investors LLC. Critics also faulted a June transaction in which Sovereign sold a nearly 20 percent stake for $2.4 billion to Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano ( SAN.MC ), and paid $3.6 billion for Brooklyn, New York-based Independence Community Bank Corp. Joseph Campanelli, who had led the bank's New England unit, is now interim chief executive. Sovereign disclosed the expected charge in its quarterly report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Last quarter, Sovereign posted an after-tax profit of $184 million, or 37 cents per share. Operating profit totaled 41 cents per share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average expect fourth-quarter profit of 34 cents per share. Sovereign shares closed Thursday up 19 cents at $24.00 on the New York Stock Exchange.
