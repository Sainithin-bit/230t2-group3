 MUNICH  (Reuters) - Germany's Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) struck a confident note on the current fiscal year and said on Thursday it would raise its dividend after fourth-quarter operating earnings beat forecasts, boosting its shares. 

 The industrial conglomerate said a reshaping of the group was almost complete and reiterated that all its businesses would meet profitability targets in 2007, while sales would grow twice as fast as the world economy. Shares in Siemens rose on the news, despite uneven results at the group's 11 units whose products range from hearing aids to trains. By 0940 GMT, they were up 3.8 percent to 74.51 euros, the top gainer in a flat German blue-chip index  .GDAXI . "2006 was a year of restructuring. In 2007, we will see execution and increased emphasis on profitable growth," Chief Financial Officer Joe Kaeser told reporters. Siemens's fourth-quarter operating profit rose by a forecast-beating 35 percent. It was lifted by strong results at healthcare unit Med, where Siemens has spent more than $7 billion on acquisitions in the last year, and factory-automation unit A&D. The results were also flattered by the fact that Siemens failed to book high restructuring charges that had been expected at its struggling IT services unit SBS, which narrowed its loss. Executives declined to say whether the charges would be booked in the current quarter but said the bulk of restructuring provisions had now been made as the group settles into its new shape, minus most of the telecoms business on which it was founded. They gave no update on the planned sale of corporate telecoms division Enterprise Networks, ahead of a news conference. Sources close to the talk have told Reuters in the past days that some of the last potential bidders have abandoned the sales process. Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ), one would-be buyer which the sources said has walked away from Siemens, reported better-than expected profits on Wednesday boosted by Internet traffic growth, sending its shares up 7.5 percent. SCEPTICISM ON TARGETS Since taking the helm at Siemens in January 2005, Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld has set about reshaping the 159-year-old company, eschewing short-term targets but promising to deliver on profitability goals next year after the revamp. Some analysts still doubt that Siemens will be able to hit operating profit margin targets ranging from 4 to 13 percent at all its units by next April, as promised. In the July-September quarter, five of 11 units met their goals. "We are still skeptical whether all the remaining divisions will reach their targets in April 2007, although Siemens management sounds very confident," Merck Finck analyst Theo Kitz wrote in a note. Others said Siemens was backing up its words with deeds. "They're raising the dividend, which is a sign they're very confident about 2007," said one London-based analyst who asked not be named. "But it's a very mixed bag of results again." Siemens said it would raise its dividend to 1.45 euros from 1.35 euros. It posted quarterly operating profit of 1.251 billion euros ($1.60 billion) compared with an average of 1.202 billion euros forecast in a Reuters poll of 21 analysts. New orders fell 4 percent to 22.616 billion euros in the quarter despite a resurgent economy in Europe, where Siemens makes about half its sales. That was below average market expectations of new orders at 24.204 billion euros. Sales rose 8 percent to 23.92 billion euros in the quarter, beating expectations for an average 22.93 billion euros, while income from continuing operations rose 29 percent to 640 million euros, less than expected. Telecoms unit Com swung to a loss despite higher sales, and took 195 million euros in severance charges. SBS narrowed its loss to 27 million euros on sales that fell 15 percent. Siemens shares trade at just under 14 times expected 2006/07 earnings, according to Reuters data. Rival conglomerates Dutch group Philips ( PHG.AS ) and General Electric ( GE.N ) of the United States trade at higher forward multiples of 19 and 15 respectively, reflecting uncertainty about Siemens's ability successfully to transform its portfolio and become more profitable.
