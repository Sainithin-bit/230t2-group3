 BOSTON  (Reuters) - An internal investigation at Rockwell Automation Inc. ( ROK.N ) found that some employees may have violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the diversified manufacturer said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. 

 Rockwell, which makes systems that help factories run more smoothly, said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that the possible violations included payments for non-business travel expenses and other potentially improper payments. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act bars U.S. companies from paying bribes. The company did not disclose where the possible violations occurred or name the people involved. A spokesman for the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company declined to provide further information on the location of the possible violations. Rockwell said it disclosed the potential violations to the U.S. Justice Department and the SEC.
