 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Thursday it was delaying the filing of its quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission while the company completes a restatement of past results. 

 Ford said last month it would restate results from 2001 to the second quarter of this year because of an accounting change related to interest-rate swaps that were taken out to hedge against the company's long-term debt. Ford, which plans to close 16 plants and cut nearly 45,000 jobs to adjust to its sliding share of the U.S. auto market, said it planned to file its report for the third-quarter with the SEC by Tuesday. A company spokeswoman declined further comment. Ford posted a preliminary net loss of $5.8 billion for the third quarter, compared with a loss of $284 million as originally reported for the same period a year earlier. "While the restatement process is not yet complete, we do anticipate changes, in some cases significant, in prior period results," Ford said in a filing on Thursday with the SEC, announcing the delay in its quarterly report. The second-largest U.S. automaker said when it announced third-quarter results that the restatement would not affect its cash position.
