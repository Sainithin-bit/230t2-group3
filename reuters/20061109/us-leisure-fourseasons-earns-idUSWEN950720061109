 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Four Seasons Hotels Inc. FSH.TO rebounded to a third-quarter profit on Thursday as improved conditions in the areas it manages hotels and resorts helped boost its revenue per available room. 

 The luxury hotelier, which received an offer to go private earlier this week, said it had a net profit of $10.9 million, or 29 cents a share, for the quarter ended September 30. That is up from a loss of $11.4 million, or 22 cents a share, in the same period of 2005 due largely to higher foreign-exchange costs and a writedown. ($1=$1.13 Canadian)
