 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. will consider plants and assets that are being shed by U.S. automakers as the Japanese company looks to expand manufacturing capacity in North America, a top Nissan executive said on Thursday. 

 Nissan is also moving production of the Quest minivan from its Canton, Mississippi, plant to a facility in Japan in 2008 to make room for new products, Daniel Gaudette, senior vice president of North American manufacturing and supply chain management, told Reuters in an interview. "Everything depends on what's available, when it's available and then what our needs are," Gaudette said, referring to the plants that are being closed by General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.. "We certainly would consider any viable opportunity." Gaudette said Nissan would also consider buying equipment from the factories that are being shuttered. "Everybody is always in need of equipment and there is always good equipment that can be used and refurbished," he said. Nissan has three manufacturing plants in the United States and two in Mexico, which are running at 85 to 90 percent of capacity. The automaker is in the midst of launching seven new models in U.S. market, where it makes more than half its profits. Nissan has said it may need more manufacturing capacity in North America as it introduces new models. GM is closing a dozen factories through 2008, while Ford plans to shutter 16 facilities in North America by 2012 as both U.S. automakers shed excess capacity in face of declining U.S market share. Nissan's U.S. sales are down 6 percent for the year, but the automaker is seeing some renewed demand for its vehicles. U.S. sales rose 8 percent in October. Nissan, which in April temporarily shut down production at its U.S. plants for six days to reduce an overhang of unsold vehicles, has a 60 to 70 day supply of vehicles currently, Gaudette said. The company does not anticipate any further production cuts, he added.
