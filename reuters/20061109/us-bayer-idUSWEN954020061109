 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - German drugmaker Bayer AG BAYG.DE said on Thursday it will cut about 800 jobs from its U.S. operations to cut costs following its acquisition of rival Schering AG. 

 Bayer will eliminate 600 positions, primarily in research, and cut an additional 200 U.S.-based workers over time in an overall reorganization. The company said that after one-time costs of about $350 million, it will be able to reduce overall research and development expenses by more than $210 million per year by the end of 2008.
