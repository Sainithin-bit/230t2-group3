 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer by market value, said on Thursday net income more than doubled in the third quarter, making it the latest insurer to benefit from the absence of hurricanes this year. 

 The company also beat analysts' expectations by 10 cents a share, sending its shares higher in aftermarket trading. "AIG rode the same wave as the rest of the property casualty industry," said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent  LLC. One of AIG's four major lines of business is property casualty, where the company suffered $1.6 billion in losses last year as Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast. This year, there were no significant catastrophes, the company said. AIG said net income was $4.22 billion, or $1.61 a share, in the third quarter, up from $1.75 billion, or 66 cents a share, in the year earlier quarter. "AIG doesn't disappoint very much," said Matt Nellans, an insurance analyst with Morningstar. Its ratio of premiums to losses and expenses for the first nine months improved by 4 percentage points, even without including the negative effect of the hurricanes in the year ago period. Life insurance premium income rose 7.5 percent in the third quarter. Life insurance policyholder contracts were $7 billion in the first nine months of the year, a steady source of fee income, Nellans said. A FEW NEGATIVES There were a few negatives. In its domestic retirement services, net flows were negative, meaning people took money out. Individual fixed annuities, contracts based on the bond market, had slow sales, AIG said. "Market conditions in Japan remain challenging due to increased competition," AIG Chief Executive Martin Sullivan said in his statement, a trend that had started earlier this year. But he said AIG was lining up products in anticipation of a full deregulation of the Japanese market. "Everyone breathed a sigh of relief that there were no special charges," said Cathy Seifert, an insurance analyst with S&P Equity Research. "It sounds like they are getting back to their old style of business, although they are not immune to macro-competitive pressures." New York City-based AIG, which also has a financial services unit that specializes in aircraft leasing and an asset management unit, said adjusted net earnings were $4.02 billion, or $1.53 a share. Analysts, on average had expected the insurer to earn $1.43 a share, according to Reuters estimates. Adjusted net excludes realized capital gains and losses and accounting for hedging activities. In the year ago quarter, AIG had adjusted net income of $1.86 billion, or 71 cents a share. In aftermarket trading, AIG's shares initially rose as much as 1.7 percent and are currently trading at $68.50, up from its close of $68.04. Since the start of the year, AIG's shares have been trading about flat at $68, compared with a 4.6 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's insurance index. But AIG's stock fell to a year low of $57.52 in July and then began to recover in August after second quarter earnings beat analyst expectations. It trades at a price to earnings multiple of 11.8, a slight premium to a group of similar insurers. Other insurers have also beaten estimates because of lower catastrophe losses. These include Chubb Corp. ( CB.N ) and Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. ( HIG.N ).
