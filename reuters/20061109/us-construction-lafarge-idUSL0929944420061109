 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's Lafarge ( LAFP.PA ), the world's biggest cement maker, reported a forecast-beating 32 percent rise in third-quarter net profit on Thursday, with higher prices offsetting cost increases. 

 Net profit rose to 548 million euros ($700 million) from 414 million euros in the same period last year. This was ahead of the 499.3 million euro average forecast given in a Reuters poll of nine analysts. Current operating profit rose to 1.004 billion euros from 850 million on sales up 12 percent at 5.104 billion, the company said in a statement. It said it expected operating income growth to continue in the fourth quarter, although at a more moderate pace due to a tough basis for comparison. "We expect our markets to remain favorable, despite the slowdown in certain North American markets. Price increases should exceed cost increases overall over the year," the group said in a statement. On Wednesday, Swiss rival Holcim ( HOLN.VX ) reported a 42.5 percent rise in its net profit in the quarter and raised its full-year outlook. Building material suppliers such as Lafarge and Holcim have benefited from increased construction activity across Europe as key economies like France and Germany have started to turn the corner after prolonged slow growth.
