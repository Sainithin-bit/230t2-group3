 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumers will share in a $336 million settlement of a lawsuit accusing several banks and credit card groups of conspiring to charge excessive fees on foreign currency transactions, a federal judge ruled on Wednesday. 

 The settlement covers holders of U.S.-issued MasterCard or Visa credit cards or debit cards, and Diners Club credit cards who made foreign transactions from February 1, 1996 to the present. Tens of thousands of cardholders, including companies whose employees travel internationally, may recover money. Judge William Pauley of the U.S. District Court in Manhattan said the class-action settlement appeared to be the result of serious negotiations by experienced counsel, and was "fair, reasonable and adequate." Defendants in the five-year-old case include credit card groups Visa and MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ), as well as Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ), JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) and several affiliates. Cardholders accused them of colluding to fix charges and of poor disclosure. "Every time you go overseas, you would be charged 1 percent by Visa or MasterCard and another 2 or 3 percent by your bank to convert a transaction into U.S. dollars," said Patrick Coughlin, a partner at Lerach Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP in San Francisco, who represented the plaintiffs. "The cost (to defendants) to do these transactions was about one-quarter of 1 percent," he said. Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang said the settlement avoids the uncertainty of litigation, and that the bank's portion was covered by existing reserves. HSBC spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to comment. Visa spokeswoman Rhonda Bentz said the card association was pleased that the judge approved the settlement. Washington Mutual spokesman Alan Elias said the settlement was not a material issue for the company. Other defendants did not immediately return requests for comment. Coughlin said one benefit of the litigation was that card issuers now break out currency charges as a separate item on customer bills. "This makes banks competitive in setting those charges," he said. Lawyers for the plaintiffs had announced a pending settlement in July. Pauley's approval is preliminary, and carries several conditions. A hearing to enter a final judgment was set for November 2, 2007.
