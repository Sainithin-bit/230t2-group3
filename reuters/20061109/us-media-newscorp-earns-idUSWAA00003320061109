 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp. NWSa.N said on Wednesday it could launch a version of its popular MySpace Internet social network in China during this fiscal year if it found the right joint venture partner. 

 The owner of the 20th Century Fox movie studio and the Fox News U.S. cable network posted a quarterly profit on an asset sale gain, and said it was well on its way to generating revenue in excess of $500 million at its Internet division in fiscal 2007, which ends on June 30. "We've had some conversations," Chief Operating Officer Peter Chernin said on a conference call, responding to a question on launching MySpace in China within fiscal 2007. "It's possible, if we can find some joint venture that makes sense," he said. The possible timeline on MySpace's China ambitions comes on the heels of an announcement on Tuesday that News Corp has struck a joint venture deal with Softbank Corp. ( 9984.T ) to launch a version of MySpace in Japan. Chernin also said the company was seeking to buy Internet applications that could work with MySpace, although it was not on a "big hunt." News Corp, which bought MySpace, one of the fastest-growing Internet properties, for about $580 million last year, has watched its stock soar 26 percent since it announced the deal. Shares were little changed after the latest results. It reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $843 million, or 27 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $433 million, or 13 cents a share a year earlier, when it booked a $1 billion non-cash charge to reduce the value of its television stations federal licenses. Profit was boosted by advertising sales at the Fox TV network and Fox News network, as well as by a $261 million gain from the sale of its interest in Sky Brasil and the China-focused Phoenix Satellite Television Ltd. ( 8002.HK ). Revenue rose 4 percent to $5.9 billion. Wall Street expected the company to post a profit of 21 cents per share and revenue of $5.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. TV OFFSETS WEAK FILMS UNIT The television division's operating income rose 20 percent to $192 million. Its cable network operating profit rose 26 percent to $249 million, mainly on an advertising sales gain from news and regional sports networks. "The results were overall very positive. It's a strong way to begin the year," UBS analyst Aryeh Bourkoff said, highlighting the cable networks performance. Operating income fell 6 percent to $851 million, from $909 million a year earlier, dragged by its movies division. That unit saw operating income fall 35 percent to $239 million as the year-earlier quarter included syndication fees for Fox TV shows and DVD sales from "Robots" and "Hide and Seek". Most big U.S. media stocks have rallied this year on investors' belief that the Internet will be a profit growth opportunity for years to come, with News Corp. outperforming the pack. Its enterprise value currently trades at 13-times its fiscal 2007 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to Walt Disney Co.'s ( DIS.N ) 10 times and Time Warner Inc.'s ( TWX.N ) 9 times. News Corp. reaffirmed its fiscal 2007 outlook for operating income growth of 14 percent to 16 percent, excluding a $140 million gain from a U.K. property sale. Company executives also said it had no plans for an initial public offering for its Sky Italia satellite TV service. Its class A shares closed up 1.35 percent at $20.95 on the New York Stock Exchange ahead of the results.
