 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store operator J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) reported higher third-quarter profit on Thursday , boosted by new brands and store openings, and sees fourth-quarter earnings above analysts' expectations. 

 Its shares rose to $80 in trading before the market opened, up from a close of $78.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, which is moving to transform its image from a stodgy retailer into a trendy one with fashionable merchandise, reported net income of $287 million, or $1.26 per share, up from $234 million, or 94 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to earn $1.23 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. J.C. Penney and rival Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) are working to grab a larger share of business from middle-income Americans by introducing more stylish and exclusive merchandise, and by opening stores closer to their shoppers. The efforts are paying off, with sales at both retailers rising, and the National Retail Federation predicting that more college-age shoppers will be heading to department stores for their holiday gift buying this year. For the fourth-quarter, Penney forecast earnings per share of approximately $1.94, compared with analysts' current view of  $1.91. Penney said total net sales rose 6.7 percent to $4.78 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. Sales at department stores open at least a year, a key gauge of a retailer's health known as comparable store sales, increased 5.2 percent. Penney said its gross margin improved by 80 basis points to 42.6 percent of sales, helped by its private brands and better inventory management. Penney has been working hard to improve the range and quality of its private and exclusive merchandise, which now account for more than 50 percent of its revenue and typically offers better margins than name-brand items. It has introduced new brands like East 5th for women and X-Games clothes for boys. It is also opening new stores, many in locations outside of malls, which it says gives it better access to the convenience shopper who wants to stop by the store on the way home from work instead of driving to a mall. In the third quarter, Penney said it opened 25 new stores, with 22 in the off-mall format. As of October 28, it operated 1,037 department stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Penney's shares have risen almost 41 percent this year, compared with a 51 rise for Kohl's and an 8.4 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's Retailing Index .GSPMS.
