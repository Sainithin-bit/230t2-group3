 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German sporting goods firm Adidas ADSG.DE is expecting a "positive" order position at its ailing U.S. unit Reebok only in the second half of 2007, Adidas Chief Executive Herbert Hainer told a conference call on Thursday. 

 Adidas earlier cut its 2007 earnings forecast due to higher investments at Reebok. Hainer also said key future growth markets for Adidas would be Russia, India and China.
