 LONDON  (Reuters) - Cable operator Liberty Global Inc. ( LBTYA.O ) is set to surpass annual new customer targets after unexpectedly strong growth in October and the seasonally soft summer months during the third quarter. 

 The company, the largest cable operator in Europe and Japan, said on Thursday that operating cashflow in the three months ended September 30 increased 15 percent on 10 percent revenue gains, excluding the effects of acquisitions and currency movements. The results prompted Liberty Global, which is part of cable mogul John Malone's vast media empire, to say it was on track to exceed full-year guidance targets of $6.2 billion of revenue, $2.2 billion of operating cashflow and 1.4 million new customers of individual services, or revenue generating units (RGUs). "In particular, we should meaningfully exceed our guidance for RGU additions given the trends we are seeing so far in the fourth quarter, as we added over 150,000 RGUs in the month of October alone," Chief Executive Mike Fries said. Operating cashflow, a key figure watched by investors in the sector, was $599 million for the quarter and revenue rose to $1.62 billion from $1.1 billion. Liberty Global also posted a quarterly net profit -- a less significant measure in the industry -- of $445 million, or $1.03 a share, reversing a year-ago loss of $127.9 million, or 27 cents a share, after selling its French unit. The company's loss from continuing operations widened. Among its 357,000 new RGUs in the quarter, gains were highest for high-speed Internet services, followed by telephony. Liberty Global ended the quarter with 18.25 million RGUs. Average monthly revenue per customer, known as ARPU, increased 7.7 percent from a year ago to 20.29 euros. It continues to seek acquisitions in central and eastern Europe after a busy year of deals including sales of operations in Sweden and France and additions in Switzerland, Australia and the Czech Republic. Fries continued to stump for his company's share price, which he regularly claims is undervalued compared with its peers and given the company's relative growth prospects. The shares, which trade on the U.S.-based Nasdaq, have gained 21 percent on the year, after closing on Wednesday at  $26.85. Liberty Global has reduced its outstanding shares by 15 percent during the year using buybacks in an effort to boost the price, and still has $118 million remaining on a $250 million repurchase program.
