 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Viacom Inc. VIAb.N said on Thursday it planned to create new digital networks for adults, as it reported a lower quarterly profit from continuing operations, dragged down by disappointing box-office results. 

 As part of a management overhaul that saw the ouster of former Chief Executive Tom Freston in September, Chief Financial Officer Michael Dolan is leaving at the end of the year and will be succeeded by Chief Administrative Officer Thomas Dooley. Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone, who has taken a more active role in the businesses he built, appointed Dooley and another close associate, CEO Philippe Dauman, in September to craft an aggressive Internet strategy. Dauman said annual digital sales from the Internet, video games and mobile programming could reach $500 million as early as next year, after rising 73 percent in the third quarter. He repeated that the company would not make big Web acquisitions, preferring to build new properties internally and talk to early-stage companies. "I will not clear an acquisition unless it has a strong return on capital," Dauman told analysts on a conference call. Viacom is expected to announce a slate of new "multiplatform" digital networks geared for adults, Dauman told analysts, but declined to say more. The targeting of older demographics, even as it continues to court youth viewers, comes after Viacom lost a bid for teenage social networking site MySpace.com to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N last year. The hugely popular teen hangout has shaped News Corp.'s online strategy and boosted its market value by a quarter. News Corp. on Wednesday forecast more than $500 million in Internet division revenue for fiscal 2007. In sharp contrast, Viacom's Class B shares have fallen 5 percent this year, after splitting off its broadcast divisions and as its Internet strategy failed to excite investors. The stock was down 67 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $39.0 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. MTV UNDERPINS PROFIT Viacom, owner of the Paramount film studios and various cable networks, said third-quarter earnings from continuing operations fell to $356.3 million, or 50 cents per share, from $449.8 million, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time compensation charges and discrete tax benefits, earnings per share was 51 cents, beating the average analyst forecast of 47 cents according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 7 percent to $2.66 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $2.64 billion. "The quarter illustrates the underlying strengths of the cable network business, with subscription fees up double digits and advertising up high single digits," Pali Capital analyst Richard Greenfield said. Cable network revenue rose 10 percent to $1.8 billion, as operating profit increased 14 percent to $778 million on higher advertising sales at the MTV group. The film division reported an operating loss of $6 million, compared with a year-earlier profit of $108.2 million, as revenue rose 1 percent to $856.5 million. Box office sales for such third-quarter releases as "World Trade Center" failed to surpass those for year-earlier titles, which included "War of the Worlds." Corporate expenses also rose after a $62 million severance payout for Freston. "I am confident that you will see further operational success in the not too distant future," Redstone said in a statement. Viacom affirmed its full year 2006 financial outlook, which calls for a double-digit percentage rise in revenue and operating income. The company also expects to post full-year earnings per share of $1.95 to $2.00 from continuing operations, excluding items.
