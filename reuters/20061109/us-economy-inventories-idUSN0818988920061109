 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Inventories at U.S. wholesalers rose by a larger-than-expected 0.8 percent in September, while sales fell for the first time in nearly a year, the government said on Thursday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters projected wholesale inventories -- unsold stocks held by U.S. businesses or companies for resale to retailers -- to rise 0.5 percent after a 1.2 percent August gain. Wholesale inventories were led by gains in unsold stocks of durable goods, which rose by 1.5 percent during the month. Inventories of nondurable goods, such as food and apparel, fell 0.4 percent, the Commerce Department said. Inventories of automobiles jumped 1.9 percent to $37.34 billion in September after a 0.9 percent August decline. Overall wholesale sales fell by 1.2 percent in September, its first decline since November 2005 and its largest since April 2003. Sales were up 0.7 percent in August. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a gauge of how long it would take to deplete existing stocks at the current sales pace, rose to 1.18 months' worth in September. That was after hitting 1.16 months' in August and was the highest level in more than a year. Overall sales were dragged down by a 7.1 percent drop in petroleum during September after a 2.8 percent decline in August. However, the value of petroleum inventories rose 2.4 percent to $10.44 billion.
