 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) is promoting Kurt Simon to co-lead its technology, media and telecommunications team, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Tuesday. 

 Simon, who heads JPMorgan's telecommunications investment-banking group, will move to San Francisco and co-head the team along with Jennifer Nason, according to the paper. "We want to build on our existing strengths to become the No. 1 technology-media-telecommunications franchise on the West Coast," the paper quoted Simon as saying. Simon advised Embarq Corp on its $12 billion sale to CenturyTel Inc ( CTL.N ) in October 2008, according to the paper. "We see a bright future for capital raising and advisory work in the technology space," Simon told the paper. JPMorgan could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. (Reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)
