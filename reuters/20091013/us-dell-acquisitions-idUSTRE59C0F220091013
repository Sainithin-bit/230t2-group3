 (Reuters) - PC maker Dell Inc DELL.O is eyeing more acquisitions as part of a turnaround plan and is developing merger expertise, Chief Executive Michael Dell told Bloomberg in an interview on Monday. 

 "You will see us be reasonably active," Dell told the news agency and said the company is looking at acquisitions that will help increase sales to corporate clients. The company is also planning to consider more deals in the healthcare industry, Michael Dell told the news agency. Dell is pushing aggressively into the services business. In September, it unveiled plans to buy technology services company Perot Systems Corp ( PER.N ) for $3.9 billion. The deal will be the largest acquisition by the No. 2 PC maker and will help it better compete with Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) and International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ).
