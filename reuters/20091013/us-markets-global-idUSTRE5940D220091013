 DUBAI/LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks stalled at 2009 highs on Tuesday as investors awaited third-quarter U.S. earnings and as European investor sentiment ebbed in October, but the U.S. dollar continued its slide to 14-month lows. 

 As risk-hungry investors sought relatively high-yielding, commodity-supported currencies such as the Australian and Canadian dollars, the flipside was more losses for units with near zero rates such as the dollar and UK pound. "Risk perception remains an important topic in the absence of a cyclical trend out of the United States," Michael Klawitter, currency strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. "The dollar isn't getting any real meaningful support." Sterling was further undermined, hitting more than a six-month low against the euro and a five-month low on the dollar, by data showing UK inflation fell to just 1.1 percent in September, its lowest in five years. EAGER FOR EARNINGS Stocks were broadly flat ahead of major U.S. earnings data. European markets underperformed slightly as German analyst and investor sentiment, captured by the closely-watched ZEW survey showed, unexpectedly fell for the first time in three months to hit its lowest level since July. Key results due this week include Intel, Goldman Sachs and General Electric. Intel is expected to beat forecasts with its results later on Tuesday but some worry that corporate spending might not rebound until mid-2010. "Investors now are in wait-and-see mode," said Philippe Gijsels, strategist at Fortis Bank. "Everyone would like to see top-line growth, but I think it is possible companies could disappoint on this." According to Thomson Reuters data, the quarterly earnings contraction rate for the three months ending September -- based on reported and estimated earnings -- stands at 24.7 percent, compared with a contraction rate of 27.3 percent in Q2. Earnings are expected to bounce back strongly to growth later this year with an estimated growth rate of a whopping 193.4 percent in the fourth quarter. "There may be some corrections in this market, but you're better off being in the market, for further gains," said Bernard McAlinden, investment strategist at NCB Stockbrokers. MSCI world equity index rose 0.1 percent but stayed just shy of its highest level since October 2008, set on Monday. The index has gained more than 28 percent this year, recouping nearly two thirds of losses from last year. The FTSEurofirst 300 index fell 0.2 percent, dragged by falls in banks. Emerging Asia stocks hit a fresh 14-month high. Broader emerging stocks were up 0.1 percent. According to Thomson Reuters data, out of 32 S&P 500 companies which reported results, 78 percent beat expectations, compared with 13 percent which missed forecasts. "The current Q3 earning season may drive the equity market into a liquidity induced overdrive. Real money and even the more aggressive hedge fund community have missed the equity market rally and have not invested strongly enough to catch up with benchmark indices," BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. "Unless there is a shock, such as a major credit event, the share market will move sharply higher which will keep the dollar under pressure." U.S. crude oil rose 1.3 percent to a seven-week high of $74.28 a barrel. The September bund future was helped by the weaker ZEW index and was up 14 ticks on the day even as traders awaited this week's record issuance of up to 35 billion euros.
