 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Benchmark U.S. shares closed at seven week lows on Thursday, marring an otherwise positive day in global equity markets as sentiment turned negative in thin seasonal trade ahead of a key speech by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. 

 While the U.S. stock market fell, pulling the Dow Jones Industrial average below the psychologically significant 10,000 mark, it was just the opposite in Europe and Japan where prices rebounded. In Europe, strong earnings helped boost shares from five week closing lows and in Japan, buyers stepped in after four-days of losses to pull the Nikkei up from a 16-month trough. The euro advanced against the greenback and yen, which helped bolster crude oil prices more than 1 percent but did not give spot gold a lift. Data showing new weekly U.S. jobless benefit claims fell more than expected last week were still too high to signal a shift in the weak labor market that is constraining economic growth. "The best the bull can say is that the recovery is evening itself out now, it's not accelerating any more," said Linda Duessel, market strategist at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. "We think it's a soft patch and not a double dip, but the market is pricing more and more for a double dip, so you're vulnerable to the upside," she said. Bernanke speaks on Friday at an annual Fed meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. While he is likely to signal his views about prospects for the U.S. economy he may not offer clues on whether the Fed will try to shore up growth with another round of cash injections. "Labor market weakness remains the primary concern in the economy," said Dana Saporta, economist at Credit Suisse. "That's something that Bernanke has to address at his Jackson Hole speech tomorrow." At the close of trade, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 74.25 points, or 0.74 percent, to 9,985.81, its lowest point since early July. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 8.11 points, or 0.77 percent, to 1,047.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 22.85 points, or 1.07 percent, at 2,118.69. REBOUND Elsewhere, strong corporate earnings aided Europe's markets. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed 0.9 percent higher at 1,020.27 points. French bank Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) rose 2.7 percent on an 89 percent rise in second-quarter net profit, miner Kazakhmys ( KAZ.L ) gained 5.2 percent after its underlying first-half earnings per share jumped 130 percent and French hotel group Accor ( ACCP.PA ) rose 3.9 percent on doubling of core profit. MSCI's main gauge of global equities .MIWD00000PUS was up 0.33 percent after hitting its lowest level since July 7 on Wednesday. The Thomson Reuters global stock index  .TRXFLDGLPU  was 0.13 percent higher. "Companies have been reporting reasonable results," said David Buik, partner at BGC Partners. "But whether a rally can be sustained is to be seen. There is nothing to say the bad news is all over." With only a few companies left to report for the second quarter, Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research shows U.S. S&P 500  .SPX  had average earnings growth of 38.4 percent in the recent reporting season. Markets have been balancing good corporate profit results with signs that growth in the U.S. economy is slowing. EURO RISES In currencies, safe-havens such as the yen and the Swiss franc extended their rallies ahead of Bernanke's speech. Any statement from Bernanke on continuing or increasing economic stimulus measures could dent the dollar given that European authorities are perceived as more given to austerity than the U.S. "A second round of quantitative easing will likely put sharp downward pressure on the dollar, to some degree versus the euro and other G10 currencies, with potential for a broader dollar sell-off," said Steven Englander, Citigroup's global head of G10 currency strategy. The euro rose 0.47 percent to $1.2716 while the dollar fell 0.18 percent against the yen, retesting its the 15 year-low reached on Tuesday. Investors will also get a chance to hear what Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa has to say on the yen or monetary policy in Jackson Hole. The dollar index, a gauge of the greenback's performance against a basket of six major currencies, fell 0.47 percent to 82.872 .DXY. It hit 83.556 on Tuesday, a six-week high. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury rose 16/32 in price, yielding 2.48 percent after solid auction demand. Benchmark U.S. crude settled at $73.36, up 84 cents per barrel. Spot gold slipped $4.95 to $1,234.05 (Additional reporting by  Dena Aubin ,  Ryan Vlastelica  and  Vivianne Rodrigues ,  Jeremy Gaunt ,  Naomi Tajitsu , Joanne Frearson and  Christopher Johnson ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
