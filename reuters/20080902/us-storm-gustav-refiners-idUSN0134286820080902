 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department said late on Monday no refiners had asked the government yet for crude oil from the nation's emergency petroleum stockpile to help replace supplies disrupted by Hurricane Gustav. 

 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal said earlier in the day that Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) would ask the department on Tuesday for oil from the 707-million-barrel Strategic Petroleum Reserve and Shell Oil ( RDSa.L ) was expected to make a similar request. "We have not had any requests yet," said department spokeswoman Alyson Austin, who added the department was ready to make oil supplies from the reserve available to refiners if asked. "We are prepared to speak to any of the oil refineries," Austin said. "The refineries have to make the request to us first." Kevin Kolevar, assistant secretary for electricity delivery and energy reliability, said on Monday that with a record amount of oil in the reserve and U.S. petroleum inventories held by private companies at very high levels, the United States could handle supply problems caused by the storm. "We are exceptionally well positioned to deal with temporary disruptions in petroleum supply," he said. Kolevar said the Energy Department had no indication "at this time" of any significant damage to U.S. oil infrastructure. "We'll learn more tomorrow," he said. The emergency reserve was created by Congress in the mid- 1970s after the Arab oil embargo, and stores crude at four deep underground storage sites in Texas and Louisiana. Austin said three of the emergency reserve's four sites had been evacuated because of the hurricane, and only the stockpile's Bryan Mound site in Texas was operating at the moment. The department sold some 11 million barrels of oil from the emergency reserve to refiners and lent them another 9.8 million barrels after Hurricane Katrina disrupted petroleum supplies in September 2005.
