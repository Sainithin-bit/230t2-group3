 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Ethan Allen Interiors Inc ( ETH.N ) forecast quarterly profit below current Wall Street views on Tuesday, citing "substantially lower" sales volumes in July and August from a year earlier and its shares fell more than 7 percent in extended trading. 

 The furniture maker and retailer expects per-share earnings of 20 cents to 26 cents a diluted share for its first quarter, which ends this month. Analysts on average expected profit of 49 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. For the year-earlier first quarter, Ethan Allen had earnings of 57 cents a share. Falling home sales and values have hurt furnishings companies as consumers face higher fuel and food costs. Furniture Brands International Inc FBN.N and Haverty Furniture Co Inc ( HVT.N ) posted quarterly losses last month as the industrywide sales slowdown continued. Ethan Allen, which is scheduled to present at a Goldman Sachs retail conference on Wednesday, reported a 46 percent drop in fourth-quarter net income in July as same-store sales at its design centers fell 11.1 percent. The retailer disclosed its latest forecast after markets closed. The company's shares fell 7.7 percent to $25.10 in extended trading from their $27.20 close on the New York Stock Exchange.
