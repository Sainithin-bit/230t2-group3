 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Shell Oil ( RDSa.L ) said on Tuesday it was reviewing its need for crude oil after Hurricane Gustav, but the company has not asked the Energy Department for supplies from the United States' emergency petroleum stockpile. 

 "We continue to assess our needs and have not made a request for crude from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve," a Shell spokeswoman said. (Reporting by  Tom Doggett ; Editing by Marguerita Choy)
