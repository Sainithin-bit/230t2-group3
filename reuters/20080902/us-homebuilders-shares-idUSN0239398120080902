 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of home builders surged on Tuesday, outpacing a broad-based rally as investors decided builder stock prices could not  fall much further. 

 D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ), Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) and Centex Corp ( CTX.N ) , the top three U.S. builders, led the rally, with shares rising about 9 percent at the market open. The home builders' index was up about 5 percent in early trading .DJUSHB, ahead of the broader market's Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX , which was up only 1.4 percent. "It looks like there could be some longer-term money heading into this group," said Kevin Quinn, a managing director of equity trading with the Stanford Group Company. "They've spent a couple years in the cellar. They seem pretty cheap." The sharp slide in oil prices after a rally in the U.S. dollar and news that Hurricane Gustav had spared major Gulf oil facilities also boosted home builder shares. Lower oil prices means a diminished chance the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to contain inflation, and a lower cost of borrowing is good news for home sales.
