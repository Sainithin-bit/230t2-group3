 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The operator of the Henry Hub, the benchmark trading point for NYMEX natural gas futures, said Tuesday on-site assessments were being performed at the Hub and on the Sabine pipeline, but force majeure remained in effect following Hurricane Gustav. 

 On Sunday, Sabine Pipe Line LLC shut down operations as its workers were evacuated from coastal Louisiana ahead of the storm, the company said in Website postings. Sabine, a unit of oil major Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ), operates a 131-mile pipeline that transports natural gas between Erath, Louisiana and Port Arthur, Texas. Sabine is a subsidiary of Chevron Corp.
