 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Wachovia Capital Markets said the third quarter will be a "quarter to forget" for Wall Street investment banks and slashed its estimates for Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Lehman Brothers LEH.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). 

 "Seasonal slow markets, reluctant investors, declining valuations in both fixed income and equity, and more marks will highlight a challenging third quarter for the industry," analyst Douglas Sipkin wrote in a note to clients. The analyst sees a drop in capital raises from last quarter as investors are reluctant to participate in such offerings. He pegged the fall in equity and debt offerings at 45 percent and 60 percent, respectively, from last quarter. Morgan Stanley would report the strongest quarter in the group while Lehman the weakest, Sipkin said, while putting Lehman's loss at an estimated $3.46 a share for the third quarter. The brokerage expects Lehman's fixed income trading loss at $2.4 billion for the quarter, driven by an estimated 15 percent to 20 percent decline in the mortgage portfolio, as well as marks across the entire mortgage and credit complex. The analyst more than halved his third-quarter earnings estimate for Goldman to $2.08 a share from $4.22, saying the firm would report one of its weakest quarters since going public from a return standpoint. Sipkin expects private equity losses of $600 million at Goldman, compared with gains of $700 million last quarter. He expects equity trading revenue to drop by about a third and equity banking revenue to fall 30 percent to 40 percent for the bank. Morgan Stanley's earnings estimates were lowered to 94 cents a share from $1.14, but Sipkin said he expects the company to benefit from selling a stake in MSCI Inc MXB.N and better commodity markets. Fixed income trading, including marks, should be in the $600 million to $700 million range, compared with a $105 million loss last quarter for Morgan Stanley, he said. Sipkin joins a growing number of Wall Street analysts, who are projecting yet another tough quarter for U.S. investment banks marked by additional write-downs across a series of fixed-income assets amid an already weak operating environment. Since August, at least eight brokerages, including Merrill Lynch, Banc of America Securities and Bernstein, have cut their view for Goldman and Morgan Stanley. At least five have forecast a quarterly loss for Lehman. DEEPER CUTS IN ESTIMATES "Widening debt spreads continues to make fixed income a challenging business," Sipkin said. "Combined with tougher trading markets and poor performance, a more sustained slowdown from in flows from hedge funds is becoming more likely." Wachovia lowered 2008 earnings estimates for Goldman to $15.55 a share from $18.21 and 2009 forecast to $18.93 a share from $22.27. It lowered 2008 per-share earnings view for Morgan Stanley to $4.52 from $4.66, but kept 2009 earnings estimate unchanged at $4.89. Lehman's loss estimate for 2008 was widened to $7.83 a share from $2.88, while its 2009 earnings forecast was cut to $1.51 a share from $2.37. M&A ACTIVITY BUCKS TREND Activity in the area of mergers and acquisitions has bucked the trend and despite turbulent market conditions, strategic acquirers operating in a position of strength continue to transact on a decent clip in the quarter, Sipkin said. Announced deals rose 41 percent from the second quarter but fell 17 percent from the year ago period. Complete M&A activity was up 19 percent sequentially and fell 11 percent annually. "However, we noticed a slowdown in announcements towards the end of the quarter, which was likely due to seasonality," he said. Shares of Lehman were up more than 3 percent at $16.66 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Morgan Stanley shares were up close to 3 percent at $42.05 and Goldman shares were almost flat at $165.06. (Editing by Anil D'Silva)
