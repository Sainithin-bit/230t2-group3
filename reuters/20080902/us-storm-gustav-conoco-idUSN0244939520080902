 TORONTO  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips said Tuesday its Magnolia platform in the Gulf of Mexico sustained only minor damage from Hurricane Gustav, according to a spokesman for the company. 

 "Remote monitoring showed we came out in pretty good shape," said Bill Tanner, a spokesman for the company which operates the platform. Tanner said there was no timetable for when the platform, which was already undergoing planned maintenance, would return to service or when work would start up again.
