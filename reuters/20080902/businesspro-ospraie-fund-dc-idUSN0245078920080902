 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge fund manager Ospraie Management 
LLC said on Tuesday in a letter to its investors that it plans 
to close its flagship fund after it plunged 27 percent in 
August on losses in energy, mining and natural resources 
holdings. 

  The closure of the fund could be more bad news for Lehman 
Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, which took a 20 percent stake in 
the hedge fund manager in 2005.  Ospraie and Lehman both declined to comment. Lehman shares 
were down more than 4 percent in after-hours trading.  Ospraie said the fund, has lost 38.59 percent so far this 
year.  The firm said it planned to distribute 40 percent of the 
fund's assets to investors by September 30 and an additional 40 
percent by year-end. The remaining 20 percent of the fund's 
assets were illiquid and could take up to three years to give 
back to investors, Ospraie Management said.  A person familiar with the situation said that, as of the 
beginning of August, the flagship fund had $2.8 billion 
invested. In addition, Ospraie Management still manages $4 
billion in other investment funds, including a special 
opportunities fund, the source said.  "I think it's probably the first of more hedge fund 
closings to come, given that a significant majority of hedge 
funds have had negative performance this year," said Chris 
Orndorff, head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel in Los 
Angeles.  "I think its another piece of bad news for Lehman which is 
unfortunate and it probably raises the stakes on their 
conversations with the Korean Development Bank," he said in 
reference to discussions Lehman has been having with KDB about 
the South Korean bank taking a stake in Lehman.  (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal  and  Kristina Cooke ; Editing
