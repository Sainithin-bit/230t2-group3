 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - No flooding has been seen at the Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ) Chalmette, Murphy ( MUR.N ) Meraux and ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) Alliance refineries south and east of New Orleans, area sheriff's offices said. 

 Those three refineries were flooded by Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Exxon's joint-venture 193,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Chalmette had no flooding, said a spokesman for the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff's office. There was also no flooding near Murphy's 120,000 bpd Meraux refinery, the sheriff's office said. An Exxon spokeswoman and a Murphy spokesman said they had no information about conditions at the respective refineries. Conoco's 247,000 bpd Alliance refinery had no flooding, according to the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's office. A Conoco spokesman said an initial assessment showed there was no standing water at the refinery and there was  minor damage like downed powerlines. The Alliance refinery does have electrical power, said Conoco's Bill Tanner, but he didn't know if it was enough to restart production after a detailed assessment is carried out. That assessment was planned for Tuesday, once the weather clears. Following Katrina, a giant oil-water tank floated off its base at Murphy Meraux refinery and caused a spill of an estimated 25,000 barrels of oil and water, which inundated neighborhoods around the refinery.
