 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Lone Star may face an order to sell shares in Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) after a regulatory omission, a watchdog said on Tuesday, a move analysts say would not hinder the U.S. private equity house's $6.3 billion deal with HSBC. 

 South Korea's Financial Services Commission (FSC) said it may consider fining U.S. investment firm Lone Star LS.UL after it failed to submit regulatory documents, and that may result in an order to sell shares in Korea Exchange Bank 004940.KS. "Financial authorities in February asked Lone Star to submit supplementary documents as we were in the process of reviewing whether Lone Star is a qualified top shareholder (in a domestic bank)," an unnamed senior official of the FSC said in a statement. "But Lone Star had not handed in documents by a new deadline of August 31 and asked us to postpone the deadline. Now that Lone Star has not accepted our request, we will proceed with relevant procedures by considering imposing a fine under the banking law." If Lone Star is fined for the regulatory omission, the firm would be disqualified from becoming a top shareholder in a South Korean bank and therefore ordered to sell shares in the lender, the statement added. Lone Star's PR agency in Seoul said it had no immediate comment. Lone Star holds 51 percent of KEB, the country's No. 6 bank for which global banking giant HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) has offered $6.3 billion for a majority stake. The deal has been mired in legal disputes surrounding the investment firm's South Korean activities, as the government has been delaying approval of KEB sale, citing legal uncertainties. Market watchers say a possible regulatory move to force Lone Star to sell shares in KEB would help the private equity house exit from its $1.2 billion deal quickly, even before it wins South Korean government approval of the deal with HSBC. From HSBC's standpoint, a regulatory move against the U.S. firm may raise the negotiation power for the UK-based bank and result in cutting the price tag of $6.3 billion, said Hana Daetoo Securities analyst Han Jeong-tae. "If the sale is a compulsory one, HSBC does not have to pay a high price," Han said. FSC Chairman Jun Kwang-woo said last week the government has been paying a serious and sincere attention to HSBC's offer to buy a majority stake in KEB, after the UK-based bank had recently put in a revised application to South Korean authorities on the bid for KEB.
