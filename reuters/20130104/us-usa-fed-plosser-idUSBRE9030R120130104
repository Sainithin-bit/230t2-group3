 SAN DIEGO  (Reuters) - Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Charles Plosser said on Friday that the United States had likely suffered a lasting decline in the trend potential growth rate of its economy as a result of the severe 2007-2009 U.S. recession. 
 "It certainly looks like we've had a permanent shock," he told a panel discussion on the real business cycle during the annual meeting of the American Economics Association. However, he said that it would take a considerable period of time before the data would be able to verify that trend growth had declined. (Reporting By  Alister Bull ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
