 (Reuters) - The world's largest retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) appointed Lev Khasis as president and chief executive of New Formats for Walmart International, a company spokesperson said. 
 Khasis, who joined Wal-Mart in 2011 as senior vice-president, will focus on developing new store concepts that can be deployed across markets, Wal-Mart spokesperson Kevin Gardner said in an e-mail statement. Khasis built up Russia's biggest food retailer X5 ( PJPq.L ) through acquisitions into a Russian market leader until his resignation in 2011. Wal-Mart has more than 4,480 stores in the United States, including large supercenters, discount stores, grocery stores, small format stores and Sam's Club warehouse club stores.
