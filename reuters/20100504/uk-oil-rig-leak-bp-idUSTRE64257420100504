 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The flow rate of the oil leak in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico remains unchanged despite efforts to fix a failed blowout preventer, a BP spokesman said on Monday. 

 A massive oil spill is edging towards the Gulf Coast shoreline, after BP's drilling rig exploded and ruptured a well nearly two weeks ago, gushing about 5,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Spokesman David Nicholas said the rate was unchanged in response to local Alabama media reports that the flow had been significantly cut. Doug Suttles, chief operating officer for BP's exploration and production unit, said further at a briefing on Monday that the blowout preventer that failed has devices that can be closed to cut the pipe leading to the well and seal off the flow. He said measurements show those devices are closed, but the seals have not worked "for whatever reason." so the flow has not been curtailed. "As soon as we get the flow stopped or captured, we will report that," Suttles said. (Reporting by Kristen Hays and  Joshua Schneyer ; Editing by Marguerita Choy)
