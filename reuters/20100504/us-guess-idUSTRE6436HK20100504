 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The president and chief operating officer of Guess Inc ( GES.N ), Carlos Alberini, will resign from the apparel maker to become co-CEO of Restoration Hardware, the companies said on Tuesday. 

 Alberini, who worked at Guess for about ten years, will join Restoration Hardware's current Chairman and CEO, Gary Friedman, to share that post's responsibilities, Restoration Hardware said. While Friedman will head marketing, merchandising and creative functions of the job, Alberini will be charged with managing operations, supply chain, inventory, finance, information technology, stores and human resources, the company said. Restoration Hardware sells furnishings for home and garden at its retail stores, online and through its catalogs. Alberini is a well-respected executive who helped grow Guess's wholesale and retail businesses internationally across a wide range of product categories. He will remain a member of that company's board of directors. The resignation will be effective June 1. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
