 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The total number of offshore natural gas production platforms shut in the Gulf of Mexico due to the oil spill stands at three, unchanged from the weekend, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 The Coast Guard is inspecting inbound vessels for possible oil contamination, and "There are no shipping disruptions," said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Mosley. "There has not been any impact on commercial shipping." (Reporting by  Chris Baltimore )
