 (Reuters) - The spread of a huge oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has rallied energy companies to work together in the cleanup effort. 

 A blown out undersea oil well owned by BP Plc is spilling about 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons or 955,000 litres) a day, creating a slick measuring at least 130 miles (208km) by 70 miles (112 km). Below is a list of what oil companies have done to assist in the cleanup effort: Royal Dutch Shell: - Given BP use of Shell's Robert Training and Conference centre in Robert, Louisiana, for use as headquarters for coordinating cleanup efforts. - Following BP's request, given the company access to Shell's ocean cleanup experts. Shell could not say how many are currently assisting BP. ExxonMobil: - Given use of a drilling rig as a staging base, two supply vessels, an underwater vehicle and support vessel. - It has provided experts to respond to BP's request for technical advice on blowout preventers, dispersant injection, well construction and containment options. - Is supporting Tier 3 spill response and cleanup cooperatives, such as Marine Spill Response Corporation, Clean Gulf, and Oil Spill Response Ltd., to provide personnel and equipment, such as dispersants, fire boom and radios. - Procuring and manufacturing additional supplies of dispersant for potential use. Chevron Corp - Assigned personnel with expertise in subsea blowout preventer interventionand subsea construction to support BP. - Personnel from Chevron's 330,000 barrel-per-day Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery joined the U.S. Coast Guard's local incident command response team in Mobile, Alabama. - BP contracted the Pascagoula refinery's marine wildlife rescue portable trailer.
