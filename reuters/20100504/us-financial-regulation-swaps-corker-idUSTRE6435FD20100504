 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An influential U.S. Republican lawmaker said on Tuesday he expects a proposal to require banks to spin off their swap-trading desks will be dropped from Wall Street reform legislation in the Senate. 

 "One way or another it will go away," Republican Senator Bob Corker told reporters on Tuesday in a Capitol hallway. "I know Treasury doesn't support it. I know the FDIC doesn't support it. I don't think the Obama administration wants to support it," Corker said. "It needs to be fixed ... It shouldn't have come out of committee." Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair over the weekend criticized the proposal, which was added last week to broad financial reform legislation following its approval by the Senate Agriculture Committee.
