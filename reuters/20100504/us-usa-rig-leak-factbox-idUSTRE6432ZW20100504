 of Mexico has raised concerns among some in the oil industry that the slick could hurt energy operations in the region. A blown out undersea oil well owned by BP Plc is spilling about 5,000 barrels (210,000 gallons or 955,000 liters) a day, creating a slick measuring at least 130 miles by 70 miles.

Delays in vessel traffic, particularly the tankers delivering crude, can impact refineries in the region.
