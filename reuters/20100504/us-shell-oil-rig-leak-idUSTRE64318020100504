 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said on Tuesday it is too early to draw conclusions on what the U.S. government will do about future Gulf of Mexico drillings as investigations are still ongoing after BP's drilling rig exploded and ruptured a well two weeks ago. 

 Chief Executive Peter Voser also said the leak, which is gushing about 5,000 barrels of crude oil per day, will not have much impact on crude prices and production. "The most important thing right now is to contain the oil spill," he told a news conference at the opening of its new petrochemical complex in Singapore. "As of now, we have not been given instructions to stop drilling." (Reporting by Seng Li Peng and Florence Tan; Editing by Ramthan Hussain)
