 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Cable is in late-stage talks to buy The Carlyle Group's cable operator Insight Communications Co for around $3 billion, Bloomberg News reported on Sunday. 

 Time Warner could announce a deal as soon as Monday, said the report, which cited two people with knowledge of the matter. Talks could still fall apart, the report said. Insight is the 10th-largest cable operator in the United States, Carlyle's website says. It sells cable television, high-speed Internet and telephone services, serving around 750,000 customers in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio. Time Warner and Insight could not immediately be reached for comment. A Carlyle spokesperson declined to comment. (Reporting by  Michael Erman ; Editing by  Dale Hudson )
