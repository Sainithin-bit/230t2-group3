 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc's ( MET.N ) 2013 earnings forecast assumes no share buybacks, the company's chief executive said on Thursday. 
 The Federal Reserve has twice blocked MetLife from buying back stock, a consequence of the bank holding company charter the insurer is trying to shed. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
