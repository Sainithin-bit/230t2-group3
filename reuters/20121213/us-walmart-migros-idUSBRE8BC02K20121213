 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) is in talks to buy an 80 percent stake in Turkish retailer Migros Ticaret AS ( MGROS.IS ) from London-based private equity group BC Partners, the Financial Times reported. 
 According to the paper, this deal would value Migros at more than $4 billion including debt. Walmart held meetings with Migros managers in recent days in Turkey but it had not placed a bid for the Turkish retailer, the paper said, citing several people familiar with the discussion. Migros could not immediately be reached for a comment. Wal-Mart spokesman Kevin Gardner said the company does not comment on rumors and speculation. (Reporting By Vishal Krishnan Menon in Bangalore)
