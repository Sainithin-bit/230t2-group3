 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Panasonic Corp President Fumio Ohtsubo said on Monday that drastic restructuring in its loss-making television business was aimed at pulling the unit into profit in the year starting in April 2012. 
 In a briefing on corporate strategy, he also said that he wanted nearly half of the company's liquid-crystal display panel production to be used in non-TV products. (Reporting by  Isabel Reynolds ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
