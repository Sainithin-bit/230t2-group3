 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ICE Futures U.S. on Monday barred MF Global brokers from its trading floors and said the stricken brokerage's customers will be limited to liquidation-only trading, effective immediately. 
 Additionally, the exchange -- one of the two biggest commodity markets in the world -- will no longer recognize MF Global or any of its divisions as a guarantor for purposes of floor trading privileges, ICE said in a notice. (Reporting by  Marcy Nicholson )
