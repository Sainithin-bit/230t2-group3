 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said on Monday that he would watch developments in forex markets after Tokyo unilaterally intervened to counter the yen's strength. 
 "We will watch how things develop from here on," he told a news conference. He also said that Japan intervened to counter downward economic risks. (Reporting by  Yoko Kubota ; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
