 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil and global stock prices fell while safe-havens like the U.S. dollar and government debt rose on Monday on fears a deadly flu outbreak in Mexico could become a pandemic and prolong a worldwide recession. 

 The threat of a pandemic triggered by a new flu strain that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico sent shares of drugmakers higher from Asia to Europe to the United States. The U.S. dollar and yen gained broadly while U.S. Treasury debt prices rose as worries about the flu outbreak prompted investors to seek shelter in the safety of both currencies. Concerns that the virus represents a new obstacle to economic recovery pushed stock prices lower when markets opened in Asia but European shares rebounded to close higher on the view fears of a pandemic were overdone. U.S. stocks closed down after briefly turning positive at midday on renewed jitters that the virus could spread beyond Mexico. Oil stocks led the Dow lower and the AMEX Airline index  .XAL  fell 10.6 percent. "The news has the potential to reduce travel, tourism, trade, and to keep the consumers away from the malls," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at options market maker Interactive Brokers in Greenwich, Connecticut. However, Wilkinson said, "I don't expect this to have a very long life." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 51.29 points, or 0.64 percent, at 8,025.00. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 8.72 points, or 1.01 percent, at 857.51. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 14.88 points, or 0.88 percent, at 1,679.41. Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) fell 1.79 percent and Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) shed 0.66 percent. Investors have turned cautious in the past few days while they await the results of the U.S. administration's bank stress tests and ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve meeting ending on Wednesday. So the flu outbreak added to investor worries. "The market looks for things to worry about, particularly when you are up nearly 30 percent from the bottom," said Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Arkansas. Stocks of drugmakers benefited from the pandemic threat, with the Merrill Lynch Biotech Holders ETF ( BBH.P ) rising 2.1 percent and Gilead Sciences ( GILD.O ) gaining 3.8 percent. In Europe, GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ) rose 5.7 percent, AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ) rose 3.7 percent and Roche ( ROG.VX ) added 3.5 percent. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed up 0.4 percent at 813.69. Crude oil ended lower but prices pulled back from losses of almost 7.0 percent as fears eased about a potential pandemic. U.S. oil futures dropped $1.41 to settle at $50.14 a barrel, off an earlier low of $48.01. London Brent crude fell $1.39 to $50.28 a barrel. Government debt prices also retreated but later rose as U.S. stocks slipped following a brief march into positive territory. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 18/32 to yield 2.92 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note gained 4/32 in price to yield 0.89 percent. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 1.12 percent at 85.665. The euro fell 1.68 percent at $1.303. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.38 percent at 96.78. Gold edged lower as the dollar strengthened, but losses were capped as fears of a flu pandemic helped underpin gold's appeal as a hedge against risk. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled down $5.90 at $908.20 in New York.
