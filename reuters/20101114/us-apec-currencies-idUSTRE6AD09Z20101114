 YOKOHAMA, Japan  (Reuters) - Asia Pacific leaders will agree in their summit statement to refrain from competitive currency devaluations and move toward more market-determined foreign exchange systems, Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday. 

 The commitments, spelt out in a draft of the statement due to be finalized shortly by APEC leaders, echoed the language of a G20 summit that ended on Friday. The meetings were preceded by tensions over how to redress imbalances between indebted advanced economies and export-driven emerging economies that had triggered fears of a "currency war."
