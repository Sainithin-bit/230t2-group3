 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) said on Thursday that fourth-quarter earnings fell, hurt by weaker prices and a dip in sales of basic chemicals. 

 Net income for the No 1 U.S. chemical maker dropped to $975 million, or $1 a share, from $1.1 billion, or $1.12 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company posted earnings of 98 cents per share, topping the average forecast of 93 cents from analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Revenue climbed to $12.2 billion from $11.9 billion. Dow, which earlier this month announced the opening of its first production plant in Russia, is seeking to increase its specialty chemical sales and expand into new markets. Specialty chemical products like styrofoam are manufactured in smaller volumes than commodity chemicals like ethylene, but carry higher profit margins. Dow shares have risen 3.1 percent in the last three months, lagging gains of 8.1 percent for the Standard and Poor's Chemicals Index .GSPPM and 9.8 percent for rival DuPont Co. ( DD.N ).
