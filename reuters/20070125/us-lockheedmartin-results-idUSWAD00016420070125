 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Northrop Grumman Corp. ( NOC.N ) reported sharp increases in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday and raised full-year forecasts, as two of the world's largest defense contractors capitalized on the continuing boom in U.S. military spending. 

 Lockheed's profit easily beat Wall Street's forecast, helping its shares rise 1 percent to almost hit a new all-time high. Northrop slightly missed analysts' average forecast due to a charge on a radar program, sending its shares down slightly after notching an all-time high earlier this week. The companies, along with rivals Boeing Co. ( BA.N ), General Dynamics Corp. ( GD.N ) and Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ), are taking advantage of record levels in U.S. defense spending, extra funding for operations in Iraq and more outsourcing of government technology projects. The Standard & Poor's Aerospace and Defense index .GSPAERO is up about 29 percent over the past 12 months, outperforming a 14 percent gain in the S&P 500 Index  .SPX . Lockheed shares have led the sector, rising about 50 percent in that time, while Northrop shares are up around 19 percent. Investors have historically put a lower valuation on Northrop, which is viewed as being tied to the slower-growing shipbuilding business, as opposed to more dynamic aerospace business, like Boeing and Lockheed, and the booming army vehicle business, like General Dynamics. Lockheed shares are trading at about 16-17 times the company's own forecast for 2007 earnings, while Northrop is trading about 14-15 times. LOCKHEED BEATS STREET Lockheed, the world's No. 1 defense contractor, reported a greater-than-expected 28 percent rise in quarterly profit, helped by strong sales for its fighter jet programs. Profit increased to $729 million, or $1.68 per share, compared with $568 million, or $1.29 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 6 percent to $10.8 billion. That easily beat Wall Street's forecast of $1.45 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. For 2007, the Bethesda, Maryland-based company raised its profit forecast based on strong expected performance from its aeronautics unit, which is producing the F-35 Lightning II. The aircraft, known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is set to be the costliest warplane project on record. It now expects profit in the range of $5.80 to $6.00 per share for the full year, up 20 cents from its previous estimate in October, and in line with analysts' average estimate of $5.86 per share. Lockheed shares rose 79 cents to $97.94 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier the shares hit $98.74, one cent short of the all-time high hit on Tuesday. NORTHROP MISSES Northrop, the No. 3 Pentagon contractor behind Lockheed and Boeing, said fourth-quarter profit rose 37 percent, slightly below expectations, as better margins in its information, electronics and shipbuilding units were partly offset by a charge on a radar program. The Los Angeles-based company, which makes warships, nuclear submarines, unmanned surveillance planes and a range of military electronics, reported net profit of $453 million, or $1.28 per share, compared with $331 million, or 92 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.29 per share. On that basis, Wall Street was expecting $1.31 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 5 percent to $8 billion. Analysts had forecast $8.1 billion. Profit was hit by a $61 million pretax loss provision for its Multi-role Electronically Scanned Array (MESA) radar system, which is a fixed-price development program, meaning that Northrop must cover the costs of unplanned delays itself. Federal and foreign income taxes also rose sharply, dragging back profit. Looking forward, Northrop forecast full-year 2007 earnings from continuing operations of $4.80 to $5.05 per share, up from its October forecast of $4.65 to $4.90 per share, helped by an expected gain from the company's pension plans based on a change in investment assumptions. Wall Street is expecting $4.86 per share, on average. Northrop shares fell 81 cents to $71.00. They hit an all-time high of $71.92 on Wednesday.
