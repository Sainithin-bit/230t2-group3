 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Japan's battered currency rebounded on Thursday on reports European governments are growing impatient with recent yen weakness, while a record-breaking run for Asian shares petered out despite tech sector gains. 

 Copper prices continued a rally on supply worries, boosting shares in diversified mining stocks and nudging Australia's resource-heavy main index to another record close, but Japan's Nikkei lost ground after touching a 6-1/2-year high. "The fact that it is by no means a cheap market is a risk," said Garry Evans, a strategist at HSBC Securities in Japan. "Investors looking to take a cyclical view probably prefer markets like Korea and Taiwan, which are equally cyclical but much cheaper." Financial bookmakers in London called the FTSE 100 index  .FTSE  to open modestly higher, supported by advances in U.S. markets, where the Dow Jones  .DJI  rose 0.7 percent to a new peak and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  jumped 1.4 percent. The yen climbed against the dollar and major currencies after reports on Wednesday said European officials want to complain about the Japanese currency's weakness at next month's Group of Seven meeting of rich countries' finance ministers. A sell-off accelerated by last week's Bank of Japan decision to hold interest rates steady at 0.25 percent -- and speculation the BOJ might not boost rates next month -- had seen the yen plumb four-year lows to the dollar and a life-low to the euro. But some market players doubted whether a European move to boost the yen would have much effect. "We think the G7 cannot take coordinated action to correct yen depreciation at the meeting," said Toru Umemoto, chief FX strategist at Barclays Capital in Tokyo. "The current dollar/yen level is not an issue for U.S. policymakers, and any voluntary unilateral action to correct yen depreciation by the Japanese authorities would not be domestically accepted." Oil gave up most of the previous day's gains but held above $55 a barrel, as U.S. plans to boost strategic reserves and colder weather in the northeastern United States, the world's top heating oil market, offset swelling crude stockpiles. NIKKEI REVERSES COURSE Tokyo's Nikkei  .N225  fell 0.3 percent, reversing course after hitting its highest level since July 2000. Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ), up 1.6 percent, held gains made amid growing optimism about the outlook for the tech sector after healthy profit reports from U.S. firms such as Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) and Sun Microsystems Inc. SUNW.O. But the yen's rally took its toll on other leading exporters -- whose overseas sales are inflated by a weaker domestic currency -- with Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) falling 1.7 percent and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) dropping 2 percent. MSCI's broadest index of shares elsewhere in Asia .MSCIAPJ was down 0.2 percent at 0620 GMT, but a technology sub-index .MSCIAPJIT gained 0.5 percent. Australia's S&P ASX 200 .AXJO inched fractionally higher to a fourth straight record close. Global miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) gained 1.9 percent, as Shanghai copper futures rose 1 percent as concerns grew about tight supply in the spot market. "The mining stocks have got a stronger correlation to spot prices than anything else," said James Holt, a portfolio manager with Zurich Financial Services. Benchmark share indexes Taiwan  .TWII , Hong Kong  .HSI  and Singapore .STI all fell, while South Korea's main index  .KS11  finished little changed. The dollar slipped to 120.30 yen  JPY=  by 0620 GMT from near 121.20 yen in late New York trade, well below a four-year peak of 121.80 yen struck earlier this week. The euro slipped to 155.90 yen EURJPY=R from 157.20 yen, down sharply from an all-time high of 158.62 yen struck on Wednesday. The European currency also edged down to $1.2960  EUR=  from $1.2970. Spot gold XAU= traded around $646.70 an ounce, down from a seven-week high of $648.60 hit the previous day. The benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond yield <0#JPTSY=JBTC> rose 1 basis point to 1.665 percent. NYMEX crude for March delivery CLc1 eased 24 cents, or around 0.4 percent, to $55.13 a barrel. Crude had jumped 4.7 percent on Tuesday on news the U.S. will increase its emergency oil reserves by 11 million barrels this spring, but prices remain down around 12 percent this month.
