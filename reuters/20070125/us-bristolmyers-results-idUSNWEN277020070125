 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. on Thursday reported a fourth-quarter loss due to special charges and generic competition for its Plavix blood-clot drug, sending its shares lower. 

 Canadian drugmaker Apotex Inc. shipped huge amounts of generic Plavix in August in its U.S. launch, before a New York federal judge halted further shipments but allowed continued sales of supplies already in the market. Bristol-Myers had predicted supplies of the generic would dry up in the first quarter, but said on Thursday they could last through the middle of the year -- and continue to bedevil Plavix. It said the generic deprived Plavix of up to $1.3 billion in revenue last year, and will likely reduce its sales another $700 million this year. An ongoing patent battle between the two companies will decide whether Apotex can resume shipments of its product. Bristol-Myers, whose performance has steadily declined since 2004 as its drugs have faced more generic competition, said earnings will resume growth this year as demand builds for its newer medicines. It projected 2007 earnings, excluding items, of $1.20 to $1.30 per share, or profit growth of 10 to 19 percent. The Reuters Estimate view is $1.22 per share. "We see 2007 as a defining year for Bristol-Myers," with cost savings another contributor to improved prospects, Bear Stearns analyst John Boris said in a research note. Many industry analysts believe another drugmaker could soon make a bid for New York-based Bristol-Myers to secure its impressive line of cancer drugs, including three for which it may seek U.S. approvals within the next 18 months. Bristol-Myers, whose shares edged down 2.5 percent in late-afternoon trading, lost $134 million in the fourth quarter, or 7 cents per share. That compared with a profit of $499 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, the company earned 19 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had expected 16 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. It beat Wall Street forecasts because of a large tax credit that was concentrated in the quarter, rather than spread over the year, Boris said. The biggest special charge in the quarter was $353 million as an additional reserve toward a proposed $499 million settlement, following federal probes into the company's pricing and marketing practices. It took another $220 million charge to retire debt. Fourth-quarter sales fell 16 percent to $4.21 billion, in line with forecasts. Bristol-Myers said revenue from Plavix, which is sold in partnership with Sanofi-Aventis, fell 53 percent to $496 million. That is an improvement over earlier quarters, when sales plunged more than 70 percent. Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister said continuation of Bristol-Myers' generous 4.2 percent dividend may not be possible if the company loses its patent battle with Apotex. Another threat is Eli Lilly & Co.'s potentially superior blood-clot drug, called prasugrel, which could be launched by 2008 and prevent Plavix sales from growing, she said. "There could be a situation where Bristol gets Apotex settled, only to face another Plavix battle with prasugrel," Bannister said. Other Bristol-Myers drugs were battered during the fourth quarter by generic competition in Europe, including cholesterol fighter Pravachol, whose global sales fell 75 percent to $146 million. Newer products continued to gain popularity, however, including blood pressure treatment Avapro -- also partnered with Sanofi-Aventis -- whose sales rose 11 percent to $307 million. Colon cancer treatment Erbitux, sold in partnership with ImClone Systems Inc., jumped 38 percent to $167 million, bolstered by its recent approval to also treat head and neck cancer. Shares of Bristol-Myers fell 68 cents to $26.31 on the New York Stock Exchange.
