 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Irish media magnate Tony O'Reilly's Independent News and Media Plc joined forces with private buyout heavyweight Carlyle Group to launch a renewed takeover for APN News and Media, valuing the Australasian group at A$2.8 billion ($2.2 billion). 

 Independent and Providence Equity Partners, part of the previous bidding consortium, teamed with Carlyle to offer A$6.05 a share for all the shares of APN, just above a previous offer but below the stock's recent highs. Independent already owns about 40 percent of APN. Shares in APN, which owns New Zealand's largest paper and a string of radio stations, traded as high as A$6.20 before easing to trade 0.2 percent lower at A$6.14 by 0455 GMT. The details of APN's previous approach were never released but sources have said the earlier bid was valued at A$6.02 per share. Analysts said the bid had a mixed chance of success as it was pitched just below APN's current share price, but played down the likelihood of a rival bid. "It is unlikely there will be a counterbid from another party given Independent has control of it already. It does not seem as much a premium as some of the other (media) deals," Shaw Stockbroking analyst Greg Fraser said. Including APN's debt and convertible notes, the offer values APN at about A$3.8 billion. Independent was expected to have a 35-40 percent stake in APN if the deal goes ahead, with Carlyle and Providence holding about 30 percent each, another source said. The deal will be funded with A$1.5 billion in equity and A$2.3 billion in debt. Sources said the deal would leave O'Reilly's Independent with A$600 million to use for potential acquisitions offshore. Previous talks ended in November, after Independent News made a joint approach with Providence amid a shake-out of Australia's television, radio and newspaper market ahead of the introduction of new media ownership laws this year. Dublin-based Independent, which publishes 175 newspaper and magazine titles across the globe including Britain's Independent, indicated last year the door was open for another offer. Independent chairman O'Reilly, a former international rugby player, is Ireland's best-known businessman and a high-profile global investor. The former HJ Heinz chairman has worked with Providence before, partnering the private equity firm and international financier George Soros in the 3 billion euro buyout of Irish phone company Eircom in 2001. MEDIA SHAKE-UP Ted Harris, chairman of the independent committee of the APN Board, said in a statement: "The proposal will now be considered by the committee, which will decide whether it is in the best interests of all shareholders, and make a recommendation as quickly as possible." A source familiar with the situation said a recommendation was likely next week. The buyout firms are the latest private equity groups to grab a piece of the Australian media industry following the passage of a law which allows owners of one form of media to own a second type in the same market and scrapping foreign ownership limits. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts set up a A$4 billion joint venture with Seven Network Ltd's media businesses last year, while and Publishing & Broadcasting Ltd. tipped its media assets into a joint venture with CVC Asia Pacific. Independent argues the value of its offer is higher than those in the PBL and Seven deals by winding back contributions from APN's joint ventures from APN's 2006 earnings forecasts, a move analysts said may be disputed by APN. APN has radio joint ventures with U.S. radio station operator Clear Channel Communications Inc. which is also being bought by private equity. APN is the largest radio broadcaster in Australasia and publishes a range of newspapers and magazines, including New Zealand's biggest daily newspaper, the New Zealand Herald. The offer includes a final APN dividend and is subject to due diligence. A bid of A$6.05 a share prices it at 17.2 times forecast earnings for this year, compared with the earnings multiple of 20.7 that News Corp and Seven paid to grab stakes in Australia's John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. and West Australian Newspapers Holdings Ltd. last year. APN's biggest institutional shareholder, fund manager Perpetual Investments with 14.8 percent stake, was not immediately available to comment. ($1=A$1.28)
