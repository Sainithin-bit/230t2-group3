 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. home builders tumbled on Thursday after a slew of companies reported weak quarterly results and said they did not see an inkling of a rebound in the U.S. housing market. 

 The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, a yardstick that measures home builder performance, was off 3.6 percent in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "They were up big yesterday, and today's reports were just not that encouraging," said Majestic Research analyst John Thomlinson. Shares of Beazer Homes USA ( BZH.N ) led the decline, falling 5.7 percent to $44.34, down $2.67. The company on Thursday reported a loss after taking charges for sagging land values and its chief executive said the company did not see evidence of a housing rebound. Ryland Group Inc. ( RYL.N ) on Wednesday reported a 46 decline in quarterly earnings. On Thursday, its shares were off about 5.6 percent or $3.15 to $52.82. Meritage Homes Corp. ( MTH.N ) on Wednesday reported a 91 percent profit decline and said it expects 2007 will be a difficult year. The company's shares fell 4.2 percent or $1.92 to $43.93.
