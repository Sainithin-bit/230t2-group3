 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Orthopedic device maker Stryker Corp. ( SYK.N ) said on Thursday quarterly net earnings rose on demand for its replacement joints and surgical equipment. 

 Fourth-quarter net income was $227.9 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, compared with $178.4 million, or 43 cents a share, a year ago, when the company took a $15.9 million acquisition-related charge. Wall Street analysts on average had forecast 55 cents a share, according to those polled by Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose more than 14 percent to $1.46 billion from $1.28 billion a year ago. Kalamazoo, Michigan-based Stryker said it is optimistic about 2007 "despite the potential for increased pricing pressure in certain markets." The company said it expects diluted net earnings per share to be $2.42, which is in line with analysts' forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates. The outlook assumes net sales increase of 11 to 13 percent on a constant currency basis, mostly because of continued strong demand for orthopedic implants and medical surgical equipment, the company said. Shares of Stryker ended the day 6 cents higher at $48.84, just off the record high of $49.33 set on January 12.
