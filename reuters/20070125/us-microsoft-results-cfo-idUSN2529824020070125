 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. on Thursday lowered the sales outlook for its entertainment and device division for the second half of its fiscal year, citing a "reasonable" amount of Xbox 360 video game console inventory in stores. 

 "We are just being cautious about the second half. It was always going to be a slow half. We've done very well in the first half. There is a reasonable amount of inventory in the channel," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in an interview. The company had shipped 10.4 million Xbox 360 video game consoles by the end of 2006, beating its target of 10 million, but it faces strong competition from Sony Corp. and Nintendo Co. Ltd., which launched consoles late last year. Liddell added Microsoft expects to offset those lowered Xbox sales expectations with better sales of premium versions of its Windows operating system. The company raised its sales outlook on Thursday for the client software division, which includes its Windows operating system, to a range of 11 percent to 12 percent for the fiscal year from a growth target of 9 percent to 10 percent. That offset an expected slower rise in sales from the entertainment division. Microsoft now sees sales for that division rising 26 percent to 31 percent for the fiscal year instead of the previously forecast 33 percent to 46 percent rise. Since Windows is a higher margin product than the Xbox 360 game consoles, Microsoft was able to raise its profit outlook for its fiscal year ending June 30, even though its revenue forecast remained largely unchanged. For the fiscal year Microsoft narrowed its target revenue range to a range of $50.2 billion to $50.7 billion from the previous target of $50.0 billion to $50.9 billion, while its net earnings per share target rose to $1.45 to $1.47 from $1.43 to $1.46.
