 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) is expected to announce on Thursday that it is selling 18 magazines to the Swedish publisher Bonnier Group for more than $200 million, the New York Post said on Thursday. 

 That is less than the $300 million that Time Warner unit Time Inc. sought when it put the magazines up for sale last fall, the Post said. Time Warner's board is expected to approve the sale at its quarterly meeting, scheduled for Thursday, the Post reported. The deal would include magazines such as Field & Stream, Outdoor Life, TransWorld Snowboarding, Yachting, Salt Water Sportsman and 11 other magazines in the Time 4 Media Group, as well as the Parenting Group, the paper said. A Time official was not immediately available for comment.
