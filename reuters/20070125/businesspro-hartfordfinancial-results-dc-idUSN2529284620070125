 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. 
( HIG.N ), the fourth largest U.S. insurer by assets, said on 
Thursday that net income rose 68 percent in the fourth quarter, 
helped by record property casualty underwriting and low 
catastrophe costs. 

  Hartford said net earnings were $783 million or $2.42 a 
share, compared with $467 million or $1.51 a share in the 
year-earlier quarter.  Operating earnings for the life and property insurer, or 
earnings before investment gains and losses, were $768 million 
or $2.37 a share compared to $498 million or $1.61 a year 
earlier.  On that basis, analysts polled by Reuters Estimates 
expected the Hartford, Connecticut-based insurer to earn $2.27 
a share.  Hartford trimmed its 2007 guidance slightly to a range of 
$9.30 to $9.60 a share. Its previous view had been five cents 
higher at both ends. It said the reason for the change was due 
to a new accounting standard.  Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates expect Hartford to 
earn $9.64 a share in 2007.  In aftermarket trading, Hartford's shares rose to $92.36 
from their closing price of $91.90 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. In the last 12 months, Hartford's shares have risen 
about 10 percent, slightly less than the Standard & Poor's 500 
index.
