 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of online marketplace eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ) jumped 12 percent on Thursday on investor hopes that better-than-expected quarterly earnings signaled the start of a recovery for its core auction business. 

 EBay reported fourth-quarter results on Wednesday that beat Wall Street expectations on an apparent stabilization of growth for its auctions business, as well as strength in international markets such as Germany and Britain. Some analysts also cited the company's 2007 earnings view, which was at the high end of Wall Street estimates, as grounds for renewed optimism for the stock. "For the first time in five quarters, management's guidance was above the consensus estimate," wrote Prudential Equity analyst Mark Rowen in a research note. "It appears that the core business is turning the corner ... We continue to believe that eBay's long-term growth prospects remain quite robust." Rowen reiterated an "overweight" rating on the shares and a $40 price target. EBay, home to online payments service PayPal and Web-based calling company Skype, said fourth-quarter net profit rose 24 percent to $346.5 million, or 25 cents per share. Before special items, the company reported earnings of 31 cents per share, topping Wall Street's average forecasts by 3 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue grew 29 percent in the quarter from a year ago, a sign of more stable growth after declines in the last three years from a rate above 50 percent. EBay executives said some of the growth stemmed from steps the company has taken to trim the number of product listings consumers see when searching on its Internet auction, helping buyers find what they want more easily. Yet some analysts remained skeptical the results merited a major reentry for the share. "Though the outperformance was modest given the relatively low expectations heading into the event, it was outperformance, all the same, and offered very faint signs that facets of eBay's business may finally be stabilizing," wrote Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Derek Brown, who rates the share a "sell" but raised his price target to $29 from $25. "Nonetheless, it is not yet clear to us that eBay has fully 'righted the ship' or fundamentally altered the tone/trajectory of its business," he said in a research note. EBay shares were up $3.40, or more than 11 percent, at $33.40 on the Nasdaq after trading as high as $33.80 earlier in the session.
