 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Builder Beazer Homes USA Inc. ( BZH.N ) on Thursday reported a quarterly loss after charges for the declining value of land and lowered its forecast, saying it has yet to see inklings of a housing recovery. 

 The results helped send Beazer shares down $2.05, or 4.4 percent, to $44.96. For the first quarter ended December 31, the sixth-largest U.S. home builder reported a loss of $59 million, or $1.54 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $89.9 million, or $2.20 per share. Excluding the $119.9 million in charges, earnings were $15.9 million, or 41 cents per share, the company said. The charges also include $4 million in severance costs for slashing jobs by 25 percent. Analysts had expected Beazer to earn 25 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The Atlanta-based company said conditions remained extremely challenging during the quarter, with most markets seeing lower demand, higher cancellations, and significant discounting, which eats away at profit margins. "Given the likelihood of future charges, and its above-average order decline, we believe downside guidance to 2007 remains, which we believe should drive underperformance relative to its peers," J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Michael Rehaut said in a note. Total sales of $806 million were above expectations for $710 million. During the quarter, the company closed on the sale of 2,660 homes, down 31 percent, reflecting both weaker demand and higher cancellation rates. New orders during the quarter fell by half to 1,779, Beazer said. The company said it expects 2007 closings to come in at the bottom of its previously announced range of 12,000 to 13,500. "At this point we have yet to see any meaningful evidence of a sustainable recovery in the housing market," Beazer Chief Executive Office Officer Ian McCarthy said in a statement. Like other home builders, such as D.R. Horton Inc.( DHI.N ) and Meritage Homes Corp.( MTH.N ), Beazer said it was waiting until the spring home-buying season to get a reading on any evidence of a recovery. Horton and Meritage did not issue a forecast. However, Beazer lowered its forecast for earnings for fiscal 2007 ending September 30, to be $1.25 per share to $1.50 per share, before special charges. That's down from $3.65 per share, the company said it would earn if it reached the high end of its prior forecast for closings. Analysts on average expected $2.32 before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. (Additional reporting by Nick Zieminski and Christopher Kaufman)
