 NEW YORK/BOSTON  (Reuters) - German conglomerate Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) said on Wednesday it has agreed to buy industrial design software maker UGS Corp. for $3.5 billion and that it will sell shares in automotive engineering unit VDO. 

 Siemens said it planned an initial public offering of VDO, which had annual sales of 10 billion euros ($13 billion) in the last fiscal year. Siemens said it would hold a majority stake in VDO, but a spokesman declined further comment on the size of the stake. An IPO would give that business additional financial resources and flexibility for future growth, Siemens said. The company said the purchase of UGS would add industrial software for planning, design and simulation to the automation-technology portfolio of its factory-automation unit,  A&D. Plano, Texas-based UGS is owned by three private equity firms -- Bain Capital, Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus, which bought UGS from technology services provider Electronic Data Systems in March 2004 for $2.05 billion. A representative for UGS could not immediately be reached for comment. UGS sells software that manufacturers use to design complex products such as airplanes, automobiles and military systems. It had revenue of $1.15 billion in 2005, according to the company's Web site. Needham & Co. analyst Richard Davis said Siemens may see value in UGS because it can sell its software to automakers and other UGS customers that are also Siemens clients. "Siemens has historically had an interest in software," Davis said. The buyout firms, which took equal stakes in UGS, at the time called the deal the largest private equity investment made in a technology company. They said it wasn't a risky venture investment, since the software maker was a profitable business and a leader in its field. Fueled by cheap debt, a steady economy, and huge cash piles from investors, private equity firms are enjoying their most profitable period in more than six years. Private equity mergers and acquisitions have gone from around 5 percent of global mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to more than 20 percent in the last few years alone. So-called buyout firms finance their deals with a small portion of their own cash and borrow the rest. After holding onto the company for, on average, three to five years, they sell them, keeping a slice of the profit and giving the rest back to their institutional investors. Rivals of UGS include Parametric Technology Corp. ( PMTC.O ) and Dassault Systems SA. Siemens reports financial results on Thursday. Deutsche Bank said it advised the sellers of UGS.
