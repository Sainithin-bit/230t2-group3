 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) and Unilever ( ULVR.L ) ( UNc.AS ) said on Thursday that they will seek an agreement that could lead to Unilever outsourcing some of its technology operations to HP. 

 Under the terms of a memorandum signed by the companies HP may work on data center operations, server and database management and application hosting for Unilever's operations in the Americas, Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Turkey. Financial terms of the proposed arrangement were not disclosed. They hope to reach an agreement in the first half of this year, the companies said in a statement.
