 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Convergys Corp. ( CVG.N ), which runs call centers for other companies, is planning to get thousands of its staff working from home to keep a lid on rising wage costs. 

 The U.S.-based group is already piloting a home-working scheme in the United States and President and Chief Operating Office David Dougherty said on Thursday he aimed to export the idea to Asia, where the company has major operations. Convergys has 60,000 call center staff worldwide, including 12,000 in India and 8,000 in the Philippines. "I would like our next 60,000 call center agents to be home agents, whether those are in North America, India or the Philippines," Dougherty said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. "It's lower cost -- even though we actually pay that person, in some cases, a higher wage -- because you don't have the capital required to build a contact center." Dougherty said the almost universal access to broadband made the proposition very workable in the United States, while broadband deployment was also growing dramatically in its offshore locations. Industry analysts say wages pressures are intensifying across the call-centre industry, reflecting currently low U.S. unemployment levels and strong demand for staff elsewhere, particularly in India. Despite the upward pressure on costs, Dougherty said India remained a very appealing location, given its large pool of skilled, English-speaking labor. "The turnover is higher and the wages have gone up relative to when we went there, there is no question about it. Relative, though, to other alternatives, it still remains an attractive market for us," he said. Convergys, which also handles billing for telecom firms and other clients, said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter profit rose 90 percent on higher revenue from its services. The company reported net profit of $44.5 million, or 32 cents per share, on revenue up 8 percent at $720 million. It forecast 2007 earnings of more than $1.20 a share.
