 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday, bolstered by growth in Internet and wireless subscribers and said cost savings from its recent BellSouth purchase would be higher than forecast. 

 The news initially pushed up AT&T shares, but the stock ended the day down 0.22 percent at $36.79 as analysts said the results had already been priced in. The largest U.S. telecommunications company said profit, including its stake in Cingular Wireless but excluding merger-related costs and other special items, rose 38.5 percent from a year ago to $2.4 billion, or 61 cents a share. That beat by a penny the average analyst forecast of 60 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "The numbers are pretty good. They're managing margins and costs," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King. But he said most of the news was already factored into the shares and gave them a "sell" rating. AT&T shares rose 4 percent on Wednesday after Cingular said its quarterly profit had nearly quadrupled on strong subscriber growth. The stock rose 46 percent in 2006, making it one of the top-performing blue chips last year. Formed through a merger of SBC Communications Inc. and AT&T Corp. in 2005, the company has tried to offset declining sales of traditional telephone lines by cutting costs through mergers and pursuing growth in Internet and wireless services. AT&T closed its merger with BellSouth Corp. on December 29, reinforcing its position as the biggest U.S. phone company and bringing their mobile service joint venture, Cingular, under one roof. AT&T owned 60 percent of Cingular before the merger. The company said on Thursday it expects cost synergies from the BellSouth merger of $800 million to $1.2 billion in 2007, up from an earlier forecast of $500 million to $800 million. AT&T also raised its estimate of synergies from the BellSouth deal in 2008 and 2009 and now expects the net value of synergies to be around $22 billion, up from a previous estimate of $18 billion. It also expected more synergies from the SBC deal this year than it previously forecast. GREATER SCALE AT&T said fourth-quarter net income, including costs such as those related to recent mergers, rose 17.1 percent from a year earlier to $1.9 billion, or 50 cents per share. It expects to deliver double-digit percentage growth in adjusted earnings per share in 2007 and 2008. The company said high-speed Internet subscribers totaled 8.5 million, up 23.4 percent from a year earlier. Traditional, primary consumer lines fell by 227,000 in the fourth quarter. Chief Financial Officer Rick Lindner said the new savings forecasts stemmed mostly from lower operating expenses and capital spending. He said AT&T was also getting better prices for network equipment due to its greater market clout. But Todd Rethemeier, an analyst at Soleil Securities, said it would take more than cost cuts to push the shares higher. He has a "hold" rating and $34 price target. "With the cost-cutting alone it's not going to go much higher. It's going to take real growth," he said. AT&T recently launched an advanced, Internet-based video service named U-Verse to fend off cable companies, which have been winning subscribers by packaging phone and Internet services with cable television. But it has introduced the service to only 11 markets so far, compared with previous plans for 15 markets by end-2006. "The biggest challenge has been putting all of the components together and making sure it results in a stable platform and one that consistently performs well," Lindner told Reuters. He dismissed suggestions by analysts the company faced technological problems with the roll-out. The U-Verse deployment -- which requires fiber networks and new equipment -- will dilute earnings by 9 cents to 11 cents per share this year, compared with 6 cents in 2006, AT&T said. AT&T also reported BellSouth quarterly results, with adjusted earnings per share rising 28.3 percent to 68 cents. The company reiterated plans to finish buying back $10 billion in shares in 2007. It bought 39 million of its shares for $1.3 billion, bringing its 2006 total to $2.7 billion.
