 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eddie Bauer EBHI.O said on Thursday that it delayed a shareholder meeting to vote on a $286 million buyout plan after finding tax accounting errors. 

 The errors cover 2005 and earlier years, the outdoor clothing maker said. They relate to the determination of deferred tax assets and goodwill on its balance sheets, arising from the treatment of leasehold improvements, it added. Eddie Bauer is working with independent auditor BDO Seidman to assess the financial impact and determine whether it will have to restate, it said. The company said the meeting, scheduled for Thursday, will be held at 1130 ET (1630 GMT) on February 8 in Bellevue, Washington. Eddie Bauer said in November that it agreed to be sold to private-equity firms Sun Capital Partners and Golden Gate Capital for $9.25 per share in cash, or $286 million, plus the assumption of $328 million in debt.
