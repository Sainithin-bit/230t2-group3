 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Robust demand for mobile phones in emerging markets lifted Nokia's ( NOK1V.HE ) fourth-quarter sales and profits above almost all analysts' forecasts, sending the shares of the world's top handset maker sharply higher. 

 The Finnish company, which makes more than one in every three handsets sold globally, shipped a record 106 million phones at sharply lower average prices, but nevertheless turned out a higher profit as a result of its scale. Nokia's earnings per share rose to 0.32 euros from 0.25 a year ago, compared with an average forecast of 0.28 euros in a Reuters poll of 37 analysts, where estimates ranged from 0.25 to 0.33 euros. The reported EPS figure included 0.02 euros of one-off gains, which were not expected by analysts. Nokia shares rose 6.7 percent after the report to 16.52 euros, pulling the DJ Stoxx European technology index .SX8P 2.7 percent higher and valuing Europe's top tech stock at 66 billion euros. "EPS was clearly better than expected, which is the main reason why the share is up. The market was also worried about worse margins for mobile phones, which didn't materialize," Johan Strandberg, Sweden's SEB Asset Management. Hannu Rauhala at Oko Bank said: "It is good that the margins improved, even though the average sales price fell." Revenues rose 13 percent to 11.7 billion euros ($15.22 billion), beating analysts' average projection of 11.57 billion. After an implosion of Motorola's MOT.N profit due to cheaper phones, investors were braced for bad news from Nokia, but the Finnish company actually improved its margins and is now almost 4 times more profitable than its main rival. Profits at Nokia's key Mobile Phones unit rose to 1.26 billion euros, at the top end of expectations in the poll. "Last week Motorola reported a clear operating profit decline, meanwhile Nokia's low end, that is the Mobile Phones division, reported significant growth in the same margins. This is what the market is following," said Ilkka Rauvola at Evli. PRICES SLIP Nokia said the average sale price of its phones fell to 89 euros in the three-month period covering Christmas, compared with 99 euros in the year-ago period and against analysts' average expectation of 92 euros and a range from 87 to 95 euros. Nokia cited strong growth of lower-end products as the main reason for the lower prices, but in October the company also cut prices of several more expensive models, like those with high-quality cameras and music players. Nokia's 106 million handsets sold in the quarter, up 26 percent on a year ago, extended its market share to 35.2 percent versus 34.3 percent in the third quarter, market research group Strategy Analytics said. Analysts had on average forecast 103 million phones. The 6 percent sales growth of Nokia's more expensive multimedia phones was lower than the expected 24 percent growth, and earnings also fell short, but analysts shrugged it off as the main focus was on the mainstream mobile phone unit, which generates almost four times more revenues. "The Multimedia unit was a slight disappointment, (but) Nokia's scale and operating model are beyond compare in this business," said analyst Karri Rinta from Handelsbanken. Nokia's mobile networks unit, which is merging with that of Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ), turned in a disappointing operating profit of 129 million euros against expectations for 185 million mostly due to higher integration charges. Revenues were above expectations, but Nokia echoed comments from rival Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA that sales were slow in North America and that it faced overall pricing pressure. The company continued to generate cash at a steady rate, and after returning 4.9 billion euros to shareholders in 2006 through dividends and share buybacks, it said it planned to buy another 4 billion euros of shares this year. Nokia also proposed to pay a dividend of 0.43 euros per share for 2006, up from 0.37 euros a year ago. Its gross margin slipped to 32.4 percent from 34.1 percent, falling for an 11th consecutive quarter, but beating the average of analysts' forecasts of 31.9 percent.
