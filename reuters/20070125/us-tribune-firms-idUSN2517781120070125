 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N is not enthusiastic about three proposals bidding on some or all of the company's assets, and has gone back to firms that did due diligence but did not bid to see if they are willing to make an offer, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. 

 One of the groups the newspaper publisher and broadcaster approached again was a consortium including private-equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners, Providence Equity Partners Inc., and Apollo Advisors LP, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. The group is still not interested in bidding, the Journal said, citing sources. Of the three offers it received, Tribune appears to slightly favor one from billionaire investors Eli Broad and Ronald Burkle, and is expected to ask for better terms, the Journal said. Burkle and Broad were exploring ways to tweak their proposal to make it more attractive to the company, a person familiar with the situation told the Journal. The board's special committee overseeing the auction is scheduled to meet again this weekend, the paper added. A Tribune spokesman declined to comment. Representatives of Broad and Burkle and officials at the three private-equity firms were not immediately available for comment.
