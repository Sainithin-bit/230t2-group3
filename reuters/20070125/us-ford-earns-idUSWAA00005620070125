 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Thursday capped the worst year in its 103-year history with a wider-than-expected fourth-quarter loss and said it would cut production this quarter and lose market share through September. 

 The No. 2 U.S. automaker posted a fourth-quarter net loss of almost $5.8 billion, or $3.05 per share, on declining truck sales and charges for employee buyouts. That compared to a loss of $74 million, or 4 cents per share, a year ago. Ford's loss from continuing operations was $1.10 a share, wider than the average Wall Street analyst expectation for a loss of 94 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. For the full year, Ford posted a record loss of $12.7 billion, leaping past the company's previous record net loss of $7.39 billion in 1992 when the industry was reeling from the aftermath of a recession in the U.S. economy. Ford, like its Detroit-based rivals, was hit hard in 2006 as high gas prices and interest rates drove consumers away from the trucks and sport utility vehicles that had accounted for most of its sales and profits. "The Explorer and F-Series were both down significantly, and those were high-volume products with the best margins in Ford's portfolio," Argus Research analyst Kevin Tynan said. Ford shares rose 12 cents to $8.32 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's bonds also gained. Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally told analysts the automaker was slightly ahead on its restructuring plan. "We recognize the position we are in and we are taking the appropriate steps to confront the issues we are facing," he said on a conference call. "We have a plan and we are on track to deliver it." Despite its record loss, analysts said Ford had burned through less cash in its troubled auto operations than expected in the past quarter, an outcome some called encouraging. "For the foreseeable future, the Ford story is less about quarterly (earnings) and more about liquidity, cash flow, and restructuring," Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold said in a note for clients. Ford's auto operations burned through $1.8 billion in cash in the fourth quarter, less than the $3 billion Nesvold said he had expected. J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel also said that while analysts might lower 2007 forecasts for Ford after the fourth quarter result, the "market may be comforted by what seems like a better-than-expected cash burn." RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $3.7 BILLION Ford, which is in the early stages of a four-year turnaround plan that includes closing 16 plants and cutting up to 45,000 jobs, said charges reduced fourth-quarter results by $3.7 billion after taxes, or $1.95 per share. Ford said its U.S. market share would fall through the third quarter as it pulls back from sales to car rental companies and other fleet operators. It ended 2006 with a market share of just over 17 percent. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker also said production would be down through the first half of the year but rise year-over-year in the second half. Ford cut its previously announced first-quarter production target in North America by 10,000 units to 740,000 vehicles, a 15.5 percent decline from the same quarter a year ago. Fourth-quarter revenue totaled $40.3 billion, down from $46.3 billion from the same period a year ago. Auto sales were $36 billion, down from $40.7 billion from a year earlier. Ford repeated that its cash burn, including restructuring expenses, would be about $17 billion between 2007 and 2009, with $8.5 billion of that outflow this year. Last month, the automaker took the unprecedented step of mortgaging assets, including its U.S. plants, to borrow over $23 billion to fund its expected cash burn. The company projected that its capital spending would be about $7 billion in 2007. Ford expects U.S. industry wide auto sales would total about 16.8 million units in 2007 with overall incentive spending higher, which would imply a roughly flat U.S. market. Some analysts have challenged that outlook as too rosy in light of a slowing U.S. economy. Said Kevin Tynan of Argus Research: "I think the organic demand would lead you to believe the market will be down." Ford cut North American production 22 percent in the fourth quarter and completed a buyout offer with unionized factory workers that cut 38,000 jobs. Its U.S. sales dropped 8 percent drop for the year. Ford's 8-percent 10-year notes issued in December rose 25 cents per $100 face value to $99.625, according to trades reported on MarketAxess.
