 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) has cut its fiscal year forecast for Xbox 360 video game console shipments to 12 million from a previous target of 13 million to 15 million, Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said on Thursday. 

 "We are just being cautious about the second half. It was always going to be a slow half. We've done very well in the first half. There is a reasonable amount of inventory in the channel," Liddell said in an interview with Reuters. "The healthy inventory that we've seen is one of the factors behind what we're looking for in the second half," he added on a conference call with analysts. Microsoft's fiscal year ends on June 30. The Xbox 360 made its debut in November 2005, roughly a year ahead of machines from rivals Sony Corp. ( 6758.T )( SNE.N ) and Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS The company said it had shipped 10.4 million units by the end of 2006, beating internal targets. Microsoft's numbers reflect units "sold into retail," which refers to units in transit, units sitting in store inventories and machines sold to consumers.
