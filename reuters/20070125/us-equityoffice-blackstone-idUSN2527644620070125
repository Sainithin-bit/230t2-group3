 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone Group raised its bid for Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N to $22.4 billion on Thursday, topping a roughly $21.6 billion offer led by Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) and raising the stakes in the largest-ever battle for a real estate investment trust. 

 Blackstone raised its cash bid to $54 a share from $48.50. The Vornado group offered $52 a share in cash and Vornado stock. Including debt, Blackstone's offer is valued at $38.3 billion, which would make it one of the biggest leveraged buyouts ever. Experts said the bidding for Equity Office, founded more than 30 years ago by real estate magnate Sam Zell, could go even higher as the competing groups battle for the biggest owner of U.S. office buildings outside the federal government. Equity Office shares rose almost 4 percent to $54.80. A termination fee of $200 million payable to Blackstone under certain circumstances has been increased to $500 million. Equity Office's board of trustees approved the increased Blackstone deal because it exceeded the rival offer by $2 a share and offered greater certainty of closing. In addition, Equity Office said the higher termination fee would not preclude a revised bid from the Vornado group or an offer from any other potential bidder. "You've got a high-stakes game of poker here and the pot is a very attractive group of assets," said Shawn Campbell, principal with Campbell Asset Management, which sold its Equity Office shares when Blackstone made its first bid. "Equity Office has the largest single concentrated position of 'A' quality office space across all the major markets in the United States." VOTE A special meeting of Equity Office shareholders to vote on the Blackstone deal remains scheduled for February 5 and completion of the deal is expected on or about February 8, subject to shareholder approval. "Our offer is now materially superior on price, timing, form of consideration and certainty," said Blackstone spokesman John Ford. Chicago-based Equity Office said it will continue to provide diligence information to the Vornado group so that the group will be able, if it wants, to submit another proposal by January 31. "Vornado is continuing to conduct its due diligence and will respond at the appropriate time," said a spokeswoman for Vornado. The Vornado group, whose offer hinges on several conditions, includes Barry Sternlicht of Starwood Capital Group Global LLC and Neil Bluhm of Walton Street Capital LLC. The bidding frenzy for Equity Office continues a spate of mergers in real estate. Global real estate mergers reached a record $414.3 billion in 2006, up 66 percent on 2005, according to data provider Dealogic. "It's cheaper to buy than it is to build. That's why you're seeing so much interest and I think it could go higher than $54," added Campbell. RISK Asset manager Cohen & Steers, a major Equity Office shareholder, favors the Vornado group because of its track record in real estate. Martin Cohen, co-chief executive of Cohen & Steers, said: "I would still love to see Vornado own the assets." One arbitrage investor said Blackstone is likely to win because it can close on the deal earlier than Vornado. He said any offer from the Vornado group accepted by Equity Office would likely have to be approved by shareholders of both real estate investment trusts, which could take months. "In the meantime there's risk, and if you're an Equity Office shareholder and something happens along the way, then Vornado could walk away," said the arbitrage investor, who declined to be named. Blackstone needs only Equity Office shareholder approval. Equity Office in 2001 became the first REIT to join the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . Private equity firms have been snapping up real estate companies, which they view as undervalued, in hopes of cashing in later on surging prices for commercial properties. Unlike publicly traded REITs, private buyers can finance their purchases by using 90 percent debt or more, allowing them to boost the return on their own money they use.
