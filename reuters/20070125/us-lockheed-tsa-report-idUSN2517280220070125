 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Security Administration has selected Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) to provide high-tech identification cards at ports, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the choice. 

 The contract, worth about $70 million, would include providing cards to 850,000 maritime workers, the newspaper reported. A TSA spokesman declined to confirm a selection had been made but said an announcement was imminent, the report said. A Lockheed spokeswoman referred questions to TSA, it said. Other competitors for the contract included BearingPoint BE.N, according to the newspaper.
