 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ) said on Wednesday quarterly profit rose 24 percent, as moves to stabilize its core auctions business showed signs of taking hold, leading its shares to surge 13 percent. 

 Fourth-quarter revenue rose 29 percent, fueled by demand for hard-to-find Sony and Nintendo gaming consoles and strengthening business in international markets such as Germany and Britain. That reassured investors worried by three years of slowing revenue growth for the online marketplace. "EBay is at the early stages of a multi-quarter period of stabilizing-to-accelerating growth," Goldman Sachs analyst Anthony Noto wrote in a research note to investors. "We expect eBay shares to benefit from strong results, higher estimates and likely multiple expansion given accelerating gross merchandise volume growth and improved margins," he wrote. Multiple expansion is investor short-hand for higher stock valuations as earnings growth improves. Gross merchandise volume, the total value of goods and services sold on eBay auction sites, grew 20 percent to $14.4 billion. By contrast, that volume figure grew 17 percent, year-over-year, in the third quarter of 2006. Fourth-quarter net income rose to $346.5 million, or 25 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter's $279.2 million, or 20 cents a diluted share. Excluding one-time items, net income rose 27 percent to $431 million, or 31 cents per share, topping Wall Street's consensus forecast by 3 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue of $1.72 billion, up 29 percent from a year earlier, marks a steadying of eBay's growth rate, which has fallen over the past three years from above 50 percent. Analysts, on average, had expected growth of only 25 percent. The San Jose, California-based company had taken steps in recent months to trim the number of listings consumers see when searching for products on eBay auctions. Executives said this helped boost revenues by helping buyers find what they wanted. "(From) third quarter to fourth quarter we saw a reacceleration of growth driven by better-quality inventories and higher conversion rates," Chief Financial Officer Bob Swan said in an interview of efforts to turn shoppers into buyers. International revenues, which account for nearly half of sales, grew 40 percent year-to-year, marking steady acceleration in growth from a 35 percent rate in early 2006. WAITING FOR SKYPE TO PAY OFF Despite progress in other areas, Chief Executive Meg Whitman told investors on a conference call that eBay has been disappointed at the pace at which Skype, a Web-based calling company it acquired in 2005, is growing its revenue. Skype's registered user numbers tripled in the past year to 171 million at the end of 2006, but the conversion of users of its free services into paying customers is slow. Its 2006 revenue of $195 million fell shy of eBay's $200 million goal. "While Skype continues to experience stellar growth in terms of its user and adoption rates, the monetization efforts we outlined at the time of the acquisition are not developing as quickly as we had hoped," Whitman said. EBay said it expected first-quarter net revenue of $1.67 billion to $1.72 billion, in the middle of current estimates. It sees first-quarter diluted earnings per share, excluding one-time items, at 28 cents to 30 cents, in line with analysts' forecasts. For 2007, eBay said it expected revenue from $7.05 billion to $7.30 billion, also in line with expectations. Full-year earnings, excluding one-time items, are expected at $1.25 to $1.29 per share, the company said. That's slightly above a current consensus of $1.24 a share and in the upper half of current forecasts ranging from $1.19 to $1.32. Earnings per share benefited from a 1.9 percent reduction in the number of shares outstanding as eBay stepped up its stock repurchases, buying $1.7 billion worth in the past five months. Company directors have authorized another $2 billion in buybacks over two years. The shares surged 13.2 percent to $33.98 in extended trade after the results on Wednesday, adding to a 4.8 percent rise in the Nasdaq regular session ahead of the news.
