 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) posted a 4.5 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by sales of chips for high-end cell phones, and affirmed its 2007 outlook, reassuring investors after disappointing views from rivals. 

 The news on Wednesday pushed Qualcomm shares up more than 2 percent in after-hours trading. Analysts were cheered by its estimate of average cell phone selling prices (ASP) at $210 in 2007, higher than an earlier view of $205. "I think there were fears going in that the company might reduce guidance for the year," said Prudential analyst Inder Singh. "And counter to what we've been hearing from most of their peers in the industry, handset ASP estimates at Qualcomm appear to be going up and not down." Motorola Inc. MOT.N, the world's No. 2 mobile phone maker, cited low phone prices for its weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results. Chip supplier Texas Instruments Inc. TXN.N blamed part of its own weak earnings and outlook on the growth of demand for low-end mobile phones. Qualcomm said net profit rose to $648 million, or 38 cents per diluted share, for its fiscal first quarter ended December 31, from $620 million, or 36 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 16 percent to $2.02 billion. Profit was 43 cents a share, before items such as results from its investment arm, topping the 42-cent average of analysts' forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates. "It was very solid earnings." said Sanford Bernstein analyst Paul Sagawa. Qualcomm is the biggest supplier of chips based on CDMA, a wireless technology popular in the United States. It also sells technology licenses and chips based on W-CDMA, a mobile phone standard gaining popularity in Europe. OUTLOOK REASSURES Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer William Keitel said he saw demand for more-expensive phones with data features such as video games and music players, as well as strong demand in emerging markets where lower-cost phones are popular. "From the outset, I'd been expecting good growth in developing world markets but at the same time we're seeing an increasing demand for data-featured phones," he said. "As you start getting data features into phones the average selling price tends to increase. That's what's giving us a little bit more optimism than what we previously had for the coming year ... for CDMA-based technologies," he said. Qualcomm forecast second-quarter earnings of 42 cents to 44 cents a share on revenue of $2 billion to $2.1 billion, excluding investment results. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 44 cents a share on revenue of $2.097 billion. Qualcomm affirmed its forecast for fiscal 2007 earnings of $1.72 to $1.77 per share, excluding its investment arm and other items, on revenue of $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion. Sanford Bernstein's Sagawa said the affirmation reassured investors that Qualcomm was bullish about demand for third generation (3G) high-speed data phones after Texas Instruments' "more cautious tone about 3G" raised some concern. Qualcomm, which is embroiled in several legal disputes, said its financial guidance includes hefty legal charges. Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) and Qualcomm have been trading multiple patent-infringement lawsuits. Qualcomm also faces regulatory complaints in Europe from several rivals over its competitive practices. It is also in negotiations with Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) ( NOK.N ), the No. 1 mobile maker, over a technology license pact that expires in April. Shares rose 2.4 percent in post-market trade to $39.53, from its close of $38.62 on Nasdaq.
