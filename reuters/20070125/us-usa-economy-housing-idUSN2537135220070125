 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The pace of existing home sales slipped 0.8 percent in December, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday, leaving in doubt whether the worst of a housing slump has passed. 

 Despite the sales decline, the inventory of homes for sale fell 7.9 percent to 3.508 million units at the end of December. Home sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.22 million. Analysts had expected home resales to fall to a 6.25 million-unit pace from the 6.28 million-unit rate initially reported for November. The national median home price of existing homes was unchanged from a year earlier, holding at $222,000. For all of 2006, home sales slipped 8.4 percent, the sharpest decline since 1989, when they fell 14.8 percent. NAR Chief Economist David Lereah said December's data was a sign the market for existing homes has stabilized. "It appears that we have established a bottom," he said, noting the pace of existing home sales has "hovered around" the 6.21 million pace set in September. Some other economists, however, think the U.S. housing market has further to fall. "The bottom won't be hit until spring or summer," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. "I think this won't hit bottom until those sales fall below 6 million at an annual rate. ... There's too much inventory around." Home sales were down 9.1 percent in the West, Lereah said, and dragged down the national numbers. Home sales were off 2.8 percent in the Northeast. Sales rose 0.8 percent in the South and were up 4.3 percent in the Midwest.
