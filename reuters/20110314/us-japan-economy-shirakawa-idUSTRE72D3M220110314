 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan supplied an additional 74 billion yen ($903 million) on Monday to financial institutions operating in areas hit by Friday's massive earthquake. 

 It said the move was at the companies' request. The BOJ also said no glitches were reported in major financial institutions' system connection to the central bank on Monday.     (Reporting by Rie Ishiguro; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
