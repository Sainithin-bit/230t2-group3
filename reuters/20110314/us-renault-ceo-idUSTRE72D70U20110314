 PARIS  (Reuters) - Renault Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn refused to accept the resignation of Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata at a board meeting on Monday over an unfounded spying probe. 

 Renault said it planned to reinstate and compensate three executives wrongly fired in January over false industrial espionage allegations. Ghosn and Pelata plan to give up their 2010 bonuses and profits from 2011 stock options after they had to apologize publicly to the three men earlier on Monday, Renault said in a statement.
