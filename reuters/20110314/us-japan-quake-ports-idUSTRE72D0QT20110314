 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo and all ports south of Japan's capital were operating normally, while the rest were being assessed for damage after last week's massive earthquake and tsunami, a shipowner and a port official said on Monday. 

 All Japanese ports were temporarily closed on Friday after the world's third largest consumer of commodities was hit by an 8.9 magnitude quake and tsunami, which likely killed more than 10,000 people. The closure of the ports was expected to cost Japan more than $3.4 billion in lost seaborne trade each day, according to shipping trade publication Lloyd's List. "Ports south of Tokyo are all operational, ports north of Tokyo are still under evaluation," said a shipowner based in Tokyo. The port of Tokyo has also resumed normal operations, a port official said. Japan is urgently working to reopen its ports to bring in the necessary aid and materials to rebuild devastated regions. Maritime trade in the world's No. 3 economy totaled $1.5 trillion last year, according to Lloyd's List Intelligence.
