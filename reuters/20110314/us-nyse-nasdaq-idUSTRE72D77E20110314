 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq OMX Group Inc ( NDAQ.O ) is closer to making a counter-bid for NYSE Euronext NYX.N, a source familiar with the situation said, a move that would challenge the Big Board's blockbuster deal with Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) by merging two of Wall Street's fiercest rivals. 

 Under the offer being contemplated, Nasdaq would finance the transaction with up to $5 billion in debt and sell NYSE's profitable Liffe derivatives business to IntercontinentalExchange Inc ( ICE.N ), the source said on Monday. An offer could come as early as this week, the source said. Bringing Nasdaq and NYSE together would create a stock-trading powerhouse in the United States and Europe that also dominates U.S. options and listings businesses. It would be a bold move by Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld, and, if successful, would redraw the global exchange map. Any bid would follow weeks of speculation that Nasdaq -- seen as the odd man out amid a global exchanges mergers frenzy -- would jump into the fray with its own bid for an exchange operator. "When you see possible bidding wars there's a reason for it, and exchanges have been making piles of money from the high-frequency traders," said Richard Gates, portfolio manager of TFS Market Neutral Fund, which has about $1.4 billion in assets. Nasdaq, NYSE Euronext and Germany's Deutsche Boerse declined to comment. ICE was not immediately available for comment. The source declined to be named because the talks are not public. A source familiar with the situation told Reuters last month that Nasdaq was exploring options that include teaming up with a partner like ICE, a derivatives and clearing specialist, on a rival bid for NYSE. [ID:nN22296944] There is a relatively steep 250 million euro ($347.5 million) termination fee on Deutsche Boerse's friendly offer for NYSE Euronext, worth about $10.2 billion. In a flurry last month, Deutsche Boerse agreed to buy NYSE, the London Stock Exchange Group Plc ( LSE.L ) announced a deal to take over Canadian stock market operator TMX Group ( X.TO ), and BATS Global Markets said it will buy peer Chi-X Europe. The frenetic activity revived a consolidation wave that last swept exchanges between 2006 and 2008 and raised some thorny questions over whether politicians and regulators would ultimately block them. Pressure is mounting on global bourses to seek partnerships to counter the threat from bigger rivals and alternative trading platforms, and to cut costs. Earlier on Monday, deal publication DealReporter reported Nasdaq is in advanced talks with lenders about funding a hostile bid. The exchange operator would finance the bid with debt from banks led by Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and $5 billion in asset sales, DealReporter said. Bank of America declined to comment. With many of the planned mergers driven by a need to ramp up profitable derivatives trading, such a move by Nasdaq to expand in its core, low-margin, stock-trading business could raise questions for shareholders. "I would be shocked if this happened," Sang Lee, managing partner specializing in market structure at Boston consultancy Aite Group, said of a possible Nasdaq-NYSE tie-up. "If the game is to create a viable, long-term business that can compete globally, doing something like this is probably a step backward," he said. Shares of NYSE Euronext closed up 4.5 percent at $36.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. NYSE Euronext option activity also heated up this afternoon. "The March $38 and $39 calls have received the majority of the attention with investors making a four-day bet that any new bid would come before this Friday's expiration and be higher than the chosen strike price," said Patrick Mortimer, director of options trading at New Hope, Pennsylvania-based Pipeline Trading Systems. Nasdaq's shares closed down 3 percent at $26.37 on Nasdaq, while ICE was off 1 percent at $124.79 on the New York Stock Exchange.
