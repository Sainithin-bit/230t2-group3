 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's financial institutions have not reported funding problems or system glitches, the Bank of Japan said on Monday, the first business day after Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit northeastern Japan. 

 Financial institutions including those in affected areas have had no problems connecting to the BOJ, banking and private settlement systems, the BOJ said. (Reporting by Rie Ishiguro; Editing by  Nathan Layne )
