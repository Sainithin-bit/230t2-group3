 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The impact from Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami looks to be worse than originally expected but there are no signs yet of an immediate fiscal crisis, Moody's Investors Service said on Monday. 

 "The economic consequences appear to be greater than we perhaps originally expected on Friday," Tom Byrne, Moody's senior vice president, told Reuters Insider in an interview. Byrne said that it looks like the death toll from Friday's disaster will be higher than for the earthquake that hit Kobe in 1995. However, he said it remains to be seen whether the economic damage would be as bad as the 1995 disaster, which cost between $100 billion and $150 billion. "If it's as bad as Kobe, then it's pretty serious and if it's worse than Kobe then we're in unchartered territory," he said. POSSIBLE OVERSHOOTING Despite the damage, Byrne stressed there were no signs yet that the country was facing an immediate fiscal crisis. "We still see that the market will readily fund the government right now," he said. However, he added that the Japanese government's target of issuing 44 trillion yen ($537 billion) in domestic bonds this year would most likely be overshot due to funding needed for reconstruction. He said that how the Japanese government bond market reacts in the coming weeks to additional issuance could be crucial. "On the downside, it could move the day of reckoning a bit closer, where the market hesitates to finance very readily JGBs and they put on a risk premium because the amount of debt will increase," he said. Moody's last month changed its outlook on its Aa2 sovereign rating for Japan to "negative" from "stable," warning that a downgrade was likely if the government fails to bring its ballooning public debt under control. Byrne said he saw no need to alter that rating. "We have a negative outlook, that still stands," he said. "At least the way we see things presently, our assessment hasn't changed much. In the near-term, Japan can cope with its fiscal problems - issue debt at high prices and low yields - and that hasn't changed yet." Japan's struggle to put a lid on the ever-rising public debt, which at double the size of the $5 trillion economy is the biggest among leading nations, has triggered a Standard & Poor's rating cut and a slew of warnings from other rating agencies. On the corporate side, Byrne said Moody's was concerned about power companies such as TEPCO, refining companies, insurers and a rail operator in the aftermath of the earthquake. He said the mega Japanese banks "seem to be okay" because they did not have much direct exposure to the worst-hit area in northern Japan, although some regional banks could be affected. Byrne added that the yen currency could strengthen as it did in the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake as the Japanese government liquidated overseas assets to fund reconstruction.
