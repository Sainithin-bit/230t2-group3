 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of the effect on manufacturers, energy firms and other companies of the devastating earthquake and tsunami that struck the northeast coast of Japan last Friday. 

 NUCLEAR - A second hydrogen explosion occurred at the Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, some 240 km (150 miles) north of Tokyo, injuring 11 people, but the government said that the reactor container at the No.3 reactor was most likely intact. - The coolant water level at the No.2 reactor was falling, Japan's nuclear safety agency said, indicating that the reactor may be in danger of overheating with nuclear fuel inside the core pressure vessel melting, which is what may already have happened in the No.1 and No.3 reactors. - TEPCO has been trying to release built-up pressure in containment vessels of the three reactors and add more water after cooling systems and backup systems were damaged by the quake. To speed up cooling, TEPCO had been pumping sea water and adding boric acid into the reactors, which effectively prevented the reactors from reaching "criticality", or an uncontrolled nuclear reaction. - Tens of thousands of people are being evacuated from the vicinity and tested for radiation exposure, but evacuation efforts have been hampered by road damage and logistics. A government official said that 22 people had been confirmed to have suffered radiation contamination and up to 190 may have been exposed. - Seven boiling water reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant and the neighboring Fukushima Daini plant, both operated by TEPCO, automatically shut down soon after the quake and subsequent tsunami on Friday. The other three units had been under planned maintenance. - A total of 11 reactors at four nuclear plants operated by three firms shut down automatically after the quake, reducing the amount of nuclear power generation capacity in operation to 25,622 megawatts, or 52.3 percent of Japan's total, Reuters calculations show. - Tohoku Electric Power Co said on Friday that all three reactors at its Onagawa nuclear plant on the northeast coast shut down automatically after the quake but all were safely cooled down on Saturday. - Japan Atomic Power Co said on Monday that it expected the 1,100-megawatt Tokai Daini nuclear plant, the closest to Tokyo, to be safely cooled down by Tuesday morning. Following is a list of the manufacturers and the current status of reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi and Daini plants, excluding those under planned maintenance when the quake struck. Generation capacity is shown in megawatts. MANUFACTURING - Suzuki Motor Corp said it had halted production at all six of its factories in Japan at least until March 16. Suzuki made 69,170 vehicles in January in Japan, where it produced 30 percent of its cars. - Nikon Corp said five of the precision equipment maker's production sites had halted operations on Monday, and that some equipment may have been damaged. - Toyota Motor Co said it had halted production at all its 12 factories in Japan at least until March 16. A three-day production halt would reduce output by 40,000 vehicles ]. Toyota made 234,045 vehicles in January in Japan, where it produced 38 percent of its cars. - Canon said it did not know when it could resume production at three plants that sustained serious damage in the quake, while TEPCO's schedule of planned power outages was not clear. Of the three factories, one makes lenses, another makes inkjet printers and a third produces equipment for manufacturing LCD screens. - Honda Motor Co said it planned to suspend all production in Japan at least until March 20. Honda kept all of its factories closed on Monday, except for a motorcycle plant on the southern island of Kyushu, although that will also be shut from Tuesday. Honda manufactured 69,170 cars in January in Japan, where it made 24 percent of its cars. - Nissan Motor Co halted production at all four of its car assembly factories in Japan and was trying to secure a supply of parts and repair facilities before deciding on resumption, the company said. Nissan made 81,851 cars in January in Japan, where it manufactured 23 percent of its vehicles. - Fuji Heavy Industries Co said all five of its car and car parts-related plants for its Subaru-brand vehicles in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, would be closed at least until March 20. - Panasonic Corp said continuing aftershocks were preventing it from inspecting two factories in northern Japan, one making optical pick-ups and other electronic parts, and another making digital cameras and audio equipment. A spokesman said the two locations likely lacked proper power and water supply. - Sony Corp said that, of the eight factories where operations were suspended, the four in Miyagi were in serious condition, with one factory, which makes optical film, flooded. Sony is mainly making maintenance checks at three factories that make lithium ion batteries. - Toshiba said production had been halted at an Iwate Prefecture factory making System LSI chips used in microprocessors and image sensors. The company has begun work on bringing the factory back on line, but does not know when production will resume. - Shin-Etsu Chemical, the world's top maker of silicon wafers used to make semiconductors, had suspended operations at three factories and does not know when the lines will come back on line. It plans to boost production at other factories to help make up lost production, especially on its 300-millimetre wafer production. UTILITIES - Power outages occurred in some areas covered by Tokyo Electric Power Co and Tohoku Electric Power Co. - Tokyo Electric selected five areas with electricity demand of 5 million kilowatts each for rolling blackouts of three hours each, beginning on Monday. - Tohoku Electric decided on Monday to follow suit and start similar rolling blackouts. - Electric Power Development (J-Power) halted operations at its 600-megawatt Isogo No.2 thermal plant in Yokohama on Friday after the quake but resumed normal operation on Saturday, a spokesman said. The 600-MW No.1 plant is shut for regular maintenance. - Tokyo Gas Co said it had stopped supplying gas to more than 35,000 households and facilities. - Tokyo Electric Power said it had restarted operations at a 350 MW oil-fired unit in Tokyo. Other companies said they had halted plants in the region as workers were evacuated following tsunami warnings or due to power outages. They include Asahi Kasei Corp, GlaxoSmithKline, JSR, Nestle, Nippon Paper Group, Sapporo Breweries Ltd and Morinaga Milk Industry. REFINERIES - Cosmo Oil said a fire had broken out near an LPG tank at its Chiba refinery and had not been extinguished by Monday, although the intensity had eased. A company official denied that rain could spread harmful chemicals from the fire. - JX Holdings said a fire at its Sendai refinery originated from a land oil product shipping facility nearby, not an LPG tank as feared earlier. It has declared force majeure on its refined product supplies as its stocks were depleted and distribution was disrupted. The company said it was working to boost output at its refineries that were still operating and diverting products to domestic use instead of exports to meet a supply shortfall. - Maruzen Petrochemical shut its sole naphtha cracker in Chiba, east of Tokyo, with capacity to produce 480,000 tonnes per year of ethylene, after the earthquake. Maruzen's Keiyo Ethylene unit kept operating a 690,000 tonne per year naphtha cracker in Chiba after the quake. - Kyokuto Petroleum closed its 175,000 barrels per day Chiba refinery after the quake. - JX Holdings shut its 404,000 tonnes per year Kawasaki naphtha cracker near Tokyo on Friday after the quake. - Tonengeneral said on Monday it was preparing to restart the main units at its 335,000-bpd Kawasaki refinery near Tokyo after a shutdown in the wake of the quake. - Mitsubishi Chemical halted two naphtha crackers at its Kashima plant after a power outage. - AOC Holdings said its 140,000-bpd Sodegaura refinery was still operating but it had cut runs of two fluid catalytic cracking units. METALS - Sumitomo Metal Industries said its main Kashima steel mill, capable of producing 8.3 million tonnes or 60 percent of its total capacity, remained suspended, although a fire in a gas holder in the facility had been extinguished. - JFE Steel said it had resumed operations at two blast furnaces at the 10 million tonnes per year Higashi Nihon plant near Tokyo, which were idled after the quake, but production has been suspended due to a power outage. - Nippon Steel Corp said on Sunday it had resumed operations at three blast furnaces at the Kimitsu plant near Tokyo and resumed shipments at all its steel plants except one small plant in northern Japan. - Pan Pacific Copper, Japan's biggest copper smelter, said it had halted operations at its 136,000 tonnes per year Hitachi refinery due to a power outage. - Mitsui Mining said it had halted operations at its 108,000 tonnes per year Hachinohe Zinc smelter. - Mitsubishi Material said operations at its 300,000 tonnes per year Onahama copper smelter were suspended due to a power outage.
