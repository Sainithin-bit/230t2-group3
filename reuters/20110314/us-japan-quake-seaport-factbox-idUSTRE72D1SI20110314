 (Reuters) - At least six Japanese ports were damaged by last week's massive earthquake and tsunami, with four potentially out of operation for months, if not years, industry officials and experts said on Monday. 

 Japan was assessing the damage to ports north of Japan's capital, Tokyo, where the 8.9 magnitude quake and tsunami hit on Friday. Tokyo and all ports south of the capital have resumed operations. Following are details of the six ports most affected by the quake and tsunami.
