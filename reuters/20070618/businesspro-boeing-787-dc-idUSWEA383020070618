 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Boeing's ( BA.N ) closely 
watched 787 Dreamliner plane is up to four months behind 
schedule, according to a JP Morgan analyst note circulated on 
Monday. 

  "We believe that the 'power on' to the aircraft was 
scheduled for April 21, but is now scheduled for August 15, and 
even that date is considered a bit of a stretch by some 
suppliers," said JP Morgan analyst Joseph Nadol in a research 
note, citing unnamed suppliers on the 787 program.  The head of Boeing's commercial airplane unit, Scott 
Carson, said earlier on Monday that the plane was still on 
schedule for roll out in July and test flight in August or 
September. He said it would be delivered on time to the first 
customer in May 2008.
