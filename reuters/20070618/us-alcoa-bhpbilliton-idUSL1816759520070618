 LONDON  (Reuters) - BHP Billiton Ltd./Plc( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ), the world's biggest mining group, has revived plans for a $40 billion takeover of aluminium producer Alcoa Inc.( AA.N ), the Times newspaper said in an unsourced report on Monday. 

 The bid speculation comes prior to Marius Kloppers taking up the role of BHP chief executive in October when Chip Goodyear, who sidelined the plan, preferring to return cash to shareholders, retires, the paper said. Alcoa has itself made a $28.4 billion cash-and-stock hostile takeover offer for Alcan Inc. AL.TO. BHP was not immediately available for comment.
