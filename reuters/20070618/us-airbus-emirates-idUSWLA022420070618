 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Emirates Airlines, the largest customer of the Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A380 superjumbo, ordered an additional 8 aircraft worth $2.5 billion at list prices on Monday. 

 The deal brings the number of A380s ordered by the Dubai-based airline to 55. Emirates said it had not yet made a decision on its requirement for 100 aircraft in the middle of the market, which pits the Airbus A350 XWB against the faster-selling Boeing 787. "For the 350 we have to make a decision in the next few months," Emirates Group Chairman Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum told a news conference.
