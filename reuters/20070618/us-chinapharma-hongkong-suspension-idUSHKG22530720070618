 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Trading in shares of China Pharmaceutical Group Ltd. ( 1093.HK ) was suspended on Monday, pending an announcement on a possible mandatory unconditional general offer, the Hong Kong exchange said. 

 No further details were immediately available. The company said earlier this month that Legend Holdings Ltd., controlling shareholder of Lenovo Group Ltd. ( 0992.HK ), had been chosen as a qualified bidder for talks with the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Committee to buy a 50.93 percent stake in the firm. Shares of China Pharmaceutical ended at HK$2.66 on Friday, valuing the company at HK$4.09 billion ($523.2 million).
