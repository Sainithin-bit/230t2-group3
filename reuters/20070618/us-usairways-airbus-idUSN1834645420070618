 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - US Airways Group Inc. ( LCC.N ) is set to announce a large order of Airbus jets that could be worth more than $10 billion at list prices, according to published reports. 

 US Airways will buy about 60 single-aisle A320 aircraft, eight wide-body A330s, and 22 long-range A350 jets, Bloomberg reported on its Web site, adding the order is worth about $10.7 billion. But The Wall Street Journal said US Airways was finalizing an order for as many as 30 jetliners, valued at $7 billion at list prices. A spokesman for US Airways said he could not comment on the reports.
