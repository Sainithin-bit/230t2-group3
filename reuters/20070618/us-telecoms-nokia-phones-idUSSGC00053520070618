 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's largest mobile phone maker, unveiled three new mobile handsets on Monday intended to boost its offering of mid-range phones and help lift its global market share. 

 While Nokia dominates the market for cheaper phones and has a wide line-up of pricier multimedia models, its weak spot in recent years has been the mid-range, or 150 to 250 euro ($200-330), price level. Nokia repeated its May forecast of increasing its market share in the April-to-June quarter from the 36 percent it reached in the first quarter. "We now see our share of the global market expanding to above the current estimate of 36 percent," Urpo Karjalainen, Nokia's senior vice president for Asia- Pacific, said in Singapore ahead of the annual telecoms fair CommunicAsia. Nokia has so far unveiled 26 new models this year. It usually markets 40 to 50 new models each year. The launches include a third generation music and multimedia phone, the Nokia 6267, which is expected to retail for 240 euros excluding subsidies and taxes. The 3G Nokia 6121 is expected to sell for 260 euros excluding subsidies and taxes, and all three are set to hit the shelves during the next quarter. A third new model, the traditional-looking 3500, is to sell for 135 euros. "Nokia has not been terribly strong in the mid-range, and these might help somewhat," said eQ Bank analyst Jari Honko. "The new phones are good looking, they look like improved versions of older ones, but they will not change the world." Nokia said it had also agreed with yellow page firms in five countries in Asia -- India, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- to provide local business and service listings in their markets to Nokia's multimedia phones. It earlier signed similar deals with yellow page firms in Europe to bring data to its positioning phones. Nokia also announced that it had agreed with MiTV Corporation to open commercial broadcast mobile TV services in Malaysia in the second half of this year. Cell phone makers and operators are keen to tap the potentially lucrative market for mobile TV. Trials have been held in many countries, but so far only a few commercial networks have been opened around the world. Shares in Nokia were unchanged at 21.78 euros by 0943 GMT.
