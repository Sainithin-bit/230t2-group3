 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - European planemaker Airbus landed $17 billion in orders from Qatar Airways at the start of the Paris air show on Monday including a new order for three A380 superjumbos. 

 The deals include confirmation of a previously announced order for 80 new Airbus A350 XWB models due from 2013, worth $16 billion at list prices, and three additional A380s worth almost $1 billion in total. Qatar had already ordered 3 of the A380 superjumbo aircraft with options for another two. Qatar will be the first airline to get the revamped A350 in 2013, Airbus President Louis Gallois told a news conference. The order includes 20 A350-800s, 40 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s. The A350 deal also means an order for Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ), which Qatar Airways named as the engine supplier.
