 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) had preliminary talks with Cerberus Capital Management about selling Cerberus its Jaguar and Land Rover brands, but the discussions have been inconclusive, according to a report on the website of The Wall Street Journal. 

 Ford expects a sale of the Jaguar and Land Rover brands to take at least a month and possibly longer, the Journal said, citing two people familiar with the matter. Ford and Cerberus were not immediately available for comment.
