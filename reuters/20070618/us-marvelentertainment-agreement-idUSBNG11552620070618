 (Reuters) - Now it is Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk's turn to appear on children's footwear and underwear. 

 Marvel Entertainment Inc. MVL.N entered into new deals to license its comic book superheroes to makers of clothing and footwear. The company signed a new multi-year licensing agreement with Fruit of the Loom, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N ), to make children's underwear lines based on its popular characters. Fruit of the Loom will initially create products based on upcoming Marvel Studios feature films 'Iron Man' and 'The Incredible Hulk.' Marvel said the underwear maker will later expand its product line to include other comic characters. Additionally, Marvel signed a deal with Crocs Inc. ( CROX.O ) to develop a line of footwear based on a range of the company's super heroes, including Spider-Man and Fantastic Four. The New York-based company also expanded its multi-year license agreement with apparel licensee Kids Headquarters to expand Marvel-branded apparel to include merchandise based on Incredible Hulk. Terms of the agreements were not disclosed. Earlier this month, Crocs had entered into a licensing deal with Warner Bros. Consumer Products, a unit of Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ), to feature cartoon characters on its footwear. Toymaker Hasbro Inc. HAS.N has licensing deals with Marvel for Spider-Man 3 and Fantastic Four toys.
