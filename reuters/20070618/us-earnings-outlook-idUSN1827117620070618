 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street is raising estimates of second-quarter earnings growth, estimating profits will be up 5.9 percent on average, according to Reuters Estimates, which compiles analysts' forecasts weekly for the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX . 

 Estimates are up for the second week in a row, but are slightly below the level at the start of April, when average forecasts among analysts and stock strategists were for 6 percent profit growth. Technology and health care sectors are expected to post double-digit profit growth this quarter, while earnings are seen weakest in the cyclical consumer goods and energy sectors, according to Reuters calculations. Among all publicly-traded U.S. companies more companies have issued negative earnings pre-announcements so far in June than positive ones, putting a ratio of such announcements at its lowest level since March.
