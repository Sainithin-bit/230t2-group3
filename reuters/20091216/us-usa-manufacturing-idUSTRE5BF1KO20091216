 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States must improve the business climate for manufacturers and not place undue regulatory burdens on the sector, the White House said on Wednesday ahead of a meeting focused on the industry. 

 Vice President Joe Biden hosts a meeting later in the day with chief executives from U.S. manufacturing companies to lay out a "framework" for boosting business for the sector. "We need legal, tax and regulatory regimes that promote American manufacturing and do not place an undue burden on those who wish to manufacture products in America," the White House said in a statement outlining an "Obama framework" on manufacturing. It said those policies should be consistent with the country's fiscal and environmental goals. "We must be sure that those who wish to sell the goods that they make in the U.S. in other countries have the market access they need and that those who sell domestically do not face unfair competition from advantaged foreign producers," it said. Politically important U.S. states including Michigan and Ohio, which historically alternate their support for Republicans and Democrats in presidential elections, have been especially hard hit by a manufacturing downturn. The White House's push for job creation to combat double-digit employment has those states -- and their struggling industries -- in mind. President Barack Obama's focus on manufacturing comes as his administration promotes policies to reduce industrial greenhouse gas emissions, which critics say will cost jobs and hurt the economy. Other aspects of Obama's "framework" include providing training for manufacturing workers, investing in research, making sure credit is available for companies upgrading their facilities and helping communities transition when manufacturing jobs disappear. "A strong manufacturing sector is a cornerstone of American competitiveness and a critical part of President Obama's strategy for economic growth," Ron Bloom, a senior counselor to Obama on manufacturing policy, said in the statement. "It is vital to have a concerted effort across the administration to support an innovative, vibrant manufacturing sector that creates and sustains good paying jobs." Leaders from Dow Corning, Procter & Gamble, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co and others will attend the meeting on ways to promote a healthy manufacturing sector. (Editing by  Todd Eastham )
