 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose in line with expectations in November on a surge in energy costs, but excluding food and energy, prices were flat, a government report showed on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index leaped 0.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis after an unrevised 0.3 percent gain in October. A 4.1 percent burst in the energy index led the rise, as gasoline, electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas prices rose. * Prices rose 1.8 percent over the last 12 months as expected, the first year-over-year gain since February. Core prices rose 1.7 percent over the 12-month period. HOUSING STARTS: Housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 574,000 in November, the fastest rate of growth since May, and building permits rose at their fastest rate since November 2008. KEY POINTS: Permits were up 6 percent, rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 584,000. COMMENTS: PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Growth in single family starts was very moderate which is a sign of healthy-but-careful optimism among builders given the uncertainties they faced at that point with the possible expiration of the new home buyers tax credit. "CPI was softer than expected in the core figure. (Ample) capacity is pulling down prices. The Fed doves see themselves as vindicated by this and the hawks can be less concerned about a revival of inflation. There's a gradual erosion of price momentum. It's disinflation that could conceivably become technical deflation before this is all done." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It is more or less in line with expectations, with the core number slightly better. I don't think inflation is a major issue at this part in the cycle. There is still vast excess capacity. We are still having trouble in real estate via commercial real estate and we still have unemployment that maybe is showing a sign of a top but we don't see any significant trends developing. So (it's) probably a bit to early on the inflation front to be concerned." FRANK LESH, FUTURES ANALYST AND BROKER, FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC, CHICAGO: "The data is supportive. Housing starts were up nice, building permits were up nice. I think that will hold us and we should be able to work higher today. "I think we just don't have quite the participation because of year-end and some muted reactions of people cutting back on their trading activity a little bit." TOM SIMONS, MONEY MARKET ECONOMIST, JEFFERIES & CO., NEW YORK "It looks like the story is very similar to what we saw in the PPI yesterday, which is that the strength in the number was driven by energy and somewhat with tobacco. But that's only a very small weight in the whole CPI; specifically it's gasoline that's one of the biggest drivers here, and vehicle prices were strong too. Those were the three areas that were the biggest drivers of growth in yesterday's PPI number too. That's interesting because we haven't over the past six or nine months seen increases in the PPI translate into increases in the CPI--which is what we should see. "Year over year, the CPI is up 1.8% which is the first positive year-over-year reading since February and that's mainly due to us rolling off severe drops in October and November last year. "We're starting to see the deflationary challenges abate a little bit, but aside from that there are some troubling things like housing was flat again. "For today I don't think it means anything (for the Fed). I think that in order for them to be really worried about inflation we'd need to see significantly stronger increases in the core CPI. "I think over the last few weeks we've seen some evidence that some market participants are already starting to (price in a rate increase earlier). That's perhaps overenthusiastic because our view has been that Q4 2010 is when the fed will start to raise rates. I've seem some indications that there are a few market participants that are pricing in a rate increase in June. I don't necessarily know that this number should drive anybody to change their expectations. "The housing starts were stronger than last month but they're pretty much right in the range that they've been in the last six months or so. I think that's just indicative that the housing market is still kind of--it's sort of bottoming still. it seems like a lot of people have been saying the hosing market is bottoming but that's been going on for like six months. I don't see anything particularly troubling or exciting." SUVRAT PRAKASH, US INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "The lower-than-expected core number is probably what has had the biggest weight out of all the data. The rise in yields we'd seen in the last few hours has now come to a halt. They've dropped back lower a bit on the softer inflation report. "We would imagine that this in some way could be incorporated into the FOMC statement. They give an update on what has happened on inflation recently. The CPI report before this had surprised to the upside so this kind of balances against it." "The housing start numbers were a bit stronger than expected. I guess that's what is keeping this market rallying further on the data as a whole. But for the most part we're not going to see so many traders take positions before the key event of the day, which is the Fed meeting at 2:15." MICHAEL POND, TREASURY STRATEGIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK "There were some concerns in the market that the CPI could surprise on the upside after yesterday's PPI reading. But the figures turned out to be in-line. The tame core rate will keep the Fed's stimulative policy in place." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The CPI data was pretty much in line with expectations. The core rate is still pretty low and it looks like the homeowners-equivalent rent is really helping to keep that core inflation rate low. "I think a lot of the worries about the PPI were overstated. Obviously you will have some impact from higher energy prices." JOHN MASSEY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, AIG SUNAMERICA ASSET MANAGEMENT, JERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY: "The core number is a little light, but it wasn't very far off, so it won't be a big driver of anything. This could be a little bit of a relief since we've seen some inflationary number lately. "Housing starts were more or less in line, so I think its a non-event. "I expect more of the same from today's Fed comments. I think they'll talk up continued low interest rates and economic healing. I don't think expect them to change their tune." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures added to gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pared losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell slightly against the euro.
