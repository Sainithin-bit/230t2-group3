 KEY POINTS: The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index leaped 0.4 percent on a seasonally adjusted basis after an unrevised 0.3 percent gain in October. A 4.1 percent burst in the energy index led the rise, as gasoline, electricity, fuel oil, and natural gas prices rose. * Prices rose 1.8 percent over the last 12 months as expected, the first year-over-year gain since February. Core prices rose 1.7 percent over the 12-month period. HOUSING STARTS: Housing starts rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 584,000 in November, the fastest rate of growth since May, and building permits rose at their fastest rate since November 2008. KEY POINTS: Permits were up 6 percent, rising at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 630,000.
