 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group AG's scheme to allow rogue players like Iran access to U.S. markets was "decades long," U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said on Wednesday after the bank agreed to pay a $536 million fine for breaking U.S. laws. 

 The U.S. government will be vigilant in pursuing other institutions and individuals engaging in similar conduct, Holder added. The payment was the biggest-ever for a violation of U.S. sanctions. The bank has entered a deferred prosecution agreement that ended a five-year investigation by U.S. authorities. (Reporting by  Kim Dixon , Editing by Dan Grebler)
