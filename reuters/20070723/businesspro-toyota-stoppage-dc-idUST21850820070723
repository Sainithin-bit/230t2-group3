 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) expects to 
lose 55,000 units of vehicle production through the stoppage of 
most of its domestic factories through Tuesday after last 
week's earthquake in Japan, President Katsuaki Watanabe said on 
Monday. 

  Toyota exports about 60 percent of its vehicles produced in 
Japan.  "We will gauge how to make up for this lost production in 
due time," Watanabe told a mid-year news conference.
