 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N posted on Monday lower quarterly profit and revenue as weak demand for its calculators offset improving sales of advanced phones that use its wireless chips. 

 TI, the world's biggest maker of chips for mobile phones, said its profit from continuing operations fell to $614 million, or 42 cents per share from $739 million, or 47 cents per share a year ago. Revenue fell to $3.42 billion from $3.7 billion, said the company, which makes everything from calculators to chips for televisions. On June 11, TI forecast earnings per share of 40 cents to 44 cents on revenue of $3.36 billion to $3.51 billion. It had lowered the midpoint of its revenue forecast, citing weak calculator sales offsetting improving wireless sales.
