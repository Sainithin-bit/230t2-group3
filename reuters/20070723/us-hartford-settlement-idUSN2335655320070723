 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. ( HIG.N ) has settled a long-running market timing and bid rigging case with New York, Connecticut and Illinois for $115 million. 

 The case dates back to the mid-1990s, when the property and life insurer paid hundreds of millions of dollars in hidden commissions to brokers who steered business to Hartford. The Connecticut insurer also allowed certain people to make rapid trades in and out of mutual funds, harming others, according to Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, who announced the settlement on Monday. Hartford said in a statement that it had already reserved $83 million of the $115 million it would pay. It did not admit or deny any violation of state or federal law. "It gets the regulatory issues behind them, and it's a lot cheaper than what some had to pay," said Paul Newsome, an analyst with A.G. Edwards. American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer, paid more than $1.6 billion in 2006 to settle similar allegations. Hartford also said that in light of the settlement, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff had told the insurer that it would not recommend any enforcement action against the company. Blumenthal said, however, that the Hartford-based carrier still needed to be held accountable. "The Hartford failed to act swiftly and strongly to stop and disclose market timing, despite its duty to do so," said Blumenthal. The insurer also gave broker Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc. ( MMC.N ) inflated bids that enabled Marsh to charge higher insurance prices to consumers, the attorney general said. Marsh already paid $850 million in fines and restitution in 2005. Hartford said its internal investigation concluded there were only isolated instances where Hartford employees engaged in improper underwriting. Hartford's penalties include $26 million in fines, with $20 million to New York State, and $3 million each to Connecticut and Illinois. In addition, Hartford will also pay $89 million in restitution, with $84 million going to victims of market timing and $5 million to victims of broker compensation. Hartford was trading at $96.57 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 89 cents. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt)
