 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - ABN AMRO AAH.AS, which received two revised offers from rival bidders Barclays ( BARC.L ) and a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ), said on Monday that it will evaluate both offers in "a fair and transparent manner." 

 Barclays earlier on Monday revised its offer for ABN to include more cash. The 67.5 billion euros ($93.4 billion) Barclays bid will be comprised of 42.7 billion euros in shares and 24.8 billion euros in cash. The consortium of RBS, Fortis FOR.BR and Santander ( SAN.MC ) is offering 71 billion euros for ABN, mostly in cash. "ABN AMRO welcomes the opportunity for shareholders to consider two competing proposals on a level playing field," ABN said in a statement.
