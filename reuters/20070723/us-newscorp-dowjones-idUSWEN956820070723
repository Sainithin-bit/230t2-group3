 BOSTON  (Reuters) - A senior member of the family that controls Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N said on Monday that he expects the family to decide by Friday whether to sell itself to Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N for $5 billion. 

 "We're still undecided," Christopher Bancroft told reporters at the hotel where the family was meeting to mull the offer. "Everyone has to decide for himself." Bancroft said the meeting would continue for another hour, but that he was leaving early to return to Texas where he lives and works.
