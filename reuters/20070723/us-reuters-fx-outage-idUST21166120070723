 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The currency trading platform of news and information provider Reuters Group RTR.L suffered an outage on Monday, prompting some dealers to switch to alternative venues or trade over the phone. 

 Reuters shut down the servers for its Dealing 3000 Matching platform for emergency maintenance at 2205 GMT on Sunday, the early hours of the new week when global trade kicks off in Wellington and Sydney. Reuters expected to have full service available again by 0530 GMT. For the latest details, click ALERT18. The outage hobbled dealings in currencies primarily traded over the Reuters platform, which include the British pound  GBP=D4  and the Australian  AUD=D4 , New Zealand  NZD=D4  and Canadian dollars  CAD=D4 . "People do seem to be having some problems," said a trader at a North American bank in Tokyo. "The market is a bit slow this morning for a variety of reasons, including this and the fact that the yen made some strange moves this morning." Sterling edged up to a 26-year high against the dollar of $2.0588  GBP=EBS  on EBS during the outage, while the kiwi hovered just below a 22-year high of $0.7994 struck on the Reuters platform last Friday. Dealers said they had switched over to alternative platforms such as EBS, a rival system owned by broker ICAP ( IAP.L ), or to voice brokers to get trades done. The outage did not affect activity in euro/dollar  EUR=  and dollar/yen  JPY= , the two most widely traded currency pairs, traders said. A matching system allows anonymous trading of currencies between buyers and sellers, mostly from currency dealers doing large-lot transactions in the interbank market. "Restoration efforts are receiving top priority and we are investigating into the root cause of this incident," Reuters said in a statement to customers. "Reuters wishes to apologise to all our customers for the disruption to business this may cause."
