 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Future residents of the Cottage Gate development in Middletown, New Jersey, may be surprised to learn their granite countertops and two-car garages were paid for by a hedge fund. 

 But after Kara Homes Inc. declared bankruptcy in October, hedge fund Plainfield Specialty Holdings provided financing to help the troubled homebuilder keep operating, assuming loans to pay for the construction of individual houses at Cottage Gate and elsewhere. If bricks and mortar on the Jersey shore sound atypical for hedge funds, think again. These funds are increasingly dabbling in troubled assets of all stripes -- from plots of land to controlling equity stakes. In the process they are showing that, rather than adding volatility and risk to financial markets, hedge funds can provide a stabilizing floor under distressed assets. "Any notion of a crash will certainly be mitigated by hedge funds," said UBS joint global head of leveraged finance Steven Smith. "They can soften a downturn by bringing liquidity to the market. We won't just fall off a cliff." With record assets under management, and a need to achieve appealing levels of return for investors, the lightly regulated industry is playing a key part in keeping both distressed companies and investors afloat. "Liquidity is the lifeline," Deutsche Bank restructuring head Mark Cohen said. "By giving a company the ability to operate it has more options available and may not be forced into a liquidation or sale. It may be able to preserve higher recoveries for creditors by having that liquidity." CAPITALIZING ON EASY CREDIT Their eagerness to get in early may prove costly to the funds themselves if an initial decline in prices of an asset turns into a rout. "Now there are guys at every major hedge fund in New York who, for better or worse, profess to be experts," said Ralph Rosenberg, a former Goldman Sachs partner who founded hedge fund R6 Capital Management. "And they're flush with liquidity. That results in pricing that old school guys find expensive but the market clears." Funds that invest in distressed debt rose 0.95 percent in June and are up 9.1 percent year-to-date, according to the Credit Suisse/Tremont Hedge Fund Index. That outperformed the fund's general index which rose 0.78 percent in June and 8.7 percent year-to-date. And some $7.5 billion was raised during the first quarter for distressed securities funds, amounting to a record $80.3 billion in 238 funds, according to Hedge Fund Research in Chicago. They are hoping to capitalize on the easy credit that has increased default risk for corporate borrowers. By making loans to troubled companies the funds are betting that they have more patience than a company's creditors to wait out the storm and profit from a company's turnaround. The funds are also providing one-stop shopping for bankrupt companies by offering everything from operating cash to long-term equity financing. By taking financing from Plainfield, Kara was able to reduce its army of 16 lenders to just five, according to Kara's attorney, David Bruck. Plainfield did not return a call seeking comment. Deutsche's Cohen said with groups like hedge funds buying bankruptcy debt, distressed companies have more options. "Now a company can negotiate more favorable structures that allow them flexibility to manage their case," said Cohen. "That is good for the company and ultimately for the recovery of the bankrupt estate." In another deal, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) is helping provide financing to power producer Calpine Corp. CPNLQ.PK in a bankruptcy exit that is expected to allow unsecured creditors to receive nearly all of their claims. SUDDENLY SHOWING UP IN SOMETHING ELSE Hedge funds often are attracted to these loans because they are then placed high on the company's secured creditors list in bankruptcy court. And if the deal still doesn't go as planned, the funds can often maneuver their loans into a private equity stake in the company. But while the funds are adding much-needed liquidity to troubled markets, there is concern they are investing beyond their mandates and may get burned by distressed assets. Indeed Robert Toll, chief executive of home builder Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ), told the Reuters Real Estate Summit last month that his company was interested in buying Kara's lots for 50 cents off the dollar. "Hedge funds that are investing in real estate ... are jumping in and going to the banks and saying, 'We'll take this for 15 cents off the dollar,'" Toll said. "That's had some influence in supporting prices above where I think they ought to be." R6's Rosenberg, also a trustee at Brown University assisting on investments, is wary of overextended funds. "In recent years people have stretched the mandate of their funds to try to do a broader range of things," he said. "Investors are just starting to probe into whether the guy they thought was just long and short equity is suddenly showing up in something else." The growing involvement in risky distressed assets also raises worries about risk controls at hedge funds, while investors are still reeling from the two Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N hedge funds that were essentially wiped out by bad bets on subprime bonds. And more funds are gobbling up the troubled assets. Earlier this week hedge fund firm Black Pearl Asset Management said it will launch portfolios to invest up to $500 million in cheap subprime mortgage securities battered by the current crisis. "If you look what's happened in the subprime mortgage market it could be just a precursor of what's coming to the leveraged loan market," said John O'Neill, president of Tartarus Advisors Inc., a turnaround advisory firm that advises distressed companies. "It's been six or seven years since the last downturn in the credit cycle, and it's clearly becoming time for the next cycle to begin."
