 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co began talks with the United Auto Workers on Monday, hoping to win sweeping concessions that would slash labor costs for the struggling U.S. auto industry. 

 The automakers insist they need major savings, particularly in health care, to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States and return to profitability. The "Big Three" Detroit-based automakers, including Chrysler Group, which is being spun off by German parent DaimlerChrysler, lost more than $15 billion last year. Analysts and industry experts have cautioned that anything short of sweeping changes could prompt the collapse of at least one of the automakers. "From our perspective, a contract that is incremental would be a real problem and would cause a failure of at least one of the companies," Dave Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research, an industry research group, said in an interview. "This contract has to be transformational." GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner and UAW President Ron Gettelfinger shook hands on Monday morning to mark the start of talks widely seen as the most important for the industry in decades. Hours later at Ford's Dearborn, Michigan, headquarters, Chief Executive Alan Mulally staged his own symbolic handshake with Gettelfinger to mark the start of talks there. Chrysler kicked off its negotiations with the UAW on Friday in Auburn Hills, Michigan. The health-care issue looms especially large for GM, which spent $4.8 billion last year on insurance and medical care for its workers and retirees. GM's chief negotiator Diana Tremblay said GM had to try to address its health-care expenses in the talks. "Health care is the largest single competitive issue we face as a company," Tremblay told reporters. "I think it's impossible to ignore the issue." GM and Ford hourly labor costs -- $73.26 and $70.51, respectively -- are about $30 an hour higher than those paid by Japanese competitors operating U.S. plants, according to data compiled by the automakers. The UAW's current four-year contract with the "Big Three" automakers expires September 14. Gettelfinger said a strike was still possible if the parties could not reach an agreement. HEALTH CARE IN FOCUS As the GM talks began, about 100 GM retirees demonstrated outside, urging the UAW to hold the line against givebacks on retiree health care. Some retirees have challenged the union's authority to negotiate concessions on their behalf in a case still pending in a federal appeals court. Many analysts expect the talks to include proposals to establish a union-operated trust fund for retiree health care if the two sides can agree on how much the automakers would contribute up front to such a fund. The retiree health care liability for all three automakers is estimated at nearly $100 billion. In a still controversial move, GM and Ford won concessions in 2005 that shifted some health-care costs to their roughly 365,000 retirees. FORD, THE WEAKEST LINK? Many analysts see Ford as the weakest of the Detroit-based automakers and most in need of concessions from the UAW. The automaker, which lost over $5,000 on every vehicle sold in North America in 2006, was forced to mortgage most of its assets, including its iconic blue oval logo, as part of a $23.4 billion borrowing program last year. But Gettelfinger said that views of the automaker's financial condition varied and argued that the union had already made painful concessions to help turn around Ford. "It's fair to say we have given a lot," Gettelfinger told reporters. Gettelfinger also said the pay packages of executives, not just hourly workers, deserved scrutiny. "You can't expect sacrifice to come from one side of the table," he said. Mulally was enticed with a $39-million pay package to join the automaker last September from Boeing Co. Joe Laymon, one of Ford's chief negotiators, defended that pay package and others at the automaker as necessary to hire and retain executive talent at a time of crisis. "Ron is well aware of the financial situation of Ford," said Laymon. "Our CEO recently said we have taken the largest home improvement loan in the history of mankind." Laymon also said Ford wanted to offer the UAW a chance to benefit from an improvement of the automaker's financial condition. "We will work together to allow the UAW members to participate in what we believe will be an upswing," he said. The remark, hinting at some type of profit-sharing arrangement, was the first indication that any of the automakers was ready to negotiate financial incentives with the UAW based on progress in their restructuring. The "Big Three" have been losing market share to Japanese competitors led by Toyota Motor Corp in the United States, historically their most profitable and largest market. Combined U.S. market share for Detroit automakers was just above 50 percent for June and could dip below that for the first time this year. (Additional reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
