 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) expects to secure a contract with the United Auto Workers union that puts the struggling No. 2 automaker in a stronger competitive position, one of Ford's chief negotiators said on Monday. 

 While Ford expects to be able to reach a deal with the UAW, a strike by the union always remains a risk, Ford Vice President Joe Laymon told reporters at a news conference to mark the start of talks between the automaker and the union. "We do expect to get a resolution for our issues," Laymon said. Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally and UAW President Ron Gettelfinger shook hands at the automaker's headquarters on Monday afternoon in a ceremony to mark the start of talks. Talks are also under way this week at General Motors Corp. and Chrysler Group. The UAW's current four-year deal with the automakers expires on September 14. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
