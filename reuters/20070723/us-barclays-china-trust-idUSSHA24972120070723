 SHANGHAI/BEIJING  (Reuters) - Barclays ( BARC.L ) has won regulatory approval to buy into a Chinese trust company, securing a foothold in the country's fast-growing asset management sector, two sources familiar with the situation said on Monday. 

 London-based Barclays Bank Plc will be allowed to buy a nearly 20 percent stake in New China Trust & Investment Co., one of the country's oldest trust firms, after negotiations for more than one year between the two companies, the sources said. The purchase will make Barclays the first foreign bank with a stake in a Chinese trust firm, while others, including Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ), are still in talks with potential Chinese partners. "The deal will allow Barclays to offer wealth management services and financial derivative products to Chinese clients through New China Trust's licenses and network," said one of the sources, who declined to be identified. "It's not a very expensive deal but it brings a very good platform to Barclays in China," he said. He declined to comment further on the financial details of the deal. New China Trust, established in 1979, manages assets worth more than 7 billion yuan ($926 million) and has registered capital of 500 million yuan. New China Trust can help Chinese companies to underwrite corporate bonds and can help institutional investors, especially state-owned enterprises, to invest in domestic stocks. After the purchase, Barclays will be the second-largest shareholder in New China Trust and will appoint representatives to the board of the company, which is controlled by a Chinese investment firm with more than a 50 percent stake, the sources said. CHINA EXPANSION Barclays will have the option to increase its stake in New China Trust to just under 50 percent if and when Beijing lifts its investment cap for foreign firms, the sources said. A single foreign investor is allowed to buy no more than a 20 percent stake in a Chinese trust company, while foreign investors can own a combined stake of up to 25 percent, under current Chinese financial regulations. Neither Barclays nor New China Trust could immediately be reached for comment. China has been moving since late last year to bolster the trust company sector, which was hit over the past decade by bankruptcies and scandals at several firms, and approved their participation in an overseas investment scheme in April. New China Trust is a founding and controlling shareholder of New Century Fund Management Co., a mid-sized fund manager based in Chongqing which could allow Barclays indirect access to China's red-hot fund sector, the sources said. In a separate deal announced on Monday, China Development Bank, one of the country's three policy lenders, will buy a stake in Barclays, helping the British lender to raise its offer for ABN AMRO AAH.AS. (For details click on <ID:nL23664287>) ABN AMRO has won Beijing's approval to set up a wholly owned unit in China but Barclays has yet to apply for permission to incorporate locally, which would allow it to expand faster. The sources said Barclays could enter Chinese commercial banking through ABN AMRO's China platform if the offer for the Dutch bank is successful. Barclays plays an active role in wholesale banking services in China, while ABN AMRO has begun offering wealth management and private banking services through its retail network in China.
