 BOSTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Members of the Bancroft family that controls Dow Jones & Co IncDJ.N met in Boston on Monday to consider a $5 billion offer by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N for the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. 

 Winning over the family, which controls 64 percent of Dow Jones's voting shares, is the last hurdle Murdoch must clear to buy Dow Jones, which has been under Bancroft control for more than a century. Their decision is far from certain as an undetermined number of Bancrofts oppose the deal because they fear Murdoch would interfere with Dow Jones's news operations to further his business interests. One prominent shareholder and board member, Christopher Bancroft, is seeking alternatives to Murdoch and could be instrumental in blocking a bid. His opposition has cast doubt on what many analysts thought would be a sure thing given Murdoch's offer of $60 per share -- a 65 percent premium to where the stock had traded before the offer was disclosed in May. The family's lead trustee, Hemenway & Barnes lawyer Michael Elefante, who is also a Dow Jones board member, said there would be an announcement later today. The Bancrofts are expected to receive the offer and ask questions at the meeting. They could take time -- perhaps days -- to consider how they would vote their shares, according to a source familiar with the situation who asked not to be named. Elefante then plans to canvass the Bancrofts to determine how they would vote before offering the tally to Dow Jones's and News Corp's boards of directors so they can determine if they have enough shares to close the deal. "The difference between what the stock was worth before Murdoch approached them and now is so broad," said Tom Rosenstiel, director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism, an organization that follows events in U.S. journalism. "But families are peculiar. And you're talking about more than money here. You're talking about blood and a family identity." Also in the mix is a competing proposal by Internet entrepreneur Brad Greenspan. On Friday, Greenspan offered to lend the Bancrofts $400 million to $600 million to buy out other members of the family who want to cash out at $60 a share. In exchange, Greenspan would get two board seats and the rights to all value created in the stock above $60 per share. Under his scenario, Dow Jones would take on $2.5 billion in debt to buy back 50 percent of its outstanding shares at $60 per share and take on another $500 million in debt to fund a digital expansion. The deal likely would not work because of the debt load, said Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino. "Why would Dow Jones take on that much debt to basically bail out the Bancrofts? It would wipe out most of their earnings. A company with no earnings, no dividend, a huge amount of debt -- it doesn't make sense." In a letter to Dow Jones shareholders on Friday, Greenspan talked about creating a cable and satellite financial news channel to rival CNBC and News Corp's planned Fox business channel and a new online video venture. Greenspan said his proposal would generate $288 million in incremental operating profit in 2009 and help more than double 2009 earnings per share to $3.91, assuming existing businesses are stable. He said his plan would help Dow Jones earnings grow at a compound annual rate of 60 percent from 2007 to 2010 and forecast the stock would be worth more than $100 a share. Dow Jones shares closed down 31 cents at $54.69 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. News Corp's Class A shares rose a penny to close at $22.72.
