 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) posted a narrower first-quarter loss on Monday as revenue rose and metal selling prices increased, but it took large charges for closing two smelters and federal health care reforms. 

 The net first-quarter loss was $201 million, or 20 cents per share, but excluding one-time charges, earnings of 10 cents per share met analysts' average forecast, according to ThomsonReuters I/B/E/S. COMMENTARY: BRIAN HICKS, CO-MANAGER NATURAL RESOURCES FUND OF U.S. GLOBAL INVESTORS INC IN SAN ANTONIO "We continue to see restructuring charges. This seems like it's been an ongoing exercise for Alcoa, with restructuring and special one-time charges. It makes the quarter a little bit messy. "On a brighter note perhaps, they were able to contain costs this quarter. That was an issue that some folks were pretty concerned about, given the fact that energy and such had been moving up so dramatically. "I don't see anything that would prompt me to go out and take a position in the name, nor do I see anything in the moment that would cause me to want to be a seller. I'd say its relatively neutral from my standpoint. DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST AT CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH.COM IN SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY "Most of their earnings were basically writeoffs. The big thing is the revenue numbers seem slightly short of what people were expecting. "Right now the companies can make the numbers, but in essence what they're doing is cutting costs. It's still a cost-cutting story, not necessarily a revenue growth story." (Reporting by  Michael Erman  and  Leah Schnurr )
