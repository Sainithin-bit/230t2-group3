 ATHENS  (Reuters) - For Greeks like Kyriaki Poniri, news that euro zone countries and the IMF are standing by to save them from national bankruptcy has come not as a relief but an outrage. 

 Her husband's civil service paycheck has already been cut by almost a third to just over 1,000 euros a month. And now Poniri fears her family of four will face even greater hardship under the watchful eye of Greece's EU peers and the International Monetary Fund if the government taps the 40-45 billion euro aid deal agreed Sunday. "If they ever resort to this aid, this will mean tougher measures for us," said the 40-year-old housewife. Across the sprawling ancient capital, Athenians expressed fears of painful belt tightening and were angry at what they said had been years of waste and corruption that has driven the country to the brink of economic meltdown. The government has already slashed public sector incomes and frozen pensions. It has also hiked taxes to try to shave 8 billion euros off of a budget shortfall that accounted for 12.9 percent of the country's annual output last year. Those measures began to filter through last month, fostering a perception the measures would hit ordinary Greeks but leave the wealthy and well-connected unharmed while years of lax tax enforcement meant those adept at cheating would feel no pain. "How much more can we take? We won't have anything left to give them," said Akrivi Panagopoulou, a 60-year-old public sector pensioner. "They should get the money back from those who took it. When I owe money, they always find me, why can't the government find them?" A survey this month showed three-quarters of Greece's 11 million people thought the belt-tightening was unfair because it hit lower-earners the most, and half did not see the euro zone bailout deal as positive. TAKING TO THE STREETS A particular worry is that the bailout will open the door to the International Monetary Fund, brought on board to monitor budget consolidation, and lead to stricter measures and tighten the noose on a population facing a second year of recession. Loath to stoke unrest like that which resulted in deadly riots in the 1990s Asian crisis, the Fund has focused this time around on stressing austerity steps are ultimately decided by governments and is paying special attention to social impact. Many Greeks say an outside solution is no reason to cheer. "It's no occasion for celebration," said the liberal Eleftherotypia daily in its main editorial. "It offers a sigh of relief...but it doesn't solve our problems... the others 'saved us', now we have to save ourselves." Greeks want to punish tax evaders and overhaul a bureaucracy held hostage by the whims of a political elite that many suspect has long used its access to state coffers to shower their supporters with perks. The private sector complains public offices are filled with idle civil servants, protected by law from sacking and some retiring with pensions as early as in their 40s. Union leaders, particularly strong in a country accustomed to industrial labor action, said they would take no more cuts. Greece's largest state union ADEDY has called a nationwide 24-hour strike on April 22. Union Vice President Ilias Vrettakos promised to step up protests if the government tapped the aid. "People need to understand that these "aid-package" policies are a dead-end," he said. "They don't offer any solutions but may lead to a social crisis. People have to react, they must not allow such measures to pass." This sentiment has led some analysts to warn of potential public unrest when students return to university in the autumn, which could eventually undermine the government's ability to meet its pledges to get Greece's fiscal house in order. George Markopoulos, for one, has little hope that the aid deal, if used, will help him after he lost his job last year. "Let them get the money. They will pocket it anyway or use it for the banks. They won't give it to us," said the 52-year-old. "I'm certainly taking to the streets."
