 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A euro zone commitment for a rescue package for Greece addresses short-term liquidity issues but fails to address longer-term challenges of solvency for debt-stricken Greece, the chief executive of top bond fund Pimco told Reuters. 

 Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co., said on Monday that Sunday's euro zone agreement for a 30 billion euro ($40 billion) loan package does not tackle Greece's fundamental crisis. "Markets have signaled that Greece faces both refinancing, or liquidity challenges, as well as stock of debt, or solvency challenges," El-Erian said. The rescue package, agreed on Sunday between euro zone finance ministers and supplemented by the International Monetary Fund, will offer loans at about 5 percent interest. That's much lower than the 7.5 percent rate that world markets were demanding last week, though not as low as Greece had wanted. "When combined with subordination and debt seniority issues, the terms of this weekend's announcement set a still too high floor for Greek interest rates given debt sustainability worries," El-Erian said. He said market enthusiasm for the rescue package faded on Monday because of these factors. "Intra-European operational and coordination challenges remain too," he said. "As an example, the disbursement of the EU aid requires individual decisions by EU member states, which will face both popularity and legal questioning." Greece needs to borrow about 11 billion euros by the end of May to refinance maturing debt and interest charges. Its overall 2010 borrowing requirement is 53 billion euros.
