 LONDON  (Reuters) - A hefty euro zone aid deal for Greece has reduced investor fears of a near-term debt default but leaves intact market concern about the ability of Greece and other weaker euro zone states to cut growing debt burdens. 

 Greek bond yields fell and the euro strengthened on Monday but uncertainty over how the aid package would, if needed, be implemented could limit further gains in these assets and those of states such as Portugal and Spain. Some in the market even see premia for Portuguese and Spanish debt relative to German benchmarks rising in months to come as they battle their fiscal problems in the face of shaky growth in the single currency bloc. Euro zone finance minister agreed the 30 billion loan aid package, to be supplemented by the International Monetary Fund, on Sunday. Most analysts see 10-year Greek bond yields stabilizing around 300 basis points over German Bunds in the next six months from historic highs over 400 bps hit last week once Athens surmounts debt financing hurdles in April/May. "It takes away some of the very short-term uncertainties ... but it doesn't really do anything to change our perception of the deficit burden that all of the peripherals countries are facing," said Mark Schofield, a strategist at Citi in London. "You should see convergence the other way where Greece stabilizes around the 300 mark over Germany and start to see some of the other more fiscally challenged markets widening. There's still a very big problem out there," he said. Spanish and Portuguese debt yield spreads widened only modestly at the height of the Greek debt crisis mostly because financial markets were concerned about how Greece would finance maturing debt in April and May without outside help. Schofield reckons the 10-year Spanish/Bund spread could hit 100 basis points from around 66 bps currently in the medium to longer term, with the equivalent Portuguese spread widening by a similar amount from around 119 bps currently. Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Co. (PIMCO), said on Monday that the euro zone loan package addressed a liquidity crisis, not the fundamental problem. "Markets have signaled that Greece faces both refinancing, or liquidity challenges, as well as stock of debt, or solvency challenges," El-Erian said. EURO GAINS LIMITED The crisis has hammered the single currency, which is still down more than 4 percent against the dollar and yen since January, making it one of the biggest underperformers among major currencies this year. Analysts see little momentum for the euro after the deal. "We are still in a phase where the market tactically prefers selling euro rallies -- euro/dollar is well off its best levels," said Kenneth Broux, a market economist at Lloyds in London. "It's been the favored strategy since late January and I don't think the deal fundamentally changes appetite versus the euro." Broux expects the euro to drift in a tight $1.34 to $1.36 range against the dollar until upcoming Greek bond supply was out of the way. Greece needs to borrow some 11 billion euros by the end of May to refinance maturing debt and interest charges. The threat of further cuts to Greece's credit ratings still looms over the market too, with Fitch saying on Monday the package was positive but not decisive. "Thirty billion should see them through the end of the year, but I would need more information on next year and the year after because this is the focus of our worries," Fitch senior analyst Chris Pryce told Reuters. Fitch cut Greek debt two notches to BBB-minus, the lowest investment grade rating, on Friday, and said the outlook was negative because of worsening prospects for the contracting economy and higher debt maintenance costs. "The high risk premium attached to Greek government bonds and continued illiquidity in Greek money markets demonstrates that this is not a short-term momentum liquidity but a fundamental crisis," said Lena Komileva, head of G7 market economics at Tullett Prebon. "The cost of Greek debt remains sufficiently high to cause further credit quality deterioration, even if the EU/IMF deal acts as a hedge to the risk of technical default." (Graphics by Scott Barber)
