 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Germany and the European Commission disagreed Monday over how financial aid should be provided to Greece, with Berlin saying EU leaders would have to meet to decide the issue and the EU saying that wasn't the case. 

 The disagreement, if it is not quickly resolved, could delay or at least complicate Athens' access to funds to finance its budget deficit and debt obligations, aggravating the crisis. A German government spokesman said that if Greece requested financial assistance from members of the euro zone, European leaders would have to meet to activate the aid mechanism, a hurdle that would probably require another EU summit. Asked about that possibility at a news briefing Monday, a spokesman for the European Commission said it was not the case, explaining that the Eurogroup -- the finance ministers of the 16 euro zone member states -- merely had to agree unanimously. "No. We do not have to organize a big summit here in Brussels. As you saw yesterday, the Eurogroup can activate itself in a very quick, effective ... way," said Amadeu Tardio. "The activation of this program requires a decision by the Eurogroup by unanimity," he said, indicating that some form of meeting would have to take place, but not a leaders' summit. Euro zone finance ministers agreed Sunday on a 30 billion euro ($40.1 billion) package of three-year loans at interest of about 5 percent, if Greece requests help, with the International Monetary Fund expected to supply an additional 15 billion euros in the first year. The agreement of Germany, the EU's largest economy, is fundamental to any aid that may be disbursed to Greece. If Berlin does not like the format or the terms under which any aid is to be distributed, it could easily veto its release. Greece needs to borrow around 11 billion euros by the end of May to refinance its debt. "Greece has itself made clear that the point in time of a 'last resort' has not been reached," German government spokesman Christoph Steegmans told a news conference Monday. "There is, accordingly, no activation whatsoever of the aid mechanism as determined on March 25 by the euro zone government leaders. An activation requires -- as already stipulated in writing on March 25 -- an EU council (meeting)," he said. The euro hit a session low against the dollar after his comments. POLITICAL ISSUE "I want to say clearly: The fact that there is now a fire-extinguisher hanging on the wall says nothing at all about the probability of whether it will be needed," Steegmans said. Granting Greece bilateral aid is unpopular with German voters who regard the Greeks as having lived beyond their means for years while Germany has kept finances tight and in order. Insisting on an EU summit to approve any aid could delay its implementation beyond a May 9 election in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Defeat at the poll would rob Chancellor Angela Merkel of a majority in the upper house of parliament. A Finance Ministry spokesman said Germany would contribute up to 8.4 billion euros in aid for Greece -- the largest national contribution -- if the rescue mechanism is activated. He also said the Bundestag lower house of parliament would address the matter, but did not say what that would involve. Were aid to be granted, it would be made available through the state-owned bank KfW, and the federal government would guarantee it, the Finance Ministry spokesman said.
