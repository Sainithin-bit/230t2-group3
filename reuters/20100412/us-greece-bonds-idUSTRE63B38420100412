 ATHENS  (Reuters) - A sharp drop in yields following Sunday's deal on a euro zone rescue package for Greece should snuff out doubts over Athens' ability to place 1.2 billion euros of treasury bills on Tuesday and slash the cost of the sale. 

 Markets greeted the news that euro zone states would lend Greece up to 30 billion euros this year at around 5 percent interest by snapping up state bonds, closing short positions and pushing Greek stocks and the euro higher. International investors had been closely eyeing Tuesday's T-bill tender, with some concern that it might flop, but dealers said Athens should now easily place the 1.2 billion euros of paper on offer at a much lower rate than those seen last week. "The context for tomorrow's auction is very positive, with front end spreads compressing massively this morning," said bond analyst Ioannis Siokos at BNP Paribas. "I think there will be strong demand for the T-bills as the default scenario is out of the way." Greece needs to roll over 3.85 billion euros of maturing bills and an 8.2 billion euro five-year bond this month. The head of its PDMA debt agency has said that, apart from the T-bill rollovers, Greece has no other funding needs in April. Greek 10-year bond yields fell around 60 basis points to 6.6 percent on Monday, narrowing the premium investors ask to buy that debt over its German benchmark counterpart to 334 basis points, its narrowest since end-March. Bond prices were coming off the rally at 1225 GMT with the 10-year spread at around 352 basis points, still a relief from the highs of last week. At the short end of the curve the compression was more pronounced. The yield of one year T-bills plunged about 268 basis points to 5.28 percent, with the curve unwinding its inversion after funding worries escalated last week. "The yield in tomorrow's T-bill auction should be in the area of 4.5 to 5.5 percent. This is where the bid/offer is for three, six and 12-month T-bills," said a senior dealer at a Greek bank. Greece will auction 600 million euros of 6-month T-bills and the same amount in 12-month paper. Another auction of 13-week T-bills is scheduled for April 20. MORE REFINANCING, DOLLAR BOND With fears over this month's tenders waning, markets are now watching for the next hurdle, the rollover of an 8.5 billion euros, 6.0 coupon bond coming due on May 19. "There's a fairly good chance (the T-bill auction) will go well. It's a fairly small amount of money, it comes on the back of this huge injection of optimism because everything is rallying today," said Giada Giani, an economist with Citigroup. "The problem is not the 1.2 billion of T-bills, it's the remaining 10 billion of more long-term paper." Markets are now watching for the results of a U.S. roadshow to promote dollar-denominated bonds, which the government said on Monday would proceed as planned around the end of April. "Our plan doesn't change regarding the global dollar issue," a senior Greek finance ministry official who declined to be named said. Greece had said it is eyeing the dollar issue to widen its investor base as it seeks to raise a total of 53 billion euros this year to plug deficits and refinance maturing debt. Officials have not disclosed how much they would aim to raise in non-euro bonds but media reports have said 3-5 billion euros worth of dollar bonds may be targeted. Another ministry official said no specific target would be set for the roadshow and there was no decision yet on how much of this year's planned issuance would be denominated in currencies other than euros. "It's a no-deal road show. We aren't going there to issue a bond while we are there," said the official, who requested anonymity.
