 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The emergency aid deal for Greece dramatically cuts the risk of troubles spreading to other strained euro zone countries, the head of UniCredit, the region's third largest bank, told Reuters on Monday. 

 Euro zone finance ministers approved a 30 billion euro ($40 billion) emergency aid plan for debt-plagued Greece on Sunday. Together with at least 10 billion euros expected from the International Monetary Fund in the first year, it could add up to the biggest multilateral financial rescue ever attempted. "This has been a very important intervention," Alessandro Profumo, the head of UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), told Reuters Insider television. "In my opinion the contagion risk is dramatically lower today." He also ruled out a spillover to eastern Europe, a region where UniCredit is a major player. "Today we are not seeing specific risk (in eastern Europe)," he said. "To talk of them (eastern European countries) as a single country is an incredible mistake." Profumo added that he expects the European Central Bank to continue to phase out lending support to commercial banks this year despite the recent problems. "Our view is that in the second half of the year there will be a gradual withdraw of this liquidity policy in order to move back to a more normal situation." UniCredit's board is due to meet on Tuesday to agree on a new unified structure for its domestic operations and is likely to appoint a manager for this unit to appease its key foundation shareholders who have strong local political roots. Profumo decline to comment on the issue. Speaking earlier at an ECB conference he called for a joint private sector/government bailout plan to fund rescue packages in future crises. "We think it is important to have a private/public partnership... and a stabilization fund should be the right way to follow." "We think this fund can be funded by the banks and partially by the governments," he added. (Reporting by Marc Jones; Editing by Louise Heavens)
