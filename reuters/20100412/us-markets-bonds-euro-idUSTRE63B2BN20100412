 LONDON  (Reuters) - Greek government bond yields fell on Monday, squeezing the spread over German Bunds, after an agreement over the terms of emergency aid to Greece but the recovery lost steam ahead of Athens's next funding hurdle. 

 The 30 billion euro emergency loan mechanism, agreed on Sunday, would allow Greece to borrow from euro zone peers and the International Monetary Fund at well below market rates. The IMF is expected to contribute at least 10 billion euros. Greece has not requested that the loan plan be activated yet. Greek 10-year yields fell around 60 basis points to 6.6 percent, narrowing the key Greek/German 10-year yield spread to 334 basis points, its narrowest since the end of March. The spread was last at 353 basis points as the recovery in Greek bonds lost some steam in thin liquidity and with the focus on Greece's immediate funding requirements. "Conditions have dried up a little bit. I guess with all the to-ing and fro-ing that we've seen over the last two months, it's almost a market that's in disbelief that we've seemingly got a solution to this problem," said Sean Maloney, rate strategist at Nomura. The Greek Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) will auction 1.2 billion euros of six-month and one-year T-bills on Tuesday. Greece needs to roll over 3.85 billion euros of maturing bills this month and refinance 8.2 billion euros of a five-year bond maturing later in April. The head of the PDMA has said that, apart from the T-bill rollovers, Greece has no further funding needs in April. Plans for a dollar-denominated Greek bond issue appeared unchanged, with a Greek finance ministry official saying a U.S. roadshow would take place at the end of April. Long-term stability fears over Greece also limited the scale of the rally in Greek bonds, with the current deal only seen as a temporary salve to the country's budget deficit problems. "It's going to be a slow and grinding process whereby it's their progress against their own fiscal goals that ultimately determines how investor confidence flows back to markets," Maloney said. German government comments that an EU summit would have to be called to activate the deal had little bond market impact. The EU Commission said no summit would be required. FEARS RECEDE The Greek 2-year bond yield fell more than a point to around 5.6 percent, below the 10-year bond yield, traders said. That normalized the country's yield curve after it inverted on fears over Greece's ability to fund its debt. However, bid/offer spreads were wide at around 90 basis points. Declining fears of a Greek default were also evident in credit default swap prices - the cost of insuring 10 million euros of Greek government debt fell to 346,200 euros, compared with 426,000 euros at Friday's New York close. Those moves pushed the iTraxx SovX index of Western European CDS prices about 5 basis points tighter to 79.5 bps, in line with the equivalent index of investment grade CDS prices. The tightening was also felt along the Greek CDS curve, with the one-year CDS at 416.6 bps, down from 649.6 bps, according to CDS monitor CMA DataVision. At 7:30 a.m. EDT (1130 GMT), the Bund future was at 122.63 ticks, down 20 ticks on the day. The 10-year German Bund yielded 3.187 percent, up 2.1 basis points while the two-year Schatz yield was 2.9 bps higher at 1.023 percent. (Additional reporting by George Matlock and Kirsten Donovan)
