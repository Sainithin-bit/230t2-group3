 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European leaders agreed at a summit in Brussels to press on with further steps to tackle their debt crisis, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel threw out a proposal to boost risk-sharing with a fund to help euro zone states in trouble. 
 EU leaders also discussed the situation in Syria, and asked foreign ministers to look at all options to help the opposition there.
