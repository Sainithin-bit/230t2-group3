 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian carmaker Fiat ( FIA.MI ) commented on press reports on Friday it was in talks with banks to explore a possible capital increase, saying it had "no specific project" regarding a capital increase, and that it had no need for one. 
 "The Italian newspapers Il Messaggero and Il Mattino reported this morning about alleged Fiat's ongoing talks with banks regarding a proposed share capital increase," the company said in a statement. "Fiat states there is no specific project in such respect, and believes that there is no need for a capital increase," it said. An unsourced report in Il Messaggero on Friday said Fiat was sounding out UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) about the possibility of raising between 1 and 2 billion euros ($1.3-$2.6 billion).
