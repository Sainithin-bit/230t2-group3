 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Inflationary pressure in the euro zone is set to decline next year and in 2014, European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny told reporters on Friday. 
 "We assume that for 2013 and increasingly so for 2014 we will have lower inflation in both the euro zone and Austria," he said at a news conference. (Reporting by  Michael Shields )
