 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Sweden's center-right government is expected to present an economic stimulus package on Friday to soften the blow of the financial crisis, public service radio reported, without disclosing its sources. 

 The government said in a statement earlier on Friday that Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt and the other party leaders in the coalition cabinet would hold a news conference at 0945 GMT. It did not disclose the subject of the news conference. Finance Minister Anders Borg said on Thursday that Sweden was planning stimulus measures to re-energize the Nordic region's largest economy, which has already been pushed into recession by a global financial malaise. He said the package would amount to less than 15 billion Swedish crowns ($1.81 billion).
