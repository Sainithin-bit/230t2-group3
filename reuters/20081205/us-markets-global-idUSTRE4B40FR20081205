 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. stock futures and oil fell on Friday and major government bonds and the yen rallied after data showed the world's biggest economy lost a bigger-than-expected 533,000 non-farm payrolls in November. 

 The fall in payrolls was the largest since 1974 and the U.S. jobless rate of 6.7 percent was highest since 1993. U.S. stock futures moved to stand down more than 2.6 percent on the day, pointing to a weaker open on Wall Street. The yen was up 0.5 percent at 91.83 per dollar. Ten-year U.S. Treasury prices were up 25 ticks in volatile trading. The December bund future was up 60 ticks. Spot gold rose to $768 an ounce. (Reporting by  Natsuko Waki , editing by Mike Peacock)
