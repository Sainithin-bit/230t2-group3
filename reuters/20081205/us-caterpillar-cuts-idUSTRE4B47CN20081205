 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ) said on Friday it has moved to again reduce its contract workforce, as the heavy machinery maker takes steps to control costs. 

 Caterpillar, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is the world's largest maker of heavy construction and mining equipment. It employs around 112,000 people. Caterpillar did not say how deep the cuts would be. The company is also reducing costs in other ways, including reduced travel and external meetings and events. "Thus far, the vast majority of workforce reductions have occurred as Caterpillar has managed its flexible workforce made up of outside contract and agency personnel," company spokesperson Jim Dugan said in an email statement. "Historically, the overall percentage of our workforce made up of agency or contract workers increases or decreases based on business needs." The financial crisis and sharp declines in commodity prices are hurting the company's customers in the mining, energy and construction industries. In October, the company posted a 6.4 percent decline in its third-quarter profit. In the same month, Caterpillar laid off an unspecified number of workers in the United States, England and France who work at facilities that make heavy machines or diesel engines for the residential construction or on-highway truck markets. Shares of Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar closed at $38.26, up 74 cents, or 2 percent. (Reporting by  Gabriel Madway ; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
