 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Assistant Chinese Finance Minister Zhu Guangyao urged Washington on Friday to take measures to protect Beijing's investment interests in the United States. 

 Speaking at a news conference after high-level Sino-American talks, Zhu was responding to a question whether China would continue to buy U.S. debt. China has more than 60 percent of its $2 trillion in official reserves in dollars, much of it in U.S. government and agency debt. (Reporting by  Simon Rabinovitch ; Writing by  Alan Wheatley )
