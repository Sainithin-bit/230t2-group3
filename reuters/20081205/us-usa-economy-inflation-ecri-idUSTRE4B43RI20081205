 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. inflation pressures fell in November to their lowest in more than 47 years, pulled down by broad-based disinflationary moves, a research group said on Friday. 

 The Economic Cycle Research Institute's U.S. Future Inflation Gauge (USFIG), designed to anticipate cyclical swings in the rate of inflation, slipped to 88.5 in November from 92.7 in October, which was revised from 95.5. The reading was the lowest since February 1961, when it stood at 87.2 according to ECRI data. "With the USFIG nose-diving to its lowest reading since 1961, U.S. inflation pressures have collapsed," Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at ECRI, told Reuters. The USFIG annualized growth rate, which smooths out monthly fluctuations, fell in November to minus 35.3 percent from minus 31.8 percent in October, revised down from negative 28.1 percent.
