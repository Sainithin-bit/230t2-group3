 ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE  (Reuters) - White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said on Sunday she knew of no talks going on between banking giant Citigroup and the federal government for financial aid. 

 Speaking to reporters traveling with President George W. Bush, who is returning to Washington after attending the Asia-Pacific summit in Peru, Perino declined to comment on whether the president supported a federal rescue package for Citigroup. Citigroup is reeling from the economic slump gripping the United States and its stock tumbled last week. Citigroup's board was reported to have met on Friday to discuss the bank's options, touching of speculation about a possible government rescue.
