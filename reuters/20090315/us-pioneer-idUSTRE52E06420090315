 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Pioneer Corp ( 6773.T ) is in talks with Mitsubishi Electric Corp ( 6503.T ), Alpine Electronics Inc ( 6816.T ) and Clarion Co Ltd ( 6796.T ) on a possible tie-up in car navigation and other auto equipment operations, the Nikkei business daily reported on Sunday. 

 Japanese electronics maker Pioneer is expected to pick up its partner in a business alliance before the end of this month, the Nikkei said. But it is uncertain whether the company could reach an agreement as its business has been struggling, the paper added. Company officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Pioneer Corp ( 6773.T ) said in February it would pull the plug on its loss-making flat TV business and cut 10,000 jobs. It expects a net loss of 130 billion yen ($1.33 billion) for the business year ending this month, hit by slumping demand for cars and TVs. (Reporting by Rika Otsuka)
