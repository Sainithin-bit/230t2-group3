 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, attending OPEC's Sunday meeting as an observer, told reporters Russian oil companies were supportive of any OPEC decision. 

 "I would like to inform you first of all, Russian companies first of all support the actions of OPEC," Sechin said through a translator. He said Russian companies had decreased production by the end of the year by three million tonnes of oil. Analysts have said any fall in Russian output is involuntary and follows under-investment and field maturity. Venezuela's Minister of Energy and Petroleum Rafael Ramirez said all OPEC oil ministers were working toward stricter compliance with current output curbs. When asked if there was a consensus for better compliance in the group rather than additional cuts, Ramirez said: "Everybody is working toward better compliance." "We have to discuss, we have the consensus for more strict compliance."
