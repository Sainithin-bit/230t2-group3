 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An angry and frustrated Obama administration said on Sunday it cannot do much about big bonus payouts by American International Group Inc -- even as it prepared to help small business and banks. 

 AIG, an embattled insurance giant that has received federal bailouts totaling $173 billion and is now paying $165 million in employee bonuses, is at the heart of a global financial crisis that President Barack Obama is trying to address with plans for trillions of dollars in spending. As part of those efforts, Obama will announce steps on Monday to make it easier for small business owners to borrow money, officials said. The Treasury will also offer more details this week about the workings of proposed public-private partnerships to take toxic assets off banks' books, including a timeframe, a senior department official said on Saturday. "No taxpayer in these arrangements is going to lose money until the investor who put up the money has lost 100 percent," said Chief White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers. Treasury officials have said the fund, or funds, would be a vehicle to provide as much as $1 trillion in financing for buying bad assets -- particularly mortgages gone bad as a result of the U.S. housing bust. The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp would participate. As more Americans lose their jobs and homes, Obama's new administration is under heavy pressure to show that the rescue plan for AIG and major banks is working to free up lending and rein in the riskier excesses of Wall Street. Summers called the AIG bonuses "outrageous" but said contracts must be honored, even though Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had "negotiated very forcefully" with AIG and done all that was "legally permissible" to limit the payments. "We're not a country where contacts just get abrogated willy nilly," Summers, a former treasury secretary, said on CBS's "Face the Nation" program. "What the lesson is, is this: We don't really have a satisfactory regulatory regime in place." Public outrage at the AIG bonuses was equally apparent on news websites and in blogs. "This makes me ill," a reader named Marc S wrote on the New York Times website. "Let AIG fail, and then let's see what those executives believe they are entitled to receive." "Yet another insult to the American taxpayer and all those displaced by the shenanigans of the 'best and brightest' at AIG and the investment houses," wrote Sipkins from Minneapolis. HELP FOR BIG AND SMALL To help small businesses, officials said Obama intends to provide $730 million from the congressionally approved $787 billion economic stimulus program to cut lending fees, boost loan guarantees and expand other programs. "We know that small businesses are the engine of growth," Christina Romer, who chairs the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said on NBC's "Meet the Press." "We absolutely want to do things to help them." As part of the financial rescue, the Obama administration expects private investors to bolster government funds to help cleanse the banking system of bad assets, said Austan Goolsbee, a member of the Council of Economic Advisers. "That is a key component to the plan but that is not the only key component," Goolsbee told "Fox News Sunday," stressing that the first step had to be a "thorough examination of what situation the banks are in." "It's better to do this jointly with private capital," said Goolsbee. "I believe there is a reasonable expectation that people will participate." The idea of offering financing support from the government for private investors willing to buy the toxic assets was first put forward by Geithner in February but the lack of detail has disappointed financial markets. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, said private investors were ready to join the government in buying up toxic assets -- "if it is organized well enough." "They're waiting to understand what this program is all about," Zandi told Fox. "I don't think stimulus by itself is the answer. In fact, the most important thing is shoring up the banking system." CHECKING AIG CONTRACTS AIG Chairman Edward Liddy said in a letter to Geithner the giant insurer was legally obligated to make 2008 employee retention payments but had agreed to revamp its system for future bonuses after the Obama administration objected. "There are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last 18 months, but what's happened at AIG is the most outrageous," Summers said. Representative Barney Frank, the Democratic chairman of the powerful House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, said the government must see if the bonuses can be recovered, adding that the timing of AIG's commitment was important. "We can't just violate law, legal obligations," Frank told Fox. "I understand that. But I do want to find out at what point these illegal obligations were incurred." Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader in the Senate, called the AIG situation an "outrage" and said the nature of the contracts needed to be checked. "Did they enter into these contracts knowing full well that, as a practical matter, the taxpayers of the United States were going to be reimbursing their employees? Particularly employees who got them into this mess in the first place?" McConnell said on ABC's "This Week."
