 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) plans to disclose counterparties to the credit default swaps it wrote on complex debt securities, a source close to the company said on Saturday. 

 The timing of an announcement was not clear, the source said. The U.S. government, which has committed up to $180 billion in the AIG rescue, extended aid to the insurer after large losses AIG suffered from a financial product unit's bets on toxic mortgage assets, triggering rating cuts and collateral demands that AIG could not meet.
