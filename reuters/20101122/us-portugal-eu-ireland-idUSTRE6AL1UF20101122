 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission reaffirmed its confidence in Portugal on Monday, saying the country was different from crisis-hit Ireland and its recent austerity measures should allow it to meet fiscal targets. 

 "There are no analogies to be made. The Irish case is very specific. In the case of Portugal, the banking sector is relatively healthy and it is resilient and it has proven (so) over the last months and so that makes it a completely different situation," Commission spokesman Amadeu Altafaj told a regular news briefing. "Portugal has recently passed a very ambitious budget for 2011 in parliament, and that should enable the country to meet debt reduction targets," he added.
