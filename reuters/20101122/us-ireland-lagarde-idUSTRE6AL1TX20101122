 PARIS  (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday that the international community's support for Ireland showed that it believed the country's strong economic fundamentals would return it to lasting growth. Lagarde said in a statement that Ireland's reform program being negotiated with the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund would show Dublin's determination to rebalance the economy and public finances. 

 She said that future financial assistance to Ireland would be delivered by the European Financial Stability Mechanism (EFSM), by the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF), by the IMF and by bilateral contributions. "This program should lead to the establishment of a recapitalization fund to assure the liquidity and the solvency of the Irish banking sector," she said. Lagarde said the support would have no impact on France's budget, as France would simply act as a guarantor for debt issued by the European stability funds.
