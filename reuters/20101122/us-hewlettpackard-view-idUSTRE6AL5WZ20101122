 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) on Monday posted better-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast earnings for fiscal 2011 above Wall Street's estimates. Its shares rose 1 percent after hours. 

 The following are immediate comments from investors and analysts. KAUSHIK ROY, ANALYST, WEDBUSH MORGAN SECURITIES "They beat on bottom line because of better gross margins coming from lower component prices." "That's why you're seeing EPS guidance for next quarter higher than the Street -- part of it is coming from gross margin improvement, the component prices. You capture some of it this first quarter. But some of the benefit of component prices would flow into next quarter." The Personal Systems Group did pretty well. Our belief is that they're regaining some of the market share they had lost in printing. Enterprise did well." "Demand is not as bad as people had thought. After Cisco guided cautiously, people got nervous. Now it appears demand is not as bad." "Overall, if you look at their revenue numbers for servers they did pretty well too. They're doing very well in Blade servers." "The corporate refresh cycle is still going. On the PC segment we think the Windows 7 upgrade cycle is just starting to kick in." BRIAN MARSHALL, ANALYST, GLEACHER & CO "These are very encouraging results. First glance, things look very solid." "I think Leo (new CEO Leo Apotheker) needs to do a good job on the conference call and talk a little bit about what he has seen at HP over his initial weeks on the job, and maybe talk about strategically what he has in store for the company. That's going to be the key going forward." "I think HP here represents an extremely attractive value." (Marshall has a buy recommendation and $53 price target on the shares.) JANE SNOREK, ANALYST FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS "It looks like they beat by a little bit. Looks like PCs were strong in corporate and ESS (enterprise storage and servers) had good growth. Looks like ESS grew by 25 percent. That is good. That would be servers." "There seems to be some worry that server demand is all caught up from the recession, but it doesn't look like it. Not with them posting 25 percent growth in enterprise systems." "Guidance for next quarter is very good." "Looks like a little bit better than people were expecting. But we still have very very minimal growth in services and software. And that's the same problem we've had with this name for a long time." "That's the problem with this stock, if you want a better multiple you've got to have growing services and growing software. You can't be all cyclical, all hardware. Those are the only areas that are growing. "I think between this one and Dell, it definitely seems to me that Cisco's problem are Cisco's problems. It's not corporate spending."
