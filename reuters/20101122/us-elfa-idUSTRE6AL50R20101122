 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A key measure of U.S. business activity continued to improve in October, a lender group told Reuters on Monday, as companies increased their investment in equipment and software and did a better job of staying current on their existing debts. 

 The Equipment Leasing and Finance Association said that U.S. businesses originated $4.9 billion in loans, leases and lines of credit last month to invest in capital equipment, which can include everything from tool-and-die machines and delivery trucks to office furniture and computer hardware and software. That was up 14 percent from October 2009, ELFA said. The group, which represents the lenders who finance half the capital investment in the United States each year, said 2.95 percent of borrowers were delinquent 30 days or more on their borrowings in October. That was the lowest level in two years and down from 3.41 percent in September and 4.20 percent last year. The charge-off picture was encouraging, too. ELFA said lenders in October considered just 1.2 percent of the loans in the portfolios as losses unlikely ever to be paid. That was down from 1.7 percent in September and 1.7 percent last year. The group said that 73 percent of all credit applications were approved in October, up from 72 percent in September and 65.6 percent last year. ELFA's president, William Sutton, said: "All indicators point to an improved equipment finance industry. Hopefully, these positive trends will continue as the broader economy struggles to recover." The only metric that didn't move in a positive direction in October was lender payrolls. ELFA said headcount in the equipment finance space was unchanged in October from September and down 6 percent year-over-year. ELFA's members include Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), Canon Inc ( 7751.T ) affiliate Canon Financial Services, Caterpillar Inc's ( CAT.N ) Caterpillar Financial Services Corp, CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ), Dell Inc's DELL.O Dell Financial Services, Deere & Co's ( DE.N ) John Deere Credit Corp, Siemens AG's ( SIEGn.DE ) Siemens Financial Services and Verizon Communications Inc's ( VZ.N ) Verizon Capital Corp affiliate, among others.
