 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen held an emergency meeting with cabinet ministers on Monday after supporters defected and opposition parties called for an immediate election, a source familiar with the talks said. 

 Pressure mounted on the deeply unpopular Fianna Fail leader to resign immediately over his handling of an economic crisis. At least four members of his own party called for Cowen to go. Ireland had on Sunday requested a bailout from the European Union and IMF, likely to be worth around 80 billion euros, to shore up its banks and budget against the effects of the global credit crunch. "The people of the country do not trust him ... I believe his credibility is in tatters now and the honorable thing for Cowen to do now is to stand down," Fianna Fail politician Noel O'Flynn said. A snap election would delay a crucial 2011 austerity budget, due to be unveiled on December 7, and so hold up any aid package. Cowen's junior coalition partners, the Greens, said they would support the government only until the budget was passed and the EU/IMF bailout was in place, and called for an election in January. BUDGET IN DOUBT Two independent members of parliament on whom Cowen relies for support then said they were unlikely to support the 2011 budget. Cowen's government is imploding amid national outrage at the  economic crisis, the bailout and a draconian austerity programme set to last for another four years. Opposition parties demanded an immediate dissolution of parliament. "What is needed now is an immediate general election so that a new government, with a clear parliamentary majority, can prepare the four-year economic plan, complete negotiations with the EU and IMF and frame a budget for 2011," Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny said in an emailed statement. Labour, Fine Gael's likely coalition partner in a new government, also called for parliament to be dissolved at once. "My preference would be for a dissolution of the Dail (parliament) today and the holding of a general election at the earliest possible date provided for under law," Labour leader Eamon Gilmore said. "This would allow the election of a new government by the middle of December." DELAYS Independent member of parliament Michael Lowry said he would support the 2011 budget only if the main opposition parties, Fine Gael and Labour, took part in devising it, which is highly unlikely. Asked if he was concerned that an immediate election would delay the budget and IMF/EU negotiations, Lowry said: "Our government has said on numerous occasions that we are sufficiently resourced and funded up to next year." Independent Jackie Healy-Rae said he was also unlikely to back the budget. The adoption and implementation of a deficit-cutting budget is usually a condition for EU/IMF aid payments. The government is expected to announce on Wednesday that it will cut the minimum wage, slash social welfare spending, reduce the number of public employees and add a new property tax and higher income taxes. Cowen said the government's four-year economic plan, to be announced on Wednesday, would involve 10 billion euros in public spending cuts and 5 billion euros in tax rises, on top of two years of harsh austerity and recession already endured. Unions have warned this could spark civil unrest: a student demonstration over planned fee increases turned violent earlier this month, and unions have organized a march to protest at the planned austerity measures on November 27 in Dublin.
