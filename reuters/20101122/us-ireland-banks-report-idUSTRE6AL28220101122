 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's banks need some 30 to 40 billion euros for recapitalization from an EU-International Monetary Fund rescue mechanism, a German newspaper reported on Monday, citing high-ranking European Union diplomats. 

 Daily Die Welt said EU, IMF and European Central Bank officials quoted this sum to European Union finance ministers on Sunday, according to the diplomats. The German paper also reported that Ireland would be excluded from sovereign borrowing on the markets for the next two years. No further details were provided.
