 LONDON  (Reuters) - The euro has retreated from a nine-month high against the U.S. dollar, hit earlier this month as Ireland's debt problems and the risk of contagion engulfing the region came back to haunt investors. 

 While Ireland agreed in principle to accept a multi-billion dollar package for its struggling banking sector, lending support to the euro and helping narrow Irish spreads over German government bonds, traders are uncertain if that will provide lasting support. Traders say any boost to the euro is likely to be temporary as investors turn to problems in Portugal and then Spain, all of which indicate the single currency may be in for a long grind lower. On Monday, the euro was flat at $1.3685 against the dollar, down nearly 4.5 percent so far this year. HOW FAR CAN THE EURO FALL? Some, like BNP Paribas, expect it to fall to $1.34 against the dollar by the end of 2010, extending those losses to $1.25 by the end of the second quarter of 2011. Others, like Barclays, have lowered their one-month and three-month forecasts. Ireland's request for financial help to bail out its struggling banking sector will calm nerves only in the short term. Investors' focus will swiftly shift to Portugal and then to the more systemically dangerous Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy. The spread between Irish 10-year government bonds and similar maturity German Bunds has widened to 552 basis points from 445 bps at the end of October. During the same time, the spread for 10-year Portuguese bonds over Bunds has widened to 416 bps from 361 points while the spread for 10-year Spanish bonds over Germany has increased to nearly 200 bps from 172 bps. WILL THE EUROPEAN SAFETY NET BE ENOUGH? Analysts say that while the existence of a financial safety net provides a base to the euro, many agree it is not a solution to the peripheral fiscal woes. Indeed, the European Financial Stability Fund will be wound up in 2013 and Germany is pushing for a public-private mechanism that implies private bondholders may have to take a haircut. This is likely to create further tension within the euro zone, hurting the currency's prospects. To add to the mix, while recent economic data from Germany has been strong, forward-looking indicators for the rest of the euro zone are easing back, indicating a two-speed recovery. Another factor likely to drive the euro lower is unwinding of long positions by speculators. Hedge funds and private investors in particular have been net long on the euro since the Federal Reserve started in September to talk about implementing QE2. They are likely to start booking profits on these positions, making the risk of more unwinding by end-December relatively high. Indeed, they have slashed bets on euro gains in the latest week, with Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showing net euro long positions at just 8,606, down from 23,283. There is a chance U.S. data may be good in coming weeks, giving more ammunition to strident critics of QE2. That could spur dollar buying and drive more investors away from the euro. WILL THE EURO'S FALL HALT IN THE NEAR TERM? Unlikely, but there is light at the end of tunnel. There are signs in the options market that investors are becoming less concerned about downside risks for euro/dollar. Risk-reversals, a measure of the premium required to hold a put or a call in a currency, have narrowed in recent weeks. The one-month 25-delta risk-reversal trades around 1.15 in favor of euro puts versus around 1.50 at the beginning of November. At the height of the debt crisis in May, the one-month 25-delta stood around 3.00 for euro puts. Short-dated implied volatilities have also eased as the market seems less persuaded the euro will fall. One-month implied euro/dollar volatility trades around 13.05 after trading above 14.00 at the start of November. WILL FOCUS SHIFTING TO THE FED GIVE IT A REPRIEVE? Some in the market say the primary driver of a lower euro has been a rise in U.S. yields rather than Irish sovereign concerns. Correlations show the euro has clearly been moving more with U.S. yields than with Irish bond spreads, which was not the case earlier in the year. For a graphic, click  link.reuters.com/nyc66q So while the euro may be buffeted by Irish or Portuguese problems in the short term, U.S. yields will be more important once peripheral debt problems have gone off the radar screens. Deutsche Bank analysts say that despite the growing criticism of QE2, the Fed will act aggressively if the pace of Treasury buying fails to achieve lower borrowing costs. As such, they expect the euro to rise at least to $1.45 in coming months. Lastly, concerns over potential Chinese tightening that have hurt risk appetite appear to have been overblown. Any rate hike is unlikely to lead to a sharp slowdown in China, so it is unlikely to trigger a rush toward the safe-haven dollar. (Additional reporting by Neal Armstrong)
