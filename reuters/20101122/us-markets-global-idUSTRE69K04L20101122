 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell while the dollar rose against the euro on Monday as initial optimism over Ireland's debt bailout gave way to concerns about the government's future and problems elsewhere in the euro zone. 

 Developments in the Irish sovereign debt crisis underpinned a rise in prices of safe-haven U.S. government bond prices. Gold also rose on safe-haven buying, but oil and other commodities were pressured by a stronger dollar. The euro reversed initial gains on Ireland's rescue by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which was aimed at tackling its banking and budget crisis. But the unpopular Irish government coalition began to unravel, a day after agreeing on the EU/IMF plan, casting doubt on its ability to push through an austerity budget needed for receiving the aid. "That just adds to the uncertainty, creating political turmoil at the time you have financial turmoil," said Scott Marcouiller, chief technical market strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors in St. Louis. In addition, investors worried the rescue might not be effective in the long term and wouldn't stop markets from targeting Portugal, also facing severe debt problems, and Spain. "The risk of Ireland is somewhat off the table, but it puts the risk onto Portugal and possibly Spain, which represents a much bigger risk for the euro," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Market participants say Portugal may be the next country forced to seek a bailout, which could reignite concerns about the stability of the euro zone. The dollar was up against major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.21 percent at 78.66. The euro fell 0.44 percent at $1.3624. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar fell 0.22 percent at 83.27.
