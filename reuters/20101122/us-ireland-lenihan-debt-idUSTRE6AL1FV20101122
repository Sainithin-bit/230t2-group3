 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - The European Union and International Monetary Fund have seen the outline of Ireland's four-year austerity plan and are unlikely to request significant changes, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan said on Monday. 

 Lenihan also told state broadcaster RTE that a loan, which EU sources put at 80-90 billion euros, could allow Dublin to make a rapid return to the bond market, after opposition finance spokesman Michael Noonan said Ireland would be shut out of the markets for about three years. "They were shown an outline of the plan over the weekend and they (the IMF) are broadly satisfied with it, the European authorities were as well," Lenihan said. Dublin's 15 billion euros debt-cutting plan is expected to be published on Wednesday. He said there was no question of changing the 2011 budget, which will frontload much of the cuts. "I'm quite satisfied on the basis of the discussions to date that the budget that will be presented to the Dail Eireann (parliament) on 7th December will be our own budget. Nobody else's budget. There have been no requests for any changes in that," he said. (Reporting by Carmel Crimmins,  Jodie Ginsberg  and  Lorraine Turner , writing by Mike Peacock; Editing by  Hugh Lawson )
