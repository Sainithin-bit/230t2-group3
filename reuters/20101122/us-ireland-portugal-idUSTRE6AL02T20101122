 LISBON  (Reuters) - Ireland's decision to request EU financial aid should help to restore market confidence, Portugal's finance minister said on Sunday, while making no mention of seeking any such help for his country. 

 Investors see Portugal as the next weak link in the euro zone after Ireland, and as another potential candidate for a bailout. "The fact that Ireland can have a significant aid plan alleviates concerns, reduces uncertainty and reinforces market confidence," Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said in a statement. "It is, without a doubt, a positive fact for the stability of the euro zone." Ireland earlier decided to seek a bailout from international lenders, a move to shore up the country's battered banks and secure cheaper state funding. Portugal has denied it has plans to request foreign aid, seeing its situation as very different from Ireland because its deficit and debt are lower, its banks do not face the same problems and it has no property bubble. Teixeira dos Santos said Portugal's banking system was "modern, sophisticated, well-regulated, resilient and well-capitalized" and fiscal consolidation was on track with a new budget expected to be passed by parliament on November 26. He said the government has a "clear and adequate strategy of fiscal consolidation and structural reforms" and will do everything it can to meet budget deficit targets of 7.3 percent of GDP this year and 4.6 percent in 2011. Portugal expects to end the year with public debt at 82 percent of gross domestic product. (Reporting by Andrei Khalip and  Axel Bugge ; editing by Michael Roddy)
