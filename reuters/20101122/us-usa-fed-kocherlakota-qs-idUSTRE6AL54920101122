 SIOUX FALLS, South Dakota  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve would have undertaken its latest $600 billion Treasury debt purchasing program even if its sole responsibility was to maintain price stability, a top official said on Monday. 

 Some Republican lawmakers have recently called for a rewrite of the Fed's so-called dual mandate, under which the Fed has the twin goals of price stability and maximum employment. Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota said on Monday the debate is "interesting," but removing the Fed's employment mandate would have had no impact on its decision to undertake quantitative easing. U.S. inflation is so low that the central bank would have done it anyway, he added. (For more stories on Fed policy, see <FED/AHEAD>) (Reporting by Ann Nachtigal, writing by Ann Saphir)
