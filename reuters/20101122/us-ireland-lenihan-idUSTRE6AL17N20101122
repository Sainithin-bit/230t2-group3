 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Following are highlights of quotes from Irish Finance Minister Brian Lenihan and opposition spokesman Michael Noonan on Monday on state broadcaster RTE. 

 IRISH FINANCE MINISTER BRIAN LENIHAN On budget, four-year plan: "The most detailed part of the plan are the estimates for spending for the first year and I'm quite satisfied on the basis of the discussions to date that the budget that will be presented to the Dail Eireann (parliament) on 7th December will be our own budget. Nobody else's budget. There have been no request for any changes in that. "They haven't seen the details of the budget ... they were shown an outline of the plan over the weekend and they are broadly satisfied with it, the European authorities were as well." "I think it is unlikely that they will request changes in the plan." On return to bond markets: "The view in the discussions to date has been that the provision of this large facility may enable Ireland to return to the bond markets very quickly." On treatment of bondholders: "I think it is very clear from the discussions that I've had to date that there is no divergence of opinion between the various international negotiators on this issue at least in relation to senior debt ... I have not seen any push to have senior debt dishonored or any sense that that's on the agenda in these discussions. (subordinated bondholders?) "That has not been addressed in the discussions to date." On loan facility: "First of all, we're not bust, we have substantial cash reserves and the EU acknowledges that, and they expect us to use part of them in resolving these problems." "Part of the purpose of this exercise, is to demonstrate that Ireland has facilities available to it, which will enable it to go to the market. In other words, if you provide a very substantial facility to Ireland, it may not all be drawn down but it demonstrates that Ireland has a last resort." On the banks: "Structural changes are required in the banking system and it will be an intensification of the type of measures which the government has already adopted. "The whole question of seeing are there other assets that can be got off the balance sheets whether by sale or by transfer to NAMA that's on the agenda. "Equally you can see that the actual injection of further capital and building a reserve that is available for the bank(s) is also on the agenda." "The banks will be downsized to meet the real needs of the real Irish economy ... they will put in a position where the bulk of their lending relates to Irish consumers and Irish businesses and that has to be the focus of our banks and other surplus activities will have to be discarded." On mergers and takeovers "That cannot be ruled out in terms of consolidating institutions, that may be a matter which arises in discussions, it hasn't arisen to date in discussions." On public sector pay agreement: "The Croke Park deal is predicated on the economic forecast of very modest growth that will take place in the next two years, clearly if there is annual review clause in the plan and the government has agreed with that, then clearly at the end of next year, if circumstances deteriorate very badly, the matter may come under review." MICHAEL NOONAN, FINANCE SPOKESMAN, FINE GAEL On budget targets: "Those targets are set in stone -- the 6 billion (in adjustments) on the first budget and 15 billion over four years." "The 3 percent by 2014; getting under 10 percent by 2011 -- all those figures are set in stone." On banks: "The Irish banking system will be a smaller banking system in scale and more fitted to the credit requirements of the Irish economy than following the kind of Anglo adventures overseas to New York and Chicago and into Asia." "On the banking side there will be two sets of money required. First of all there will be some capital money, and the amount hasn't been estimated yet." "On the other side, one of the big fears over the last couple of weeks has been the liquidity of the banks. Money has been flowing out of the banking system. "A big tranche of money as a contingency fund should settle down those people who are taking their deposits out and attract (those) who want to put money back in at good interest rates." On corporation tax: "It was never on the table, that was a kind of straw man invented by the government so they could claim victory when it wasn't touched." On bondholders: "I'm hearing that there is a conflict of policy position between the IMF and the European Central Bank. The IMF would be following the type of American model where those that lend recklessly should be punished as well as those who borrow recklessly. And that would mean, as the banking system is worked out, there would be discounts taken from the bondholders." Question: Senior bondholders? "Yes." "The European position has been over the years that no European bank would be allowed to default and that has been the principle of the European Central Bank. "But obviously we know from statements by Angela Merkel and others that that policy position has been ... there are signals that it is changing for the future. "It will be interesting to see now in the workout in Ireland, will that new mandate be put in place under the influence of the IMF." On budget: "We would certainly be bound by the targets (if Fine Gael are in power). We would be bound by the details of the first budget because I presume the government will now get it through with the backing of Europe, and then subsequent budgets you could vary the detail but not the targets." On sovereign borrowing: "We will be out of the bond markets as far as the country is concerned for about three years, drawing money from a combination of the funds being provided by the agencies in question."
