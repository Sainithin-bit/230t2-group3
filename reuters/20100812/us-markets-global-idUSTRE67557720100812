 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks slid and the U.S. dollar strengthened on Thursday after weakness in the American jobs market sapped the appetite for risk, driving gold to its biggest one-day gain in more than two months. 

 First-time jobless benefits claims unexpectedly rose to their highest in almost six months, fueling fresh concerns of a faltering U.S. economic recovery. The euro slid to a three-week low against the dollar at one point after figures showed Greece's economy shrank more than expected in the second quarter and euro zone industrial production declined in June. The dollar extended its previous day's strong gains on the weak U.S. jobs data. Softer-than-expected euro zone data also spurred safe-haven demand for the dollar, as worries about the global economy prompted investors to dump risky assets. Gold prices hit a four-week high despite the strong dollar and two days of sharp equity market losses, which were sparked by the Federal Reserve's downgrade of its economic outlook. "With the weak job report and everything else we heard in the past couple of days, you are finding a safe-haven bid in gold," said Fred Schoenstein, a trader at Heraeus Precious Metals Management in New York. Gold for December delivery in New York settled up $17.50, or 1.5 percent, at $1,216.70 an ounce. It was the biggest one-day percentage gain for the contract since June 7. A bleak outlook from tech bellwether Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) highlighted worries about the economic growth and cut 10 percent from Cisco shares a day after Chief Executive John Chambers warning of "unusual uncertainty" in the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 58.88 points, or 0.57 percent, at 10,319.95. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slid 5.86 points, or 0.54 percent, at 1,083.61. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 18.36 points, or 0.83 percent, at 2,190.27 "Bears have the upper hand today because claims were so much worse than expected," said Gary Flam, a portfolio manager at Bel Air Investment Advisors in Los Angeles. "It adds to their case that we're not getting any jobs growth, which means people won't be able to spend and the economy won't be able to recover," Flam said. MSCI's all-country world index of equities .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.6 percent, as did its emerging markets index .MCIEF. Oil prices fell to a three-week low, extending losses for a third consecutive day, on the jobs data. U.S. crude for September delivery settled down $2.28 at $75.74 a barrel, and later dropped to $75.52, the lowest for front-month crude since July 19. Brent crude was down $2.29 at $75.35. U.S. Treasuries prices eased in profit-taking from a recent rally that propelled benchmark yields to 16-month lows, although losses were limited as lower stocks maintained some of bonds' safe-haven allure. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 12/32 in price to yield 2.75 percent. The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.41 percent at 82.625. The euro was down 0.09 percent at $1.2821, and against the Japanese yen, the dollar was up 0.82 percent at 85.90. In Asia, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific ex-Japan stocks .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 1.2 percent. The Nikkei average  .N225  closed 0.9 percent down after sliding to a 13-month low earlier in the session.
