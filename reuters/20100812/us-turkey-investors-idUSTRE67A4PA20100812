 LONDON  (Reuters) - Delays to key reforms in Turkey may merely dent rather than destroy investors' enthusiasm for an economy whose higher growth and lower inflation prospects have taken it to the top of fund managers' shopping lists. 

 Turkish shares, among the best-performing emerging equities this year, fell to a three-week low and bond yields rose after the country's industry minister said fiscal reforms -- aimed at cutting budget deficits and debt -- would not be implemented next year as expected. The news comes at a time when global risk appetite is looking shaky again and positioning in Turkey is pretty crowded. Yet this delay by itself, even though it gives the government leeway to spend ahead of a July 2011 election, may not in the long term lessen Turkey's desirability for investors. Turkey is fund managers' top equity play with a net 60 percent overweight, Merrill Lynch/BoA's monthly survey revealed in July. Turkish stocks  .XU100  have hit record highs in recent weeks, led by banks .XBANK which are benefiting from a strong rise in consumer lending as well as low interest rates. With foreign investors holding an estimated 70 percent of Turkey's stock market, the ingredients for a reversal are there. "This is not great news and it makes you wonder if they are serious about fiscal policy," said Will Calvert, who runs $600 million in emerging equities at Axa Investment Managers, and whose biggest overweight is Turkey. "I would start getting worried if you see government finances deteriorating and if you see policy going the wrong way. I still like Turkey, but when you get news like this there is a tipping point of credibility. It can make you feel incrementally negative about the country." Ratings agencies expressed concern, fuelling worry that they may hold off on Turkey's long-awaited upgrade to investment grade, a status that tends to bring in a bigger pool of international investors. Turkey is rated Ba2 by Moody's and BB by S&P, two notches below investment grade, and BB+ by Fitch. Yet Calvert says valuations remain compelling, meaning foreigners are unlikely to bail out en masse just yet. MSCI's Turkey index trades at around 9 times 12-month forward earnings, compared with 11 times for the MSCI global emerging equities index .MSCIEF. NO MORE UPGRADE? Even a breakdown in talks with the International Monetary Fund earlier this year failed to deter foreign fund managers, although this could quickly change. "One of the reasons why Turkey has been performing so strongly recently is that markets bought the idea Turkey was prepared to implement strong fiscal policy independent of the IMF," said Manik Narain, emerging markets strategist at UBS. "This raises the concern the political situation will influence the budget next year and it probably does push back Turkey's ability to be upgraded this year." Narain said he remained long of the Turkish lira, however. Turkey's status as an investor favorite is relatively new. It had a history of fiscal mismanagement until the AK Party government, backed by the IMF, led the economy back from the ruins of a financial crisis after it came to power in 2002. Today, the years of hyperinflation -- between 1999 and 2001 price growth averaged 122 percent -- are a distant memory. The central bank expects 2010 inflation at 7.5 percent. Surging budget revenues and careful government spending cut Turkey's budget deficit by 33.5 percent in the first half of 2010 versus year-ago levels. The primary budget surplus, which excludes interest payments, surged 200 percent. The rate cuts and inflation outlook boosted Turkish bonds, taking yields to 10-month lows. "The fiscal rule was an external discipline, we would rather have it than not, but the macro-economic situation in Turkey has been conducted in a way we are very happy with," said Ghadir Abu Leil-Cooper, head of EMEA equities at Baring Asset Management. "We like to have exposure to the Turkish consumer and the best way to do that is through Turkish banks." TIME TO BUY? Investors say the risk is that Turkey's primary surpluses are eroded, pushing up government borrowing and crowding out private investment. But many say further falls in Turkish asset prices are a buying opportunity after recent bond and stocks rallies. All emerging markets were under pressure on Wednesday following the U.S. Federal Reserve's downbeat assessment of the U.S. economy, and Turkish markets did not massively underperform. "We're not changing our position -- which is overweight to the benchmark. And we plan to increase the overweight if there's further consolidation," said one emerging bond fund manager in London. Jeremy Brewin, fixed income portfolio manager at Aviva, also plans to add to his position in Turkey if prices fall further. "This is an emerging market so there will always be slippages in terms of timing," he said. "We score them higher than rating agencies -- we're used to the idea that Ankara's agenda is not going to meet everyone's." (Additional reporting by  Sebastian Tong ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
