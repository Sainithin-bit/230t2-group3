 JERUSALEM  Nov 4 (Reuters) - Israel's Hot Telecommunications
Systems Ltd HOT.TA said on Sunday it had cut the CNN cable
television news network from its cable TV programming. 

  Hot, one of Israel's two main TV operators, said it cut CNN
from its programming after it failed to reach a new agreement
with the global television news network owned by the world's
largest media company, Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ).  Hot said it did not intend to replace CNN with any other
news network as its assortment of news channels already includes
Fox News Network, the British Broadcasting Co, and Sky News.  CNN is still available on YES, the digital satellite
television operator controlled by Bezeq Israel Telecom
( BEZQ.TA ).
 Hot's shares were up 1.5 percent in morning trade in Tel
Aviv compared with minor losses in the broader bourse.
