 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) on Sunday said Chairman and Chief Executive Charles Prince has retired, and that it expects an additional $5 billion to $7 billion after-tax write-down related to subprime mortgages. 

 The write-down equals $8 billion to $11 billion before taxes, Citigroup said. The bank also said it has no plans to reduce its common stock dividend, and expects its capital levels to return to normal levels by the end of the second quarter of 2008. Robert Rubin was named chairman, while Sir Win Bischoff was named acting chief executive, Citigroup said. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
