 NICOSIA  (Reuters) - Euro zone finance ministers did not reach an agreement on the pricing of loans from the European Stability Mechanism at their meeting in Cyprus, an EU diplomat said. 
 The diplomat said no agreement could be reached as the discussion was poorly prepared. Northern euro zone countries wanted a higher margin on ESM loans and southern countries a lower one. (Reporting by Ecofin team)
