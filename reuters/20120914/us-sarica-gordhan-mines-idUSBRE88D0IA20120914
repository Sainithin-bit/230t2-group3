 PRETORIA  (Reuters) - Labor unrest sweeping through South Africa's mining sector could be "extremely damaging" for the economy, Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan conceded on Friday. 
 Gordhan's comments are a shift in tone from last week, when he told a joint government and IMF briefing that the violence was not likely to affect growth in "any significant way". (Reporting by Xola Potelwa; Editing by  Ed Cropley )
