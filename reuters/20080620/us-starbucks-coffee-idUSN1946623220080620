 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) is planning to add back bolder varieties of brewed coffee at some locations after replacing them with a smoother roast this spring, according to story in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. 

 The Journal said the coffee company was responding to customer feedback. A Starbucks spokesperson was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
