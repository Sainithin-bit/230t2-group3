 Earnings outlook for 2008, 2009 cut * Ford says 2008 automotive results will be worse than 2007 and cash outflows will be greater than previous guidance. * Ford says it will be difficult to break even companywide on a pre-tax basis in 2009 unless the economy improves. * Ford Motor Credit, the automaker's financial arm, will incur a pre-tax loss this year due to weakness in large truck and SUV auction values. Ford Credit no longer plans a distribution payment to Ford in 2008. * Ford now expects U.S. industrywide auto sales, including medium and heavy vehicles, of 14.7 million to 15.2 million units, down from its previous guidance of 15 million to 15.4 million. * Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally says the company sees June industrywide auto sales slowing further and demand for large trucks and SUVs at one of the lowest levels in decades. Cuts truck production, boosts car output * Ford plans to produce 475,000 vehicles in the third quarter, down 50,000 from previously announced plans and a decline of 25 percent from a year earlier. * Ford expects fourth-quarter production of 550,000 to 590,000 vehicles, down 40,000 from previous plans and a decline of 8 percent to 14 percent from a year earlier. * Ford is delaying the introduction of its redesigned 2009 Ford F-150 pickup truck by two months, citing the need to sell down dealer inventory of the current model. The new F-150 will now go on sale in late fall. * Ford will eliminate one shift each from its truck plants in Kansas City, Missouri, and Dearborn, Michigan. The two plants currently have three shifts. The Dearborn plant will be idled most of the third quarter. * Ford will eliminate one SUV shift at its Louisville, Kentucky plant. * Ford will retool its Cuautitlan, Mexico, plant, which currently produces large pickups, for production of the new Fiesta small car for North America beginning in 2010. * Ford will increase production of better-selling cars and crossovers, including the Focus sedan, the Edge crossover, the Lincoln MKX sedan, and the new 2009 Ford Flex crossover. * The next-generation European Ford Focus small car will be produced in North America beginning in late 2010.
