 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co shares fell 5.5 percent Friday on rumors that the investment bank may issue a profit warning and take additional write-downs on its mortgage holdings, traders said. 

 The rumors also weighed on U.S. and European stocks. A Merrill spokeswoman declined to comment on the rumors. The world's largest brokerage is due to announce second-quarter results next month. Investors are concerned about its performance after peers including Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley posted weak results this week. Merrill has recorded more than $30 billion of write-downs since the 2007 third quarter and has raised more than $12 billion of capital. The company's chief executive, John Thain, said last week that Merrill did not need more capital but would consider selling its stakes in Bloomberg and money manager BlackRock if it did. In a research note last week, analyst Roger Freeman of Lehman Brothers said Merrill appears increasingly likely to raise additional capital. Freeman also said he expected Merrill to post additional write-downs from collateralized debt obligation and subprime exposure. Merrill shares fell $2.07 to $35.62 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; editing by John Wallace)
