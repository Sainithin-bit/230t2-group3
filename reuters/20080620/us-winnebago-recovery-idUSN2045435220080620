 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The top executive at Winnebago Industries Inc ( WGO.N ) said on Friday that the company saw no signs of a rebound in demand for its motor homes, which has slumped over the past six months because of skyrocketing fuel prices, tighter credit markets and the souring of consumer confidence. 

 In a conference call with analysts to discuss the company's fiscal third quarter results, Bob Olson, Winnebago's chairman, chief executive and president, also said that cautious dealers were reluctant to order new recreational vehicles to replace units even when they managed to sell them. "Until this thing turns around ... dealers are going to continue lowering inventories," he said. (Reporting by  James B. Kelleher , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
