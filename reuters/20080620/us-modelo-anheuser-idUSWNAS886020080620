 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) on Friday said Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ) Chief Executive Carlos Fernandez resigned from its board of directors, signaling the loss of a potential key ally in the U.S. brewer's fight to fend off an unsolicited takeover bid. 

 Anheuser-Busch, which owns 50 percent of Modelo, Mexico's No. 1 brewer, is currently weighing a $46.3 billion takeover proposal from Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev NV INTB.BR. A Modelo spokesman declined to comment on the resignation and an Anheuser spokeswoman declined to elaborate beyond a press release. Modelo, whose brands include Corona and Negra Modelo, is emerging as a critical power broker in the battle for control of Anheuser, the largest U.S. brewer and maker of Budweiser and Michelob. Modelo is being courted by Anheuser about a possible combination that would help it thwart the InBev bid, according to the Wall Street Journal. It is also believed to have been approached by InBev, sources familiar with the situation have told Reuters. Ann Gilpin, an analyst with Morningstar, said she believes Fernandez's interests lie first with Modelo, which is controlled by his family, and secondly with Anheuser-Busch. "Given that Grupo Modelo is going to potentially play a key role in whether Anheuser-Busch stays independent or not, I think he (Fernandez) would rather be representing the interests of Grupo Modelo," Gilpin said. Anheuser-Busch shares were up 13 cents at $61.18 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Steve Orlofsky)
