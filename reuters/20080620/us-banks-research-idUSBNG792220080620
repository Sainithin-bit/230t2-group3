 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - It's not just banks that have persistently underestimated the scope of the credit crisis afflicting them. So have the Wall Street analysts paid to warn their clients what to expect. 

 Since the start of the year, analysts have slashed their earnings estimates on Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  financial companies by a respective 41 percent, 28 percent and 25 percent for the second, third and fourth quarters, according to Lab Thomson, a Thomson Reuters research publication. Merrill Lynch & Co's Edward Najarian was the latest to turn more downbeat, amid mounting credit losses and growing uncertainty over banks' abilities to preserve capital and pay out dividends. He slashed his earnings estimates for 12 U.S. banks by an average 22 percent for 2008 and 19 percent for 2009. Najarian joins rivals at Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co and Lehman Brothers Inc among those in June to slash their outlooks for banks and project more capital raising. Regional banks may face at least three further rounds of capital raising, Credit Suisse said. Goldman, meanwhile, projected that U.S. banks will raise $65 billion of additional capital to cope with credit losses. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), Regions Financial Corp ( RF.N ), SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ), Wachovia Corp WB.N and the investment bank and brokerage Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N are among companies that analysts believe may need to raise more capital. Among those to raise the most in the current cycle are Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Wachovia, Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) and National City Corp NCC.N, which this year each raised at least $7 billion. In afternoon trading, the S&P Financial Index .GSPF was down about 2 percent, while the 24-member KBW Bank Index .BKX was down 0.36 percent. STOCKS IN CAPITULATION MODE Large-cap banks' stocks now appear to be in "capitulation mode," said Merrill's Najarian. He expects bank stocks to trade below fair value in the near term as more dividend cuts and capital raises, high credit risk and an uncertain earnings outlook weigh on their share prices. <ID:nBNG329860> The analyst expects dividend cuts, capital raising or both at Bank of America, Regions, SunTrust and Wachovia in the year's second half, putting downward pressure on their shares. Ladenburg Thalmann & Co's Richard Bove, meanwhile, on June 2 said downward pressure on bank stocks is "overwhelming," and that the catalyst to reverse this is "unknown." Bove, however, said that despite investor fear and uncertainty, the situation might not actually be as dire, because many lenders maintained strong cash flows and were increasing market share. Lab Thomson, in a report this week, said that despite the downward estimate revisions, some banks could still see earnings improve in the second half of 2008, relative to poor first-half results.
