 (Reuters) - Protests against surging fuel prices which have triggered fears of political instability and a global economic downturn expanded in Europe and Asia on Monday, and Colombian truckers said they would join the wave of strikes. 

 Here are some details: * FRANCE: -- On Monday, French truckers began blocking roads in the latest protest to pressure the government to help them cope with oil prices that have more than doubled in a year. -- The nationwide day of action announced by the main haulage associations included roadblocks and so-called "snail" operations by convoys of slow-moving trucks. -- French fishermen fighting for cheaper fuel have recently blockaded ports, disrupted traffic on land and sea, and blocked the fuel depot of France's largest oil refinery. * SPAIN: -- Spain's few remaining striking truck drivers called off their week-long fuel protest for now. -- The strike paralyzed Spain's transport network last week, leaving petrol stations without fuel, factories without parts, empty supermarket shelves and sparked travel chaos for millions. * COLOMBIA: -- In Colombia, the world's No. 3 coffee producer, freight drivers were due to stage a national strike on Monday. Transport Minister Andres Uriel Gallego said officials were taking measures to guarantee food supplies. * SOUTH KOREA: -- In South Korea, construction workers joined thousands of striking truckers in the latest blow to new President Lee Myung-bak, who said inflationary pressures were creating the biggest global economic crisis in 30 years. * THAILAND: -- Yoo Chienyuenyongpong, president of the Land Transport Federation of Thailand, which has 400,000 trucks under its banner, said he would decide whether to resurrect a strike threat after a meeting with finance, transport and energy ministry officials on Thursday. -- Last week, thousands of Thai hauliers went on a half-day strike. Facing sustained protests on the streets of Bangkok and shaky public support, Thailand's government gives out handouts to everyone from rice farmers to bus operators.
