 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ) said on Friday it will acquire the remaining 50 percent stake of the Crown Beers India Ltd joint venture from partner Crown International. 

 The acquisition includes the joint venture's 500,000-hectoliter brewery in Hyderabad, said Anheuser. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Crown International and Anheuser-Busch formed the Crown Beers India venture last year to distribute Budweiser and Armstrong, a beer developed specifically for India, throughout southern and western India.
