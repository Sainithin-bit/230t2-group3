 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting Merrill Lynch's MER.N debt with credit default swaps rose on Friday as rumors swirled among stock traders of a possible profit warning by the investment bank. 

 The cost of insuring Merrill's debt for five years rose by about 25 basis points to about 225 basis points, or $225,000 a year to protect $10 million of debt, according to data from CMA DataVision. A Merrill Lynch spokeswoman declined to comment on the rumors. Credit markets overall were weaker in the United States and Europe amid fears that investment banks may face further write-downs, especially after rating downgrades of the two largest bond insurers late on Thursday. "It's not going to help the bottom line and it definitely raises the question as to how much more they're going to have to write off," said Scott MacDonald, head of research at Aladdin Capital in Stamford, Connecticut. Moody's Investors Service on Thursday stripped the insurance arms of Ambac Financial Group ABK.N and MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) of their top triple-A ratings, citing impaired ability to raise capital and write new business.
