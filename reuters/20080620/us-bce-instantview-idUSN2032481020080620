 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada's largest telecom company, BCE Inc., won the unanimous backing of the Supreme Court of Canada on Friday to proceed with the world's biggest leveraged buyout. 

 LINKS: KEY POINTS: - BCE Inc wins Canada Supreme Court case; leveraged buyout can proceed COMMENTARY: JAMES MORTON, CORPORATE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTED A GROUP OF  BCE BONDHOLDERS AT THE INITIAL HEARING: "This is not a surprising decision. "This clarifies the law ... it makes it very clear that what boards of directors have to do is look after making money and look after the shareholders. "The trouble is if the Quebec Court of Appeal decision stood, what that would mean is that boards of directors would have to take into account many other types of stakeholders, people who had other interests. For example, General Motors in closing the Oshawa plant might have to take into account the interest of employees. Whether that's a good or bad thing, it would be a tremendous change in Canadian law. "The Quebec Court of Appeal decision did introduce an element of uncertainty, which was highly problematic. "If the court had recognized a broad duty on the part of boards of directors to look after more than simply the owners of the company ... it could have led to vast amounts of litigation and I'm sure that's one of the factors that led the Supreme Court to decide the way they did." JANIS SARRA, LAW PROFESSOR, UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA: "I'm not surprised ... it certainly gives some temporary clarity, and it won't dampen the takeover market at all in Canada, I think it's fair to say. "What will be really interesting is when they (judges) do issue their reasons. I'm quite confident they will issue reasons that give us guidance, because this is the first Supreme Court of Canada decision on takeovers and what the duties of directors are, and what the standard of approval is for a plan of arrangement. "That's where the market will be really interested to see what exactly the scope of obligations are -- whether the obligation is to maximize return to shareholders, which is the Revlon duty, or to maximize value of the company overall." MARSHALL SONENSHINE, CHAIRMAN OF NEW YORK-BASED INVESTMENT  BANK SONENSHINE PARTNERS: "(The outcome) means that bondholders should negotiate covenants in their indenture if they want rights later on. It's hard for bondholders to assert that later on. "It means that indentures will get longer because bond holders will insist on more rights up front. "It's a pro-transaction position. It favors the ability to do a deal that is in the interests of shareholders even if it impairs credit worthiness, and bondholders need to be aware of that and insist on stronger protections in their indentures. "This makes it more comfortable for (private equity) to invest in Canada because this makes Canada look more like the  U.S. "This is positive for US investors going into Canada, and positive for Canadian corporations." JOEL GREENBERG, PARTNER AND CO-CHAIR OF LAW FIRM KAYE SCHOLER LLP's CORPORATE AND FINANCE DEPARTMENT: "I thought the (Quebec) Court of Appeal decision was very, very troubling. And so it's good to hear that it has been reversed by the Supreme Court. "It doesn't have a large impact on Wall Street. The BCE deal is proceeding under a structure that we simply do not have in this country. "But on the other hand, the court of appeal decision, depending on how it would have been construed, had the potential to have a very serious impact on acquisition activity in Canada. "They have very little time. They have to get the transaction done by June 30 or either party can just walk freely." MOHAMED KHIMJI, LAW PROFESSOR, DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY: "I'm not surprised, I think this is obviously the less controversial decision. "It could come down to two things: the court could have been sympathetic to the notion that management should consider every stakeholder in making decisions, and that they (BCE) did that here. The other way they might have thought is that no, in terms of any legal rights that bondholders have, they came exclusively from what they negotiated contractually with BCE when they bought the bonds. "That's what I think will be most interesting when the reasoning comes out. It's fascinating." (Reporting by Lynne Olver, Paritosh Bansal. Chelsea Emery and  Louise Egan )
