 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The top executive at Winnebago Industries Inc ( WGO.N ) said on Friday the motor home industry was "in for a tough go" through 2008 and warned it could lead to a "discounting war" between RV makers. 

 Bob Olson, Winnebago's chairman, president and chief executive, made the comments during a conference call with analysts to discuss his company's fiscal third-quarter results. (Reporting by  James B. Kelleher ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
