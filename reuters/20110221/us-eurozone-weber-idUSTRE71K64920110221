 LONDON  (Reuters) - The euro zone's measures for short-term crisis resolution go far enough and do not need big adjustments, European Central Bank policymaker Axel Weber said on Monday. 

 "Existing instruments for short-term crisis resolution are adequate and, despite repeated demands to the contrary, should not undergo significant adjustment," Weber wrote in a guest column for the Financial Times. Weber, the departing Bundesbank president, also said there is a danger in cutting interest rates on future euro zone rescue loans, as that could introduce eurobonds "through the back door."
