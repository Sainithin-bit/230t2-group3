 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - The spike in banks' emergency overnight borrowing from the European Central Bank since last Thursday will subside on Wednesday, said a majority of money market traders polled by Reuters on Monday. 

 Twelve out of 17 traders who answered an extra question in the weekly poll said banks' emergency overnight borrowing from the ECB -- which leapt to a near two-year high of more than 16 billion euros ($22 billion) on Friday -- would normalize with a new round of borrowing on Wednesday. None of the remaining five said it would last beyond the second week of March. Reasons cited by traders for the temporary spike ranged from a one-off typing error to preparations for asset sales from weakened Irish banks. Emergency borrowing from the European Central Bank declined only slightly to 14.1 billion euros on Monday. A source told Reuters on Saturday the expected sale of deposit books in Ireland's two most troubled banks is behind the spike. Median estimates from the survey of 25 money market dealers showed the European Central Bank will allot 140 billion euros at its regular seven-day refinancing operation on Tuesday, and 48 billion euros at the three-month refinancing operation on Wednesday. Forecasts for the seven-day refinancing operation ranged from 110 billion to 180 billion euros, while traders saw the longer-term allotment in a range of 30 billion to 100 billion euros. At the last weekly auction, the ECB allotted 137 billion euros compared with a forecast for 160 billion, while the ECB allotted 71 billion euros at the last three-month auction compared with a forecast of 53 billion euros. The ECB's long-term refi tenders are aimed at providing small banks with liquidity and are not seen as an indicator of the central bank's monetary policy.
