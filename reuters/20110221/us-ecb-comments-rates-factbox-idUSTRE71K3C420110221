 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is widely expected to keep euro zone interest rates at a record low of 1.0 percent for the 22nd month in a row on March 3. 

 Below are highlights of ECB policymakers' comments since the bank's last meeting on February 3. To read full stories, double-click on the numbers in brackets. ATHANASIOS ORPHANIDES (CYPRUS), FEB 21 "The sharp increases in food and energy prices over the last few months have been a surprise, and I don't think we can rule out further surprises that would result in inflation staying above 2 percent for somewhat longer than what we expected." "At the moment, this increase is not reflected in underlying inflation measures, suggesting that the inflation increase may remain temporary and not become embedded in longer-term expectations. So we do not need to be overly concerned yet, but we need to continue to monitor developments," EWALD NOWOTNY (AUSTRIA), FEB 21 "We cannot influence the oil price but we are watching out that there are no second-round effects or that this leads to a (price) spiral. At the moment we have no indication that this is happening but we are especially vigilant. LORENZO BINI SMAGHI (EXECUTIVE BOARD), FEB 21 "There is pressure on prices of agricultural products and this may not be a temporary phenomenon, it may be a permanent one, the same for energy," [ID:nTOE71K03D] LORENZO BINI SMAGHI (EXECUTIVE BOARD), FEB 18 "It is a key challenge for monetary policy to avoid spillovers and maintain inflation expectations in check ... This requires the ability to take pre-emptive actions if needed." "As the economy gradually recovers and global inflationary pressures arise, the degree of accommodation of monetary policy has to be monitored and, if needed, corrected,"
