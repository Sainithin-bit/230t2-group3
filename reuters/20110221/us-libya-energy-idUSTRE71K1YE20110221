 (Reuters) - Violence and unrest that has swept the Middle East and North Africa gripped Tripoli on Monday, capital of Libya, an OPEC member that produces 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd). 

 The news helped to push oil prices above $104 a barrel. Foreign oil companies were reassessing operations in the country, and oil had reportedly stopped flowing at the Nafoora oilfield in Libya's Sirte basin, according to Al Jazeera, although few details were available. The following lists oil and gas companies present in Libya. BP BP ( BP.L ) on Monday said it had suspended preparations for drilling in Libya, but a spokesman added it was years away from production there. The drilling would be the first under a $900 million deal BP signed with Libya in 2007, which BP said at the time was its largest single exploration commitment. Shell Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) said it had temporarily relocated the dependents of expatriate staff outside Libya and was monitoring the situation. Shell signed a deal with the Libyan government in 2005 to explore and develop five areas in the Sirte basin and was also awarded a gas exploration permit in 2007. Its current operations in Libya are limited to exploration. OMV OMV ( OMVV.VI ) said on Monday none of its operations in Libya had been affected by the unrest there but added it was withdrawing expatriate staff from the country. Libya is one of OMV's most important oil suppliers and provides around 34,000 bpd. ENI A spokesman said the company's output in Libya had gone ahead normally in the past 24 hours. JX Nippon Japan's largest refiner in 2005 struck an offshore exploration and production-sharing agreement with Libya that also included Mitsubishi Corp. and Japan Petroleum Exploration (JAPEX), which said it would invest $48 million in exploration over five years. Mitsubishi Corp ( 8058.T ) and Japan Petroleum Exploration (Japex) ( 1662.T ) said none of their Japanese employees were currently in Libya. Exxon ExxonMobil ( XOM.N ) in February 2008 agreed with Libya's national oil company to invest $97 million plus tens of millions in fees in offshore hydrocarbon exploration. The company in 2005 struck an exploration and production-sharing deal with Libya's state oil company that covers the Cyrenaica Basin, covering 2.5 million acres, from deep to shallow waters. Occidental The company ( OXY.N ) began business in Libya in 1966. In late 2007 it won gas-focused permits to explore areas of Libya's Sirte basin, and in 2005 was the biggest winner in Libya's first licensing round. PGNiG Libya's state-owned oil corporation ratified a gas exploration agreement in February 2008 with the Polish gas monopoly to drilling at least eight wells at a cost of $108 million in the Murzuq Basin over six years. It aims to begin drilling the first two exploration wells in 2012. The company has 12 percent stake in the concession and hopes to reach an annual gas production of 1 billion cubic meters. Gazprom The Russian company ( GAZP.MM ) is taking 50 percent of ENI's stake in Libya's elephant oil field, valued at $170 million. The company was awarded a gas exploration license in 2007 for areas in the Ghadames Basin. RWE The German energy company ( RWEG.DE ) made two new oil discoveries in the Sirte Basin in 2008, only a year after its first oil discovery in the basin. It agreed to spend at least $76 million and drill two exploration wells in Syrenica basin blocks it won access to in late 2007.
