 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP PLC ( BP.L ) has suspended preparations for exploratory drilling for oil and gas in western Libya due to growing unrest in the north African country, a spokesman for the British energy giant said on Monday. 

 The company does not produce any oil or gas in Libya but has been readying an onshore rig to start drilling for fuel in the west of the country. "We are looking at evacuating some people from Libya, so those preparations are being suspended but we haven't started drilling and we are years away from any production," the spokesman said.
