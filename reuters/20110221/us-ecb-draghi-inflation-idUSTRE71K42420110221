 BOLOGNA, Italy  (Reuters) - The best contribution the European Central Bank can make to fixing global economic imbalances is to anchor inflation expectations to ensure price stability, governing council member Mario Draghi said on Monday. 

 Speaking in Bologna, Draghi, who heads Italy's central bank, also said the main obstacle to a recovery of investments in the euro zone was the level of risk premiums rather than credit costs or official interest rates. "The best contribution the ECB can make is to continue to ensure price stability and to anchor inflation expectations," Draghi said in a question and answer session with students at Bologna university. Draghi is considered a leading candidate to replace Jean-Claude Trichet as ECB president when Trichet's term expires in October.
