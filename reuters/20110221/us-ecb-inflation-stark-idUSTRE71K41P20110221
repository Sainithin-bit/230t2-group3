 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Risks to the medium-term outlook for prices in the euro area could move to the upside and the European Central Bank should monitor developments very closely, ECB policymaker Juergen Stark said on Monday. 

 Stark added that the ECB would act "quickly and decisively" to respond to any signs of so-called "second-round effects" -- where supply-related rises begin to have an impact on wage demands and other prices. "In my view, risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments in the euro area as a whole could move to the upside," Stark said. "We therefore need to very closely monitor further developments." "In this respect, we need to keep a close eye on any signs of emerging second-round effects in the behavior of wages and price setters," he added in the text of a speech for delivery in Frankfurt. "I can assure you that we will act quickly and decisively on any indications of emerging second-round effects." Stark said the ECB's exit strategy "has been, and will be, gradual." With its bond-buying program, he said the ECB had entered "terrain in which it should not stay longer than absolutely necessary." (Reporting by  Paul Carrel ; editing by Stephen Nisbet)
