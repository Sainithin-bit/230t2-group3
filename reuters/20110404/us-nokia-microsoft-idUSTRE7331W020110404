 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Talks between Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker by volume, and Microsoft on a software deal are on schedule and a large number of Nokia Windows phones should be sold in 2012. 

 "Negotiations have progressed very well. They will be concluded well on schedule," Kai Oistamo, head of corporate development at Nokia, said on Monday. The companies signed a non-binding agreement on February 11 for Nokia to start using Microsoft software as its main platform in smartphones. Nokia chief executive Stephen Elop said in February it would take at least a couple of months to sign a deal. The long negotiation process has led analysts to question whether the partnership can produce quick results. Some analysts have said talks should be concluded by end-April when Nokia plans to start talks over job cuts stemming from the agreement. (Reporting by  Tarmo Virki ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
