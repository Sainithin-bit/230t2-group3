 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - BP has submitted one application for a drilling permit since the Obama administration lifted its deepwater-drilling ban, but it has reached no deal with the government on resuming activity in the Gulf, a company source said on Monday. 

 BP is "just following the regulatory process", the source said. (Reporting by  Ayesha Rascoe ; Editing by  Dale Hudson )
