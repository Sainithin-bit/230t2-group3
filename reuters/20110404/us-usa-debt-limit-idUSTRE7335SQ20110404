 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Monday he expects the government to reach the $14.294 trillion statutory limit on its borrowing by May 16 at the latest, narrowing the time Congress has to act to raise it. 

 The Treasury Department previously had projected it would reach the debt ceiling sometime between April 15 and May 30. In a letter to Congress, Geithner repeated that the Treasury could take extraordinary measures to postpone a potential default on government obligations. But he warned that these measures would only last about eight weeks. He said the Treasury would exhaust all "headroom" to borrow under the limit after about July 8, at which time it would not have enough cash on hand to securely meet U.S. obligations. As of March 31, the total U.S. debt subject to the limit stood at $14.218 trillion, or $76 billion below the ceiling. Congress has routinely raised the debt limit every year since 2002, but Republicans want to tie any hike this time to commitments by the Obama administration and Democrats to deeper spending cuts. The Treasury has already drawn down a $200 billion Federal Reserve emergency lending account to $5 billion as part of its efforts to stay under the limit. Geithner said he would take all measures to protect U.S. credit-worthiness if Congress does not act by May 16. Following is a rundown of the additional tools that he could deploy to stay under the debt limit. ISSUE MORE CASH MANAGEMENT BILLS The Treasury could cut issuance of longer-term government debt and rely more heavily on short-term cash management bills to gain more day-to-day control over debt outstanding. Cash management bills are typically issued for days instead of normal Treasury bill maturities of four weeks to one year. However, this is unlikely to buy much time and officials are wary of making any major shifts in the Treasury's debt issuance calendar, which could upset markets. SUSPEND STATE, LOCAL GOVERNMENT SECURITIES The Treasury could suspend sales of State and Local Government Series securities, known as "slugs," which are special low-interest-bearing Treasury securities offered to local governments and other tax-exempt entities for the investment of municipal bond issue proceeds. Slugs, which count against the debt limit, were last halted in September 2007 to avoid hitting the ceiling then. So far in fiscal 2011, which began on October 1, the Treasury has sold $45.7 billion in slugs to muni bond issuers. CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT AND DISABILITY FUND As it has in the past, the Treasury could suspend payments to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, a government employee pension fund. The government has recently been contributing an average of $5.8 billion to this fund per month. It would be required to replace any missed contributions and lost earnings. Based on a study of data from August 31, the Government Accountability Office estimates that these moves could add up to $7.7 billion in borrowing capacity. EXCHANGE STABILIZATION FUND The Treasury could dip into this seldom-used $50 billion fund earmarked to stabilize currency rates. Created during the Great Depression of the 1930s, the fund was last used as a backstop to guarantee money market mutual funds during the worst part of the financial crisis from September 2008 to September 2009. The GAO study estimated that this could increase borrowing capacity by $20.4 billion. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES INVESTMENT FUND To free up cash, the Treasury can halt reinvestment of another federal employee pension fund known as the G-Fund, which had net assets of about $125 billion at the end of 2010 invested in special short-term Treasury securities with maturities of one to four days. Normally, maturing assets in the G-Fund are reinvested daily. But the Treasury has statutory authority to retain a portion of the fund, as long as it provides proper notification and reimbursement for any lost earnings from the move. Such a move could temporarily claw back $122.3 billion in borrowing capacity. SWAP FEDERAL FINANCING BANK DEBT The Federal Financing Bank can issue up to $15 billion in debt on behalf of other government agencies that is not subject to the debt limit. So the Treasury could exchange FFB debt for other debt to reduce the total amount subject to the limit. However, based on August 31 data, the GAO said this offered just $4.8 billion in remaining borrowing capacity. ACCELERATE ASSET SALES The government could raise money by selling off chunks of companies it bailed out under its $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. However, Geithner said this was not a viable option because taxpayers could end up suffering losses from a "fire sale" of financial assets. He also said selling U.S. gold could undermine confidence in the United States. Still, the Treasury is planning a stock offering in insurer American International Group Inc this spring that had been expected to top $15 billion. The government's 1.66 billion AIG common shares, however, have taken a hit in recent weeks from market turmoil caused by the Libyan conflict and worries about insured losses from Japan's earthquake. They are now worth about $61.5 billion, compared with $87.4 billion at their peak in January. All net proceeds would go to the government. The Treasury also anticipates IPOs this year in automaker Chrysler Holdings and lender Ally Financial Inc, formerly GMAC. It can resume selling General Motors shares after a lock-up agreement expires in May. The Treasury soon will begin to sell down the $142 billion portfolio of mortgage-backed securities it acquired to combat the financial crisis, bringing in about $10 billion a month to federal coffers over the next year. It said, however, that these will not "meaningfully extend" the time before it reaches the debt ceiling. For details see [ID:nN21186232]. HOPE FOR HIGHER TAX RECEIPTS The Treasury also could stave off its debt limit reckoning if tax receipts come in higher than expected due to stronger economic growth. Receipts in the first five months of fiscal 2011 were up about 9 percent -- a $68 billion increase -- versus the year-earlier period. Outlays in the same period were up $58 billion, or 4 percent, but tax cuts approved last year are expected to widen deficits -- and borrowing needs -- through the end of the current fiscal year. Stronger economic growth, increased employment and a rising stock market would produce more income, reducing the need to fund government operations with debt. But the Treasury's latest projects are based on receipts from the current tax filing season, which is now reaching its peak.
