 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama has invited top Democratic and Republican lawmakers to a meeting on Tuesday about the budget, the White House said. 

 House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democratic, were among those invited to the meeting, which comes as the White House and lawmakers struggle to work out a budget deal to avert a potential government shutdown.
