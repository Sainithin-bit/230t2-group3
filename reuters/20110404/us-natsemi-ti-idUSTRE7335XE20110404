 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N plans to buy smaller rival National Semiconductor ( NSM.N ) for about $6.5 billion in one of the microchip industry's largest deals in years. 

 Commentary: BRIAN COLELLO, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR "It's very surprising. Texas Instruments has made some shrewd investments to expand their production capacity in an attempt to gain growth organically. We thought that would drive growth. "Analog (chip) acquisitions of this size are fairly rare, so this deal is surprising to us. "It will improve TI's position in power management chips, that's where National has particular strength. I'm very curious to hear what they say on the call on their strategy of combining the two firms." (Reporting by  Bill Rigby )
