 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan will not hesitate to buy more government bonds from the market if needed to calm the markets, as the country's economy may contract in the fiscal year beginning in April due to damage from last month's devastating earthquake, a former senior BOJ official said on Monday. 

 While the yen is likely to weaken medium to long term as the BOJ maintains its ultra-loose monetary policy, the Group of Seven nations will likely step into the currency market again if the yen spikes at an alarming rate once more, said Eiji Hirano, who as executive director at the Japanese central bank attended numerous G7 gatherings. "The markets are still unstable. In the event of severe market turmoil, the G7 nations may jointly intervene again," Hirano told Reuters in an interview. Hirano, who left the BOJ in 2006 but still has close ties with central bankers across the globe, is now executive vice president of Toyota Financial Services, the financial arm of Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ).
