 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Monday that a tentative plan to cut $33 billion from the budget is "not enough" in a sign that negotiators were having trouble reaching a deal to keep the government running beyond a Friday deadline. 

 "I've made clear that their $33 billion is not enough and many of the cuts that the White House and Senate Democrats are talking about are full of smoke and mirrors. That's unacceptable," Boehner, the top Republican in Congress, said in a statement. (Reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Will Dunham )
