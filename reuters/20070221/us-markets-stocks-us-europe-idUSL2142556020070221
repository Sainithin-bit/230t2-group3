 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stocks on Wall Street are expected to open a touch lower on Wednesday as investors await latest inflation data, with little on the earnings calendar. 


 By 1042 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening dips of between 0.05 and 0.07 percent for the three main indexes: SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. The U.S. Consumer Price Index for January will be released at 1330 GMT. "It's the event of the day, really, so far as the U.S. market is concerned," said Peter Dixon, economist at Commerzbank. "But ultimately it's not something which the markets are that fixated on now because the Fed signaled that whilst inflation remains a concern, it is likely to tail off over the course of 2007." Stocks rallied last week when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told the Senate that he thinks inflation pressures are easing and the U.S. economy should grow moderately. The Fed will release minutes from its January meeting at 1900 GMT but Dixon said the market would not expect much new guidance as Bernanke had telegraphed the bank's message last week. The other major economic event of the day has already happened, with the Bank of Japan raising interest rates to 0.5 percent, the highest in ten years. "I wonder if there will be any after-effects," Dixon said. "But it doesn't seem to have a major impact on markets. It's a mixed picture in Europe." U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, supported by slackening oil prices, a flurry of merger deals and strong earnings from Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ). After Tuesday's slew of corporate earnings, the diary on Wednesday is very light. Results are due from Medco Health Solutions MHS.N and Whole Foods Market WFMI.O. Weakening oil prices may play a role on Wall Street again. U.S. crude  was down for the third straight day at 1042 GMT, falling 67 cents to $58.18, though it remained in a narrow trading range.
