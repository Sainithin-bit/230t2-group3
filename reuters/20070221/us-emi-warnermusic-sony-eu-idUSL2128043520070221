 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Warner Music's WMG.N decision to approach EMI Group EMI.L may strike a sour note for music rivals Sony ( 6758.T ) and BMG BERT.UL as they try to win approval from the European Commission for their own merger. 


 But Warner's bid may just be background noise as the EU's competition regulator focuses intently on deciding a case with more ups and downs than Robbie Williams's career. The Commission is deciding on the Sony-BMG merger for the second time. In an unexpected and rare move, an EU court threw out its first approval last year, ruling the Commission lacked hard data to prove its points. This time, Brussels has wallpapered the music industry with requests for information and is being inundated with responses. Against this backdrop, Warner has approached EMI about a possible deal, potentially complicating the Commission's task. The question is whether EU regulators must take a potential Warner-EMI tie-up, which has not yet been notified to Brussels, into account when deciding on Sony BMG. If so, the Commission would have to think about how a market with five big players would change if two firms merged out of existence instead of just one. "I would be very much surprised if the Commission didn't think that this might end up (shrinking from) five to three and that they had better contemplate that possibility," said a competition lawyer in Brussels who asked not to be identified. Any time a competition authority sees a potential reduction of two players in a market with four, five or six companies, it looks more closely -- and alarm bells sometimes go off. That happened in the United States in 1998 when two sets of drug wholesalers were forced to call off their mergers after a court ruled against them, and in Europe with a similar case involving large accountancy mergers at about the same time. SPLIT DECISION Lawyers don't agree which course the Commission should take. "My view is that they (Sony BMG and Warner-EMI) are separate," said a London competition lawyer, who asked not to be identified. "After all, look at the timing." The Commission could argue the Sony BMG case dates back to 2004 while Warner-EMI only surfaced in 2007. If it follows that reasoning, Brussels would probably conclude it should decide on Sony BMG before turning to any Warner-EMI deal. Another factor in both cases is an independent group of mostly small music publishers and record producers, Impala. The indies' trade group shocked the music industry by convincing the EU Court of First Instance in July 2006 to overturn the Commission's approval of the Sony BMG deal. It feared that a concentration of music majors would marginalize its members' ability to compete. The court found the Commission had failed to marshal sufficient facts to show that the deal would not harm competition. But Impala has agreed to support a Warner-EMI deal because Warner said it would take steps to help the independent sector through a possible sale of assets including labels. It will also help industry groups that work with independent producers, Impala's chairman, Martin Mills, said. "This could be hugely important," Mills said. "This is an agreed solution (for the European regulators). This provides a solution that all the parties are happy with and I would have thought that they would welcome that."
