 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said on Wednesday U.S. interest rates appeared well positioned, but that the central bank would be faster to strike against rising inflation than it would be to move to bolster growth. 


 "The economy is very evenly balanced. I think that a standard forecast for GDP is around 3 percent growth with inflation rate gradually tilting down," Poole said in an interview with Bloomberg Television, referring to gross domestic product. "As long as that situation prevails, the current interest rate environment, as far as I'm concerned, can stay right where it is," he added. Poole, who is among the voters this year on the U.S. central bank's policy-setting panel, said the Fed would not hesitate to strike against inflation, given the importance of the central bank's price-stability objective. "We will be more ready to act, I think, if news comes out on the unfortunate side of inflation not coming down, than we would for news coming down on the other side," he said. "But the prospects, it seems to me, are pretty equally balanced for where the economy is going to go."
