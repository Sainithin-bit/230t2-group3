 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) said on Wednesday it would buy privately held Reactivity Inc., a maker of equipment used in computer networks, for $135 million as part of an effort to diversify from its core business of making routers and switches. 


 Reactivity specializes in XML (eXtensible Markup Language), a standard for Web documents. It was founded in 1998 and has 56 employees in Redwood City, California, according to Cisco. Cisco said it expects the deal to close in its fiscal third quarter, which ends April 28. The acquisition is part of Cisco's efforts to broaden its product line -- through acquisitions of small, niche technology companies -- to offer "end to end" services, meaning Cisco products would help deliver, process and receive information. Cisco said the purchase price for Reactivity includes cash and assumed options. Over the past few years, Cisco has acquired a wide range of companies, including wireless router maker Linksys, cable set-top box maker Scientific-Atlanta, and Internet security firm IronPort.
