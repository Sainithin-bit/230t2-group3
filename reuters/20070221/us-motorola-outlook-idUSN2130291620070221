 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N, the world's second-biggest maker of mobile phones, expects the first half of 2007 to be "rocky" before improving in the second half, Chief Financial Officer David Devonshire said on Wednesday. 


 Motorola reported disappointing fourth-quarter results last month, hurt by a sharp fall in phone prices as it tried to hold on to market share amid stiff competition. It had said it hoped to return operating margins to the double-digit percentage range in the second half of 2007. "We've got some work to do. I think we'll have a couple of rocky quarters. In the second half of the year you'll see some improvements," Devonshire said at a Bank of America technology conference, adding that the company expects improvements as it introduces more profitable products in volume. Asked about first-quarter profit margins, Devonshire would not give a specific forecast but said: "It's not going to be good." He added, "But I don't see this as a terminal illness by any means." In late January, billionaire investor Carl Icahn said he had taken a stake in Motorola and intended to seek a seat on the board with the aim of convincing the company to accelerate its share buy-back program. Devonshire did not say whether Motorola would agree to Icahn's demand. "He really hasn't asked us for anything yet, so I would say we're going to be communicating directly with him over the time frame and we'll see what happens," said the executive. Motorola shares were down 29 cents or 1.5 percent at $18.88 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
