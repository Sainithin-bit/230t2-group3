 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), the No. 1 manufacturer of PCs and printers, fell 4 percent on Wednesday after its quarterly results underwhelmed some investors and raised questions about its growth momentum. 


 HP said late on Tuesday that profit rose 26 percent in the first quarter ended on January 31, helped by strength in its personal computing businesses. But some analysts said it might be tough for HP to repeat its strong performance in the current period because inventories of its products had risen in the last quarter, meaning that distributors and retailers might reduce purchases. "There were some concerns about inventory build up," said Raymond James analyst Brian Alexander, adding that the concerns arose as analysts crunched the numbers from HP's financials and questioned company executives. "I think the quarter was lower quality than it initially appeared," he said. To be sure, Alexander raised his price target on the stock to $46.50 from $45, saying he believes the shares are only taking "a breather" and should bounce back from Wednesday's decline. HP shares were down $1.73 at $41.40 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade, the biggest fall in the stock since September. The shares are still trading within sight of their more than six-year high of $43.72, hit in January.
