 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. mortgage applications dropped more than 5 percent last week to their lowest level this year even as interest rates fell, an industry trade group said on Wednesday. 


 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and purchasing loans, fell 5.2 percent to 606.6 in the week ended February 16. Applications, however, were 4.9 percent higher than a year earlier. The four-week moving average of applications, which smoothes out the volatile weekly data, was down 0.2 percent. James O'Sullivan, economist at UBS Securities in Stamford, Connecticut, said the indexes tend to be volatile on a weekly basis, but still sees weakness in the overall housing market. "There are some signs of bottoming in sales, but that's not to say that housing activity is at its bottom yet," he said. "There are lags in construction spending and construction employment, nor are we necessarily seeing the bottom in home prices," he added. "Very broadly, I wouldn't say we have hit bottom in housing even if home sales have." Many analysts view the housing market as a key factor in Federal Reserve interest rate policy. "There's more fallout to come and I think ... growth will be a bit weaker than the Fed projections show," he said. O'Sullivan expects the Fed to ease rates at its May meeting after leaving them steady since last June, primarily due to the direct and indirect effects of the housing sector slowdown. The next Fed policy-making meeting will be on March 20-21. Borrowing costs on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, excluding fees, averaged 6.19 percent, down 0.05 percentage point from the previous week. Interest rates were slightly below year-ago levels of 6.22 percent. The MBA's seasonally adjusted purchase index, which is considered a timely gauge of U.S. home sales, fell 4.8 percent to 381.4, its lowest since the week ended October 27, 2006, when it stood at 375.6. The index was also below its year-ago level of 408.7, a fall of 6.7 percent. REFINANCING SKIDS Borrowing costs on long-term mortgages are widely considered to be historically low and with an abundance of adjustable-rate mortgages resetting in 2007, consumers holding these loans have been refinancing into fixed-rate loans. While demand for home loan refinancing lost its luster last week, it was sharply above its year-ago level. The group's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications slid 5.4 percent to 1,921.1, up 22.3 percent from a year ago when the index stood at 1,571.4. The refinance share of applications decreased to 44.9 percent from 46.1 percent the previous week. Fixed 15-year mortgage rates averaged 5.88 percent, down from 5.94 percent. Rates on one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, increased to 5.81 percent from 5.80 percent. The ARM share of activity was unchanged at 21.2 percent. U.S. housing industry indexes, in general, tend to be volatile, and in recent months have painted a mixed picture, with some pointing to weakening and others to stabilization. The MBA's survey covers about 50 percent of all U.S. retail residential loans. Respondents include mortgage banks, commercial banks and thrifts.
