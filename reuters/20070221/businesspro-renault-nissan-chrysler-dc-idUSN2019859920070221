 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Neither Renault ( RENA.PA ) nor Nissan 
Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) are interested in buying DaimlerChrysler 
AG's DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group, the Wall Street Journal 
reported late on Tuesday. 


  The French and Japanese car makers would like to have a 
North American partner join their alliance but aren't 
interested in buying or linking up with Chrysler, the paper 
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  Those same people said that Renault's chief financial 
officer Thierry Moulonguet told institutional investors in 
London last week that Renault and Nissan were not interested in 
expanding their alliance to include Chrysler in any manner, 
either by acquiring a stake or by buying it outright, the paper 
said.
