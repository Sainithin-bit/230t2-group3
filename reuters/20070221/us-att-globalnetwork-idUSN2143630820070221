 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) said on Wednesday it would provide global networking services to General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) under a five-year contract worth nearly $1 billion. 


 The pact expands on an existing deal and is one of the largest commercial contracts in AT&T's history, the company said. In addition to normal telecommunications services, AT&T will also manage GM's global information technology (IT) systems, overseeing the automaker's various IT suppliers around the world to ensure their various systems work together. An existing contract has been in effect since 1999, and GM and AT&T have been working over the past few years to come up with an expanded relationship that consolidates its various services and which can respond to GM's expansion overseas. "It brings simplicity to the overall model and it allows GM to design, engineer and ship cars from anywhere in the world," Ron Spears, executive vice president, global business sales, told Reuters in a phone interview. Enterprise revenue, or sales to business customers, have been one of the weak points at AT&T, which has enjoyed strong earnings growth on the back of higher wireless and high-speed Internet subscriptions. But the segment saw some improvement in the fourth quarter, with revenue down 3.7 percent year-on-year compared with a fall of 5.1 percent in the third quarter. The company says it expects enterprise revenue to return to growth in 2008.
