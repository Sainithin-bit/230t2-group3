 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein received more than $54.3 million in cash, stock and options last year, setting a record for Wall Street CEO remuneration after leading the most profitable investment bank for just six months. 


 Blankfein, 52, named CEO in June after Henry "Hank" Paulson quit to become U.S. Treasury Secretary, earned $600,000 in salary and a cash bonus of $27.2 million, according to a proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday. He also received $15.7 million in restricted stock, options valued at $10.5 million and $261,906 for perks such as a car, driver and financial counseling, plus $82,876 in contributions to his pension, insurance and other benefit plans. Excluding options, Blankfein's cash and stock pay rose 42 percent from 2005, when he was Goldman's president. "Don't get me wrong: it is a large amount, and people want to be outraged, but this is a perfect example of executive pay tracking company performance," said Bill Coleman, chief compensation officer at Salary.com. Goldman had a standout year in 2006, with earnings surging 70 percent to a record $9.4 billion. Its stock price rose 50 percent during the fiscal year ended November 30, more than double that of the Amex Securities Broker-Dealer Index .XBD. Goldman set aside a jaw-dropping $16 billion for bonuses, with Blankfein's cash and stock bonuses exceeding previous records held by Merrill Lynch MER.N CEO Stanley O'Neal, at $47.3 million in bonuses, and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) chief John Mack, at $40 million. These rival CEOs even fell short of the riches heaped on Goldman Co-Presidents Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried, who each received $52.4 million in bonuses, stock and options. Combining salary, bonuses and stock, Cohn received $53.2 million in compensation last year. Before his promotion, Cohn, 46, was co-head of Goldman's global securities trading. Winkelried, 47, earned nearly $53.3 million in total pay last year. He was co-head of investment banking before moving up in June. Blankfein, who rose through the ranks as a trader and helped build Goldman's giant fixed-income business, did not exercise any stock options last year, though he held more than $63 million in in-the-money options at the end of November. Paulson, who had led Goldman since its initial public offering in 1999, last year earned $19.2 million in salary and bonus, but he received no restricted stock or options. He realized $34.9 million by exercising options. Goldman discloses its windfall pay packages at a time when shareholders and governance groups accuse companies of overpaying executives. With annual meetings scheduled over the next few months, several fund managers and pension groups are pushing companies to give shareholders a voice in setting pay.
