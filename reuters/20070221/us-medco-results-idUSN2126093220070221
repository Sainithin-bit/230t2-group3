 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. drug benefit manager Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N on Wednesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong demand for mail-delivered generic medicines and raised its 2007 outlook, sending its shares up more than 11 percent to an all-time high. 


 Medco, which also forecast at least a 20 percent rise in earnings for 2008 and expanded its share buyback program, said it stood to benefit from the takeover battle for rival Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N. Both drugstore chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) and benefit manager Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ) are bidding for Caremark. "Today's earnings announcement is consistent with our investment view that Medco has the strongest business momentum of the three independent" pharmacy benefit managers, Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher McFadden said in a research note. Medco shares jumped $7.01, or 11.4 percent, to $68.60 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $68.82 earlier in the session. Pharmacy benefit managers administer drug benefits for employers and health insurers and also operate large mail-order pharmacies. Medco's fourth-quarter net income rose to $228.8 million, or 77 cents per share, from $176.8 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding 9 cents per share in amortization of intangible assets, earnings were 86 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 79 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 1.2 percent to $10.9 billion. Medco processed 187.5 million prescriptions on an adjusted basis, down 3.6 percent from a year earlier, but up 3.8 percent when accounting for an extra week in the year-ago period. Generic drugs accounted for 47.4 percent of all mail-order prescriptions, up 5.3 percentage points from a year earlier. The increase helped drive overall gross margin to 6.3 percent from 5.3 percent a year earlier. More than half of Medco's profits are derived from delivering generic drugs by mail, according to the company. Medco can get low prices from generic manufacturers and capture more of the overall profit by dispensing the drugs itself, while its clients also seek greater use of lower-cost generics to cut their overall drug bills. EARLY OUTLOOK SEEN POSITIVE The company forecast 2007 earnings per share of $3.31 to $3.40, excluding items, up from both its prior view of $3.12 to $3.19 and 2006 profit of $2.78. Analysts expected $3.16 per share for 2007. The new outlook represents a growth rate of about 19 percent to 22 percent over 2006. About two-thirds of the higher forecast stems from improved fundamental performance, with share repurchases driving the rest, Chief Executive Officer David Snow said. Snow said Medco's 2008 forecast does not include any potential business gained because of the Caremark merger. Potential clients are worried about any service disruptions caused by an acquisition by either CVS or Express Scripts, Snow said in an interview. "By issuing 2008 guidance so early, management is indicating its confidence that (industry) fundamentals will remain strong in 2008 and that Medco can compete in the new competitive landscape," Wachovia analyst Matt Perry said in a research note. The company also said its board authorized it to buy back $3 billion more of its shares over the next two years, bringing the total amount of the authorization to $5.5 billion. Jack White, director of research for Todd Investment Advisors, said the market was likely applauding the share repurchases, along with the quarterly profit surprise and the increased forecast. "Companies that have the excess cash to do share repurchases are showing the financial strength the market really likes right now," White said.
