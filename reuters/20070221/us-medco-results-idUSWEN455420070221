 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drug benefit manager Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N on Wednesday reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on strong demand for mail-delivered generic medicines and raised its 2007 outlook, sending its shares to an all-time high. 


 Medco, which also forecast a 20 percent rise in earnings for 2008, said it stood to benefit from the takeover battle for rival Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N. Both drug store chain CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) and benefit manager Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ) are bidding for Caremark. "Today's earnings announcement is consistent with our investment view that Medco has the strongest business momentum of the three independent" pharmacy benefit managers," Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher McFadden said in a research note. Pharmacy benefit managers administer drug benefits for employers and health insurers and also operate large mail-order pharmacies. Medco's fourth-quarter net income rose to $228.8 million, or 77 cents per share, from $176.8 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding 9 cents per share in amortization of intangible assets, earnings were 86 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected 79 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 1.2 percent to $10.9 billion. Medco processed 187.5 million prescriptions on an adjusted basis, down 3.6 percent from a year earlier, but up 3.8 percent when accounting for an extra week in the year-ago period. Generic drugs accounted for 47.4 percent of all mail-order prescriptions, up 5.3 percentage points from a year earlier. The increase helped drive overall gross margin to 6.3 percent from 5.3 percent a year earlier. More than half of Medco's profits are derived from delivering generic drugs by mail, according to the company. Medco can get low prices from generic manufacturers and capture more of the overall profits by dispensing the drugs itself, while its clients also seek greater use of lower-cost generics to cut their overall drug bills. The company forecast 2007 earnings per share of $3.31 to $3.40, excluding items, up from both its prior view of $3.12 to $3.19 and 2006 profit of $2.78. Analysts expected $3.16 per share for 2007. The new outlook represents a growth rate of about 19 percent to 22 percent over 2006. About two-thirds of the higher forecast stems from improved fundamental performance, with share repurchases driving the rest, Chief Executive Officer David Snow said. The company also said its board authorized it to buy back $3 billion more of its shares over the next two years, bringing the total amount of the authorization to $5.5 billion. Medco shares were up $4.41, or 7.2 percent, at $66 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade after rising as high as $67.10 earlier in the session.
