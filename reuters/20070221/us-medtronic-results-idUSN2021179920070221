 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday as demand for its spine, vascular and neurology products offset weak sales of its implantable devices to control dangerously fast heartbeats. 


 Its shares fell 2.8 percent in after-hours trading. Medtronic said the market for ICDs -- implantable cardioverter defibrillators that can save lives by shocking racing hearts back to normal rhythm -- is not rebounding as quickly as anticipated. "It is taking longer to recover than we had estimated," Medtronic Chief Executive Art Collins said in an interview. High-profile ICD recalls in 2005 and 2006 by Guidant Corp., now a unit of Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ), hurt demand for the devices as physicians and patients weighed concern about device reliability. Analysts had predicted the ICD market was poised to bounce back after Medtronic and competitors Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) and St. Jude Medical Inc. ( STJ.N ) all posted better-than-expected sales of the devices last quarter. Medtronic also acknowledged losing market share to rival ICD makers in the quarter. The Minneapolis-based medical device maker posted a net profit of $710 million, or 61 cents per share, for its fiscal third quarter, compared with a profit of $670 million, or 55 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected 58 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter revenue rose 10 percent to $3.05 billion. Sales of ICDs, Medtronic's largest product line, fell 2 percent to $711 million, below many analysts' forecasts. "This was a flat-out disappointment to come in roughly $60 million light of expectations. That's a fairly sizable bogey to miss by," said David Heupel, portfolio manager for Thrivent Investment Management, which owns Medtronic shares. Analyst Jason Wittes of Leerink Swann said Medtronic's ICD sales cast doubt on prospects for a market recovery in the near term. "I think it's a little too early to call it a bottom here," he said. Collins predicted growth in the U.S. ICD market would rebound to the high-single-digit rate in the company's next fiscal year and could return to double digits going forward. He said Medtronic expects to regain market share this quarter after losing "several points" in the third quarter, a period in which it has historically lost share, versus the second quarter. The company ended the quarter with 53 percent of the U.S. ICD market and 52 percent of the worldwide market. "We expect that we will improve market share in the fourth fiscal quarter that we are in now," Collins said. Medtronic said its revenue in the overall Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management business, which also includes pacemakers, rose 2 percent to $1.29 billion. Spinal revenue rose 12 percent, and revenue from vascular products including stents to treat clogged arteries increased 29 percent. Neurological revenue rose 17 percent and diabetes revenue increased 24 percent. "The results are still pretty solid," said Eric Schoenstein, co-portfolio manager of Jensen Portfolio mutual fund, which has about 1.9 million Medtronic shares. "They're not necessarily reliant on any one business to drive growth. It's what's allowed them to withstand disappointments on the ICD side." Medtronic narrowed its earnings per share forecast for fiscal 2007, raising the low end of its previous outlook while lowering the top end of its revenue projection. Medtronic now expects earnings of $2.34 to $2.38 per share on revenue of $12.2 billion to $12.4 billion. It had previously forecast earnings of $2.30 to $2.38 per share and revenue of $12.2 billion to $12.6 billion. Shares of Medtronic fell 2.8 percent to $53.00 in after-market trading on Tuesday, from a close of $54.54 on the New York Stock Exchange. Medtronic shares fell about 7 percent in 2006, lagging well behind the S&P 500 Index  .SPX , which rose more than 13 percent last year. (Additional reporting by  Bill Berkrot  in New York)
