 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A key forecasting gauge for the U.S. economy rose for the second straight month, but at a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in January, a report from a private research group said on Wednesday. 


 The rise in the U.S. Composite Index of Leading Economic Indicators was short of market expectations for a 0.2 percent gain and followed a sharp, upwardly revised 0.6 percent gain in December, the Conference Board said. The December rise was the largest since 0.9 percent in November 2005. U.S. government debt prices shrugged off the slight rise in the index, but were already lower on Wednesday on stronger-than-expected gains in consumer prices. The latest figures suggest that slow to moderate economic growth is likely to continue in the near term, the board said. "Despite the hike in energy prices and the slump in housing, the economy remains resilient - especially consumer demand," Ken Goldstein, Conference Board economist, said in a statement. "This resiliency is still evidenced in the first quarter of 2007 and the latest data for the index points to a continuation in the second quarter, or even a little more growth," Goldstein said. The coincident index, a barometer of current economic performance, rose 0.1 percent in January after a 0.2 percent rise in December. The lagging index, which measures past trends in the economy, fell 0.1 percent in January after a 0.8 percent rise in December. This was the first drop since July, when it fell 0.3 percent. The leading index, which measures a basket of economic indicators ranging from unemployment insurance claims to building permits, is designed to forecast economic trends up to six months ahead. Four of the ten indicators that make up the leading index increased in January -- real money supply, index of consumer expectations, jobless claims and stock prices. The negative contributors were average weekly manufacturing hours, building permits, manufacturers' new orders for nondefense capital goods, interest rate spread, vendor performance and manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods and materials.
