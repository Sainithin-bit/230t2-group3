 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan raised its main interest rate on Wednesday by a quarter percentage point to 0.50 percent, the highest in more than a decade, but the yen retreated as the central bank signaled caution on further increases. 


 The BOJ, whose board members voted 8-1 for the rise, said the economy was likely to continue growing and it would make further rate adjustments only gradually. BOJ Governor Toshihiko Fukui, in a news conference, echoed that view and said the central bank does not have specific schedules in mind for future rate hikes, such as consecutive rate rises. In pushing up the cost of money, at a time when many politicians have expressed concern about the Japanese economy, the central bank has underlined its independence. But, ironically, that too could be a bad omen for the yen. Analysts believe the BOJ's hawkish stance now might influence the Japanese government when it nominates future board members in two months, as the terms of two of the nine board members expire then. Glenn Maguire, chief economist at SG Hong Kong, said the likelihood of further rate rises had been reduced. "It will be difficult to do anything before the second half of this year," he said. "By moving against the government's clear stance on interest rates, the likelihood is that more dovish members will be nominated to the board." The government, playing down the idea of any rift, said it monetary policy was up to the BOJ. "I understand the BOJ reached its conclusion after a thorough examination and discussion," Japanese Finance Minister Koji Omi told parliament. "I'd like to respect that decision." But a ruling party heavyweight, Hidenao Nakagawa, was quick to say the BOJ would be held responsible for its rate hike decision. Japanese politicians are sensitive about the economy ahead of the parliament's upper house election in July. The rise marks the third major policy move in less than a year. Last March, the BOJ ended its so-called quantitative easing policy of pumping excess money into the banking system. In July it followed up with a rate rise to 0.25 percent from virtually zero, the first rate increase in six years. TOUGH CALL The yen went on a roller-coaster ride, strengthening half a yen to around 119.75 per dollar just after the rate rise but then losing all of its gains as the market digested the BOJ comments and reckoned this could be the last move for some time. After Fukui's news conference, it weakened further to around 120.60 per dollar by 0815 GMT, off more than three quarters of a yen from the day's highs. A Reuters survey of 59 market participants, conducted after the BOJ decision, showed 25 expect the BOJ to boost the overnight call rate to 0.75 percent in the July-September quarter while 26 see the second hike in last three months of this year. The market had been divided over whether the BOJ would move to head off economic risks that arise from having ultra-cheap money rates for too long. "It was an appropriate decision," said Yasuhiro Onakado, chief economist at Daiwa SB Investments. "There was a growing sense that the U.S. economy will be able to achieve a soft landing, and Japan's fourth-quarter GDP data came out very strong. That gave the BOJ a very easy-to-understand explanation for raising rates." Japan's interest rates, despite Wednesday's move, are still well below benchmark rates in the United States, at 5.25 percent, or the euro zone, at 3.5 percent. The wide gap in rates has encouraged investors to sell yen in recent months in favor of the dollar or euro. The yen this month hit record lows against the euro and approached four-year lows against the dollar. In January, the yen fell to a 21-year low on a traded-weighted and inflation-adjusted basis. LONGEST RECOVERY Japan's economy is now in its longest post-war growth period. Growth accelerated to an annualized 4.8 percent in October-December from 0.3 percent in the previous quarter, thanks to a rise in personal consumption. But there has been scant evidence of inflation after seven years of debilitating deflation. Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile fresh food prices, in December were just 0.1 percent higher than a year earlier. Such mixed economic signals in recent months have made politicians nervous that the current expansion -- despite its longevity -- could peter out, just as so many other recoveries have since the early 1990s. Indeed, the BOJ, in a monthly report released after the decision, said growth would be moderate and core inflation would be near zero in the short run. But the central bank wants to avoid the mistakes that past policy makers have made, when they left credit policy too easy and sparked asset price bubbles that ultimately led to economic downturns. "The stimulative effect of easy monetary policy on the economy has been very strong, as seen in rising stock prices and the weakness of the yen," said Onakado of Daiwa SB.
