 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Higher-than-expected U.S. consumer prices last month chilled hopes that the Federal Reserve will drop a policy bias to hike interest rates and served a terse reminder that inflation remains a threat. 


 Economists said the rise would not prompt immediate action from the U.S. central bank, which has voiced guarded optimism that price pressures were heading down, but it reduced the likelihood that the Fed will cut rates any time soon. "It appears that the deceleration in core inflation that was evident in October and November has come to a halt," wrote Morgan Stanley economists David Greenlaw and Ted Wiesman. "This means that the Fed will maintain a tightening bias -- but probably not act unless there are clearer signs of a pick-up in core inflation," they said in a note to clients. The Department of Labor said on Wednesday that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in January, while the core non-food, non-energy index climbed 0.3 percent. In both cases, the rise was one-tenth of a percentage point higher than forecast by analysts, lifting the gain in core CPI since January 2006 to 2.7 percent. This is well above the comfort zone voiced by a number of Fed policymakers for core inflation to remain in a range of 1 percent to 2 percent. The U.S. central bank has held interest rates steady at 5.25 percent since June, but has warned that inflation risks remain and might warrant additional rate hikes. The jump in last month's core CPI compared with 0.1 percent rises in November and December and was driven mainly by a spike in medical costs by the widest margin in 15 years. On the other hand, owners' equivalent rent, which is a measure of the cost of home ownership and makes up almost a third of the core index, rose by only 0.2 percent, down from 0.3 percent and 0.4 percent, respectively, in the preceding two months. PRICE PROBLEMS Economists acknowledged that the data was mixed and probably influenced by seasonal factors, but felt the underlying message for policymakers was very clear. "Slice and dice these numbers as you please, the reality is that inflation remains a problem for the Fed," said Joel Naroff at Naroff Economic Advisers. "That means the Fed will remain on inflation watch for quite some time. Whether the bond market wants to accept that is another story. But investors should not assume that inflation has gone away," he said. U.S. government bond prices fell and yields rose on the data, and the chances reflected in interest rates futures of a rate cut in either August or September retreated slightly. Bernard Baumohl at The Economic Outlook Group in New Jersey said the Fed would stay on hold until the middle of the year while it weighed inflation data against developments in labor productivity, which has slowed. "What will determine Fed monetary policy after that can be summed up in one question: Is the economy's productive capacity increasing fast enough to pay for higher wages? "If the growth in productivity and profits fall behind wage increases, the risk of more serious inflation increases and Fed will have to step in and raise rates," he said.
