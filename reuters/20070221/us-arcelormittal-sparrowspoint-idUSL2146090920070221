 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mittal Steel ( MT.N ), ordered by the U.S. Justice Department to sell a plant in Maryland, is expected to draw bids for the facility from big companies in China, Russia and India, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 


 The antitrust authorities said the sale of the plant in Sparrows Point, near Baltimore, would remedy concerns about competition arising from the deal that created Arcelor Mittal ( ISPA.AS )CELR.PA, the world's largest steel company. The paper said bidders could include India-based JSW Steel Ltd. or Ispat Industries Ltd. ISPT.BO or Russia's Evraz Group HK1q.L or OAO Severstal Group ( CHMF.MM ), both of which already own U.S. operations. China's Wuhan Steel Corp. and Anshan Iron & Steel Group Corp. also have a good deal of cash and are considering expanding, the paper said. The paper reported that other potential bidders are Germany's ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ), which was unsuccessful in buying Canada's Dofasco Inc., and Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica Nacional ( CSNA3.SA ), which failed in its attempt to buy Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp. WPSC.O. A spokesman for ThyssenKrupp, which has expressed interest in acquiring firms only that fit well with its focus on high-quality carbon flat steel, reaffirmed it had "no interest" in Sparrows Point. The German steelmaker had hoped the U.S. Justice Department would require Mittal to divest Dofasco -- a specialist in high-quality carbon flat steel -- to address competition concerns. The European steelmaker won a bidding war with ThyssenKrupp over Dofasco, coveted by both for its strong business ties in the United States to high-end customers such as Honda Motor ( 7267.T ) and its access to captive iron ore assets. Prior to the announcement of its bid for Arcelor, Mittal contractually agreed to sell Dofasco to ThyssenKrupp should it succeed in buying Arcelor -- a move that would have gained U.S. antitrust approval for the deal. During the ensuing takeover battle, however, Arcelor placed Dofasco in the independent control of a Dutch foundation, and the latter has refused to dissolve the arrangement and allow the sale, despite the merger of Arcelor and Mittal.
