 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. 
( TAH.AX ) posted a 3.6 percent fall in first-half profit 
Tuesday, partly due to the impact of smoking bans at its 
casinos, and ruled out major acquisitions until its performance 
improved. 


  "Merger and acquisition activity and international moves 
are off the agenda until we get these businesses delivering 
better results," Chief Executive Matthew Slatter said in a 
statement.  Tabcorp, Australia's largest gaming group, said net profit 
excluding one-off items for the six months to December 31 was 
A$270.3 million ($212.8 million).  Three analysts on average were expecting a net profit of 
A$284 million for the Melbourne-based company, which owns four 
of Australia's 13 casinos.  Tabcorp shares closed on Tuesday at A$17.75 and have risen 
17 percent since end-June, in line with an 18 percent rise in 
the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 .AXJO index.  Tabcorp had been looking for new growth opportunities after 
its former takeover target, UNiTAB, merged with Australia's top 
lottery operator Tattersall's Ltd. ( TTS.AX ).  It had been in talks with Richard Branson's Virgin Group 
about a casino and resort development project in Macau but 
sources said this week it was unlikely a deal would go ahead.  Slatter said the outlook for the rest of the year was 
challenging, particularly for its casinos division due to 
smoking bans in pubs and clubs.  ($1=A$1.27)
