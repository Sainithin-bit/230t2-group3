 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JetBlue Airways Corp. ( JBLU.O ) said on Wednesday the huge number of flight cancellations it suffered last week would result in a wider-than-expected loss for the first quarter and would cut full-year profit. 


 The low-cost airline, which canceled some 1,200 flights after an ice storm disrupted its New York operations on February 14, has already said the cancellations will cost it $30 million or more. Its shares rose 3.4 percent to $13.32 in early Nasdaq trade, recovering some of Tuesday's 4.9 percent fall. The shares are now trading above where they were on February 13, before the ice storm. The airline's chief executive, David Neeleman, has spent the past few days doing a round of television appearances, apologizing repeatedly to customers. The company took out full-page ads in the New York Times, New York Post and Daily News on Wednesday, saying it was "sorry and embarrassed" about its performance. Early on Wednesday, JetBlue said it expects a first-quarter pretax margin of negative 10 percent to negative 8 percent. On January 30, it said it expected that margin to be negative 4 percent to negative 2 percent. The carrier said it now expects a first-quarter operating margin -- which does not include some other costs and sources of income -- of between negative 4 percent and negative 2 percent, based on an assumed aircraft fuel cost of $1.89 per gallon, net of hedges. Its previous forecast was for an operating profit margin of 2 percent to 4 percent, based on slightly higher fuel costs. Wall Street's forecast, which is not directly comparable to JetBlue's guidance, was for a first-quarter loss of 10 cents per share, excluding one-time items, according to Reuters Estimates. The airline had already warned it would make a loss for the quarter due to higher costs. For the full year, JetBlue forecast a pretax margin of between 3 percent and 5 percent. On January 30, it forecast 5 percent to 7 percent. The airline is now forecasting a full-year operating margin between 8 percent and 10 percent, based on an assumed aircraft fuel cost of $1.94 per gallon, net of hedges. It previously forecast 10 percent to 12 percent on slightly lower fuel costs. Analysts were expecting full-year profit of 51 cents per share, on average.
