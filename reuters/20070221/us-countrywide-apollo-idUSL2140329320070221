 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Apollo Management has made a 1-billion-pound ($1.95 billion) bid proposal to Countrywide ( CWD.L ), but one of the British property agency's key shareholders immediately rejected it as too low. 


 The potential 590-pence-a-share offer consists of 505 pence in cash per Countrywide share plus a distribution of Countrywide's stake in online property Web site Rightmove ( RMV.L ) at 0.16518 Rightmove shares per Countrywide share, Apollo said on Wednesday. Countrywide owns 21.5 percent of Rightmove. Countrywide, one of Britain's biggest agencies, said last week it had received a preliminary bid approach, a fortnight after the failure of a 971-million-pound management buyout backed by British private equity firm 3i ( III.L ). Apollo said it was in talks with certain Countrywide shareholders as the proposal is conditional on receiving indications of support from shareholders, including those who voted against the 3i offer. U.S. investment manager Artisan Partners and France's Boussard & Gavaudan Asset Management, together with Standard Life Investments, publicly opposed the 3i offer. The three own about 15 percent of Countrywide. Apollo, which bought U.S. estate agency Realogy Corporation ( H.N ) in December for about $6.65 billion, said it had completed its due diligence and negotiation of its financing arrangements. 3i had offered 490 pence in cash per Countrywide share and 0.16518 per Rightmove share. Artisan Partners used the valuation on Apollo's deal with Realogy as an argument for rejecting the 3i-backed management buyout in January. "The potential offer from Apollo ... represents only a 3 percent increase in the cash portion over the offer from 3i. As such, our belief that the Countrywide business is undervalued has not substantially altered," Standard Life Investments said on Wednesday. The Apollo's proposal values Countrywide at 9.8 times 2006 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) and 9.2 times 2007 EBITDA, according to Reuters calculations. Morgan Stanley estimates Apollo paid a higher premium of 11.2 times 2006 EBITDA and 12.4 times 2007 EBITDA for Realogy. "The cash portion is only 15p higher than the 3i bid and the (mid-cap) market has moved on quite a long way since that ... it doesn't appear to be that attractive," said an analyst who declined to be named. The analyst said the proposal appeared fair value, given that Countrywide's business is cyclical and faces a possible slowdown this year, and added shareholders may accept an offer if a deal is structured to increase the cash portion. Since Countrywide, which operates 1,200 estate agent offices, said in early February it had received a new approach, people familiar with the matter told Reuters 3i would consider making another formal bid if Apollo made an offer. Both 3i and Countrywide declined to comment on Wednesday but a source close to the situation told Reuters Countrywide views the Apollo approach as a positive development and it wanted to move forward quickly. Shares in Countrywide were 1.1 percent lower at 575p by 1351 GMT, reversing an earlier rise to 589p. Rightmove fell 5.7 percent to 486p, on concerns any purchase of Countrywide may prompt investors who are entitled to receive Rightmove shares from the deal to sell the stock, Numis analyst Richard Hitchcock said.
