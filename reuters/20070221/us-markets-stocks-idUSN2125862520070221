 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. blue-chip stocks fell on Wednesday after stronger-than-expected inflation data dimmed hopes for an interest-rate cut and computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) failed to impress investors with its latest earnings report. 


 The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 47.11 points, or 0.37 percent, to end unofficially at 12,739.53. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 2.09 points, or 0.14 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,457.59. But the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 5.38 points, or 0.21 percent, to close unofficially at 2,518.42, its highest in about six years.
