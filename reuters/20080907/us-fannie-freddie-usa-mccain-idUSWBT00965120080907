 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain views the federal takeover of mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as a step in the right direction, a senior economic adviser said on Sunday. 

 "Sen. McCain thinks this is a step in the right direction and we need to protect the taxpayers and we need to never allow this to happen again," adviser Nancy Pfotenhauer said on CNN's "Late Edition." She called the companies an example of "crony capitalism" that allowed private investors to reap profits but left taxpayers liable for the risks. The companies' political supporters should be held accountable, she said. Campaign officials said Democratic candidate Barack Obama was expected to respond on Sunday. A senior adviser to Obama, Robert Gibbs, did not comment on the rescue plan announced Sunday but, appearing on the same program, he called the financial troubles that prompted the federal takeover "one more piece of bad economic news under (Republican President George W.) Bush's watch." Obama said on Saturday that a federal intervention was necessary but he was withholding judgment on the plan until he had seen all the details. He said any plan must "protect taxpayers and not bail out the shareholders and management." (Reporting by  Randall Mikkelsen ,  Deborah Charles  and  Nancy Waitz ; Editing by  Bill Trott )
