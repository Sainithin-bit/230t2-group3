 (Reuters) - A strike by machinists at Boeing Co ( BA.N ) almost certainly means that the troubled 787 Dreamliner will fall further behind schedule. The project, which is key to Boeing's financial future, is already around 18 months behind the original delivery plan, due to a series of problems with suppliers and shortages of parts. 

 The U.S. plane maker is pioneering a new way of making its latest carbon-composite aircraft, outsourcing most of the structure and components to companies around the world and assembling the pieces at its plant in Everett, Washington. A prolonged strike would seriously hurt 787 development and ripple through a global aerospace industry already strained by project costs, currency volatility and a faltering global economy. The following is a list of some of the biggest suppliers on the 787, where they are based and what they are producing.
