 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Sunday he planned to hold hearings to examine the government's decision to take control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying there were many questions still unanswered. 

 "There are still many unanswered questions about the Administration's plan," Dodd said in a statement, referring to the two troubled housing finance companies. "We need to understand the circumstances which led the administration to change course" after saying just weeks ago it did not think it would need to exercise emergency authorities Congress approved in July. "In the coming days, I will invite the architects of this plan to come before the banking committee to provide members of Congress and the public with more information," he said.
