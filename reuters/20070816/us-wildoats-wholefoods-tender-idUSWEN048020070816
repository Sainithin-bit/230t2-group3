 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O said on Wednesday it extended its tender offer for Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O shares until August 20, marking the sixth time the offer has been extended, as the companies wait to hear whether they can proceed with their deal. 

 Whole Foods, the largest natural and organic grocer, announced plans to buy rival Wild Oats in February, to better compete with mainstream grocers that have been moving into its organic and prepared foods niches. But the U.S. Federal Trade Commission sued to block the deal on concerns it could reduce competition and lead to higher prices. The FTC sought a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The offer, to acquire all of Wild Oats' outstanding shares for $18.50 each, or about $553.6 million, was to have expired on August 15 prior to the deadline extension.
