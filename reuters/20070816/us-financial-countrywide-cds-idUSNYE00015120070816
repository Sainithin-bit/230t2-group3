 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost to insure the debt of Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N surged early Thursday on worries that the mortgage company has struggled to raise money to keep operating. 

 Countrywide's credit default swap spreads were quoted 950 basis points to 1050 basis points, or $950,000 to $1,050,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, traders said. Late Wednesday, Countrywide's 5-year CDS was at 500 basis points.
