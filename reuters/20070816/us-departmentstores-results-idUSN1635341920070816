 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department-store retailers Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ), J.C. Penney Co ( JCP.N ), and Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ) posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday, citing demand for exclusive brands and encouraging back-to-school sales. 

 J.C. Penney said brands available only at their stores helped results, while Kohl's cited strength in all categories except its summer clothes, which have performed poorly. The higher-end Nordstrom cited positive reaction to its sales and clearance events. Total sales at Kohl's, whose exclusive brands include Chaps clothing by Polo Ralph Lauren Corp ( RL.N ), rose 8.7 percent to $3.6 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year gained 1.3 percent. Kohl's earnings rose 20 percent to $269.2 million, or 83 cents a share, while sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.3 percent. J.C. Penney said earnings rose 1.7 percent to $182 million, or 81 cents per share. Excluding a charge of 2 cents a share related to the extinguishment of debt, Penney's earnings from continuing operations were 80 cents per share, 2 cents better than analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Penney's second-quarter sales rose 3.6 percent to $4.39 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year rose 1.9 percent. Penney's exclusive brands include Ambrielle intimate apparel and Liz & Co by Liz Claiborne Inc LIZ.N. ECONOMIC CONCERNS In an interview, J.C. Penney Chief Executive Mike Ullman said his company is banking on its lower-priced merchandise to carry it through consumers' credit woes and concerns about the housing market. "Given the macro environment and the pressures the consumers have in mind, we felt we did well," Ullman said. Penney's exclusive lines at lower prices give it an edge against higher-priced department stores such as Macy's ( M.N ), Ullman said. Upscale retailer Nordstrom said earnings rose 6 percent  to $180.4 million, or 71 cents a share, better than analysts' expectations of 70 cents a share. Nordstrom sales rose 5.2 percent to $2.39 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year rose 5.9 percent in the quarter. The best-performing categories included designer apparel, accessories and men's apparel. Kohl's and Nordstrom released results after markets closed. On the New York Stock Exchange, J.C. Penney rose $1.57, or 2.5 percent, to $64.14; Kohl's gained 4.13 percent, or $2.31, to $58.25; and Nordstrom was unchanged at $46.15. Kohl's shares are down about 14 percent and J.C. Penney's shares have fallen about 17 percent so far this year, while Nordstrom is down about 6 percent and Macy's is off about 20 percent.
