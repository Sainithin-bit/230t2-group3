 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Organic grocer Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O is investigating how U.S. antitrust authorities botched a release of electronic documents involving sensitive Whole Foods information, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. 

 The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) failed to completely redact Whole Foods' proprietary information in a court filing on Tuesday, resulting in some of it being released. "I think it's unfortunate and unfair that privileged and confidential information" was released, said Whole Foods spokeswoman Kate Lowery in a telephone interview. "We have been looking at how this error occurred and have no further updates at this time." The filing, which briefly appeared on a public Web site Tuesday, was in support of a preliminary injunction that the FTC is seeking while it determines if Whole Foods' acquisition of Wild Oats Markets Inc OATS.O for about $553.6 million would violate U.S. antitrust statutes. The filing was electronically redacted but some news organizations were able to download it and read portions of it before it was replaced with a properly redacted version. Lowery cast doubt on elements of the information released, saying, for example, that Whole Foods would not know if 30 Wild Oats stores would be closed until the merger was completed and it had access to each store's receipts and costs. Asked about assertions that suppliers had been told they could not sell to Whole Foods if they sold to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), Lowery said: "I honestly don't even know where that came from ... I've never seen or heard that." Both Whole Foods and Wild Oats have the right to terminate the deal if it is not completed by August 31. The companies are waiting for a ruling from U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which held hearings on the FTC's case against Whole Foods and Wild Oats on July 31 and August 1. Whole Foods asked the court for an expedited schedule so that it could have a resolution by August 31. The company said last week that it expected to get a ruling from the federal court in mid-August.
