 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity in the U.S. 
Mid-Atlantic region stagnated in August, a survey showed on 
Thursday. 

  The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business 
activity index was at 0.0 in August versus 9.2 in July. 
Economists polled by Reuters had forecast a reading of 9.0.  Any reading above zero indicates growth in the region's 
manufacturing sector.
