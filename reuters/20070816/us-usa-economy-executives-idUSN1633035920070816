 BOSTON  (Reuters) - With stock markets falling, the U.S. housing market in a tailspin and credit tightening, corporate America is bracing for impact. 

 Top U.S. executives are watching the spread of the economic contagion that started with a slump in U.S. home prices and spread through the financial sector as default rates on risky subprime mortgages rose, spooking investors the world over. Department store chain J.C. Penney Co. ( JCP.N ) regards "pretty negative sentiment" as a business reality for the near future, its chief executive said on Thursday. "Our responsibility is to find a way to perform whatever the environment, despite a pretty negative sentiment in the marketplace, particularly about housing and energy," said Mike Ullman, CEO of the Plano, Texas-based chain. Deere & Co. ( DE.N ), which makes heavy equipment used in construction and agriculture, has already started to brace for slower demand, a top executive said on Wednesday as the company reported better-than-expected profit. "We have tried to be very responsive to the downturn by stepping on the brakes aggressively on our production," said Mike Mack, Deere's chief financial officer. TIME FOR A RATE CUT? Bruce Hertzke, chairman and CEO of Winnebago Industries Inc. ( WGO.N ), the big U.S. motor home maker, said the U.S. Federal Reserve should lower interest rates to stave off further economic slowdown. The Fed has left the benchmark federal funds interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent since June 2006. "They ought to cut it a couple quarter points to see if they can get things stable and headed back in the right direction," Hertzke said. Not all executives agreed that a rate cut was needed. "We've just gone through a period where credit was too easy to get and now there's a painful correction," said Edward Ludwig, CEO of Becton Dickinson and Co. ( BDX.N ), a maker of health-care equipment. "The fundamentals are still good, inflation is low and independent of this contagion, there are no other signals that would warrant a rate cut." The three major U.S. stock indexes -- the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  and the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  -- fell as low as 10 percent below their mid-July record highs on Thursday, a threshold professional investors consider a market correction. The market turmoil is not the only worrying factor for executives. The trade organization Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI on Thursday lowered its 2007 U.S. economic forecast. It now expects 1.9 percent gross domestic product growth this year, down from an inflation-adjusted 3.3 percent in 2006. CREDIT COSTS A CONCERN The credit tightening -- spurred by the subprime problems -- may further pinch companies, particularly in capital-intensive sectors like power generation. "The recent deterioration of the capital markets is having an impact on the power-generation industry like many other sectors of the economy, because the cost of borrowing has risen significantly, further increasing the cost to build new generation," said Bruce Williamson, chief executive of independent power producer Dynegy Inc. ( DYN.N ). Executives had a mixed view as to whether the U.S. economy was facing a possible recession. "Recession at this point would be a threat unless the government is willing to take some action to stem that," said Andrew Puzder, CEO of CKE Restaurants Inc. CKR.N, parent of the Hardee's and Carl's Jr. hamburger chains. Geoffery Merszei, CFO at Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ), the largest U.S. chemical company by sales, disagreed. "The global economy remains healthy -- we know this because more than 60 percent of our sales are outside the United States," Merszei said. "Even within the U.S., where we work across a broad range of industry sectors, we've not yet seen any signs to suggest there's a significant risk of recession."
