 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos. Inc. ( EL.N ) Chief Financial Officer Richard Kunes said in a conference call on Thursday that he sees sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 hurt by a retail calendar shift. 

 He said that due to the shift in the retail calendar, one week's worth of sales from the first quarter of fiscal 2008 will shift to the second quarter, and that, combined with weak U.S. department store sales, would pressure current-quarter earnings. Estee Lauder, whose fiscal year ends on June 30, reported fourth-quarter earnings earlier on Thursday. (See  here  -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog)
