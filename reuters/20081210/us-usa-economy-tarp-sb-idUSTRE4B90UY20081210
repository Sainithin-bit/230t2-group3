 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A congressionally appointed oversight panel on Wednesday was expected to urge the Treasury Department to be clearer to the public about its handling of a $700 billion financial rescue package. 

 "The American people need to understand Treasury's conception of the problems in the economy and its comprehensive strategy to address those problems," the Congressional Oversight Panel for Economic Stabilization said in a draft report. The panel's lone Republican, Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling, declined to sign the report, saying his concerns about the panel's transparency and accountability had not been addressed. The oversight body was chaired by Harvard Law School professor Elizabeth Warren and included New York State Superintendent of Banks Richard Neiman and labor union federation AFL-CIO Associate General Counsel Damon Silvers. Members were appointed by Congressional leadership. Warren and Hensarling were due to testify on the report before the House Financial Services committee on Wednesday. The panel called on Treasury to explain whether any conditions were attached to the use of funds obtained through the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP. "Treasury cannot simply trust that the financial institutions will act in the desired ways; it must verify," the report said. Congress passed the TARP rescue law in October. Treasury has set aide $250 billion of the first $350 lump of the bailout to provide capital to banks in a bid to restore lending. It has also said it would invest $40 billion in distressed insurer American International Group. The panel said it would hold a series of hearings on the financial crisis, beginning next week in Las Vegas. It plans to release a report January 10 on the administration of the TARP program and its impact on the economy, followed by a second paper January 20 that will propose financial regulatory reforms.
