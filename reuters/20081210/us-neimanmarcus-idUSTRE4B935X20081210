 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Upscale department store Neiman Marcus posted a sharply lower quarterly profit on Wednesday as its affluent shoppers, facing a deep economic downturn, scaled back their spending. 

 The results from Neiman, which also reported a 14.5 percent decline in quarterly same-store sales, came as a worrying reminder that shoppers across the board were keeping their wallets tightly shut in the face of mounting job losses, tighter credit and the housing slump. Other high-end retailers such as Tiffany & Co ( TIF.N ) and Saks Inc SKS.N have also faced consumer cutbacks, stoking fresh worries about the holiday shopping season, which could be the worst since the early 1990s. Neiman's net profit was $12.9 million in the fiscal first quarter that ended Nov 1, compared to a profit of $78.6 million in the year-earlier quarter. On an operating basis, the company posted a profit of $81.6 million, compared with $189.7 million, a year ago. Sales fell to $986 million from $1.13 billion a year ago. Neiman, which was acquired by a private equity group in 2005, operates about 40 namesake stores across the United States and the Bergdorf Goodman stores in New York City.
