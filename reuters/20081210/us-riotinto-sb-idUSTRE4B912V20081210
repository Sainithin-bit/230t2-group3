 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ), saddled with almost $40 billion in net debt, announced plans on Wednesday to cut capital spending, slash jobs and boost asset sales but said it would hold its dividend steady. 

 Rio ( RIO.L ) has been under pressure since its share price collapsed after larger rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) scrapped a $66 billion takeover bid for the company last month. Following are some initial analyst and investor reaction to the news: TIM SCHROEDERS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, PENGANA CAPITAL, MELBOURNE: "What they've done is more than allayed fears of the market they were going to come and have an equity issue. Drastic times call for drastic measures. They've addressed all parts of the equation they've definitely gone into survival mode, which is appropriate given the market circumstances. The execution in terms of the asset sales is obviously difficult in the current environment. Even if there's some slippage in asset sales, the other measures, staff reductions, cost cutting at operations, and the dividend will more than likely very much see them make that payment in October next year." From that point of view there's no short term liquidity crisis, so the market should re-rate the company as a consequence." MARK PERVAN, SENIOR COMMODITIES ANALYST, AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND BANK, MELBOURNE "This will appease shareholders and the market, where there was huge concern about cashflow and debt levels. They could be looking at including industrial minerals into the asset sales, but will hold onto their tier one assets in copper, iron ore and coal. "They may make haircuts there too in where they have joint ventures -- maybe the Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia. The cut in iron ore output will mean people will be trimming medium-term supply forecasts, but I doubt we will see an immediate impact in prices." YINGXI YU, ANALYST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, SINGAPORE "The details of the capex cuts will be interesting. It's in line with the trend we have seen from other metals producers who are preferring to cut back on spending, and focus on liquidity."
