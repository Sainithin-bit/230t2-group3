 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors fearful of everything from deflation to the fragile banking system fought on Tuesday to hand cash to the U.S. Treasury for safekeeping, giving the government an unprecedented interest-free loan of $30 billion. 

 A regularly scheduled auction of four-week Treasury bills triggered a tsunami of demand that sent market rates on 3-month T-bills below zero percent, the first time the 3-month U.S. T-bill rate has turned negative since 1940, according to Global Financial Data. Pressures on fund managers to stock up on the safest possible assets in advance of year-end book-balancing added to the bid for securities backed by the U.S. government, traders said. "I think it is a sure sign that fear has not left the market place," said Bret Barker, portfolio manager at Metropolitan West Asset Management in Los Angeles. "People are willing to forgo any return to preserve their capital." The U.S. Treasury Department said it sold the bills at a high rate of 0.000 percent, a level never before seen. Rates for three-month bills in the market briefly fell below zero, according to fixed-income trading platform Tradeweb. When Treasury bill rates turn negative it shows that investors are so concerned about the safety of other assets that they are willing to pay the U.S. government a fee to look after their money. "There is just a continuing flight to safety with money that needs to be invested. Money funds want it to be invested rather than under the mattress, which is continuing to push rates lower," said Lou Brien, a market strategist with DRW Trading Group in Chicago. "There is the uncertainty of counterparty risk and concern over the possibility of deflation," Brien said. Counterparty risk describes the anxiety among banks and other lenders that the party on the other side of a trade might not repay funds. Bill rates fell to zero in mid-September when investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, sending panicked investors to the relative safety of government paper. "There's still a ton of fear. People are now paying the government to take their money. Something is wrong," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. As an indicator of investors' expectations for the sliding economy, T-bills moves were ominous and could presage a long lasting economic downturn, some said. "For the Treasury, it's great financing. For everyone, it's not a good sign that things will get better ...That's fool optimism. A quick recovery is not going to happen," said Rudy Narvas, senior strategist at 4Cast Ltd in New York.
