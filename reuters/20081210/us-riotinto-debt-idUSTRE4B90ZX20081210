 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ), saddled with almost $40 billion in net debt, announced plans on Wednesday to cut capital spending, slash jobs and boost asset sales but said it would hold its dividend steady. 

 "Rio Tinto has announced a detailed package of measures in response to the unprecedented rapidity and severity of the global economic downturn, which has caused sharp falls in commodity prices and a significantly weaker outlook," the company said. Rio ( RIO.L )h as been under pressure since its share price collapsed after larger rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ) scrapped a $66 billion takeover bid for the company last month.
