 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese exports and imports unexpectedly fell in November from year-earlier levels, dramatically illustrating how abruptly the world's fourth-largest economy has slowed in response to the global credit crunch. 

 The drop in exports was the largest since April 1999, while the decline in imports was the steepest since monthly records kept by bankers began in 1993. Other Asian export power houses, including South Korea and Taiwan, had already reported a drop in shipments last month as the shock to confidence that followed the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September reverberated through the world economy. But the extent of the downturn in China was startling. Economists had expected exports to rise 15 percent and imports to be up 12 percent compared with November 2007. But the data showed exports fell 2.2 percent from a year earlier and imports dropped by 17.9 percent. "Global demand for Chinese products is vanishing," said Gene Ma, an economist at China Economic Monitor, a Beijing consultancy. "Secondly, the credit freeze in importing countries has made it hard for Chinese exporters to sell abroad." Even though imports fell more sharply than exports, the trade surplus soared to an all-time high of $40.1 billion last month, eclipsing the previous record of $35.2 billion set in October, the customs administration reported. A plunge in the price of oil and other commodities cut China's import bill, but economists said the drop also reflected spreading weakness in home-grown demand as businesses and consumers battened down the hatches. "It's just a start. Exports and imports will continue to fall in the coming months, probably until next June," said Zhang Shiyuan, an analyst with Southwest Securities in Beijing. UNEMPLOYMENT WORRIES The government has been unusually frank in acknowledging its worries that the economic downturn will cause unemployment to soar, jeopardizing social stability. Export firms employ tens of millions of rural migrants. With factories closing by the thousands in southern China, many of these workers are heading home much earlier than usual for the Lunar New Year, which falls in late January. "With few policy options with which to revive exports, Chinese authorities are understandably focusing on measures to boost domestic demand and push forward with infrastructure initiatives, in an effort to absorb some of the migrant workforce," Jing Ulrich, head of China equities at J.P. Morgan, said in a note to clients. The government launched a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus plan on November 9 to boost infrastructure spending over the next two years and the central bank followed up on November 26 by slashing interest rates by 1.08 percentage points -- four times its usual margin. A burning question among economists is whether Beijing will go one step further and engineer a drop in the value of the yuan to give exporters more of a competitive edge in global markets. The Chinese currency has risen sharply in value this year against a basket of currencies of its main trading partners. But the central bank raised eyebrows last week by allowing the yuan to weaken modestly against the U.S. dollar. Many economists cautioned against reading too much into the move, but others are not so sure. "The government is likely to launch new policies soon to help the export sector, and that may include a change in exchange rate policy," said Zhu Jianfang, an economist with CITIC Securities in Beijing. In another sign that the economy has simply run into a wall, the statistics office reported earlier that wholesale price inflation collapsed to 2.0 percent in the year to November from October's reading of 6.6 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rate of 4.4 percent. The lowest forecast was 3.3 percent. "The situation is quite severe. We are slipping into a deflationary recession risk pretty fast," said Isaac Meng, an economist with BNP Paribas in Beijing. LINKS > For comments on the trade data. > For comments on producer prices.
