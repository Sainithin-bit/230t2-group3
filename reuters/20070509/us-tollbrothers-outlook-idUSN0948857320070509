 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc. ( TOL.N ) said on Wednesday it expected to report lower quarterly revenue and warned that its profit would fall short of its own forecasts, as the protracted downturn in the U.S. home market worsened. 

 Fiscal second-quarter homebuilding revenue fell 19 percent to about $1.17 billion for the period ended April 30, according to preliminary results. The company is slated to release its official results on May 24. With slack demand, the value of lots and homes built without a buyer have fallen. The company expects to take a second-quarter charge of between $90 million and $130 million to account for the lowered value, but still expects to report a profit. "Twenty months into this housing downturn, we continue to face difficult conditions in most of our markets," Chief Executive Robert Toll said in a statement released with the company's preliminary results. "We no longer expect to achieve the most recent quarterly and annual guidance we provided on February 22." In February, Toll forecast net earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.85 for the full year; 43 to 57 cents for the fiscal second quarter; 33 to 45 cents for the fiscal third quarter; and 36 to 50 cents for the fiscal fourth quarter. Looking to indicators of future revenue results, Toll said it signed 2,031 contracts, down 14 percent from the year-ago period. Total contracts -- those signed during the quarter, less those that were canceled out of backlog for its wholly owned operations -- fell 24 percent to 1,647 homes. The value of the contracts fell 25 percent, to $1.17 billion. "Our sense is that the decline in March/April was more severe than the decline for the quarter since the negative impact of the mortgage environment did not begin until March," Bank of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim wrote in a research note. The second-quarter cancellation rate was 19 percent, down from the prior quarter's rate of 30 percent but still higher than the 9 percent rate for 2006, Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll said. About 70 percent of the cancellations came from contracts signed more than 30 months ago. "This means that buyers are typically canceling closer to closing, likely due to price and inability to sell their existing home, instead of financing issues," Oppenheim wrote. The second-quarter backlog of homes on order fell 32 percent to about $4.15 billion. For about a year, home construction has fallen off sharply on weakening demand and rising interest rates. The situation has not improved much recently. Problems in subprime mortgage lending -- loans to those with sketchy credit histories -- has made it even more difficult for potential buyers to get a mortgage. The company said fewer than 2 percent of its buyers use subprime loans, but said that stricter lending standards were hurting affordability at lower price points. "This, in turn, can impact the entire 'housing food chain,' including some of our potential customers' ability to sell their existing homes," Toll said. Housing construction typically follows the existing home market, and on Tuesday the National Association of Realtors for the third straight month cut its forecast for sales and prices. In early Wednesday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Toll shares fell 13 cents to $29.08. Year to date, Toll shares are off 10 percent while the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, a yardstick that measures home builder performance, is down 14 percent.
