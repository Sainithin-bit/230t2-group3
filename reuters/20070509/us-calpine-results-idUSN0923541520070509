 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bankrupt power company Calpine Corp. CPNLQ.PK posted a narrower quarterly loss on Wednesday, as the company generated and sold more power and received benefits from restructuring activities. 

 Net loss was $459 million, or 96 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $589 million, or $1.23 per share, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sales rose 19 percent to $1.6 billion for the quarter ending March 31, said Calpine, which operates 25,000 megawatts of generating capacity in 18 states and sells power to the wholesale market. Energy revenue was helped by a 31 percent jump in power generation from the year-ago period, which followed its bankruptcy filings. Calpine filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December 2005 in one of the largest U.S. corporate insolvencies in recent history. It said it also benefited from a $246 million gain on asset sales as part of its restructuring activity. Those were offset by higher debt financing costs and plant operating expenses. Calpine said it expects to file its reorganization plan by June 20 with the bankruptcy court. That plan will provide a roadmap for its emergence from Chapter 11, the company said. Since filing for bankruptcy, Calpine has sold many assets as part of a plan to sell about 20 plants, or one-fifth of its total, in a bid to emerge leaner and focused on power generation in the core markets of California and Texas.
