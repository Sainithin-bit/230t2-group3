 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N said on Wednesday quarterly profit rose, helped by movie titles such as "Night at the Museum" and the DVD release of "Borat," as well as an increase in affiliate revenue for cable channel Fox News. 

 Murdoch, who made a surprise $5 billion, or $60 per share, offer to buy Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N to gain a foothold in the business media industry, also defended the deal during a morning conference call. "We made the offer at what we believe is a full and more than fair price because our two companies are a perfect fit," Murdoch said. He declined to address further questions on the offer or on discussions with Dow Jones' controlling shareholders, members of the Bancroft family. Murdoch said business news products, unlike local newspapers, did not face the same regional barriers that hurt growth at general-interest newspapers, addressing Wall Street criticism that the 76-year-old mogul might be investing heavily in a growth-strapped industry. "It's something you can charge highly for," he said. "It's something you can customize and take that journalism and information and sell all over the world." The potential deal, which faces objections from some of the Bancrofts, would have no impact on its share buyback program, executives said. Murdoch also said he saw no other "opportunistic" purchases in sight at the moment. News Corp., home to the Fox television network and online teen hangout MySpace, said fiscal third-quarter profit rose to $871 million, or 27 cents per share, from $820 million, or 26 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose 21 percent to $7.53 billion. The results were in line with analysts' average forecast for earnings per share of 27 cents and beat revenue expectations of $6.81 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. INTERACTIVE GROWTH ON TRACK Growth was fueled by News Corp.'s filmed entertainment unit, which posted an 82 percent rise in operating income to $410 million, including the release of DVDs such as "The Devil Wears Prada" and "Little Miss Sunshine." Cable network programming saw a 34 percent increase in operating income to $282 million, helped by growth for Fox News, the FX network and regional sports networks. Interactive revenue also grew 65 percent in the quarter to $135 million. The company said this week it planned to make more purchases to boost one of the fastest growing units at the company. Those increases were partially dampened by declining operating profit at the company's television business due to losses for MyNetworkTV and a relatively flat performance for its newspaper businesses due to weakness in Britain. Looking ahead, the company backed its earlier full year operating income view for a rise of 14 percent to 16 percent. It also continues to expect to match or exceed full year interactive revenue of $500 million, primarily from its popular Internet social network MySpace. News Corp.'s Class A shares fell 30 cents, or 1.38 percent, to $21.44 on the New York Stock Exchange in morning trading.
