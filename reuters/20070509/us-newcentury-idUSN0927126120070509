 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), the subprime lender, has asked a federal bankruptcy judge to reject a government request to appoint a trustee to replace its management and take control of asset sales. 

 In a filing late on Tuesday with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware, New Century said the request by the U.S. Department of Justice ignores executives' efforts to sell assets fast and wind down the Irvine, California company's business. U.S. Trustee Kelly Beaudin Stapleton argued in an April 17 court filing that management's failure "to ensure accurate financial accounting and to institute adequate internal controls" mandated the appointment of a trustee. "This broad and sweeping attack on well-respected executives is unjustified," wrote New Century lawyer Christopher Samis. "To tar all company executives, particularly those who had no role in accounting, with a broad brush and without any evidence that they knew or had reason to know of the accounting issues is unwarranted." Also late on Tuesday, a unit of Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) endorsed the appointment of a trustee and ouster of management. DB Structured Products Inc. said New Century lacked records for seven loans valued at $1.13 million that it bought. It said a trustee is warranted because management cannot account for the loans and a trustee can do "at least as well as, if not better, than current management" in liquidating assets. New Century had been one of the largest U.S. providers of home loans to people with poor credit before filing for Chapter 11 protection from creditors on April 2. It filed after it stopped making home loans and Wall Street lenders cut off its access to credit, and amid federal criminal and civil probes. New Century has said at least 27 lawsuits have been filed against the company, its officers and its directors. The company has about 1,000 employees left. It fired 3,200 people on April 2 and another 2,000 people last week after it failed to find a buyer for its lending unit. New Century's last major asset for sale is its loan servicing unit, which handles collections. Hedge fund Carrington Capital Management LLC offered to buy it for $133 million, so long as another buyer does not top that bid at auction. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey is scheduled to hold a May 15 hearing on the case. New Century shares fell 9.5 cents to 48.5 cents in afternoon trading on the Pink Sheets.
