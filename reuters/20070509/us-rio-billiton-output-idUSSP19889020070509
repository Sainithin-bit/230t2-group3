 (Reuters) - A takeover of Rio Tinto ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ) by BHP Billiton ( BLT.L )( BHP.AX ) would cement the latter's position as the world's largest diversified mining conglomerate, according to Reuters and company data. 

 Shares in miner Rio Tinto jumped as much as 11 percent on talk of a $100 billion-plus bid by larger rival BHP Billiton, but the company denied it had been approached by BHP. <ID:nSYD88867> In copper mining, the company would rival world number one producer Codelco of Chile, which mines around 1.3 million tonnes of copper in concentrate per year, though the combined entity would lag the Chilean state-owned producer in refined output. In iron ore, BHP-Rio would challenge current world no. 1 Brazil's CVRD ( VALE5.SA )( RIO.N ). The company would account for around 6.6 percent of world primary aluminum production and 9.75 percent of alumina output.
