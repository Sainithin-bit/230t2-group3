 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley is in talks with foreign money managers including ING Group to sell its South Korean asset management firm, sources said on Wednesday, in a deal local media valued at up to $220 million. 

 U.S.-based Prudential Financial Inc. is another bidder for an 87.6 percent stake in Landmark Investment Management, owned by Morgan Stanley's private equity fund LM Investment Management Holdings AB, the sources said on Wednesday. Regulatory and banking sources had said earlier that Morgan Stanley has been seeking to sell the unit, which it bought in 2002 for 44 billion won ($47.58 million), since last year, but they declined to give the value of a potential deal. The talks come after Goldman Sachs agreed this week to acquire a South Korean asset management firm majority owned by Australia's Macquarie Bank, highlighting growing interest from global financial services firms in the country's $250 billion asset management sector. "Morgan Stanley's private equity fund seems to think now is the best time to cash out. Nearly all major foreign players are looking to enter the market unless they are here already," a source who declined to be named said. Morgan Stanley was not available for comment. South Korean newspaper Moneytoday said earlier in the day Morgan Stanley is likely to sell the business for 150 billion won to 200 billion won ($216.8 million) and that France's AXA, Prudential and Dutch insurer ING were in the bidding, among others. South Korean retail assets are flowing into investment products from bank deposits for higher returns, and foreign companies are anticipating huge growth as the country's mandatory corporate pension scheme, introduced in late 2005, is set to roll out to most local firms over the next several years. Analysts say the plan, which requires companies to outsource a fixed portion of their employee's retirement money to an outside financial institution, would unleash what could amount to $60 billion by 2010. JP Morgan Chase is expected to win the financial regulator's approval on Friday to establish a 100-percent owned asset management company in South Korea after it submitted a final application in March, an official at South Korea's Financial Supervisory Service said. Swiss bank UBS AG agreed to pay up to $190 million for 51 percent of Hana Financial Group's fund management unit that has 19.6 trillion won under management. Landmark, in which South Korea's Kyobo Life Insurance holds a 11.2 percent stake, has been a mid-sized player which has 8 trillion won assets under management. Among 49 fund management firms in South Korea, 14 are majority controlled by foreign companies. (Additional reporting by  Rafael Nam  and Lee Eun-yul)
