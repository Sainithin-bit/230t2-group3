 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp. NWSa.N said on Wednesday fiscal 2007 operating income will rise 14 percent to 16 percent, reaffirming an earlier target. 

 The company still expects to match or exceed $500 million in full year interactive revenue goals, driven by social network MySpace. News Corp. chief executive Rupert Murdoch also said on a morning conference call its $60 per share offer to buy business news and information company Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N was a "full and more than fair price."
