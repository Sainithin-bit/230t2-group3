 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. women's apparel sales fell 6.5 percent in April as cold stormy weather for part of the month cut into business that was already hurt by the shift of Easter sales to March, according to a report released on Wednesday. 

 The April decline dragged the three-month moving average for women's apparel sales down to a decline of 0.3 percent, the worst level in more than a year, according SpendingPulse, a retail data service of MasterCard Advisors, which is part of MasterCard Worldwide. That compares with an average of up 3.1 percent in the three months ended in March, Michael McNamara, vice president of research and analysis for SpendingPulse, said. "That segment really, overall, had a difficult winter season and we hoped to see a turnaround in spring," McNamara said of women's apparel. "We really haven't seen much of an uptick. It could be due to just fashion trends really not catching fire." McNamara focuses on the three-month moving average because of shifts on when key holidays fall in the National Retail Federation sales reporting calendar. Easter fell on April 8 this year, the first day of the April reporting period, meaning sales of apparel and other items typically bought before the holiday moved into the March selling period. Easter itself is typically the third-lowest sales day of the year because many stores are closed, McNamara said. A major storm in the eastern United States in the middle of the month also hurt sales, as did cold weather, he said. April 2007 was the coldest April since 1997, while April 2006 was the warmest April on record, according to weather tracking firm Planalytics. "The fact that there was a cool start to the spring didn't help," McNamara said. Still, shares of apparel retailers, are up more than 3 percent since most reported March sales on April 5, as measured by the Standard & Poor's Apparel Retailers index .GSPRETA. That compares with the broader-based Standard & Poor's Retail index .RLX, which is up less than 1 percent. Sales of men's apparel, which are not as seasonal, were generally flat in April, with a price increase of about 3.5 percent helping offset a 3.6 percent decline in transactions, according to SpendingPulse. McNamara said higher gasoline prices may be causing shoppers to cut back on trips to stores, resulting in the decline of transactions but making each transaction larger as shoppers buy more items per trip. Footwear sales increased 3.3 percent in April compared with a year earlier, SpendingPulse said. Most U.S. retailers will report April sales on Thursday. The other key day for retailers this week is Saturday, the day before Mother's Day, typically the second-highest-volume day for women's apparel sales, McNamara said. "So there could be a late spring season surge from Mother's Day," he said. The biggest day for women's apparel sales is the Friday after Thanksgiving. SpendingPulse reports are based on aggregate sales activity in the MasterCard U.S. payments network, coupled with estimates of other payment types.
