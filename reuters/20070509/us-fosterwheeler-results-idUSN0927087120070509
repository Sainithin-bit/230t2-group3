 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Foster Wheeler Ltd. ( FWLT.O ), an engineering and construction company for the energy industry, reported a sharply higher first-quarter profit on Wednesday, boosted by a 78 percent jump in operating revenue and easily beating earnings expectations. 

 Shares of Foster Wheeler rose by 9.7 percent to $80.29 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The Bermuda-based company said it had net income of $114.8 million, or $1.60 per share, compared with a profit of $14.6 million a year ago. In the year-ago quarter, however, it showed a per-share net loss of 8 cents due to 29 cents per share allocation to shares issued to warrant holders. First-quarter earnings easily topped Wall Street's forecast of 74 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenues rose to $1.15 billion from $645.8 million. The company said it had strong bookings in the quarter with consolidated new work orders, excluding flow-through costs, rising by 29 percent to $1.07 billion.
