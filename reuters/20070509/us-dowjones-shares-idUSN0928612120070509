 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N fell more than 5 percent on Wednesday after News Corp. NWSa.N Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch said his $5 billion bid for The Wall Street Journal publisher was "full and fair." 

 Part of the drop in the share price may be because of traders interpreting Murdoch's remarks as his signal that he will not increase his $60-a-share bid, said Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino. "There's clearly still interest on the part of Mr. Murdoch," Atorino said. "But it sounds like he's in no hurry." Dow Jones shares traded down 5.3 percent to $52.07 on the New York Stock Exchange, after falling to as low as $51.10. Murdoch told financial analysts on a conference call to discuss News Corp.'s third-quarter results that "We made the offer at what we believe is a full and more than fair price because our two companies are a perfect fit." Murdoch's offer, at $60 a share, is about a 65 percent premium to Dow Jones share's closing price on the day before the company disclosed the bid. Slightly more than half the Bancroft family, which has a controlling interest in Dow Jones, opposes the takeover, as do members of the Ottaway family who control shares they gained after selling their local newspapers to Dow Jones in 1970. Former Journal Chief Executive Peter Kann, who retired as chairman in April, also opposes a deal. It also has picked up opposition from many reporters at the Journal. Many industry watchers say Murdoch could raise his bid to build support.
