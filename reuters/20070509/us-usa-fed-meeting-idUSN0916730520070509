 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve policy-makers started a one-day meeting on Wednesday that was widely expected to end with a decision to hold interest rates steady and a likely restatement of concerns over inflation. 

 The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee began its third meeting of the year at about 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT), a Fed official said. The Fed is expected to hold its key overnight rate steady at 5.25 percent and reaffirm that inflation remains its predominant concern in a statement due at about 2:15 p.m. (1815  GMT). Analysts have said the key to the statement will be any clues on how the Fed views risks to the economy and of inflation evolving, given economic data that has pointed to slowing growth. Tepid April job creation reinforced market views that the Fed will lower borrowing costs in the future, but the data was not soft enough to prompt traders to anticipate an imminent move.
