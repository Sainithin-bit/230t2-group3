 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett is confident that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ) can conclude several large takeovers soon, Buffett told Swiss newspaper Finanz und Wirtschaft in an interview on Wednesday. 

 "We are primarily interested in larger takeovers. I'd happily buy something in the area of $5-$20 billion, but unfortunately targets with potential are rare. I'm confident that we are going to be able to conclude several larger transactions soon," he told the newspaper. Buffett said insurance and investment group Berkshire, which he heads, was not as active in the currency markets as it once was. "Today, we're only actively buying one currency. You'll find out in one year which one it was," he said.
