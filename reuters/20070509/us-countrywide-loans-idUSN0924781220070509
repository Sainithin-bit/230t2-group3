 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender said on Wednesday it made 11 percent more home loans in April despite cutting back loans to people with weaker credit histories. 

 The company also added 1,759 jobs in April, including 760 in loan originations, and ended the 57,682. It has added 3,027 employees this year. Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo has long said Calabasas, California-based Countrywide would expand and add market share as weaker rivals scale back amid the U.S. housing slowdown. New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ) of Irvine, California has fired about 5,200 people since early April, when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Mortgage lending at Countrywide totaled $40.48 billion in April, up from $36.35 billion a year earlier. Though new home loans fell 5 percent to $15.87 billion, refinancings rose 25 percent to $24.61 billion. "Given Countrywide's diverse product set, its production volumes are clearly benefiting, as consumers move back into more traditional products," wrote Credit Suisse analyst Moshe Orenbuch. Countrywide shares fell as much as 3.1 percent, but later bounced back. The shares had risen 7.2 percent on Tuesday on speculation the company might be acquired, at least the third time this year that such rumors circulated. The company declines to discuss market rumors, and was not immediately available on Wednesday to discuss the job additions. Nonprime loans, including "subprime" loans, sank 49 percent to $1.68 billion -- just 4 percent of total volume -- and fell 29 percent from March's $2.36 billion. Like many lenders, Calabasas, California-based Countrywide has tightened its loan guidelines, and in March it stopped making some no-down-payment subprime loans. Just 7 percent of loans were nonprime from January to March, and Countrywide expects that rate to fall as low as 4 percent this quarter. Lenders are struggling with rising defaults as U.S. home prices stagnate and investors grow less willing to buy loans packaged into securities. Rising subprime defaults contributed to a 37 percent decline in first-quarter profit, to $434 million. "Countrywide is getting less of its volume from previously higher margin products (home equity and subprime)," wrote Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Bruce Harting. "This decline should not come as a big surprise given the recent tightening of subprime underwriting standards and cooling of the housing market." Countrywide, which services $1.37 trillion of loans, said pending foreclosures as a percentage of unpaid principal balances rose to 0.85 percent in April from 0.43 percent a year earlier, and 0.83 percent in March. Foreclosures based on the number of loans serviced rose to 0.69 percent from 0.46 percent a year earlier, and held steady from March. The delinquency rate was 4.45 percent, versus 4.06 percent last April and March's 4.29 percent. In late morning trading, Countrywide shares were up 19 cents at $41.47, after falling to $40.00. They began 2007 at $42.45. (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb )
