 LONDON  (Reuters) - British cable group Virgin Media VMED.O lost customers in the first quarter of 2007 and expected more to desert because of its continuing dispute with rival BSkyB ( BSY.L ). 

 The group, which launched earlier this year from the merger of NTL, Telewest and Virgin's mobile phone division, said on Wednesday it had added 36,100 net TV customers in the first quarter but that this number could turn negative during the second three months. Its overall customer numbers in the first quarter were down by 46,900, hit by the poor performance of its fixed-line telephony business, which pulled down otherwise good demand for broadband and TV. It had an operating loss of 15.3 million pounds, compared to a profit of 9.2 million pounds in the previous quarter, which the group said was linked to an increased depreciation charge and issues regarding the merger of Telewest and the Virgin Mobile acquisition. Revenue was down over 5 percent at 1.02 billion pounds ($2 billion), while underlying operating income was 305.7 million pounds, down from 313.0 in the previous quarter. Its shares, which are listed in the United States, were down 2.4 percent at 1340 GMT. Virgin Media has been dogged in its first months by its spat with satellite group BSkyB. The two sides failed to agree on how much Virgin should pay to carry BSkyB's basic channels, which show programmes such as Lost and 24. As a result, BSkyB pulled its basic channels off the cable platform, and Virgin Media has launched legal action over the dispute. "We can't pretend that we're not going to have some impact for taking those channels off," Chief Executive Steve Burch told reporters on a conference call. "We're not being cavalier about it, but we're comfortable that we made the right decision economically for the business, and we believe that in the long term we made the right decision for the customer." FEWER TELEPHONE USERS The company lost 63,400 telephony customers in the quarter, which it attributed to a competitive market. It added 87,900 net broadband customers, giving it 3.15 million cable broadband subscribers in total. It had 4.81 million customers in total. Churn, or the percentage of customers who left the service, was 1.6 percent per month, while cable ARPU, the average amount of revenue per customer, was slightly down at 42.75 pounds from 42.82 pounds the previous quarter. Analysts said the revenue figure was lower than their consensus while the net number of customers lost had been higher than expected. Goldman Sachs said it expected to see another quarter of overall customer loss but said it would not change its group financial estimates. Virgin Media said it incurred an incremental spending cost of 25 million pounds on its rebrand and marketing but that this would have long-term benefits and was within its annual budget. The group's results are complicated by its history, and it does not provide a pro forma set of results for the same period a year ago.
