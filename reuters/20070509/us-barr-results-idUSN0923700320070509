 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Barr Pharmaceuticals Inc. BRL.N said on Wednesday quarterly earnings fell as a charge from discontinued operations from an acquisition outweighed a 90 percent increase in revenue. 

 Barr shares rose in premarket trading. They were bid at $50.67 and offered at $50.80, up from their close at $49.89 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. Barr, which makes brand-name drugs in addition to generics, said first-quarter net income was $11.6 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $76.1 million, or 70 cents a share, a year ago. Excluding special items, earnings from continuing operations were 72 cents a share. Wall Street analysts on average had forecast 60 cents a share, according to those polled by Reuters Estimates. Quarterly revenue jumped about 90 percent to $563.8 million from $293.5 million a year ago on strong sales of generic drugs. Sales of generic products increased to $475 million for the first quarter, compared with $200 million a year ago. Sales of generic oral contraceptives, Barr's single biggest category of generic products, were $113 million for the first quarter of 2007, compared with $101 million a year ago. The company reiterated its forecast for adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3 to $3.30 per share for the full year. Total revenue for 2007 is expected to be $2.4 billion to $2.5 billion, including total product sales in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion. The outlook excludes amortization costs associated with acquired products. Barr forecast research and development expenses to be approximately $240 million to $250 million and sales, general and administrative expenses to be about $740 million to $760 million.
