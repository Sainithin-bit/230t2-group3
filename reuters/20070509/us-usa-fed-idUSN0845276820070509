 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve held interest rates steady on Wednesday and said its main concern was inflation as it held to a forecast for steady growth ahead despite recent signs of economic weakness. 

 The widely expected decision by the U.S. central bank's Federal Open Market Committee keeps the overnight federal funds rate target at 5.25 percent, the level it hit in June after 17 straight quarter-percentage point increases. In a statement outlining its decision that hewed closely to its last announcement in late March, the Fed nodded to recent sluggish economic growth, but stood by its view that the economy was likely to expand at a moderate pace in coming quarters. The Fed emphasized that in spite of recent milder readings on non-energy, non-food inflation, its remains focused squarely on seeing price pressures ease more, saying flatly: "Core inflation remains somewhat elevated." While job growth slowed and unemployment ticked higher in April, the Fed again said it was concerned tight labor markets could fuel inflation. "Although inflation pressures seem likely to moderate over time, the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures," the Fed said. "The committee's predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected," it said. The restatement of the Fed's inflation concerns pushed down prices for U.S. government bonds and gave a lift to the dollar as traders saw it suggesting less likelihood of rate cuts later in the year than some had thought. Stocks initially fell on the announcement, but closed higher as markets concluded the Fed's stance was unchanged from its last meeting. "They are not trying to send any signal of a policy change any time in the near term -- the signal is no policy change, and there will probably be no change at the next meeting in June," said Kevin Logan, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in New York. The U.S. central bank has held rates steady since June in the hope that sub-par growth would lead to cooler inflation as higher unemployment takes the pressure off employers to raise wages. Recent signs have pointed to core inflation easing somewhat, but still above the 1 percent to 2 percent comfort zone some Fed officials have said they prefer. Also, high gasoline prices and higher costs for imported goods as a result of a weaker dollar have pointed to the possibility of persistent upward pressures on prices. While the jobless rate moved slightly higher to 4.5 percent in April, it is still at a level that is likely to keep alive Fed concerns over the potential for wage-induced inflation. Furthermore, while the Fed has forecast sluggish growth, reports that the economy expanded at a tepid 1.3 percent annual rate in the first quarter and that the housing market remains in the doldrums have raised some fears the expansion might be more precarious than initially thought. However, worries about growth have been tempered by signs that factory activity has begun to revive and business spending may be picking up. At its last rate-setting session in March, the Fed changed the wording of its statement to reflect greater uncertainty about the outlook for both inflation and growth. In a nod to that uncertainty, policy-makers at that meeting dropped an explicit reference to the possibility of future rate increases that had been contained in prior announcements.
