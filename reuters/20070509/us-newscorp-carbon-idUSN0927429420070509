 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Media conglomerate News Corp. NWSa.N said on Wednesday it would be "carbon neutral" across all of its businesses by 2010, putting a time frame on when it plans to cut energy usage. 

 The declaration comes after News Corp. Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch announced late last year his intention to cut the company's emissions of greenhouse gases. "Climate change poses clear catastrophic threats," Murdoch said at a news conference. "We might not agree on extent, but we certainly can't afford the risk of inaction." Murdoch said his own company generated some 641,150 tons of carbon output in 2006, according to its internal studies. The 76-year-old media mogul, who bought a hybrid car several months ago, said News Corp.'s global operations have begun moving to cut usage. Early steps include switching to energy-efficient light bulbs at its newspaper offices, including the New York Post. The company has also deployed solar-powered golf carts on the 20th Century Fox movie studio lots. "When all of News Corp. becomes carbon neutral, it will have the same impact as turning off the electricity in the city of London for five full days," Murdoch said. Murdoch said News Corp.'s MySpace social network has launched a new page devoted to discussing the issue.
