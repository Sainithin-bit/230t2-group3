 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O, the largest natural and organic grocery chain, posted a wider-than-expected 11.2 percent decline in quarterly profit due to store-opening costs, and its shares fell as much as 6.7 percent after hours. 

 The company also said on Wednesday members of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission staff have voiced concerns over the perceived anti-competitive impact of its plan to buy rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O, and that the FTC has not yet decided whether to challenge the $565 million deal. Profit fell to $46 million, or 32 cents per share, in the fiscal second quarter ended April 8, from $51.8 million, or 36 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected it to earn 36 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Preopening and relocation costs more than doubled to $15.6 million, or 7 cents per share, from $7.3 million, or 3 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Whole Foods said it opened six stores in the quarter and 15 stores over the last 12 months. The company, which now has 194 stores, plans to open a major store in London in early June and is set to expand in California and other U.S. states. Austin-based Whole Foods has felt pressure from private chains such as Trader Joe's and Wegmans, and traditional grocers such as Safeway Inc. ( SWY.N ), who have improved their selection of produce and prepared foods. Sales rose 11.6 percent to $1.46 billion, falling short of analysts' average forecast of nearly $1.49 billion. Sales at comparable stores, which exclude new outlets, rose 6 percent after rising 11.9 percent a year earlier. For the full year, Whole Foods expects sales to grow by 13 percent to 17 percent, with comparable store sales up 6 percent to 8 percent. That forecast excludes any impact from the pending purchase of Wild Oats. Whole Foods said it was working with the FTC on its review of the deal, which was announced in February. Whole Foods aims to reach $12 billion in annual sales in fiscal 2010. Shares of Whole Foods fell as low as $42.74 in post-close trading after the results were released. The shares had ended 10 cents higher at $45.80 in Nasdaq trade before the results.
