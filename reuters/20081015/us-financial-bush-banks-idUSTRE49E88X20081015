 ADA, Michigan  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush said on Wednesday that the government's plan to buy stakes in banks will likely result in most of the money being returned and in some cases the government would make money. 

 "It was necessary that the stock be purchased to help us through this financial crisis," Bush said after meeting business leaders. "In the long run it's not good for the country so the plan is structured to get government in a position where these investments will be returned to the taxpayers and it's likely ... that we will not only get most of the money back but in some cases make a little money," he said.
