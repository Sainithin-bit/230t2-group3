 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales at U.S. retailers posted the biggest monthly decline in more than three years in September, according to a government report on Wednesday that showed consumers struggling to cope with falling home and stock prices. 

 Sales fell 1.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted $375.5 billion, after a revised 0.4 percent drop in August, previously reported as a 0.3 percent decline. The September decline was the sharpest since August 2005, when sales fell 1.4 percent. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.7 percent decline for September. Excluding autos, retail sales were off 0.6 percent for the month, double the 0.3 percent decline that economists had forecast. The house downturn continued to take a toll on furniture and home furnishings, with sales falling 2.3 percent, the sharpest decline since February 2003.
