 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Giant buyout firm's Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co's KKR.UL co-founder said on Wednesday that the banking situation was beginning to stabilize but said investor and business confidence had been shaken to the core by the financial crisis. 

 Henry Kravis said the global economy was threatened by a lack of confidence in the value of financial assets, which had come at a "very high cost to hard-working people," with job losses hitting hard. "Unfortunately I've seen little evidence that makes me think these trends will turn around anytime soon," he told a packed room at the Super Return private equity conference in Dubai. Having a more stable market is particularly important for KKR, which is planning on braving the turbulent equity markets to list on the New York Stock Exchange this year. The buyout firm is not, however, having to rely on a public offering. It plans to go public through a complicated transaction that involves buying its publicly listed Amsterdam investment fund, delisting it from Amsterdam and relisting the new company in New York. Kravis did not address the NYSE listing during his speech and declined comment on any subject on the sidelines of the conference, citing regulations surrounding the filing. During the speech, he said: "It seems to me that the banking situation is finally beginning to stabilize, and we can certainly expect the industry to consolidate over the next year or so." But he said that despite the aggressive actions by governments around the world, "investor and business confidence remain shaken to its core." THE SOLUTION Kravis said that private equity and sovereign wealth funds could be part of the solution to the financial crisis, in terms of supplying capital to companies in need. "I'm convinced that private equity can help businesses overcome the hurdles they're facing in the current crisis," he said. "In the wake of the financial crisis, many companies need access to capital and operational and strategic advice. They go hand in hand; you don't have one without the other." He said in providing capital to these companies, private equity would likely have to think differently. "We should be looking at more transactions in which we partner with non-private equity firms," he said. "We should also look at a variety of investment options including mezzanine financing, even taking minority stakes in companies, as long as we have the ability to improve the strategy and operations of that company." Founded in 1976, KKR rose to prominence during the debt-fueled leveraged buyout craze of the 1980s. It has investments in numerous household names, such as Toys R Us and Sealy mattress maker.
