 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit default swaps on U.S. banks weakened on Wednesday, reversing some gains made earlier in the week, as concerns about a global recession weighed on the equity and credit markets. 

 Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) were among the weaker performers after the American Bankers Association erroneously reported the banks would not be eligible to participate in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp program to guarantee unsecured bank debt. The ABA corrected the statement on Wednesday. The cost to insure Morgan Stanley's debt rose 50 basis points to 480 basis points, or $480,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, according to Phoenix Partners Group. Its stock also dropped more than 16 percent to $18.05 per share. Goldman Sachs' ( GS.N ) credit default swaps also weakened 40 basis points to 240 basis points. Merrill Lynch's MER.N swaps also widened 20 basis points to 190, Phoenix said. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday the turmoil in credit markets poses a "significant threat" to an already slowing U.S. economy. The benchmark U.S. investment grade credit derivative index widened 7.5 percent on Wednesday to around 190 basis points, according to Markit Intraday.
