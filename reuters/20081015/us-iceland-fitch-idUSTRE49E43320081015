 LONDON  (Reuters) - Credit ratings agency Fitch warned on Wednesday Iceland needed to sort out a bailout to rescue its collapsed banking sector within weeks to avoid a downgrade, saying it would prefer to see a deal with the International Monetary Fund. 

 Iceland is also approaching Russia for a loan after its highly indebted banking sector collapsed, taking with it the crown currency and the wider economy. Fitch last week slashed Iceland's credit rating to BBB-, the lowest level in the investment grade universe, and kept it on rating watch negative. "They really need to get some kind of bailout plan sorted, ideally from the IMF," senior director in Fitch's London sovereign ratings team Paul Rawkins told Reuters. "We already have them on ratings watch negative and this needs to be sorted out. It's got to be a matter of weeks rather than months." He said he would prefer to see an IMF deal because it would likely make it easier to persuade other central banks to provide support as well. (Reporting by  Peter Apps )
