 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) reported a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss on Wednesday as it faced more than $800 million in extra fuel bills as oil spiked in the quarter. 

 AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, the world's largest carrier by traffic, is also expected to report a loss because of high fuel costs later in the day. Although the price of oil has returned to the same level as a year ago, around $76 per barrel, it spiked to a record-breaking $148 over the summer. That dashed airlines' hopes of profit in the third quarter, but results are expected to improve if oil stays at current levels. The massive spike in oil last quarter forced airlines to raise fares and introduce new fees while they retire old planes, cut services, jobs and capacity and target more lucrative international routes. Those measures are expected to bring the industry back to profit in 2009. Delta, which emerged from bankruptcy in April 2007, is set to overtake American as the world's biggest airline when it completes its purchase of Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N. That deal is on track to close by the end of the year, Delta said on Wednesday. The Atlanta-based airline, currently the U.S. No 3 carrier behind American and UAL Corp's UAUA.O United Airlines, reported a quarterly net loss of $50 million, or 13 cents per share, compared with a profit of $220 million, or 56 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Excluding one-time items, it reported a loss of 7 cents per share. That was wider than the 2 cents per share loss expected by Wall Street, according to Reuters Estimates. Delta shares were changing hands at $7.00 in pre-market trade, down about 4.7 percent from the close at $7.35 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. AMR shares were trading up slightly, at $8.85, from their last close at $8.79. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
