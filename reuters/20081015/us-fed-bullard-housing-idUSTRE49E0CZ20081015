 MEMPHIS  (Reuters) - St Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Tuesday that U.S. housing prices, following recent declines, may now not be that far from fair value and therefore do not need further big reductions. 

 "Today's level house prices are not too unreasonable. ... People saying house prices have to decline a lot more, I don't really agree with that," he told an audience after delivering a speech here. Bullard said that if measures of U.S. house prices had increased only at the same pace as nominal U.S. gross domestic product since 2001 -- instead of the large increase and steep decline that they in fact experienced -- they would be close to where they are now.
