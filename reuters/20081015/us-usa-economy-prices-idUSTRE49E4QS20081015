 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wholesale prices dropped 0.4 percent in September, the government said on Wednesday, in line with expectations as another fall in energy costs eased price pressures. 

 The Labor Department's Producer Price Index, which measures prices at the farm and factory gate, fell for the second straight month. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected the index to drop 0.4 percent in September after falling 0.9 percent in August. Core prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, rose by a surprising 0.4 percent. Analysts had expected only a 0.2 percent rise, the same as in August. Energy prices fell 2.9 percent in September after tumbling 4.6 percent in August, which was the biggest drop in nearly two years. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by Tom Hals)
