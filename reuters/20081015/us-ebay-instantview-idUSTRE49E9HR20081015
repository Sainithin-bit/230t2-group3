 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EBay Inc ( EBAY.O ) warned on Wednesday that its full year revenues would fall below its previous forecast as the Internet giant restructures to reinvigorate growth in its main online auctions business. 

 Shares dropped more than 8 percent. COMMENTARY: YOUSSEF SQUALI, ANALYST, JEFFERIES & CO, NEW YORK "One of the biggest surprises here was the GMV (gross merchandise volume) growth, which turned negative for the first time ever ... That's not good and I would suspect that combined with the lower guidance is sending the stock price down after hours." "GMV growth domestic is probably, you know, down substantially and that's probably what's driving the overall decreases ... It's probably a reflection of the economy but also a more competitive landscape."
