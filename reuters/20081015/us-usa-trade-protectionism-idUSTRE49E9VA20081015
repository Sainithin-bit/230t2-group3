 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Hard lessons from the Great Depression make it unlikely that countries will shut down trade to save jobs if the global financial crisis turns into an ugly worldwide recession, but trade liberalization could slow, analysts say. 

 U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez, in a speech on Wednesday, became the latest Bush administration official to warn of the damage that new trade barriers could cause. Less than one year after the 1929 U.S. stock market crash, Congress passed the now-infamous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act that raised tariffs on more than 20,000 imported goods. "Essentially the idea was in a time of economic turmoil we needed to protect U.S. jobs," Gutierrez said to the U.S.-India Business Council. "We did reduce imports by 50 percent, but the rest of the world ... retaliated in kind and our exports dropped 50 percent. Our unemployment went to 25 percent. If there's one big lesson that we should learn from that it's protectionism doesn't protect," Gutierrez said. Most economists agree that hiking tariffs would be the one of the worst things to do to try to restore economic health, and so far there are few signs so far that countries are seriously contemplating that step. "At the moment, the chances of a big protectionist outbreak seem a bit remote," said Edward Gresser, trade studies director at the Progressive Policy Institute. The next U.S. president, be it Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain, will need to work closely with other countries "to get over this crisis and it will be hard to do that if we have a big trade fight with them," Gresser said. That so much of international trade is between companies also reduces the chance that countries will hike tariffs, said Claude Barfield, a resident scholar with the American Enterprise Institute. "We'll just have to wait and see. When Asia went through a financial crisis in the late 1990s, we didn't see an uptick in protectionism," Barfield said. FREE TRADE DOUBTS Stuart Eizenstat, who served as deputy Treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton, said he does not believe the United States would enact protectionist legislation under either an Obama or a McCain administration. But the crisis could prompt many countries to increasingly question longtime U.S. assumptions about the benefits of open trade and investment, he said. "I think it can have a very profound impact on our capacity to get things done. And if it leads to a wave of protectionism and raising barriers to trade and investment, it will complicate the ability of the world to pull itself out of what is clearly a global slowdown coming," Eizenstat said. The crisis also could further delay completion of the nearly seven-year-old Doha round of world trade talks "even though one could argue the Doha round would inject $100 billion, without taxpayers money, into the world's economic system by lowering tariffs," Eizenstat said. Dan Griswold, director of trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, agreed the crisis could much make it harder to persuade countries to lower existing barriers to trade, even if they resist the temptation to impose new ones. "I think at the very least you're going to see a slowing of the trade liberalization agenda. I think we're going to have a de facto time out (on trade deals) in Washington," especially if polls are right that Obama will capture the White House and Democrats will expand their majority in Congress, he said. The Democrats have long been divided on trade, with former President Clinton pushing an internationalist agenda that included passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement and a 1994 world trade deal -- despite strong opposition from many fellow party members who blame trade deals for lost jobs. "I think a President Obama, with a strengthened Democratic majority, will be under tremendous pressure to sign legislation that raises trade barriers against China," although hopefully, hopefully he would resist that, Griswold said.
