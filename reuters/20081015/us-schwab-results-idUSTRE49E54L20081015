 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Charles Schwab Corp's SCHW.O third-quarter profit beat analysts' expectations, but its shares slipped on Wednesday as credit market turmoil weighed on the company's assets under management. 

 The largest U.S. online brokerage, whose shares fell 3.3 percent in early trading, said client assets at the end of September were down 9 percent from a year earlier. Fees derived from asset management and administration -- a segment on which Schwab relies more heavily than its rivals -- dipped 2 percent. Although Schwab's shares have remained relatively stable amid the volatility in financial stocks in the last two months, worries persist that the company's managed assets will inevitably drop along with the market. "Investors are experiencing market conditions that are as difficult as I have seen in my career and that test anyone's resolve and confidence," Chairman Charles Schwab said in a statement. Schwab, which provides online brokerage services, banking and financial advice, earned $304 million, or 26 cents a share, in the third quarter. On average, analysts polled by Reuters Estimates expected the San Francisco-based company to earn 23 cents a share. Late last month, Schwab warned of a $73 million pretax charge in the quarter related to its exposure to Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK and Washington Mutual WMPDC.UL debt. Schwab's daily average revenue trades, or the key DARTS figure, jumped strongly from both the previous and the comparable quarters, reflecting volatile markets through September 30. September's DARTS figure was 339.7 thousand, up 50 percent from August. "During the extremely volatile month of September, our clients made heavy use of all of our service channels," Walt Bettinger, who became chief executive this month, said in a statement.
