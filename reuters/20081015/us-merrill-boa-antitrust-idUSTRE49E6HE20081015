 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities have approved Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday. 

 The deal will merge one of the world's largest banks with the largest U.S. brokerage in a deal that was valued at $50 billion when it was announced last month. The FTC put the deal on a list of approved mergers that it issues several times a week. Bank of America has agreed to pay 0.8595 of a share of its stock for each share of Merrill Lynch. Merrill's share price had fallen sharply as the company struggled to raise capital and stave off further write-downs from its portfolios of mortgage securities. The boards of Bank of America and Merrill Lynch have already approved the deal. Bank of America shares were 2.8 percent lower to $25.79 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, while Merrill Lynch was down 5.7 percent to $20.14.
