 KIEV  (Reuters) - An International Monetary Fund mission is due to arrive in Ukraine on Wednesday to examine its financial situation, the economy minister said, as the country reeled from the impact of the global financial crisis. 

 Emerging market countries have turned to the Fund, for now just for advice, to shore up confidence in financial systems that are struggling to gain access to credit and defend their currencies from global risk aversion. The crisis has yet to deal a serious blow to Ukraine's economy, but there has been widespread unease over the stability of the banking system. The central bank has already adopted measures to shore up the system, curbing banks' borrowing and injecting large sums to refinance banks. "An IMF mission is coming today to get acquainted with the situation in Ukraine, discuss issues concerning the trade and economic situation as well as the overall situation with the development of the economy in the near term," Economy Minister Danylyshyn told reporters. Asked whether the mission intended to offer financial assistance to Ukraine, Danylyshyn said: "Consultations are proceeding on a wide range of issues." Talks, he said, included coordination with international financial organizations, views on market trends and "Ukraine's chances to resolve internal contradictions as well as chances for joint action to resolve many international problems." Earlier in Washington, IMF officials said authorities in Kiev had requested a mission in the face of the spreading financial crisis -- the fourth country in a matter days after Hungary, Serbia and Iceland to seek IMF help. Hungary has said the IMF's offer to help would be used only as a last resort, while Serbia has said it needs an IMF agreement for longer-term stability. An IMF official, asking not to be named, said earlier this week that Iceland had turned to the fund for financial aid as it bids to stave off a worsening crisis that has left its economy near collapse. An IMF delegation is also due to visit Turkey on Thursday as part of its post-program monitoring process. Ukraine's central bank has injected 10.9 billion hryvnias ($2.23 billion) into its banking system this month to October 13, almost double the amount for the whole month of September. Its foreign currency reserves stand at $37.5 billion, which covers about 3.7 months of imports. The cost of insuring sovereign debt has climbed sharply in both Ukraine and Hungary, traders said. Credit swaps -- used to insure against restructuring or default of debt -- for Ukraine were quoted at 1,500-1,700 basis points, about 200 wider, one trader in London said. Hungary stood at 350-375, about 30 wider. "Hungary and Ukraine are under massive pressure, it's hard to see any end in sight for these two countries at the moment," the trader said.
