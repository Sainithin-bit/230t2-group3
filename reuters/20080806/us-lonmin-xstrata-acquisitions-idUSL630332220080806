 (Reuters) - Lonmin Plc ( LMI.L ), the world's third-biggest platinum producer, rejected an unsolicited takeover bid worth $10 billion from mining group Xstrata XTA.L on Wednesday, saying the 33-pound per share cash offer undervalued the company. 

 Xstrata has grown from a small Swiss producer of steel alloys in the late 1990s to the fifth-biggest mining group by market value through a string of acquisitions. Following is a chronology of the Anglo-Swiss group's major acquisitions since March 2002, when Xstrata plc was created through an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange: March 2002 - Xstrata acquires Glencore's GLEN.UL Australian and South African coal assets for $2.5 billion, becoming the world's largest exporter of thermal coal. January 2003 - Xstrata buys the German Nordenham zinc smelter from Metaleurop for $100 million. June 2003 - Xstrata completes the acquisition of MIM Holdings, an Australian metals and mining group which produces coking coal, copper, zinc, lead, silver and gold assets, for $2.9 billion. April 2004 - Xstrata purchases 45 percent of the Cook Colliery from Centennial Coal Company Ltd CEY.AX for $6.35 million, increasing its stake in the Queensland-based coking coal mine to 95 percent. August 2005 - Xstrata buys 19.9 percent of Canada's Falconbridge Limited for $1.7 billion to add nickel to its suite of commodities and expand into North American markets. October 2005 - Xstrata acquires the remaining 80 percent of Falconbridge, with the total cost of the takeover amounting to $18.8 billion. March 2006 - Xstrata acquires a one-third stake in the Colombian coal operation, Cerrejon, from Glencore International, for $1.7 billion. June 2006 - Xstrata buys Tintaya, Peru's third-biggest copper mine, from BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) for $811 million. August 2007 - Xstrata acquires South Africa's Eland Platinum in a $1 billion takeover in a bid to tap booming demand for the metal from Asia. August 2008 - Xstrata unveils a $10 billion takeover bid for the world's third-biggest platinum producer Lonmin, aiming to diversify its business from industrial metals such as copper. -- South Africa-focused Lonmin swiftly rejects the bid.
