 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac is at an early stage of eventual credit losses on its home-loan investments even though the market downturn might have hit its mid-point, the mortgage finance source's chief business officer Patti Cook said on Wednesday. 

 "Credit losses continue to accelerate in our single-family (guarantee) business," Cook told investors on a conference call. "While we may be roughly half-way through the eventual decline, we are still in the early stages of realized defaults," she said. "Most of the expected (credit) losses are yet to be realized."
