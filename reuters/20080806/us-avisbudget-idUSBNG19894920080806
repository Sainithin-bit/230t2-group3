 (Reuters) - Avis Budget Group Inc CAR.N, a provider of vehicle rental services, posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit and said it was cutting jobs and reducing its fleet size to tackle the challenging travel environment, sending its shares up as much as 9 percent. 

 The company, however, did not give any details on the extent of the proposed job cuts. For the second quarter, net income was $15 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $24 million, or 22 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 6 cents a share, before special items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 4 percent to $1.58 billion, topping analysts' average expectation of $1.50 billion. Car rental revenue increased 5 percent year-over-year, but car fleet costs also rose 11 percent. "The impact of rising fuel costs and a weak economy began to affect commercial travel volumes in the second quarter," Chief Executive Officer Ronald Nelson said in a statement. "Leisure traffic was less affected, as softer transaction volume was more than offset by longer length of rental." For the full year, the company expects revenue to rise above $6 billion it posted in 2007 and sees pre-tax income of about $140 million, excluding items. Domestic fleet costs are expected to rise by about 4 percent to 6 percent per vehicle. The company also sees a fall in domestic enplanements for the year. Shares of the company were trading up at $6.57 after the bell. They closed at $6.22 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
