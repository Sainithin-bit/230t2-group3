 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ambac Financial Group ABK.N, a bond insurer, said on Wednesday that second-quarter earnings rose sharply, helped by valuation gains on credit derivatives. 

 The New York-based company said net income rose to $823.1 million, or $2.80 a share, from $173 million, or $1.67 a share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
