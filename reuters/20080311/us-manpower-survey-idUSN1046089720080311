 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. employers are less optimistic about hiring in the next three months than they were in the first quarter or a year ago, but the slowdown is gradual and international labor markets are now less synchronized with the United States, Manpower Inc ( MAN.N ). said on Tuesday. 

 The global employment services provider said its U.S. net employment outlook -- which measures the difference between those planning to add jobs and those cutting them -- fell to a seasonally-adjusted 14 for the second quarter. That compares with 17 in the first quarter and a 18 during most of 2007. "This is a very slow and gradual decline from a labor market perspective," said Manpower Chief Executive Jeff Joerres. As credit problems stemming from the U.S. mortgage crisis work their way through the system, they are only now affecting employers' plans for the next quarter. In the past, jobs were often a leading indicator of the economy, Joerres said, this time, they may prove to be a lagging indicator. During the two most recent U.S. recessions, in 2001 and in the early 1990s, Manpower's net employment outlook sank in the quarters immediately preceding a downturn. There's no evidence yet of that happening this time, Joerres said. "Most industries are still above water," Joerres said. The survey predicts a weaker hiring pace in six of ten U.S. industry sectors, but only one -- construction -- is likely to see outright job cuts during the second quarter. "It could clearly get worse if commercial construction starts to hit the same woes as residential," Joerres said. It is too early to say what the third quarter survey might show, he said. The next report will likely be a turning point -- either showing a faster downturn or providing evidence that the current cycle is an anomaly, with job weakness contained to specific parts of the economy. Regionally, the U.S. hiring outlook was steady in the South and Northeast of the United States. It was weakest in the U.S. Midwest, reflecting depressed automotive and manufacturing sectors. Employers in the West, meanwhile, are predicting their weakest hiring pace in four years. Construction jobs in the region are "falling right off a cliff," Joerres said, and prospects are also dimmer in finance, insurance and real estate. Manpower's U.S. survey, which dates back to 1962, is based on interviews with 14,000 employers. INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTS A separate, international survey found a weaker hiring outlook in many large economies, including China, where recent government steps to cool the economy are affecting demand for workers. China and Taiwan show the least optimistic hiring expectations in Asia, while optimism is highest in Singapore and India. Employers in Australia and Hong Kong are the most optimistic since the surveys began there in 2003, Manpower reported. Jobs prospects are slightly dimmer in Japan. In Europe, jobs optimism fell in 10 out of 17 countries, including in Germany and the United Kingdom. Germany "still looks relatively healthy," Joerres said in an interview ahead of the survey's release, while it is too soon to tell whether a dip in Britain's hiring outlook presages a deeper downturn, or if Britain's labor market can "escape" a global decline. It managed such an escape earlier this decade, he said. Spain, where ruling Socialists scored an election victory on Sunday, reported the weakest hiring outlook in the region that encompasses Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and the weakest in the survey's history in that country. The Spanish government is preparing a public works program to boost the economy. Manpower's Joerres said other countries can never be fully immune from any decline in the United States economy, given its size. But he added: "We have a better chance of decoupling since there's been a divergence of fiscal and monetary policy. You will see some effects, but it will not be synchronized swimming."
