 INGOLSTADT, Germany  (Reuters) - German premium carmaker Audi expects to maintain record profitability in 2008 amid further growth in earnings, vehicle sales and revenue, the Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) unit said on Tuesday. 

 Currency headwinds and rising raw material prices pose a massive headache for carmakers, but robust demand for Audi's sporty models like the A5 coupe that boast the latest high-price features and accessories have helped it cruise past rival BMW  ( BMWG.DE ). Pretax profit jumped by half to 2.92 billion euros ($4.48 billion) last year, lifting Audi's profit margin to 8.7 percent from 6.2 percent in 2006. "This means that Audi is one of the most profitable companies in the international automotive industry today," Chief Financial Officer Axel Strotbek said at a news conference. BMW is the world's largest premium carmaker. Its comparable margin at its automotive business was 5.4 percent through the first nine months of last year. It has yet to publish 2007 results. Audi posted its twelfth consecutive record year for vehicle sales and historic highs in all key financial figures in 2007. It plans to expand its product range to 40 models from 25 now in order to sell 1.5 million cars in 2015 -- doubling sales in China and the United States to 200,000 each. On the way, the company expects profits this year to grow in line with revenue and vehicle sales. Sales are expected to cross the 1 million mark thanks in part to the relaunch of its biggest volume model, the mid-size A4 saloon and estate. Audi has booked more than 70,000 orders for the next-generation A4 saloon in the few months since its world premiere, exceeding Audi's expectations, and the A4 Avant estate version will be rolled out starting at the end of April. "The A4 (Avant) model changeover will presumably have a negative effect on our sales figures in March. From April onwards we expect to continue our usual growth rates," Chief Executive Rupert Stadler said. NO TIME PRESSURE While pretax profit may have outpaced top-line growth in 2007, Audi warned this could not continue. It enjoyed a raft of new and particularly high-margin models last year, while this year has seen further dollar weakness and material cost hikes. The euro touched a record high on Tuesday just a tick below $1.55 while key steel suppliers like ThyssenKrupp ( TKAG.DE ) have already announced price hikes for quarterly and half-year contracts of 100 euros per tonne. Nonetheless, Strotbek told Reuters that chillier forex headwinds did not mean Audi would speed up a decision on whether to build vehicles in North America, either in tandem with parent Volkswagen or on its own. For now he was relaxed about adverse currency effects, which he said hurt Audi's bottom line last year by a figure in the low hundreds of millions of euros. "I think we are reasonably and sufficiently hedged for this and next year," Strotbek said when asked whether he planned to increase its hedging further. He said that Audi "significantly" reduced its loss in 2007 in North America. A distant also-ran in the U.S. premium car market, Audi hopes to dramatically boost sales by concentrating on 25 metro areas, upping the number of exclusive Audi showrooms to 170 from 100, encouraging dealers to invest significantly, changing their bonus system and raising their margins from a current 2.2 percent. "Our best dealer in the USA sells over 2,000 Audis a year. If we have a 100 of the like, then we're at 200,000 vehicles -- so its doable," Stadler said. (Editing by Mike Elliott and David Cowell)
