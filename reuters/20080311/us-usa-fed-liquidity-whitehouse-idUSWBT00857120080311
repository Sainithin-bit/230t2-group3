 ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush has full confidence in Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and he backed the latest steps taken to boost liquidity in financial markets, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said on Tuesday. 

 "The president welcomes the steps today by the Federal Reserve and he has full confidence in Ben Bernanke at the Fed," said Perino as Bush traveled to Tennessee for a speech on the war in Iraq. "Beyond that, I cannot comment on specifics." Asked if Bush was informed about the steps in advance, Perino said she did not know.
