 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's top government spokesman said on Tuesday it would be an option to renominate Toshiro Muto as next governor of the Bank of Japan if he is rejected by parliament. 

 "That would be an option ... We'll give it some thought while watching moves in parliament," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto )
