 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's short-term money markets are relatively stable and the Bank of Japan's current market operation tools can ensure their stability, a senior central bank official said on Tuesday. 

 "Japan's markets, centering on the short-term money markets, have been relatively stable while global financial markets are shaky," Nobuo Inaba, a BOJ executive director, told a news conference after the world's major central banks acted together to help ease mounting pressure in financial markets. "We can ensure stability in the Japanese markets by continuing to painstakingly use the tools we currently have in place," he added. Inaba said liquidity pressure in global financial markets has been increasing since the end of February, adding that Tuesday's coordinated steps by the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank was aimed at stabilizing the markets.
