 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Continental Airlines CAL.N pilots voted to increase funding amounts to bolster a merger war chest in preparation for the airline combining with a rival. 

 Members of the Air Line Pilots Association at Continental said they will determine if any merger is designed for the benefit of airline executives, Wall Street and lawyers at the expense of the pilots, airline employees and flying public. In this was the case, the pilots said the would "use all lawful means necessary to ensure the completion of that transaction is unsuccessful."
