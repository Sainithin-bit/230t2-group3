 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's main opposition party rejected the government's pick to run the central bank of the world's second-largest economy on Tuesday, despite the nominee's pledge at parliamentary hearings to act independently in the job. 

 The row over whether Toshiro Muto should head the Bank of Japan raises the risk of a monetary policy vacuum in the midst of a global credit crisis, with current governor Toshihiko Fukui due to retire next week. Executives of the main opposition Democratic Party met after the hearings and confirmed they would veto Muto, currently a deputy BOJ governor who was put forward by the government. "It cannot ensure the BOJ's independence," Yukio Hatoyama, the Democrats' secretary general, told reporters in explaining his party's rejection of Muto. "We are not opposing Muto just because he is a career finance ministry official, although he is dubbed 'Mr Finance Ministry'." Of the two nominees as deputy governors, the Democrats rejected academic Takatoshi Ito but said it would accept retired central bank official Masaaki Shirakawa. That raises the possibility that Shirakawa could be confirmed in his job in time to take over as acting governor when Fukui retires on March 19 -- although economists say a temporary central bank head is not a good solution as the world faces a possible recession in the United States. VOTE SCHEDULED Opposition parties, led by the Democrats, have consistently opposed Muto because of his close ties to government. His candidacy is expected to be rejected formally in a vote scheduled by the upper house on Wednesday. Opposition lawmakers control the upper house, giving them power to veto his candidacy. The row has added to political paralysis in Japan that has sent Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda's popularity sliding. Some cabinet ministers said earlier the government would put Muto's name forward again if he was rejected but Fukuda declined to outline his plans. "I'm puzzled as to what to do as I don't know the reason why the Democrats opposed him," Fukuda told reporters. "It is outrageous to say he is rejected just because he used to work at the Ministry of Finance. He has been working as deputy BOJ governor for five years and has done well." While markets have been focused more on the threat of recession in the United States, analysts said the succession issue should be resolved quickly. "If the Democrats vote down the candidates, it will be negative for financial markets," said Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. "With heightening concerns about a deepening U.S. economic slowdown, market participants will be faced with another concern that the BOJ's moves could fall behind the curve." On Wednesday, Japan is expected to sharply lower its growth estimate for the last quarter of 2007, and Muto, 64, told parliament of rising economic risks. "Japan's economy is at a critical stage as it faces various risks at home and abroad," he said. "Signs of a U.S. economic slowdown are intensifying and downside risks for the global economy are rising. "I would strive to gain the public's trust and ensure the BOJ's independence," he said. The government could still appoint Muto as temporary head of the central bank or ask Fukui to stay on a bit longer -- neither of which would require parliamentary approval. Another scenario being floated is for parliament to endorse Shirakawa, the least controversial of the nominees for deputy governor, who could then serve as acting governor while the politicians sought to end the row. Under Fukui, the central bank has sought to raise rates gradually, until the U.S. subprime housing loan crisis and a gloomier outlook tied its hands. The BOJ has left its main policy rate at 0.5 percent for more than a year, with investors pricing in a roughly 55 percent of a rate cut by the end of the year. JPONIBOJ=TRDT Muto has been seen as less hawkish than Fukui and polls show he has the backing of markets, but Yoshito Sengoku, a senior Democrat lawmaker, told reporters the controversial candidate had not persuaded opposition lawmakers to accept him. "He answered as if he was an honor student, and it did not dispel our concerns," Sengoku said.
