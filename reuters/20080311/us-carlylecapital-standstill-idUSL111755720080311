 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Shares in Carlyle Capital Corp Ltd CARC.AS fell 20 percent on Tuesday in thin trade after trading resumed following their suspension last week. 

 Shares in the affiliate of private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL were suspended by Dutch regulator AFM last week after it lost more than half of its value when it warned its cash could run out. Dutch regulator AFM had said that the shares would remain suspended until it came out with further news and the shares did not trade on the exchange on Monday. Late Monday, Carlyle Capital, or CCC, said it had had "constructive" talks with its lenders as it seeks a standstill agreement. "Although the company has not received executed standstill agreements from its lenders, the company remains in active discussions with lenders who hold approximately $16 billion in securities," it said, adding that discussions "progressed throughout the day in a constructive manner." The stock was at $4 on Tuesday, down from $5 when they were suspended and a fifth of their value of $20 when CCC went public in July 2007. It said it believed certain lenders may have liquidated collateral securing $700 million more of Carlyle Capital's debt, bringing the total to around $5.7 billion. CCC said last week its lenders had significantly reduced the amount they were willing to lend against the company's portfolio of U.S. government agency AAA-rated residential mortgage-backed securities due to recent turmoil in that market. Carlyle Capital, 15 percent owned by the private equity group's managers, said no creditors or shareholders have taken legal action against it. According to CCC's annual report, counterparties for its repurchasing agreements were as of the end of 2007: Bank of America, Bear Stearns, BNP Paribas, Calyon, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, ING, JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and UBS. Mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, like those traded by CCC, are seen as posing little credit risk but as banks and other large investors shed riskier debt, they are asking dealers with already bloated inventories to buy their holdings, creating a glut in the market. It reported a 2007 net profit of $16.8 million last month and Carlyle Group agreed to increase the unsecured revolving credit facility to $150 million from $100 million.
