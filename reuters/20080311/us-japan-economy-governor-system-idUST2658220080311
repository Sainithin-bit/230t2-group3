 (Reuters) - Political deadlock is fanning doubts over whether the government nominee to head the Bank of Japan, Toshiro Muto, can win approval from parliament, raising concern about a policy vacuum at time of global market volatility. 

 Just over a week is left before current central bank governor Toshihiko Fukui and his two deputies step down on March 19. Former BOJ official Masaaki Shirakawa and academic Takatoshi Ito are the nominees to be deputy governors.  While a system is in place to ensure there would be an acting governor if the appointment was delayed, analysts doubt if a stand-in could make long-term policy decisions. Following are key points on how the selection process works and what happens if parliament fails to approve a replacement for Fukui before he retires. -- The government nominees for the central bank governor and two deputy governors require approval from both the lower and upper houses of parliament. -- Opposition parties hold a majority in the upper house and can block appointments. -- If parliament fails to approve the nominees before the terms of Fukui and his deputies end, the positions may become vacant. -- If a replacement is not found for Fukui by his retirement date, a temporary governor would be brought in. Analysts say it is unlikely a stopgap governor would take long-term decisions. -- If the post of governor falls vacant because of death or resignation, or parliament's failure to approve a successor by the time the governor's term expires, the job is temporarily taken over by a deputy governor. -- If Muto is voted down by the upper house, the government can either propose him again or nominate another candidate. -- If parliament rejects Muto but approves Shirakawa and Ito as deputies, one of them could serve as acting governor. -- If the posts of deputy governors also fall vacant for such reasons, the governor's job will be temporarily handed to an executive director at the BOJ. -- In that event, Nobuo Inaba, a BOJ executive director, may serve as temporary governor, a Japanese newspaper has reported. -- Technically, Fukui or one of his two deputies, Muto or Kazumasa Iwata, could be also appointed to the post of executive director after stepping down in March. An executive director is appointed by the Ministry of Finance and does not need parliamentary approval. -- Remaining members of the BOJ's nine-person policy board, along with the executive director, could then choose an interim governor until parliament settles on a permanent replacement. -- If a governor is in place but temporarily unable to work because of illness or accident, or is overseas at a time of crisis, a policy board member would be appointed as acting governor. At present, Muto is first in the line, followed by Iwata and then board member Miyako Suda. BACKGROUND -- In 2003, the opposition Democratic Party opposed the government's appointment of Fukui, Muto and Iwata, but it did not have control of parliament's upper house at the time. -- The Democrats opposed the appointments in part because they were angry that the three had not been called to parliament for a hearing. But they also said that Muto, as a former finance ministry bureaucrat, was unsuitable from the viewpoint of safeguarding the central bank's independence.
