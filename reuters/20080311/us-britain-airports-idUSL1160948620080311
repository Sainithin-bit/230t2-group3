 LONDON/MADRID  (Reuters) - London's crowded Heathrow airport could almost double airline charges in the next five years, boosting its debt-laden Spanish owner but sparking fury among airlines that fly from there. 

 Britain's airport regulator said Spanish construction group Ferrovial ( FER.MC ) would need the money to improve security and reduce queuing at the airport, where regular delays and lost baggage have earned it the name "Heathrow hassle". Shares in Ferrovial ( FER.MC ), which bought Heathrow owner BAA in a 10 billion pounds ($20 billion) deal in 2006, leapt as much as 8.8 percent after BAA said the new charges should help it to complete a delayed debt refinancing by the end of June. But airlines reacted angrily to the Civil Aviation Authority's (CAA) price controls, calling on the government to intervene, for BAA to be broken up and for the CAA to be overhauled. "We need a break-up of BAA's stranglehold on London airports," Virgin Atlantic VA.UL Chief Executive Steve Ridgway told reporters at a rare press conference alongside the bosses of rivals easyJet ( EZJ.L ), Ryanair ( RYA.I ) and bmi. The CAA said Heathrow would be allowed to charge 12.8 pounds ($25.7) per passenger in the year starting April 1, and increase this by no more than retail price inflation plus 7.5 percent in the subsequent four years. The CAA set a price cap of 6.79 pounds per passenger for Gatwick airport. The four airlines said that would equate to an 86 percent increase in charges at Heathrow over the next five years, which would ultimately be borne by passengers. SHARES BOOSTED "We see this as very detrimental to the UK economy," said Ryanair Deputy Chief Executive Michael Cawley. "The UK is competing for both business and tourism travel with every other country in Europe. Passengers will vote with their feet. They will not come." As well as struggling to refinance its debt amid the global credit market turmoil, Ferrovial has come under fire for service levels at Heathrow, where queues, delays and lost baggage have become commonplace. British Airways BAY.L said BAA should be monitored to ensure the money is used for improvements rather than paying off Ferrovial's debts. Analyst Gonzalo Moros at Ahorro Corporacion said the news was very positive for Ferrovial's shares. "Now we have to see what happens with the refinancing but obviously, with these figures, they (Ferrovial) can negotiate with much more certainty now that they know about future cash flow etc," Moros added. At 1432 GMT, Ferrovial shares were up 5.7 percent at 46.14 euros. BA was down 1 percent at 239.25 pence, easyJet off 3.2 percent at 398 pence and Ryanair 3.4 percent lower at 3.14 euros. BAA, whose dominance of London airports is being investigated by Britain's competition watchdog, said the rise in charges was still not enough. "The (CAA) review does not recognize sufficiently ... the scale of the task we are embarked on," it said in a statement. Nonetheless, BAA said the new charges would allow it to finalize its refinancing plans. EasyJet Chief Executive Andy Harrison said the CAA had failed to stand up to the BAA and the entire system needed overhauling. "It's clear to all passengers that London airports are in a mess," he said. "We call for a moratorium on these price increases... The secretary of state needs to step in and show leadership, because there's a huge vacuum at the moment." BAA said it planned to implement the refinancing by the end of the second quarter, and said it would include a migration of existing bondholders into an investment-grade, ring-fenced structure backed by its three London airports and the Heathrow Express rail service. "Conscious of the existing difficulties in the capital markets, BAA is also working constructively on a bond and bank based financing which can be effected within the same investment grade securitization structure in order to improve the chance of completing the refinancing in these challenging market conditions," it said in a statement. The cost of insuring BAA debt against default fell, but not by as much as some traders had anticipated. Its five-year credit default swaps were about 40 basis points tighter at 420 basis points, a trader said. That means it costs 420,000 euros ($645,000) a year to insure 10 million euros of BAA's debt. "The bonds are also a couple of points better, which you would expect given that the bonds will go into a ring-fenced entity," the trader said. "But there must be some degree of skepticism about when this is going to happen because I would have expected CDS to be much tighter."
