 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) has committed to injecting $1 billion across six highly leveraged municipal bond funds with $15 billion in assets, the New York Times reported on Tuesday, citing people briefed on the situation. 

 The bonds, which were sold to wealthy customers under the names ASTA and MAT, have so far received about $600 million as of last week after lenders issued a margin call in response to falling securities values, according to the Times. Citigroup was not immediately available to comment. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke , editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)
