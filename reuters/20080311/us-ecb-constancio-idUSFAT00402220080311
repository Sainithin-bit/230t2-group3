 LISBON  (Reuters) - Financial market turbulence has taken a turn for the worse in recent weeks and has spread well beyond subprime mortgages, European Central Bank Governing Council member Vitor Constancio said on Tuesday. 

 "The current situation is a very complicated situation and it is potentially serious," Constancio said in a speech to Portuguese bankers." "It has worsened in the last weeks and days, it is a crisis which significantly transcends the problem of subprime." He said the situation would have an impact on the real economy, as would the weak dollar, which hit an all-time low against the euro earlier on Tuesday. The ECB left interest rates unchanged at 4 percent last week but trimmed staff projections for growth, while inflation is seen higher over this year and next year.
