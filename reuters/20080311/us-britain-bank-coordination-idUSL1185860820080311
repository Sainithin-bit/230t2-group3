 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England said on Tuesday its earlier extension of its 3-month loan program against a wider range of collateral was part of co-ordinated action by global central banks to calm money markets. 

 "Since the co-ordinated actions taken in December, the G-10 central banks have continued to work together closely and to consult regularly on liquidity pressures in the funding markets," the BoE said in a statement, coinciding with measures announced by the Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and others. "We all continue to work together and will take appropriate steps to address these liquidity pressures." Earlier, the BoE said it would offer 10 billion pounds of three-month loans on March 18 and a further unspecified amount in April, depending on next week's auction goes.
