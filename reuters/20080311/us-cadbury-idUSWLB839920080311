 LONDON  (Reuters) - Cadbury Schweppes CBRY.L, the world's biggest confectioner, said the demerger of its $11 billion North American soft drinks business is set for May 7, easing concerns over a delay and sending its shares higher. 

 The British maker of Dairy Milk chocolate and Trident gum said on Tuesday it expected both Cadbury Plc and the demerged Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPSG) to have investment-grade capital structures as it signed definitive credit agreements for DPSG. The loan deal for DPSG arranged with five banks helped dispel concerns that tight credit markets may have prevented the division being split off and paves the way for the drinks group to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange on May 7. Cadbury shares were the top gainer in the FTSE 100 index  .FTSE , up 4.3 percent to 562-1/2 pence by 6:15 a.m. EDT as the news settled investors' nerves that a worsening world credit crunch might jeopardize the beverage spin-off. "The completion date should reassure investors that the demerger will proceed as Cadbury had planned in the second quarter of 2008," said one industry analyst. Last week, U.S. brokers Bear Stearns heightened concern that weakening credit markets may cause the spin off to be delayed or abandoned if the Dr Pepper and 7UP soft drinks group was not able to take on more debt as a separate company. Cadbury moved to sell the drinks unit last March under pressure from active investor Nelson Peltz, but plans for a lucrative sale to private equity buyers were detailed by a world credit squeeze in July and a spin-off was decided on by October. London-based Cadbury said it will bring forward the date of its annual general meeting to April 11 from a planned mid-May date to coincide with other meetings to approve the demerger, while it will also give a trading update on the same day. After the demerger, the standalone confectionery group Cadbury will have net debt of around 1.65 billion pounds ($3.3 billion) and be listed in London on May 2. DPSG will have net debt of some $3.8 billion when listed in New York on May 7. Last month, group said its deputy chairman, Roger Carr, would be appointed chairman of Cadbury Plc after John Sunderland said he wanted to retire after the demerger. Wayne Sanders, former president and chief executive officer of Kimberly-Clark, will become chairman of the new beverage group DPSG. At the time, Cadbury also gave a cautious outlook for the drinks business with profit margins down sharply in 2007 and unlikely to begin recovering until next year, but did say it would be spun off by the end of the second quarter.
