 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union and American Axle & Manufacturing Holdings ( AXL.N ) have made little progress toward ending a two-week strike and no formal meetings were set for Tuesday, representatives of the two sides said. 

 The apparent breakdown in talks raised the specter of further production interruptions for American Axle's main customer, General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), which already has shut or curbed work at nearly 30 facilities. "Unfortunately, there has been a breakdown in communication there, although the dialogue is still underway," UAW President Ron Gettelfinger said Tuesday in an interview on Detroit radio station WJR. "There has not been really any movement toward a settlement there," Gettelfinger said, adding that "from day one, it has been American Axle's way or the highway." American Axle spokeswoman Renee Rogers said there were ongoing discussions between the two sides and said meetings were scheduled for later in the week. The strike has idled American Axle facilities in the United States and become increasingly costly for GM. The affected GM facilities, in the United States and Canada, have nearly 42,000 hourly and salaried workers. GM thus far has had enough inventory of the pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles that depend on parts from American Axle, but the automaker may be drawn in to mediate the dispute if it runs much longer, one analyst said. Representatives from the union and American Axle resumed talks last week for the first time since the strike started on February 26. They negotiated through the weekend and met again on Monday but have not met on Tuesday. More than 3,600 UAW workers at five American Axle facilities are on strike. GM, which sold off the plants to an investor group that formed American Axle in 1994, accounts for about 80 percent of the company's revenue. STEEP CONCESSIONS American Axle has said it cannot continue to produce parts in the United States at current cost levels and has demanded steep wage concessions, arguing that its total wages and benefits now run more than three times that of competitors. The company proposes to cut its labor costs in the United States from above $73 an hour to between $20 and $30 to be more competitive. It also has proposed closing plants in New York and suggested possible buyouts or one-time payouts to get workers to retire or accept lower pay. The UAW filed an unfair labor practices complaint against American Axle, alleging the company did not share key financial information in six months of talks that preceded the strike. Analysts have said GM could be called in to help mediate the talks in a bid to move them toward a resolution that would allow it to avoid a more costly loss of production. However, GM President Fritz Henderson told the New York Times in an interview that the car maker did not plan to intervene in the dispute, though he did say GM would be more "excited" if it were losing sales. KeyBanc analyst Brett Hoselton said GM eventually would be drawn into the dispute if the strike continued. It could start to have a materially negative impact as soon as March 21 on sales related to full-sized SUVs, he said. "We strongly believe General Motors will begin to exert more influence on discussions very soon," Hoselton said in a note to clients. "To us, this suggests the possibility of significant near-term progress and/or a tentative agreement." Wall Street analysts have said they expect American Axle to emerge from the strike with sharply reduced labor costs that would boost earnings. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's has said it could place the ratings of some companies in the sector on a watch list if the strike were to drag on beyond the end of this week. A strike would create "a large ripple effect through GM that would touch most of the U.S. automotive industry, including smaller suppliers," S&P said.
