 LAS VEGAS  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), the world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment, raised its forecast for 2010 revenue on Tuesday, crediting in part continued worldwide infrastructure spending. 

 At an event for investors held on the sidelines of an industry trade show here, the Peoria, Illinois-based company said it now expects its sales in 2010 to approach $60 billion, up from a previous forecast of $50 billion "plus." But the company did not raise its forecast for 2008 earnings per share, saying it still expects to earn between $8 and $10 a share. Caterpillar also predicted that its earnings per share would grow at an annual rate of between 15 to 20 percent through 2012. During a presentation to analysts, Jim Owens, the company's chief executive and chairman, said he thought the likelihood of a recession in the United States was a little more likely than when the company issued its 2008 guidance late last year.
