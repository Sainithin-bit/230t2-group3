 (Reuters) - Asian steel producers China and India are the rising stars of the $700 billion global steel industry, the world's third largest commodity market. 

 Steel production in Asia (excluding Japan) increased from 40 million tonnes in 1975 to 635 million tonnes in 2007 -- almost a sixteen fold rise. London based steel analysts MEPS forecast the figure will reach 773 million tonnes by 2010. Here is a timeline charting the industry's radical restructuring since the post-1970s collapse of U.S. steel makers and rapid consolidation in the European sector. * 1970s: -- Global steel sector dominated by Russian, U.S., Japanese and European steel makers. Asia's share of global production constant at around 23 percent over the period, with Japan making the lion's share. -- It takes 11 man-hours to make one tonne of steel. * 1980s: -- Minimal growth in steel making of just 5.3 percent over the decade (+ 40 million tonnes). -- Consolidation of steel sector in European Union (EU) countries after output decline in 1982/3 in EU and United States. -- The European steel industry goes into meltdown -- minimum prices imposed and restructuring commences -- and U.S. steel consumption collapses as industry loses competitiveness, particularly in blast furnace mills. -- Share of global output by Asian mills (excluding Japanese) more than doubles over the decade. * 1990s: -- The 1990s are an extremely slow decade for steel output, hampered by economic collapse in the USSR, where output falls from 160 million tonnes at end of 1980s to 77 million in 1996. -- But economic growth in North America sees rises in steel production; and the EU sees steady improvement. -- Asia makes substantial gains: an 84 million tonne increase over the decade as its share of global output rises to 39 from 29 percent. -- In 1992 Japan overtakes USSR as number one producer. China overtakes U.S. in 1995 and Japan in 1996, to become largest steel producing country in the world. -- By 1994, technological improvements mean it takes three man-hours to produce a tonne of steel. * 2000-present: -- The period to 2007 sees a massive increase in demand and production from China, rising from 127 million tonnes in 2000 to 490 million tonnes in 2007. -- This rapid rise creates raw material shortages in 2004. Steel prices rise to unprecedented levels after substantial hikes in iron ore and coking coal prices. -- Global steel output tops the 1 billion tonne mark in 2004. -- Consolidation begins on a global scale. The Mittal group purchases East European mills. In 2006 Mittal acquires Luxembourg-based Arcelor for $38.3 billion to become ArcelorMitall, the world's biggest steelmaker and first 100 million tonnes enterprise. -- In January 2007, India's Tata Steel makes a successful $11.3 billion bid for European steel maker Corus Group PLC. -- Majority of output growth is in Asia, where the global production share hits 56 percent in 2007. Japan's share of production remains quite constant. -- India becomes a major producer, rising to fifth largest in 2007 from number eight at the start of the millennium. -- Substantial steel price hikes again in 2008 to well above previous record levels after massive rises in the cost of raw materials iron ore and coal. * FUTURE: -- World production hits 1.35 billion tonnes in 2007. MEPS forecasts more than 1.55 billion tonnes output by decade-end. -- Global consolidation is expected to continue, with further rationalization of China's fragmented steel sector. ** Data for this overview provided by MEPS Managing Director Peter M.
