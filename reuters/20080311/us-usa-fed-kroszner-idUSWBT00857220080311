 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - In scathing criticism of their failure to understand the risks of the subprime market, a Federal Reserve policymaker on Tuesday lambasted top bankers and called for much more prudence in lending. 

 "In particular cases, senior management was not fully aware of the firm's latent concentrations to U.S. subprime mortgages," Fed Board Governor Randall Kroszner said in prepared remarks to the American Bankers Association. A text of his speech was made available Io the media prior to delivery. "They did not realize that in addition to the subprime mortgages on their books, they had exposure to off-balance sheet vehicles holding mortgages, through claims on counterparties exposed to subprime," he said. Kroszner did not touch directly on the outlook for the U.S. economy in his prepared remarks. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
