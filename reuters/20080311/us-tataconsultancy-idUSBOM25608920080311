 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - India's Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS.BO ) expects demand from emerging markets like Latin America and Eastern Europe to jump, an official said on Tuesday, amid fears of a recession in its key U.S. market. 

 India's top software services exporter sees emerging markets accounting for about 20 percent of its revenue in five years, up from around 8 percent now, Gabriel Rozman, its executive vice president for emerging markets, told Reuters in an interview. In the fiscal year ended March 2007, Tata Consultancy's consolidated revenue rose to $4.3 billion. "We believe that there is a lot of local work that can be (done) for local customers in those markets. We believe that there's a lot of local talent that can be used to build new development centers," Rozman said. In January, Tata Consultancy, part of the Tata Group that has interests in cars, commodities and services, set up a strategic unit to focus on emerging markets, which include Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and Eastern Europe. India's export-driven outsourcers like Tata Consultancy and Infosys Technologies ( INFY.BO ), which get more than half their revenue from the United States, are increasingly eyeing deals in emerging markets amid widespread fears that a weakening U.S. economy will cut into spending on technology. Last week, Tata Consultancy said two of its 15 biggest clients have delayed some projects in this quarter. "We have a very aggressive growth strategy, so you need to keep opening new markets," Rozman said. "So far we have noticed that the emerging markets are pretty much decoupled from the slowing down of the economy in the U.S." India's large pool of English-speaking workers and comparatively lower wages have helped software services companies grab large outsourcing deals from Western firms looking to cut their costs. But worries about a possible sharp slowdown in the United States have roiled global markets and weighed on software services stocks in the local markets. Rozman said Tata Consultancy saw strong business potential in emerging markets, as banks and other financial institutions, telecom firms and government departments step up outsourcing. In November last year, Mumbai-based Tata Consultancy said it had won a four-year outsourcing deal worth more than $200 million from Social Security Institute of Mexico. Tata Consultancy plans to raise headcount in emerging markets to 10,000 by end-March 2009 from 7,500 now, and set up new software development centers in places like Russia and the Middle East over the next two years, the official said. It currently has nine development facilities in emerging markets, including in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Hungary and Morocco. Tata Consultancy beat forecasts with a 20.5 percent rise in profit to 13.31 billion rupees ($329 million) in its fiscal third quarter to December 31, from 11.05 billion a year ago, under U.S. accounting rules. Tata Consultancy, whose leading clients include General Electric ( GE.N ), ABN AMRO AAH.AS and Nielsen Co, does not provide a forecast. Shares in Tata Consultancy, which has a market value of more than $20 billion, ended 1.01 percent lower on Tuesday at 823.25 rupees in a Mumbai market  .BSESN  that rose 1.3 percent. The stock has fallen 24 percent so far this year. (Editing by  Mark Williams  and Mike Elliott)
