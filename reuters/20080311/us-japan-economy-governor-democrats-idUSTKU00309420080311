 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's main opposition Democratic Party decided on Tuesday to reject government nominee Toshiro Muto as the next Bank of Japan governor. 

 Party executives also decided to oppose academic Takatoshi Ito as a deputy governor but to accept former BOJ official Masaaki Shirakawa in that post, said Yukio Hatoyama, the Democrats' secretary-general. The government has nominated Muto, currently a deputy BOJ governor, to succeed Toshihiko Fukui when his term expires on March 19. The nominees appeared on Tuesday at hearings in parliament, which must approve their appointments. (Reporting by  Tetsushi Kajimoto  and  Yuzo Saeki )
