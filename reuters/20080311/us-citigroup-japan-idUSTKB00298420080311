 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup said on Tuesday it would merge its brokerage and investment banking units in Japan, as the faltering U.S. bank looks to bulk up in the world's second-largest economy, despite cutbacks elsewhere. 

 Citigroup, which lost $9.8 billion in the fourth quarter due to soured U.S. subprime loans, said it still planned an initial public offering of its fund management unit Nikko Asset Management, but no timing has been set. Even as the U.S. firm continues to falter under massive losses from subprime investments, Citigroup's chief executive in Japan, Douglas Peterson, said it would not alter its plan to build a united banking and securities group in Japan. "This commitment comes from the top of the organization, from our new CEO, Vikram Pandit," Peterson told a news conference. After more than 100 years as a niche player in Japanese banking, the U.S. firm is now hoping to tap into the country's $13 trillion in household financial assets, most of which sits in low-yield savings accounts. Citigroup said it would reshuffle its Japan organization over the next two years, bringing brokerage Nikko Cordial and investment bank Nikko Citigroup together as Nikko Citi Holdings. The bank completed its acquisition of Nikko Cordial, Japan's third-largest brokerage, earlier this year, giving it full control of about 100 brokerage outlets and a name well-known to domestic investors. After its big fourth-quarter loss, the bank has been on a push to improve its finances. In addition to raising $14.5 billion from foreign investors, the firm announced 4,200 job cuts. JOB CUTS A spokeswoman for Citigroup, Chikako Oki, declined to say how many of those cuts, if any, were in Tokyo. She also would not say whether or not the bank was considering cuts in the future. Goldman Sachs analysts have said they expect the firm to cut jobs by up to 7 percent in coming months. That would work out to about 26,000 people, based on Citigroup's year-end total of 375,000 employees. As part of its reorganization, Citigroup said it would focus on three areas: retail businesses such as securities and banking, institutional businesses such as investment banking, and alternative investments such as private equity and hedge funds. The bank said it was still planning an IPO for Nikko Asset Management, and that it expected to transfer merchant banking unit Nikko Principal Investments to another Citigroup affiliate. The reorganization plans come after the bank said last week it aims to cut its home loan exposure by $45 billion, and save $200 million a year in an overhaul of its U.S. residential mortgage business. The bank also said last month it had completed the sale of its Japanese headquarters to Morgan Stanley, a deal the local press said was worth about 48 billion yen ($469.8 million). Shares of Citigroup ended down 4.5 percent at 2,030 yen on the Tokyo exchange's market for foreign companies. (Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)
