 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Google Inc plans to make an unspecified number of job cuts at DoubleClick Inc following the closing of its $3.1 billion acquisition of the advertising technology company, Google said on Tuesday. 

 In a statement on Google's Web site, the Internet leader said it has been limited by law from making detailed integration plans, but by early April it expects to have a plan for staffing levels in DoubleClick's U.S. operations. "An immediate task we'll undertake over the next few weeks is matching and aligning DoubleClick employees with our organizational plan for the business," Google said in a blog post at  tinyurl.com/yuagge/. "As with most mergers, there may be reductions in headcount. We expect these to take place in the U.S. and possibly in other regions as well," the company said. DoubleClick has 1,500 employees. Outside of the United States, Google will begin consultations with employee organizations on potential job reductions in line with local laws, it said. A pioneer in the field of Web advertising, DoubleClick was headquartered in New York in the same building as Google's local offices. Google completed the acquisition earlier Tuesday.
