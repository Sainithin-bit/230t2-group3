 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Government nominees for Bank of Japan governor and deputy governor appeared at a hearing in parliament's lower house on Tuesday, as part of their approval process. 

 The trio made similar opening speeches at another hearing in the upper house, where opposition parties have the power to veto their nominations. In both cases, the nominees' opening remarks were made in public but subsequent questioning was behind closed doors. Following are key comments made by the nominees in parliamentary hearings. BOJ GOVERNOR NOMINEE TOSHIRO MUTO "I became a BOJ deputy governor in March 2003. At that time, Japan's economy was at a crisis stage and on the edge of falling into a deflationary spiral. But it overcame that difficult stage and it has been on a sustained growth path, albeit modestly. "That was helped by global economic expansion. But more importantly, it was also due to structural reforms led by painful efforts by the private sector to get rid of excess debt and investment. "The Bank of Japan has supported such efforts by keeping monetary conditions accommodative, including its quantitative easing framework. "Now, Japan's economy is at a critical stage as it faces various risks at home and abroad. "The global financial market turmoil triggered by subprime mortgage loan problems in the United States continues. Signs of a U.S. economic slowdown are intensifying and downside risks for the global economy are rising. "Crude oil and commodity prices are rising while inflationary risks are heightening in many countries. "Looking at Japan's economy, in addition to falling housing investment due to tighter construction rules, the earning environment for smaller firms is worsening, and the prices of daily necessities are rising due to rising raw material and energy costs, so the number of such risks is not small. "In this environment with tougher economic conditions at home and abroad, the Bank of Japan has a difficult task in guiding policy to keep the economy on a sustained growth path. "I think the Japanese economy has fundamental strength that can overcome the current difficult situation. Over the past several years, the health of corporations and the financial system has become stronger, boosting the economic strength. "I am confident in the strong potential of Japan's economy and I would like to take appropriate policy to materialize that. "As for monetary policy, the bottom line is to keep a broad watch on economic and financial conditions at home and abroad and forecast the outlook as correctly as possible. "When economic uncertainty is high, it is important not to have just one outlook but to look at both upside and downside risks in guiding monetary policy. "There are risk factors that may not necessarily materialize but if it does would lead to substantial damage. Therefore, we should take policy measures decisively based on a thorough analysis of economic conditions, without any preconception." "I also think it is extremely important to boost the transparency of monetary policy and communicate with the public and markets. "I would strive to gain the public's trust and ensure the BOJ's independence." "While the Japanese economy is at a critical stage, I would give everything I have to the job if I were able to make the most out of my experience." BOJ DEPUTY GOVERNOR NOMINEE MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA "Downside risks and uncertainties for Japan's economy are increasing, such as a sharp U.S. economic slowdown, falling domestic housing investment on revised construction rules and rising crude oil costs that are weighing on corporate earnings and household income. "In this environment, the task for monetary policy is to achieve sustained economic growth with price stability. "Needless to say, the outlook for Japan's economy is full of uncertainties. The central bank thus needs to gather various information with a humble attitude. "In making policy decisions, the bank should look not only at underlying (economic) developments but at medium- to long-term risks. That is because there is a long time lag for the effect of monetary policy to show up and because there is a complicated interdependency between monetary affairs and the real economy. "With this in mind, I will strive to act and make decisions by taking fully into account the basic principle of the BOJ's policy management, which is to maintain its independence and transparency." "I worked at the BOJ for 34 years and during the last four years as an executive director, I helped implement policy and support the governor and deputy governors in areas of monetary policy, markets and settlement systems. "When I was at the BOJ, I closely watched what the governor and deputy governors did. Through this experience, I think the first role for a deputy governor is supporting the governor, in areas such as monetary policy and the bank's operations. "The second role is to contribute to the policy board's decision as a board member. I understand that people would expect me to give consideration to appropriately providing information that is accumulated within the BOJ and is useful for policy decisions." BOJ DEPUTY GOVERNOR NOMINEE TAKATOSHI ITO "The central bank's biggest responsibility is to achieve price stability. This view is now widely shared among academics and policymakers around the world. "In this case price stability means keeping the medium-term inflation rate, or the average inflation rate for several years, at a certain range that is low but not below zero. "It is also important to win the confidence of market participants that the central bank is striving to achieve price stability. Therefore, (policy) action and (market) expectations are both important for price stability. "The BOJ governor and deputy governors need to explain convincingly to the government, to markets, and to the Japanese public, as well as to overseas investors and policymakers the bank's policy goals, its economic view and what it sees as the best policy tools. "An increasing number of countries have adopted an inflation target to enhance transparency, to meet their responsibility to explain policy actions well and to stabilize market expectations. "No industrialized nation sets the bottom range of its inflation target at zero. Each nation has continued to seek more transparency, including those that have adopted an inflation target and those that have not. Japan should continue similar efforts. "To prevent any misunderstanding, an inflation target is not aimed at triggering inflation. Rather, it is aimed at keeping the inflation rate at a certain level that is low but not below zero in a stable manner. It is definitely not a policy that aims to achieve a certain policy effect by pushing up the inflation rate, for example, above 5 percent. "Looking at the global economy, it is now being hit by two  shocks simultaneously. The first shock is the rising risk of recession, as the credit squeeze ensuing from the U.S. subprime mortgage loan problem hurts production. Another shock is a spike in prices of oil and other natural resources due to strong demand in China and India. "The most feared scenario is stagflation, which is a combination of an economic slowdown and price rises. It is extremely difficult to cope with an economic slowdown accompanied by price hikes." "While I have been trying to write many papers that are highly valued in the academic field, I have had many opportunities to practice in the field of international finance through my time at the International Monetary Fund and the MOF." "I have routinely exchanged views with governors and deputy governors of central banks as well as finance ministers and international finance experts at finance ministries in many places, including the United States, the ECB, England, whenever I attended international conferences or was on business trips." "This network I built overseas will contribute greatly if I were to be appointed deputy governor." (Reporting by  Yoko Nishikawa  and  Leika Kihara )
