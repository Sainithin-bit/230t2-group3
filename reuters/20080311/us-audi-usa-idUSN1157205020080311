 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Audi AG ( NSUG.DE ) expects a tough market for U.S. auto sales until at least the fourth quarter but sees no signs that the U.S. economy is slipping into recession, a senior executive said on Tuesday. 

 "We certainly are seeing an economic contraction, but we don't speak of recession," Audi Executive Vice President Johan de Nysschen told reporters on a conference call. He added: "We're facing seven to nine tough months ahead of us." (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
