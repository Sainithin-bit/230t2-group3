 (Reuters) - Marvel Entertainment Inc said it is voluntarily recalling four styles of a plush Curious George doll that showed total lead levels in surface coatings in excess of the federal limit. 

 The company, which licenses comic-book characters, said about 110,000 units sold to the public since the items were introduced in 2005 are affected by the recall. There have been no reports of illness or injury related to any of the recalled toys, it added. (Reporting by Manish Gupta in Bangalore)
