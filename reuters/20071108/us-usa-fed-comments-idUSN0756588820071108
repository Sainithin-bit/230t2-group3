 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Fed policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2007 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. * FED BOARD GOVERNOR FREDERIC MISHKIN, NOV 7: On the impact of rising oil prices: "This is why it is always important, for example, not to overreact to a rise in oil prices but actually to think about what is going to happen in the longer run context and take exactly the steps that will create an environment on which is successful both on the inflation front and on the output front." * FED BOARD GOVERNOR KEVIN WARSH, NOV 7: "Should incoming data materially change our forecast, or risks to our forecast, for growth and inflation, so too would our view on the appropriate stance of monetary policy." * ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM POOLE, NOV 7: "It is easy to imagine a scenario where another rate cut is called for." "It could be that the downdraft from the housing industry will spread to other sectors, which might require that recent rate cuts not be reversed, or even that additional rate cuts would be in order." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, NOV 7: "There are some improvements in inflation but I still have some concerns." "I supported the (October rate) reduction, because I thought a slightly lower rate was warranted. There were good arguments on both sides." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, NOV 7: "Some anecdotal information contradicts the picture suggested by recent data," he said, on evidence of a business spending retrenchment in his region despite recent signs of resilience in the economy. PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, NOV 6: In a New York Times interview, Plosser said he "would not be surprised" if fourth quarter growth came in at 1.0 percent to 1.5 percent. "That's already built into my forecast. The key here is that growth would have to be less than the forecast to cut rates again." * FED BOARD GOVERNOR RANDALL KROSZNER, NOV 5: "Conditions for subprime borrowers have the potential to get worse before they get better ... House prices are likely to remain sluggish for some time." * FED BOARD GOVERNOR FREDERIC MISHKIN, NOV 5: "If, in their quest to reduce macroeconomic risk, policy-makers overshoot and ease policy too much, they need to be willing to expeditiously remove at least part of that ease before inflationary pressures become a threat. "Even if readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation." FOMC STATEMENT, OCT 31: "Economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance. However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Today's action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time. "Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the Committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully. "The Committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. The Committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth." * FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, OCT 19 "Predictability is critical in building credibility. It is critical in reducing uncertainty, in making long-term interest rates respond in appropriate directions to Fed actions," he told a conference in St. Louis by satellite link during a panel discussion on making monetary policy under uncertainty. "My idea of being predictable is on the one hand to use benchmarks ... but also to provide information to the public what our outlook is, what our forecast is, how we see the risks and how we plan to respond. "That communication, and providing adequate information, is really the only way to be adequately predictable in a world of uncertainty," Bernanke said. "Intuition suggests that stronger action by the central bank may be warranted to prevent particularly costly outcomes." (To access stories on Fed policy click on <FED/AHEAD>)
