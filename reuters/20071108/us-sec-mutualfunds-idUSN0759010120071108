 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to propose new mutual fund disclosure rules and will vote on whether to adopt new international accounting rules for foreign companies at a November 15 meeting, the agency said on Wednesday. 

 The investor protection agency said it plans to propose that mutual funds provide investors with a summary prospectus "containing key information in plain English in a clear and concise format." The SEC also said it will likely propose mutual funds provide more detailed information to investors on the Internet. Also on the agenda is a vote on whether to allow foreign companies to submit financial statements to the SEC using International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), without reconciling the data to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Absent from the meeting notice were two SEC proposals that would determine whether shareholders could nominate corporate directors. The SEC has been expected to vote on the issue by the end of this year, and SEC Chairman Christopher Cox recently reiterated that the agency intends to have a clear rule in place for the annual proxy season that begins in the spring. The meeting notice released on Wednesday is not necessarily a final version of what will be on the agenda for the SEC commissioners to consider. Democratic lawmakers have pressured the SEC to delay a vote on the proxy access proposals until the agency has all five commissioner jobs filled. One Democratic commissioner has already left and a second Democrat has announced her resignation but not set a departure date. The other three commissioners are Republicans. One of the SEC proxy proposals would enable shareholders to nominate a director providing certain conditions were met, such as ownership of at least 5 percent of the company stock and successfully amending company bylaws. The other plan does not allow shareholders to put forward proposals that involve director nominations. On the accounting matter, the SEC proposed in July to remove the reconciliation requirement for foreign filers, another step in an effort to move U.S. accounting standards closer to increasingly popular international standards. The vote on November 15 would be a final adoption of that proposal. The agency is also exploring whether to take the more controversial step of allowing U.S. companies to file their financial data using IFRS. About 100 countries, including European Union members, require or use international accounting standards, which are more principles-based compared the rules-based U.S. GAAP. Also on the SEC meeting list was whether to adopt rules that would expand the number of companies that qualify for scaled disclosure requirements for smaller companies. Further, the SEC plans to consider whether to shorten the holding period for the resale of restricted securities, and whether to provide exemptions from the registration requirements for compensatory stock options.
