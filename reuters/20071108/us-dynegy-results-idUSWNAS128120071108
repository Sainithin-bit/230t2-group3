 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Independent power producer Dynegy Inc ( DYN.N ) on Thursday posted a third-quarter profit against a year-earlier loss, helped by a gain on an asset sale and higher revenue. 

 Net income was $220 million, or 26 cents per share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $69 million, or 14 cents per share. Income from continuing operations was $96 million, or 11 cents per share. Revenue more than doubled to $1.05 billion from $508 million in the quarter, boosted by increased generation from the company's combination with LS Power earlier this year. The Houston-based company stood by its 2007 target of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).
