 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp NWSa.N reported on Wednesday a 23 percent rise in quarterly operating profit, helped by strong box-office sales for "The Simpsons," but said it could face a "rough" economic climate next year. 

 The media company, which is waiting to close a deal to buy Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N, said fiscal first-quarter net income fell to $732 million, or 23 cents per share, beating the average Wall Street expectation by 1 cent, according to Reuters Estimates. Profit was $843 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier, when Rupert Murdoch's News Corp logged gains from the sale of stakes in the Sky Brasil satellite TV service and the Phoenix Chinese TV channel. Despite strong growth in the latest quarter, News Corp reaffirmed a forecast for fiscal 2008 operating profit growth in the low-teen-percentage range. "Right now, all the economic indicators are that next year ... could be rough," Murdoch said on a conference call, responding to an analyst's question. "So we're not going to give guidance until we're a little bit closer to it." Excluding items, News Corp recorded a quarterly operating profit of $1.05 billion, up from $851 million. Revenue rose 19 percent to $7.1 billion, beating an average estimate of $6.6 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "Results were strong across the board," said Chris Marangi, an analyst at Gabelli & Co, which owns News Corp shares. "They continue to execute." News Corp's Class A shares, down 3 percent to $20.92 on the New York Stock Exchange on a broad market sell-off, rose 1.5 percent in after-hours trade after posting financial results. The movie studio led the quarter, with operating income jumping 51 percent to $362 million on strong box office from films like "Live Free or Die Hard," and DVD sales of "Eragon" and "Night at the Museum". Ad sales and affiliate revenue at Fox News Channel boosted cable network operating income by 16 percent to $289 million. But that was offset by the costs of launching CNBC rival Fox Business Network and the Big Ten Network. Satellite operator Sky Italia saw its revenue rise 11 percent to $48 million. MYSPACE GROWTH SEEN Quarterly revenue rose 80 percent to $188 million at Internet division Fox Interactive Media, which houses top Web social network MySpace. Operating income was $4 million. Executives said it would be its weakest quarter of the year. A little less than a third of the division's revenue come from its search advertising deal with Google Inc ( GOOG.O ), with the rest derived from online display advertisements. In October, Murdoch said News Corp expected to generate about $1 billion in revenue from its Internet division, tightening a prior range of more than $1 billion. Asked by an analyst on Wednesday if he expected any change to Internet revenue expectations, Murdoch said, "No, nothing drastic." MySpace faces intense competition from Facebook, in which Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) just invested $240 million, giving Facebook an estimated valuation of $15 billion. To boost ad sales, Murdoch talked up MySpace's announcement this week to help advertisers identify audiences out of its base of millions of users in a program called HyperTargeting. The company offered the program to about 50 advertisers in July by breaking up users into 10 interest groups such as fashion, movies and finance. Executives said an additional 100 sub-categories would be made available in the next stage, with thousands of interest groups coming later. Murdoch said MySpace is now available in 20 countries with at least 10 more on the way. "Spending time talking with the innovators and leaders at the tech world make it even more clear to me there are no limits to continuing that extension, to building -- smaller sites," Murdoch said. Asked about competition from Facebook, Murdoch added, "I'm more convinced than ever that any fear is misplaced.
