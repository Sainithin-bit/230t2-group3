 ULAN BATOR  (Reuters) - Mongolia risks losing future foreign investment because it is taking so long to give a green light to a huge copper project in the Gobi desert, mining major Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) ( RIO.AX ) warned on Thursday. 

 Rio Tinto and its partner, Ivanhoe Mines ( IVN.TO ), plan to develop the Oyu Tolgoi copper deposit, which they say could lift Mongolia's gross domestic product by 34 percent. But the long-awaited launch depends on parliament okaying a draft investment deal during its current session, ending on January 26. "We have production slots for the critical equipment for Oyu Tolgoi. Those production slots are coming to the point where significant funds will have to be expended to maintain the momentum and keep the production slots," Bret Clayton, Rio Tinto's chief executive for copper, told Reuters. Rio Tinto was not planning to pull out of Mongolia, it just could not keep pouring $30-40 million a month into an uncertain project, Clayton said. "That's not a threat. That is business," he said. "We want to be in Mongolia. We are hoping to do more business and do more exploration here, but we must walk before we run. And the first step in that walk is this agreement." If parliament ratifies the draft investment agreement for the project -- in which the state would own 34 percent -- it could set a precedent for major investments in the poor Asian state. "It is not an exaggeration to say that global investors are carefully watching what happens with the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement," Clayton earlier told a mining conference in the Mongolian capital. He cited an annual survey of countries' attractiveness to mining investors published by Canada's Fraser Institute, which showed Mongolia slipping to 62nd out of 65, from 33rd last year. "The long-term damage caused by this loss of confidence is very real in terms of the opportunities foregone as companies turn their attention to more attractive regimes. That is why the Oyu Tolgoi investment agreement has implications that go far beyond the operation itself." STUCK? Rio Tinto owns 10 percent of Ivanhoe, which owns the Oyu Tolgoi project in the southern Gobi desert, and has options to buy up to 40 percent and agreement to own up to 46 percent. Under the draft investment agreement struck earlier this year, the firms will lend the government its share of the capital costs on the two planned mines, likely to total $2.7 billion over the first six years. The companies have also committed to building a power station and a copper smelter capable of smelting at least 500,000 tonnes of copper concentrate a year -- key conditions the government had sought when negotiating the deal. That smelting capacity would imply actual copper production of about 150,000 tonnes a year. Building a smelter exempts the project from a 68 percent windfall profits tax when copper prices are over $2,600 a tonne. Benchmark copper futures in London MCU3 are currently at $7,300 a tonne. Uncertainty about the fate of Oyu Tolgoi deepened this week after Mongolia's prime minister resigned. But his likely successor, Sanj Bayar, is widely expected to give the deal fresh impetus rather than slowing things down. Dogsom Ganbold, president of the Mongolian National Mining Association, said the agreement could usher in more big deals that avoided the windfall profits tax, provided the new prime minister used his control of the parliamentary majority to push for an agreement on the draft. "The political parties in the parliament are using this issue to gain more popular support before the next election," he said. Industry and Trade Minister Tseren Davaadorj said it was hard to say whether the agreement would get bogged down in parliament. "Nobody can predict it," he told reporters. "I think our parliament will support a win-win situation." (Editing by  Louise Ireland )
