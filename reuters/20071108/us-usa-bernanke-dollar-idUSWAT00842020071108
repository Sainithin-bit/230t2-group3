 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday he was not particularly concerned about changes in China's reserve holdings of U.S. assets. 

 "I'm not particularly concerned about the holdings of China or any other country," he said in testimony to the congressional Joint Economic Committee. "I don't see any significant change in the broad holdings of dollars around the world. Dollars remain the dominant reserve asset and I expect that to continue to be the case," he said.
