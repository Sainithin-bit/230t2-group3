 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that he expects the economy to recover to a "more reasonable growth pace" by next spring. 

 "We have not calculated a probability of a recession and I would not want to offer that today," Bernanke told the congressional Joint Economic Committee in answering questions after testifying before the panel. (Reporting By Joanne Morrison; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
