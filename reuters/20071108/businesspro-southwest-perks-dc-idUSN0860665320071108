 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) has 
created a "Business Select" ticket class in a bid to drive 
sales, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday in its online 
edition. 

  Starting Thursday passengers who book tickets in the more 
expensive fare category will be among those to board first and 
have their choice of seats on Southwest flights which don't 
offer assigned seats, the Journal reported.  Chief Executive Gary Kelly told the Journal he expects the 
new ticket class -- along with other changes in the fare 
structure and frequent flier program -- will generate at least 
$100 million more in annual revenue starting next year.  The newspaper also reported that starting Thursday it will 
begin a new policy assuring preferential boarding to passengers 
who fly 16 round trips in one year.  Representatives from Southwest could not immediately be 
reached for comment.
