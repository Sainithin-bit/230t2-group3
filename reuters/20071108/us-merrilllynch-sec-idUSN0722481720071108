 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating matters related to Merrill Lynch & Co Inc's MER.N subprime mortgage portfolio, the company said on Wednesday. 

 Merrill Lynch said SEC staff initiated the inquiry on October 24, the same day the company reported a $2.3 billion loss for the third quarter, mostly because of write-downs of subprime mortgage related assets. Merrill made the disclosure in a quarterly SEC filing. The company said it is cooperating with the SEC. (Reporting by  Tim McLaughlin )
