 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discount retailer Target Corp ( TGT.N ) on Thursday said sales at stores open at least a year rose 4.1 percent in October, slightly above its lowered forecast, helped by strong sales in the last week of the month. 

 Target, the No. 2 U.S. discount retailer after Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), initially had forecast October same-store sales would increase between 3 percent and 5 percent. But late last month it lowered that forecast, saying it expected same-store sales to rise between 2 percent and 4 percent. Analysts, on average, were expecting a same-store sales gain of 2.5 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales for four weeks ended November 3 rose almost 10 percent to $4.45 billion from $4.05 billion a year ago. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
