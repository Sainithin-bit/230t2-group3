-- Rio Tinto sees no end in sight for tight copper

 ULAN BATOR  (Reuters) - Lack of experts and equipment will keep the copper market tight for years and governments will struggle to approve new projects fast enough, the head of Rio Tinto's ( RIO.L ) ( RIO.AX ) copper division said on Thursday. 

 "It's getting very difficult, because of two or three things, for mines to expand -- because of tightness of people, lead times on equipment, and a lot of the easy stuff has already been done," Bret Clayton, chief executive for copper at the diversified miner, told Reuters in an interview. "In my old job, I used to run our U.S. coal operations. If I wanted two or three haul trucks to increase production by a million tonnes, I could have them on site, assembled and  running within three or four months. Now it's a year." Clayton was in the Mongolian capital, Ulan Bator, to urge the parliament to ratify an investment agreement which will unlock the huge Oyu Tolgoi copper project being developed by Rio Tinto and its partner, Ivanhoe Mines ( IVN.TO ). He spoke to Reuters minutes after Rio Tinto's rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) said it had made a bid approach to the smaller firm and been rejected. He declined to comment on the bid, a long-expected move in a global wave of consolidation in the sector. He said the delays in getting Oyu Tolgoi under way epitomized another problem facing miners: the political obstacles that can slow down the progress of a project. That logjam, coupled with demand from China -- where Rio Tinto expects the economy to grow by 8 percent a year to 2015 -- is likely to keep prices high, he said. "When you put those two together, short of something that is unforeseen on the horizon that completely changes things, we see a tightness in commodities for some time to come." The recent subprime crisis and even the threat of a U.S. recession were not a big enough "unforeseen" to seriously dent the market. "We don't see the current financial stress or financial issues that the markets are facing as being a tipping point or a turning point," he said. The United States accounts for 12-13 percent of worldwide copper market and comprises demand for housing, renovation and commercial construction in roughly equal measure. House-building is weakening but commercial construction has been stronger than expected, he said. Although new copper supplies are scarce, there is a surfeit of smelting capacity globally, resulting in smelting fees -- so-called treatment and refining charges, or TC/RCs -- getting squeezed. With China building new smelting capacity, the hard times are here to stay for smelters, Clayton said. "The environment of low TC/RCs as a result of tight concentrate supply, as a result of excess smelting capacity, will continue for a few years. It will not unwind quickly. "We don't see the kind of levels of TC/RCs that we're seeing changing significantly in the near future -- going back up -- because of this excess, very tight concentrate market." Chinese demand for new resources has spurred Chinese firms to start sniffing out potential acquisitions in competition with global miners such as Rio Tinto. Clayton said he saw most Chinese interest in South America and Africa, but he was less concerned by the potential rivalry than by their standards. "We have neighboring operations and we want to ensure that standards and transparency are upheld in all developments. We would hate to see that any of their actions might cause community issues that then cause a backlash against mining in general. That would be our concern." (Editing by Michael Roddy)
