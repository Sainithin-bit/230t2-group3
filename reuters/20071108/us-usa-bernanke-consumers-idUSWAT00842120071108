 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday the Fed does not take an "alarmist view" that a drop in U.S. home values will badly damage consumer spending. 

 "We do not take the alarmist view on this," Bernanke told the congressional Joint Economic Committee. "There are a number of factors at play right now including higher oil prices that would be a negative for consumer spending," he said. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
