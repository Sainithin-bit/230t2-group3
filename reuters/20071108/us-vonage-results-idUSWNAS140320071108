 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Vonage Holdings Corp ( VG.N ) said on Thursday its quarterly loss widened due to litigation costs, and cancellations rose due to problems with customer care and negative publicity from patent lawsuits. 

 Vonage said its third-quarter net loss expanded to $162 million, or $1.04 per share, from a loss of $62 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges, including those related to lawsuits from large phone companies like AT&T Inc ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) which claimed patent infringement, its loss narrowed to $16 million, or 10 cents a share, it said. Revenue rose 30 percent to $211 million. That was largely in line with market expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Churn, or cancellations, rose to 3 percent from 2.5 percent in the second quarter, it said. Vonage said 70 percent of those who left did so because of "poor experience." Some users have had to call several times to get problems fixed, said Vonage Chairman Jeffrey Citron. "The result of the existing care problems and negative press associated with the litigation caused churn to rise to 3 percent," he told Reuters. "The first thing the company needs to do is fix the customer service issue." (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; editing by John Wallace and Dave Zimmerman)
