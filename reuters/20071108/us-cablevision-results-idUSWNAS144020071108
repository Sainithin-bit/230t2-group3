 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cablevision Systems Corp ( CVC.N ) posted a wider quarterly loss as subscribers dwindled in a more competitive market, and the cable company cut its outlook for the number of services it will sell in 2007, sending shares down 3 percent. 

 The New York-based cable television operator, which has 3.1 million subscribers, said on Thursday it lost 16,000 basic subscribers during the third quarter, as it faced mounting competition from Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) and satellite TV operators in its region. Oppenheimer & Co had forecast Cablevision would lose 10,000 subscribers. Cablevision also lowered its outlook for the number of services it would sell in 2007 to 800,000 units, down from a previous estimate of 825,000 to 900,000. "The customer numbers were mixed and they reduced guidance, so we'd say their results were lackluster," said Thomas Eagan, analyst at Oppenheimer. Cablevision said its third-quarter net loss widened to $79.3 million, or 27 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $59.2 million or 22 cents per share a year earlier. Prior-year results included a tax benefit. Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $1.512 billion. Wall Street analysts on average had expected revenue of $1.545 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Cablevision executives said Verizon's FiOS high-speed Internet and video service now passes 1.1 million homes in its area and it has local approval to offer video services to 890,000 of these homes. But Chief Operating Officer Tom Rutledge said the company's high percentage of customers who take its "triple play" packages of video, phone and Internet services has helped Cablevision hold off competition. "The reason we've been able to hold our own against that competitive thrust is because of the triple play," said Rutledge. He said triple play customers have been found to be less likely to disconnect their service even in a more competitive environment. Cablevision said it added 35,000 digital video subscribers and 52,000 new high speed Internet subscribers during the quarter. Oppenheimer had expected 44,000 digital video additions and 41,000 Internet additions. It also added another 91,000 phone subscribers compared with the Oppenheimer forecast of 66,000. Last month, Cablevision shareholders rejected a $10.6 billion buyout bid offered by the Dolan family, after major stakeowners said it undervalued the business. Cablevision, owns several cable networks as well as major sports teams and venues including Radio City Music Hall, Madison Square Garden, the New York Knicks basketball team and the New York Rangers ice hockey team. U.S. cable stocks have been under pressure in recent weeks. Investors have worried over increasing subscriber losses as competition mounts from phone and satellite companies and the wider U.S. economy slows down due to a housing market crisis. Charter Communications Inc ( CHTR.O ), which has 5.7 million cable TV subscribers, on Wednesday posted a wider third-quarter loss of $407 million, or $1.10 a share, versus a loss of $133 million, or 41 cents a share a year before. The company, controlled by former Microsoft Corp ( MSFT.O ) co-founder Paul Allen, said it lost 40,200 basic subscribers during the quarter. Shares of Cablevision were down 41 cents at $26.12 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling as low as $25.57. Shares in Charter were down 60 cents or 34 percent to $1.18 after dropping as low as $1.11. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Dave Zimmerman)
