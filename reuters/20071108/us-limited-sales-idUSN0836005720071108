 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a year fell 6 percent in October. 

 Analysts on average had expected a same-store sales decrease of 1.8 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales for the operator of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains were $644.7 million in the four weeks ended November 3, down from $694.8 million a year earlier. October same-store sales fell 7 percent at Victoria's Secret and 6 percent at Bath & Body Works but rose 3 percent at the company's La Senza lingerie chain. Third-quarter company-wide same-store sales fell 3 percent, driven by a 4 percent decline at Victoria's Secret and a 3 percent decline at Bath & Body Works. The company said it expects November same-store sales to be flat. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by Mark Porter/Lisa Von Ahn)
