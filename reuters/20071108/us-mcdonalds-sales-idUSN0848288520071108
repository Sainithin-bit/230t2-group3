 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) on Thursday posted a 6.9 percent increase in sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, helped by a popular promotion in the United States and strength in Asia. 

 The world's largest restaurant chain has outperformed many other chains this year with breakfast items and newer menu choices like chicken snack wraps that have sold well in the United States, and extended hours in Asia. Those factors continued to boost sales in October and the company's stock rose more than 1 percent in premarket trading on Thursday. The company said U.S. same-store sales rose 5.4 percent, helped by its Monopoly game promotion, breakfast and late-night hours. Same-store sales rose 6.4 percent in Europe, lifted by strength in France, the United Kingdom and Russia, the company said. Same-store sales rose 9.4 percent in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa unit on extended hours and strength in most markets, especially Australia, Japan and China, the company said. Overall, total sales rose 14.2 percent, with 6 percentage points of the increase due to the weaker dollar, which lifts the dollar value of overseas sales. McDonald's shares traded at $59.25 on Thursday morning in electronic trading, up from Wednesday's New York Stock Exchange close of $58.38.
