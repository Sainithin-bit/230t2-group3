 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Upscale department store chain Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ) said on Thursday that October sales at stores open at least a year fell 2.4 percent. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting same-store sales to rise 1.1 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. It was the second-straight month that Nordstrom posted same-store sales that fell short of analysts' expectations. On a recorded call, the company said designer apparel and accessories sales were strong but business in California was hurt by fires in the southern part of the state. It also said an extra week in the previous year affected sales comparisons. The Seattle-based retailer said preliminary data indicated total sales for the four weeks ended November 3 rose 0.5 percent to $625.7 million. For the third quarter, Nordstrom said total sales rose 5.3 percent to $1.97 billion, about in line with analysts' estimates.
