 LONDON  (Reuters) - Highlights from British Prime Minister Gordon Brown's speech on the world's financial system at the London offices of Thomson Reuters: 

 GLOBAL SUPERVISION "This crisis demonstrates beyond doubt that a global capital market requires much stronger global cooperation and supervision. And we need to ensure that we have an effective global early warning system to alert us across continents to economic and financial risk." NEW BRETTON WOODS "Around us we must build a new Bretton Woods. A new financial architecture for the years ahead. Sometimes it does take a crisis for people to agree that what is obvious and should have been done years ago can no longer be postponed. But we must now create the right new financial architecture for the global age." "With the same courage and foresight of their founders, we must now reform the international financial system around agreed principles of transparency, integrity, responsibility, good housekeeping and cooperation across borders. "First transparency. We must now insist on openness and disclosure, with an immediate adoption of the internationally agreed accounting standards -- and the standards being brought forward for the valuation of assets. "And transparency must extend also to markets including the trillion dollar credit insurance markets which now play such a central role in shifting risk around the system. "Second integrity. We must tackle once and for all the conflicts of interest which have distorted behavior and undermined trust, and now lie at the heart of public concern." CAPITAL FLOWS SUPERVISION "We will not stop at immediate measures to stabilize the system. We also need measures to reshape the global financial system to make it fit for purpose for the future. This work is important for building confidence and this work must start today. "And we must start by recognizing that we are now in a global financial system and that while we have already global flows of capital we have supervision only at a national level. "And just as we need new global coordination to deal with the waves of change that are defining the new global age from energy supply to climate change, so we need enhanced global cooperation to monitor and then supervise financial flows that know no borders." INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION "The global financial system is too clouded with opacity, conflicts of interest, irresponsible risk taking, and when problems occur countries have tended to look inwards and deal with them in isolation when it is clear they should look outwards and join in international cooperation." "This cannot simply be a short term rescue to paper over the cracks. only surgical approach that gets to the root of the problem will now work to ensure the problems do not return." WORLD LEADERS "This financial crisis now affects the whole world and because we recognize the importance of Asia, so I am in touch with the Asian authorities, too. "Later this week we will go further when we meet as a European Council in Brussels and we are proposing a world leaders meeting at which we must agree the principles and policies for restructuring the financial system across the globe."
