 LONDON  (Reuters) - Three major British banks could take 37 billion pounds ($64 billion) in government money to boost their capital, the government said on Monday. 

 Below are highlights of the deal: MEASURES - The government is making capital investments in RBS, and upon successful merger, HBOS and Lloyds TSB, totaling 37 billion pounds. - Following the completion of these capital investments, each of the institutions will have a Tier 1 capital ratio in excess of 9 percent, well above international minimum standards and at a level that should put them on a strong footing for the future. BANK COMMITMENTS IN RETURN FOR CAPITAL - Maintaining, over the next three years, the availability and active marketing of competitively priced lending to homeowners and to small businesses at 2007 levels - Support for schemes to help people struggling with mortgage payments to stay in their homes, and to support the expansion of financial capability initiatives - Conditions on the remuneration of senior executives, both for 2008 (when the government expects no cash bonuses to be paid to board members) and in the future when incentive schemes will be linked to long-term value creation, take account of risk and avoid rewarding failure. - The right for the government to agree with boards the appointment of new independent non-executive directors - Suspension of dividends COMMITMENTS BY GOVERNMENT - The government intends to create a new arms-length body to manage the government's shareholdings in recapitalized institutions on a professional and wholly commercial basis, and seek to effectively realize value to the taxpayer. - Transparent arrangements will be put in place to ensure that any role for the government in relation to investment decision-making is clearly defined. - The government is not a permanent investor in UK banks. Its intention, over time, is to dispose of all the investments it is making as part of this scheme in an orderly way. - To reflect the implementation of the scheme, the government will on Tuesday announce a revised debt remit for the Debt Management Office. AIMS OF PACKAGE - Make available new Tier 1 capital to UK banks to strengthen their resources permitting them to restructure their finances and maintain their support for the real economy. - Ensure that the banking system has the funds necessary to maintain lending in the medium term - To support stability in the financial system; protect ordinary savers, depositors, businesses and borrowers; and to safeguard the interests of the taxpayer. LLOYDS TSB TAKEOVER OF HBOS - Revises terms for the acquisition of HBOS. - HBOS shareholders will receive 0.605 Lloyds TSB share (0.833 previously) for every 1 HBOS share. At the same time, an offer will also be made to the Treasury to exchange preference shares in HBOS for equivalent preference shares in Lloyds TSB. - The board of Lloyds TSB intends to recommend that Lloyds TSB shareholders vote in favor of the necessary resolutions. The board of HBOS has also agreed to recommend the revised terms. The Takeover Panel has consented to the revised terms. - Lloyds TSB expects the deal will be completed early 2009. - The enlarged entity will continue to use The Mound as its Scottish headquarters, will continue to hold its AGM in Scotland and will continue to print Bank of Scotland notes. - Upon completion of the deal HBOS Chief Executive Andy Hornby and Chairman Dennis Stevenson will leave the group. LLOYDS & HBOS RAISE 17 BILLION POUNDS IN CAPTIAL - 17 billion pounds of capital to be raised by the combined group, of which 11.5 billion (8.5 billion pounds in ordinary shares and 3 billion pounds in preference shares) will be raised by HBOS and 5.5 billion pounds (4.5 billion pounds in ordinary shares and 1 billion pounds in preference shares) by Lloyds TSB. - The equity capital raising by Lloyds TSB comprises a subscription by the British Treasury of about 2.6 billion new ordinary shares at 173.3 pence per share, representing an 8.5 percent discount to Lloyds TSB's closing price on October 10 and raising about 4.5 billion pounds in total. - Lloyds TSB shareholders will be given the opportunity to claw back their proportionate entitlement to these new Lloyds TSB shares through an open offer. - In addition, the British government will subscribe for 1.0 billion Lloyds TSB preference shares. The preference shares will carry an annual coupon of 12 percent (non tax deductible), and will be callable after a period of five years. - If neither Lloyds TSB nor HBOS shareholders participate in the claw-back, the government will own 43.5 percent of the combined group, existing Lloyds TSB shareholders will own 36.5 percent and existing HBOS shareholders 20.0 percent. - Under the terms of the preference shares, the enlarged group will be precluded from paying a cash dividend on ordinary shares whilst any of the preference shares remain outstanding. - The revised terms and the 8.5 billion pound equity capital raising by HBOS will result in the issue by Lloyds TSB of 7.80 billion new ordinary shares in respect of the acquisition. - Following the actions announced today, the equity placing completed on 19 September 2008 and the inclusion of the HBOS acquisition on a pro forma basis at 30 June 2008, the enlarged group had a core Tier 1 ratio in excess of 8.5 percent.
