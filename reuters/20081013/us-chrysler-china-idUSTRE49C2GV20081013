 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Chinese automakers Chery Automobile Co and SAIC Motor ( 600104.SS ) said on Monday they have not had talks about possible access to Chrysler's U.S. dealership network with Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL, majority owner of the troubled U.S. car maker. 

 While exploring opportunities to merge Chrysler's loss-making operations with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), Cerberus also had talks with a number of Chinese automakers, including Chery, SAIC Motor and FAW Car Co ( 000800.SZ ), about access to Chrysler's U.S. dealer network, two sources familiar with the matter said over the weekend. But spokesmen at both Chery and SAIC, a GM China partner, said they had no knowledge of such talks with Chrysler or Cerberus. Executives at FAW and its parent FAW Group, a partner of Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ) and Toyota Motor ( 7203.T ), could not immediately be reached for comment. "I have not heard of any discussions about dealer networks with Chrysler," said the Chery spokesman. He declined to discuss the current status of Chery's plan to sell China-made compact cars in the Americas under the Chrysler badge. Chery Chairman Yin Tongyao said in April that the company aimed to begin exporting its A1 compact car to South America before the end of this year. (Reporting by Fang Yan; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
