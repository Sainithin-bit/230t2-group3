 BERLIN/PARIS  (Reuters) - Germany and France prepared to unveil massive financial rescues on Monday as governments across Europe stepped in to shield banks and restore confidence in the face of the worst financial crisis in nearly 80 years. 

 The measures will be a crucial test of investor faith in the ability of European politicians to get a grip on the global financial crisis after promising a series of coordinated rescue packages after an emergency summit in Paris on Sunday. So far the reaction has been positive. Stock markets across Europe rallied after leaders from the 15-nation euro zone agreed at a summit in Paris on Sunday to present a series of coordinated rescue packages. The interbank cost of borrowing three-month sterling and euro funds also eased in response to the bank rescue measures. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government was set to unveil a 470 billion euro package, a draft bill seen by Reuters showed, that would include 400 billion in guarantees to help banks get over a liquidity squeeze and 70 billion to recapitalize them. France was preparing a similar plan that would set up a fund of 40 billion euros to aid troubled banks and provide up to 300 billion euros in bank guarantees, according to media reports. Italy was also expected to present new measures for its financial sector in a flurry of announcements timed for around 3 p.m. (1300) central European time. Underpinning the government plans, European central banks said they would lend out as much U.S. dollar liquidity as commercial banks needed in renewed joint bid to tame money market tensions. "The biggest change from today relative to last week is the fact that euro zone officials seem to have come up with a template plan from which national governments can pick and choose and implement where they see necessary," said Derek Halpenny, European head of Fx research at BTM-UFJ. Although governments are bracing for a prolonged period of economic weakness, they hope the measures announced on Monday will stem a crisis of confidence in the financial system that has sent global stock markets spiraling lower. "Despite prospects of a worsening economic crisis, we believe that the nationalization of parts of the banking system could be viewed as the defining moment that marked the start of the end of the financial crisis," Philip Finch, global banks analyst at UBS, said in a note to clients. FORCED TO UNITE On top of the steps in continental Europe, Britain, which presented its own bank rescue plan last week, said it would spend up to 37 billion pounds ($63.95 billion) buying into top UK financial institutions. The move means the Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government is likely to become the biggest shareholder in Royal Bank of Scotland and lender HBOS. For weeks, European governments were divided about how to address the crisis, which reached new heights last month with the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers and quickly spread across the Atlantic. Some countries, like France and Italy, had mulled the idea of a Europe-wide rescue fund. Others, like Germany, had resisted blanket measures and advocated a case-by-case approach to bank troubles. "The leeway allowed to each European country lends some credibility to thelikelihood of European plans moving forward quickly and possibly being adopted by each country's parliament by the end of the this week," SocGen said in note. The summit on Sunday, hosted by French President Nicolas Sarkozy, was seen as a last chance to overcome those differences and send a strong signal to investors following stock market plunges across the globe last week. "I think that thanks to the decisions that have just been taken, the peak of the crisis is perhaps behind us," Dominique Strauss-Kahn, managing director of the International Monetary Fund told French radio. Britain's Gordon Brown, whose decisive action during the crisis has bolstered his political standing at home, called on Monday for world leaders to come together to remake the Bretton Woods agreement for a new globalize financial system. He said he would push his plan for an overhaul of the rules that govern world finance at a meeting of European Union heads of government on Wednesday. "Sometimes it does take a crisis for people to agree that what is obvious and should have been done years ago can no longer be postponed. But we must now create the right new financial architecture for the global age," Brown said in a speech at the London offices of Thomson Reuters.
