 (Reuters) - The retirement of Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) chief financial officer last week came after increasing friction between him and other senior executives, The Wall Street Journal said citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Top executives at Ford in recent weeks spoke with Chief Executive Alan Mulally and Chairman William C. Ford Jr about their dissatisfaction with CFO Don Leclair, the paper said citing the people. The working relationship had frayed so much that at least two high-level company officials talked openly about whether they could continue to working with Leclair serving as CFO, the people told the paper. The strained relations between Leclair and other members of Ford's senior management team centered on whether Leclair had been too forceful in pursuing his own agenda without informing other vice presidents in a timely way of his plans, the paper said citing the people. Ford could not be immediately reached for comment. Leclair, who helped steer Ford through a $23 billion borrowing program in 2006, announced his retirement on Friday after 32 years with the company.
