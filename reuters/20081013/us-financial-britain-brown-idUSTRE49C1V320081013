 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain bailed out three major banks with 37 billion pounds ($64 billion) to boost their capital, the UK Treasury said on Monday. 

 Following are comments by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and finance minister Alistair Darling at a news conference after the bailout was announced: BROWN "This is perhaps the first government to do what I believe a large number of governments are going to do over the next few days and it is about restoring trust and confidence in the banking system, which is absolutely essential." "We would prefer other investors to come in and many will but at the last resort it is right that the government is prepared to take the step that is necessary. If we can strengthen our banks then our holdings will be temporary. We are ready to move them on to other investors when it becomes the right time to do so." "There will be no dividends paid until the government's preference shares have been fully redeemed." "I spoke to President (George W.) Bush last night after returning from Paris and we agreed the common ground for action in our two continents." "I believe that only by global action can we fully restore the confidence that is needed and build the international financial order. And I will put forward proposals for major reform of the international institution at a speech in the City (of London) later this morning."
