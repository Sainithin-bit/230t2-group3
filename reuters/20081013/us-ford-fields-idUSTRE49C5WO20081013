 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.'s president of Americas operations Mark Fields on Monday declined to comment on reports that the automaker has had talks with larger rival General Motors Corp on a potential tie-up. 

 Fields said the automaker was focused on executing its establishing turnaround plan and in taking "fast and decisive" action to tough external conditions. He also said U.S. industrywide sales in October continues to be weak so far. (Reporting by  David Bailey )
