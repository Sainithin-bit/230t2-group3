 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea said on Monday it would make it easier for funds and foreign banks to be top shareholders in local banks, in a move aimed at stabilizing an industry rocked by the global financial crisis. 

 The first of financial reforms promised by a government that took office eight months ago should bring in much-needed capital by broadening the banking sector's investor base, and could also help bank privatizations. It may also allow Korea's giant conglomerates such as Samsung and Hyundai to muscle into a sector they have been barred from controlling, analysts said. The change comes amid concern that South Korea's banks could fall victim to global financial turmoil that is piling up local and foreign debt problems and forcing the government to delay sales of state-controlled banks. "The global banking industry trend of growing big and the financial crisis require reasonable improvements to the current regulations which are excessive and strict," the Financial Services Commission regulator said in a statement. "Judging from the current situation, loosened regulations would give more positive factors for our banking industry growth." Bank shares rose sharply, with Shinhan Financial Group, the top financial services firm, up 7.9 percent and second-ranked Woori Finance Holdings gaining more than 14 percent. Fourth-ranked Hana Financial Group, nearly 10 percent owned by Singapore investor Temasek, jumped 14.6 percent. The main share index ended up 3.8 percent. Facing a weak won and tight liquidity, South Korean banks are struggling to service foreign currency debts that have grown with increased exposure to wholesale funding instruments such as bond issues as depositors shift to higher yielding investment funds. At home, there are concerns the banks could be sitting on more bad debt if a slowing economy triggers company failures. The announcement is the first major economic reform by President Lee Myung-bak whose support has dwindled since taking office in February promising sweeping changes to make Asia's fourth-largest economy more competitive. The move also comes ahead of the Capital Markets Integration Act, which takes effect in February, designed to give securities companies a bigger role and break down barriers between brokerages, asset managers and futures trading firms. But analysts warned that Korea's family-run and cash-rich conglomerates could take control of domestic banks, an issue that remains politically charged. "Large conglomerates having management rights can help enhance banks' competitiveness in that banks can make a strategic decision swiftly and reasonably manage themselves," said Hanwha Securities' analyst Park Jeong-hyun. "This is very positive for banks. But the government still needs to figure out how to prevent conglomerates from using banks as their money sources, taking into account public concerns." Under a looser ownership ceiling, non-financial services firms will be able to hold 10 percent voting rights in domestic banks, up from 4 percent. The government will reclassify some pension and private equity funds, including the National Pension Service and MBK Partners -- a private equity fund set up by former Carlyle Group Asia head Michael Kim -- as financial investors, allowing them to control a local bank. That relaxation would also apply to foreign banks, and may include DBS, the Singapore bank forced to drop its bid for Korea Exchange Bank last year because top shareholder Temasek was a non-financial institution. The FSC expects deregulation to help the privatization of Korea Development Bank, Woori and Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK), while KB Financial Group, parent of top local bank Kookmin, is looking to sell shares in itself to bolster its capital base and secure funding for acquisitions. The government will also allow insurance-focused holding companies to control non-financial services firms as units so they can compete better with banks and securities companies. The FSC will submit the changes for parliamentary approval this year. (Additional reporting by Park Ju-min; Editing by Jonathan Thatcher & Ian Geoghegan)
