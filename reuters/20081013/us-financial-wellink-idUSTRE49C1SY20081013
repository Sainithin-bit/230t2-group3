 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch central bank governor Nout Wellink has called for a European banking supervisor, Dutch newspaper De Gelderlander reported on Monday. 

 Asked about his opinion on Iceland's banking supervision, Wellink said in an interview in Washington: "The results were, to say it politely, not brilliant. I think that a European supervisor can do more here. It does not exist now but I think there should be one." Wellink said the Netherlands could go "very far" in shoring up financial institutions. "As long as money is being put into healthy companies, there will be a return," he said. Asked how sure he was that the support for the financial system would work, Wellink said: "Pretty sure. But of course you don't know whether there are other things that will go into the wrong direction." (Reporting by  Niclas Mika ; Editing by  Valerie Lee )
