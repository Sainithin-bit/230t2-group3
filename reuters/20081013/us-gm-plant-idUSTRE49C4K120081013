 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp said on Monday it would close its Janesville, Wisconsin, assembly plant by year-end in response to slumping demand for the full-size SUVs it manufactures. 

 GM had previously said it would close the Janesville plant by 2010, but a spokesman said the sharp drop in SUV sales through September had forced it to act sooner. The plant employs about 1,200 hourly workers represented by the United Auto Workers and assembles GM's Yukon and Suburban SUV models. The plant will shut down operations on December 23. In a related move, GM announced earlier this month that it would also close an SUV plant in Ohio by the end of the year, cutting about 1,200 jobs, most of them hourly workers. GM builds the Chevrolet TrailBlazer, GMC Envoy and Saab 9-7X SUVs at the plant in Moraine, Ohio. In June, GM had said it expected to close the truck plants in Ohio and Wisconsin by 2010 because of sharply reduced demand. GM spokesman Chris Lee said the automaker believes it has sufficient production capacity for SUVs with its remaining plant in Arlington, Texas. "The forecasts are that the market will continue to shrink," he said. GM's U.S. sales through September were down 18 percent from a year earlier, a deeper decline that the 13 percent posted by the industry as a whole. The plant closure came at a time when investor attention is focused on the possibility of a GM merger. The automaker has had talks with Chrysler LLC owner Cerberus Capital Management and Ford Motor Co in recent weeks, people familiar with those talks have said.
