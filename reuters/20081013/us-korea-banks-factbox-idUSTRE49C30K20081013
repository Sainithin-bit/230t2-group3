 (Reuters) - South Korea outlined on Monday plans to make it easier for funds and foreign banks to be top shareholders in local banks, a move that could help steady an industry rocked by the global financial crisis. 

 Following are excerpts from a Financial Services Commission (FSC) statement: OWNERSHIP OF DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL BANKS: PENSION FUNDS - Infrastructure-investing companies, invested by pension funds, will be excluded from a review of whether or not they are financial investors. Public pension funds will be classified as financial investing firms if conditions are met. PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS (PEFs) - PEFs, in which non-financial companies hold a stake below 30 percent as limited partners, will be classified as financial investors. NON-FINANCIAL COMPANIES - Allowed to buy up to 10 percent voting rights, up from 4 percent FOREIGN BANKS - Foreign banks or banking holding companies, which are supervised by their home countries, have high credit ratings and are not controlled by non-financial companies, will be classified as financial companies. FINANCIAL HOLDING COMPANIES: - Allows both insurance-focused financial holding companies and financial investment holding companies to control non-financial services firms as subsidiaries. - Eases regulations over establishment of non-banking holding companies. - Allows staff to take double posts between subsidiaries. - Expands business scope to be entrusted to sister companies under a holding firm, including computer and back-office work. - Removes investment limits on financial holding companies' investments in subsidiaries, compared with a current 100 percent ceiling of holding company's capital. - Lowers minimum ownership for holding companies' overseas units to 30-50 percent from 100 percent.
