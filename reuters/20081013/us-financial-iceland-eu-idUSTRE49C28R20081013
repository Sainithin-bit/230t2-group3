 REYKJAVIK  (Reuters) - A key Icelandic minister long opposed to joining the European Union said on Monday that given the current financial turmoil, the country had to consider every option, including a shift in that stance. 

 Fisheries Minister Einar Gudfinnsson said on Icelandic radio: "It's no secret, I've been against membership. However, the current turmoil means we have to look at every option." Many Icelandic citizens and politicians have in recent years advocated joining the euro currency, a step that requires EU membership first. But the fishing industry has long been fearful of joining the trading bloc on the grounds it could lead to fishing concessions.
