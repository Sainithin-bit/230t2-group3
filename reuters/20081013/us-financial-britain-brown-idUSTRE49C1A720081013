 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain bailed out three major banks with 37 billion pounds ($64 billion) to boost their capital, the UK Treasury said on Monday. 

 Following are comments by Prime Minister Gordon Brown and finance minister Alistair Darling at a news conference after the bailout was announced: DARLING ON ICELAND "As soon as it became apparent that Iceland had decided to leave out British depositors from what they were proposing that we took action to secure assets of the bank. And I said we want to resolve that, but the Icelandic government needs to take a decision to resolve its own problems and they are reflecting on that. There will be announcement in relation to Landsbanki very shortly." BROWN ON RBS "As I understand it, (RBS Chief Executive) Sir Fred (Goodwin) is announcing that he is not taking any severance payment." DARLING ON PREFERENCE SHARES "We are investing in banks where, as conditions improve, we will get our money back and of course we also get dividends and the guarantees of lending come at a cost." "You have to get the right balance here. The preference shares have the advantage that they are first call. The banks do have to pay us a premium for having these shares. But if you have too many preference shares that puts a burden on the banks that actually might be counterproductive so the bulk of the shares in relation to RBS and the Lloyds TSB HBOS group are ordinary shares." BROWN ON OTHER ACTION "This is perhaps the first government to do what I believe a large number of governments are going to do over the next few days and it is about restoring trust and confidence in the banking system, which is absolutely essential." "We would prefer other investors to come in and many will but at the last resort it is right that the government is prepared to take the step that is necessary. If we can strengthen our banks then our holdings will be temporary. We are ready to move them on to other investors when it becomes the right time to do so." "There will be no dividends paid until the government's preference shares have been fully redeemed." "I spoke to President (George W.) Bush last night after returning from Paris and we agreed the common ground for action in our two continents." "I believe that only by global action can we fully restore the confidence that is needed and build the international financial order. And I will put forward proposals for major reform of the international institution at a speech in the City (of London) later this morning."
