 (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSN.VX ), Merrill Lynch MER.N, the JPMorgan Cazenove ( JPM.N ) CAZ.UL joint venture are winning deals as the British government pumps in 37 billion pounds ($64.5 billion) of taxpayers' money to bail out three major banks on Monday. 

 But bankers say these investment banks are unlikely to earn big underwriting fees because the UK Treasury will be taking most of the underwriting risks. Following are the advisers to the capital raising plans of major UK banks: RBS ( RBS.L ) -- Merrill MER.N and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) are joint financial advisers. -- RBS is to raise 15 billion pounds worth of core tier 1 capital at 65.5 pence each, resulting in 22.9 billion of new shares on top of 16.5 billion current shares, leaving existing shareholders with a 40 percent stake. -- Treasury will subscribe for 5 billion pounds of preference shares (coupon of 12 percent, callable five years, not convertible to shares), further increasing RBS's tier 1 ratio to around 10 percent. -- Prospectus expected in late October. -- No dividend will be paid on common shares until the preference shares have been repaid. LLOYDS TSB ( LLOY.L ) -- Merrill Lynch, UBS and Citi ( C.N ) are the joint bookrunners for placing the offers. -- Lloyds is to raise 4.5 billion pounds by issuing common shares, with the UK government subscribing for 2.6 billion pounds worth of the new shares at 173.3 pence each, an 8.5 percent discount to the closing price on October 10. -- Lloyds is to issue 1 billion pounds of preference shares, which carry a coupon of 12 percent and are callable after five years. -- Lloyds also revised the HBOS buyout terms, offering 0.605 Lloyds shares for every HBOS share, resulting in 7.8 billion new shares now. -- Core tier 1 ratio to reach 8.5 percent. HBOS HBOS.L -- Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) is sponsor to the deal. -- HBOS is to issue 11.5 billion pounds in shares. -- Including 3 billion pounds of preference shares, which are callable at par after five years with an annual coupon of 12 percent in the first five years and Libor plus 700 basis points thereafter. -- And 8.5 billion pounds in common shares at 113.6 pence per share. The new shares will represent 58.1 percent of enlarged share capital. BARCLAYS ( BARC.L ) -- JP Morgan Cazenove and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) are advising the bank. -- Although Barclays is not taking any public money, it is raising 6.5 billion pounds to lift its tier 1 capital to over 11 percent. -- It will issue 3 billion pounds of preference shares by the end of the year and 3 billion pounds in common shares before March 2009. -- One shareholder has already committed to contribute 1 billion pounds. HM Treasury -- Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) is the sole financial adviser to the Treasury on the subscription of shares in RBS, HBOS and Lloyds. The bank is also advising the government on the merger between HBOS and Lloyds. -- UBS, J.P. Morgan Cazenove and independent adviser Michael Klein, Citi's former chairman of institutional clients group, were also informally advising the UK government last week.
