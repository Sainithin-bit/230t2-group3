 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK is opposing its creditors' request for documents related to the investment bank's operations before its bankruptcy filing, saying that the demands are inappropriate and oppressive, according to court documents. 

 Creditors, including Harbinger Capital Master Fund and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ), had sought permission from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York to conduct depositions and access documents saying there had been no disclosure of how cash was distributed before the bankruptcy filing, among other complaints. But in court documents filed on Sunday, Lehman Brothers Holdings said that the demands were "inappropriate" and would unduly burden the company. Lehman asked the court to deny the motion.
