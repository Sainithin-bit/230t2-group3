 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers likely added 128,000 jobs in October, a survey by a private employment service said on Wednesday. 

 From July through October, estimated job growth in the survey has averaged about 0.1 percent, said ADP Employer Services, whose employment report was jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. The median forecast for the ADP survey from 10 economists surveyed by Reuters pointed to a reading of 103,000 new jobs for the October report. Automatic Data Processing, based in Roseland, New Jersey, is the parent of ADP Employer Services and is a large payroll services company. Macroeconomic Advisers LLC is based in St. Louis, Missouri. The ADP National Employment Report is released each month, two days prior to the government's own job survey. According to the latest Reuters poll of economists, the U.S. Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday is expected to show that 125,000 non-farm payroll jobs were created in October, up from 51,000 in September. Based on a derivatives auction conducted on Tuesday by Goldman Sachs, interdealer broker ICAP and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME.N, traders' median expectations for the October payroll reading was a 112,760 job increase.
