 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Wednesday said U.S. October vehicle sales rose 8.1 percent compared to a year ago when demand fell after a summer of showroom discounts. 

 The second-largest U.S. automaker said it sold 215,985 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 199,847 vehicles a year earlier. Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks and are not adjusted for the extra selling day in October 2005. Ford also estimated its inventory levels of Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands at 622,000 units -- down 107,000 units from a year ago.
