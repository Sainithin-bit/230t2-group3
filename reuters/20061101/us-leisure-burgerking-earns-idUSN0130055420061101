 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Burger King Holdings Inc. BKC.N, the world's No. 2 hamburger chain, on Wednesday reported a better-than-expected 82 percent rise in quarterly profit, as the new BK Stacker hamburger helped sales and the company had a lower tax rate. 

 Burger King also said it was considering other uses for its excess cash, including dividends or share repurchases, and stock in the newly public company rose as much as 9.5 percent. Net income for the fiscal first quarter ended September 30 rose to $40 million, or 30 cents per share, from $22 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding $13 million in early debt retirement costs and other one-time items, last year's first-quarter earnings were $35 million, or 26 cents per share. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 26 cents per share in the latest period, according to Reuters Estimates. Total quarterly revenue rose 7 percent to $546 million. Worldwide comparable-store sales, a key retail measure, were up 2.4 percent. Burger King said sales of its BK Stacker sandwiches, which have two, three or four beef patties and bacon and cheese, exceeded expectations. Its lower-priced "Value Menu" items such as a Whopper Jr. sandwich and small French fries added to both revenue and profit. Burger King introduced the value menu earlier this year to help it compete against McDonald's Corp.'s ( MCD.N ) Dollar Menu and Wendy's International Inc.'s WEN.N Super Value Menu. CHIDSEY STRESSES VALUE MENU On a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, Burger King Chief Executive John Chidsey said the value menu would be key to increasing sales going forward. "We continue to believe that we have growth opportunities in the value segment," Chidsey said. The company's effective tax rate decreased by more than 10 percentage points to about 37 percent due to a restructuring of its European and Asian units, which also boosted earnings. In a note to clients, J.P. Morgan analyst John Ivankoe said same-restaurant sales and profit margins "were at or above expectations in all regions." Burger King's business in the United States and Canada was benefiting from extended hours, the value menu, and strong promotions, he said. Burger King went public after being owned by private equity firms Texas Pacific Group, Bain Capital and a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. affiliate since 2002. The company's shares were up $1.47, or 8.8 percent, at $18.25 in late-morning trade Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares trade at about 14 times analysts' profit forecasts for the next year, compared with 16.4 times for larger rival McDonald's Corp.
