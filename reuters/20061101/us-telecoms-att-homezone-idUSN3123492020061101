 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc., the nation's largest phone company, said on Wednesday it was expanding its AT&T Homezone service, which combines high-speed Internet and satellite television in one set-top box. 

 The Homezone service, which offers digital video recording, movies on demand, and photo- and music-sharing will now be available in most areas it operates in, the company said. The service was initially launched in July in selected areas in Texas and Ohio. The expanded launch comes amid its bid to compete against cable companies' all-in-one offerings of video, voice and Internet services. Homezone is designed as an alternative to AT&T's Web-based television service U-Verse, which runs on fiber optic networks, for customers who live in areas without fiber deployment. Homezone will be available at various prices depending on features such as long-distance calling, channels and Internet speed. Bundled packages will cost around $80-$140 per month, compared to $70-$120 per month for the U-Verse bundle, a spokesman said. AT&T did not provide any sales forecasts for Homezone. The service combines services from its partnerships with Internet company Yahoo Inc. and EchoStar Communications Corp.'s DISH Network.
