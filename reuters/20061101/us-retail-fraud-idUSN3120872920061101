 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Santa won't be the only one trying to decide who's naughty or nice this holiday season. 

 One in four U.S. retailers plans to crack down on fraudulent returns, which are expected to cost the industry some $3.5 billion over the November-December shopping period, according to a survey released on Wednesday by the National Retail Federation. The trade group's poll of 90 retailers found that some 95 percent have had stolen merchandise returned for a refund, the most popular form of return fraud. More than half of retailers surveyed said customers had tried to return used merchandise -- everything from already-worn party dresses to laptop computers. "Retailers have often viewed lenient return policies as a cost of doing business with honest shoppers," Joseph LaRocca, the NRF's head of loss prevention, said in a statement. "Unfortunately, due to an increase in return fraud, retailers are being forced to strike a delicate balance between servicing loyal shoppers and discouraging opportunistic criminals." The survey found that 25 percent of retailers will be tightening their return policies this year, while 70 percent will keep them unchanged from last year. Around 5 percent planned to make the rules more lenient, giving customers extra time to return merchandise or easing rules on receipts. Returns typically spike after the holidays, with some 8.8 percent of gifts expected to be brought back this year. Normally, about 7.3 percent of purchases are returned. The NRF survey was conducted October 2-27.
