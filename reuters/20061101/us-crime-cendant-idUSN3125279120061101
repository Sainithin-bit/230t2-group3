 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. District Court convicted former Cendant Corp. CD.N Chairman Walter Forbes on Tuesday of organizing a $14 billion fraud to inflate the real estate and travel firm's profits. 

 Forbes and former Cendant Vice Chairman Kirk Shelton oversaw a decade-long accounting scheme that inflated earnings and stock values of Cendant and its predecessor company CUC International, said U.S. Attorney Christopher Christie. Two previous juries could not reach a verdict on Forbes. Shelton was convicted of fraud in January 2005, when Forbes was tried for the first time. Cendant's stock fell more than $19 after the falsification of its earnings was disclosed in 1998, wiping $14 billion off its market value. It was one of a series of accounting scandals that shook the U.S. corporate world. "The innocent victims of this $14 billion fraud engineered by Walter Forbes have waited a long time for justice to be done," Christie said. "This is a great day for those who believe that everyone in our society must be held accountable for their conduct." Forbes was convicted of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and on two counts of making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission. He is due to be sentenced on January 17 and faces 10 years in prison and a $1 million fine. Shelton was sentenced in August to 10 years in prison and was ordered to pay nearly $3.3 billion in restitution, but is now free on bail as he appeals his conviction and sentence.
