 NEW YORK  Nov 1 (Reuters) - Prudential Financial Inc.
( PRU.N ) said on Wednesday that third-quarter operating earnings
increased 18 percent from year-ago levels and beat analyst
estimates by a wide margin as insurance and annuities generally
achieved better results.  Prudential, the second-largest life insurer in the United
States, also forecast earnings per share for the full year
above analysts' average estimates.  "Prudential showed a lot of strength in its underlying
businesses," said Donald Light, an analyst with Celent LLC.
"Overall they are still a rock."  Prudential's results show a trend among insurers such as
MetLife Inc. ( MET.N ) and Lincoln National Corp. ( LNC.N ) to
outperform Wall Street's earnings expectations.  The company said operating earnings, which analysts use to
measure performance because it excludes investment gains and
losses, were $830 million, or $1.72 a share.  On that basis, analysts on average expected the insurer to
earn $1.48 a share, according to Reuters estimates.  In the year-ago quarter, Prudential earned $739 million, or
$1.46 a share, from operations.  By contrast, net income for the Newark, New Jersey-based
insurer fell to $1.15 billion, or $2.38 a share, down from
$1.32 billion, or $2.59 a share, in the year-earlier quarter.  The decline in net was due to a tax refund of $720 million
in last year's third quarter, the company said. After
adjustments, the company also had a decline in operating income
in its individual life business because more policy-holders
died, it said.  In after-hours trading, Prudential's shares rose slightly
to $76.98 from a New York Stock Exchange close of $76.32.  "Prudential's core businesses showed good growth, but I'm
still concerned that premiums are lower," said Eric Fitzwater
of SNL Financial. "They overcame that with growth in investment
income and kept expenses down.  Prudential Chief Executive Arthur Ryan said that, based on
results for the first nine months, the company was on track to
achieve earnings per share of $5.90 to $6 for 2006, compared
with analysts' estimates of $5.76, as polled by Reuters
Estimates.  Since the start of the year, Prudential's shares have risen
4.3 percent, compared with a 3.5 percent gain in the Standard &
Poor's insurance index .GSPINSC. Prudential trades at a price
to earnings multiple of 13.3 compared with 14.7 for a group of
comparable insurers.  In its insurance division, adjusted operating income was
$465 million for the third quarter, compared with $341 million
in the year ago quarter. Operating income for individual life
and annuities, which are policies with long-term structured
payouts, rose to $375 million for the latest quarter compared
with $281 million for the year ago, Prudential said.
