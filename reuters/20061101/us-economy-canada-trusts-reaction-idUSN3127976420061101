 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The Canadian government's plan to overhaul the rules for income trusts will change much more than just taxes and could lead to everything from a protracted dive by the Toronto Stock Exchange to smaller bonuses for Bay Street investment bankers. 

 Ottawa's surprise move to level the tax playing field between corporations and income trusts, announced late Tuesday, has already roiled analysts and executives preparing to cope with the possibility of an end to tax advantages enjoyed by trusts. John Brussa, a tax lawyer at Burnet Duckworth & Palmer in Calgary, who sits on a number of income-trust boards, had harsh words for the Conservative government on Tuesday. "This arbitrary action is not very conducive to business," he said. "This is going to cost a bunch of people a lot of money tomorrow." Two mammoth telecom conversions hang in the balance while Bay Street tries to glean more detail of Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's thinking on the issue. BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ), which owns Canada's largest telephone company, said earlier this month it planned to transform into a trust. The decision was timely, as its tax shelters would be fully used up in the first half of next year, triggering a mountain of taxes. BCE has estimated C$250 million in tax would have to be paid in 2007 -- soaring to C$800 million in 2008. Rival Telus Corp. ( T.TO ), which announced plans to convert exactly a month before BCE, is also likely thinking twice about such as move. Telus declined to comment on Tuesday and BCE did not return requests for comment. Along with the conversions, millions of dollars in legal and corporate-finance fees related to trust conversions -- both future and present, as well as trust initial public offerings -- are at stake for blue chip law firms and investment banks. Then, there's the Toronto Stock Exchange, which relies heavily on the performance of financial and energy shares, many of which are trusts. "This is going to be a bolt from the blue," said Elvis Picardo, chief market strategist at Global Securities Corp. in Vancouver. Picardo noted that the last time talk of taxing trusts began, in September 2005, the TSX saw a selloff led largely by trusts and potential conversion candidates. "That came to an end, and the market really turned to the upside once Ottawa said that they would not be taxing trusts," he said. "So, based on what we know, and based on the reaction that stocks like Telus and BCE have seen ever since they announced they'd be converting, I think you can expect a fairly negative reaction in the markets tomorrow." What's more, portfolio managers may decide to sell trust holdings if the impetus for holding them -- steady and hefty distributions -- becomes negated by government tax changes. But some analysts said they remained confused by Ottawa's proposals and the apparent about-face from earlier indications that the trust structure would continue to thrive. "What is the policy? You can't just flop around," said William Lacey, an analyst at FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. ($1=$1.12 Canadian)
