 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturers and consumers would face higher prices for a number of goods if Congress fails to renew a trade benefits program for developing countries that expires at the end of this year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a report on Wednesday. 

 "We'd like to see a full renewal of the program, with no qualifiers," said John Murphy, vice president for the Western Hemisphere at the business group. "Congress should remember the Hippocratic oath of 'first do no harm.'" The 32-year-old Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program uses trade as a foreign economic development tool by waiving U.S. import duties on thousands of goods from more than 130 developing countries. However, key U.S. lawmakers are frustrated that big GSP beneficiaries like Brazil and India have resisted U.S. demands in world trade talks to open their markets to more U.S. agricultural and manufactured goods. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley, an Iowa Republican, has threatened to let the program expire at the end of the year, while U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Thomas, a California Republican, has proposed renewing the program with changes that would reduce benefits for Brazil and India. The Bush administration favors continuing the program, but is in the midst of a review that could kick some countries out and reduce benefits for others. "The bottom line in this report is that GSP brings significant benefits to American companies, American consumers," Murphy said. Congress will return to Washington for a short session after the November 7 elections. The chamber hopes lawmakers will make renewal of the program a priority, Murphy said. Among the report's findings: -- GSP duty waivers help U.S. manufacturers and their suppliers remain competitive. Three-quarters of the $27 billion in goods imported under the program in 2005 were raw materials, parts and components, or machinery and equipment used by U.S. companies to manufacture goods in the United States for domestic consumption or for export. -- Finished consumer goods sold by U.S. retailers accounted for 25 percent of GSP imports in 2005. Relatively inexpensive jewelry was the most significant item. -- GSP is particularly important to U.S. small businesses, many of whom rely on the program's duty savings to compete with much larger companies.
