  By  Kim Dixon CHICAGO  Nov 1 (Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp.
( CI.N ) on Wednesday posted a 15 percent rise in third-quarter
earnings, and forecast 2007 profit within Wall Street
expectations on strong pricing and stable medical costs,
sending
 its shares up as much as 8 percent.  Strength in Cigna's health-care business and cost cuts
fueled results. Cigna, which sells insurance to about 9.3
million Americans, is one of the last major health insurers to
post strong earnings the quarter.  In addition to providing its first 2007 forecast, the
company hiked its full-year 2006 view, implying that the fourth
quarter will be strong.  "Certainly it was an impressive quarter," David Heupel, a
portfolio manager of Thrivent Financial's Large Cap Growth
Fund, which holds about 50,000 shares of Cigna. "These guys for
the last (several) years have bled (market) share. They are
finally stopping the bleeding."  Cigna, which competes with Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ) and
UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ), is seeking to stabilize its
business after struggling in recent years with losing members
due to service issues and pricing its premiums incorrectly. It
expects 2007 membership growth of 4 to 6 percent.  Net income at the Philadelphia-based company increased to
$298 million, or $2.75 per share, from $259 million, or $2 per
share, a year earlier.  Excluding 31 cents in investment gains and a 4-cent loss
for discontinued operations, earnings were $2.48 per share,
ahead of the average forecast of $2.17 from analysts polled by
Reuters Estimates.  TAKING BACK SHARE  Company officials on a conference call said Cigna is taking
market share from competitors, which it declined to name. It
also said it expects further improvements in medical cost
controls.  At least one analyst said the forecast may be too bullish.  "Recent trends at Cigna have not been dramatic enough for
us to feel comfortable with such a change in fundamentals,"
Merrill Lynch analyst Doug Simpson said in an investor note.  Citing strong pricing of its medical plans to employers,
Cigna said it expects to earn $9.50 to $10.10 per share in
2007, excluding items and investment results.  Analysts polled by Reuters' Estimates forecast $9.69 per
share for 2007, excluding one-time items.  Cigna said it expects operating earnings of $1 billion to
$1.06 billion in 2007.  The company forecast membership growth of 4 percent to 6
percent in 2007, with 3 percent of that growth occurring as of
Jan. 1, 2007.  Quarterly revenue rose 2.9 percent to $4.13 billion,
slightly ahead of estimates. Membership rose 2.8 percent to 9.3
million. The increase included 166,000 members from Cigna's
acquisition of Star HRG, a provider of low-cost health plans to
part-time and hourly workers for whom benefits are voluntary.  Cigna also said it had repurchased 8.4 million shares in
the third quarter.  The company forecast full-year 2006 adjusted earnings per
share of $8.85 to $9.15, excluding future stock repurchases.
The company previously forecast $8.30 to $8.80 per share, and
Analysts expected $8.79.  Cigna shares were up $4.28 at $121.26 on the New York Stock
Exchange, after touching $125.84 earlier in the session.
