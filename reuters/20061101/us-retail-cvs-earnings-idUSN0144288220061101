 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain, on Wednesday posted a 12.5 percent rise in quarterly profit, driven by strong prescription drugs sales, just hours after it agreed to buy pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N in a $20.7 billion stock deal. 

 Third-quarter profit was $284.2 million, or 33 cents per share, up from $252.7 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had, on average, expected the company to earn 32 cents per share. In October, CVS forecast a profit of 31 cents to 33 cents per share, citing strong business trends. CVS estimated that its acquisition of 701 Sav-on and Osco drugstores, which closed in June, hit earnings by about 5 cents per share. CVS, which typically reports its results in the morning and gives its financial forecast during a conference call later the same day, issued the results a day earlier than planned on the heels of the Caremark acquisition announcement. CVS said it would still host a call on Thursday, as previously scheduled, but that it would be a prerecorded call. In the past, the call has been live and analysts and investors were able to ask questions. As the company previously reported, quarterly sales jumped 24.9 percent to $11.2 billion, with sales at stores open more than one year up 9.1 percent. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 10.2 percent and same-store sales of general, or front-end, merchandise rose 6.4 percent. Total pharmacy sales represented 70.3 percent of CVS' total sales in the quarter. The sales continued to climb despite worries about how the new $4 generic drug plan from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) would impact the drugstore industry. Wal-Mart's $4 generic drug strategy debuted in Florida in September and expanded to more states in October. Neither CVS nor rival Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) has matched Wal-Mart's strategy, instead relying on convenient locations and businesses such as in-store medical clinics to satisfy customers' demands. Woonsocket, Rhode Island-based CVS currently ranks behind Walgreen in terms of revenue, but has more stores. As of September 30, CVS had 6,157 stores, while Walgreen had 5,475 stores. Shares of both drugstore chains fell sharply in the days after the Wal-Mart plan was announced, and were lower on Wednesday after CVS said it would buy Caremark. Shares of CVS ended the day down $2.35, or 7.5 percent, at $29.03, while Walgreen shares fell $1.57, or 3.6 percent, to $42.11. Shares of Caremark also slipped, down 2.15 percent to $48.17.
