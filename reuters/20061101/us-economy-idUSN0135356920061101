 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. manufacturing growth edged closer to stagnation in October as a housing-led economic slowdown hurt demand across a wide variety of sectors, according to reports on Wednesday. 

 Weak construction spending and pending home sales data suggested the housing market's misfortunes were far from over, and its effects were being felt in other areas of the economy. Softer-than-expected car sales for October also indicated a recent pullback in consumption had yet to abate. "The broader economy is now slowing, and slowing sharply," said Richard Iley, senior economist at BNP Paribas. The Institute for Supply Management's factory index slipped to 51.2 last month from 52.9 in September, below Wall Street forecasts and its lowest level since June 2003. The measure was close to the break-even reading of 50 that separates growth from contraction. Norbert Ore, the head of the ISM Business Survey Committee, said he would not be surprised to see the ISM figure dip into recessionary territory. The shakiness in manufacturing comes at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing considerable headwinds. Growth in gross domestic product slowed in the third quarter to a paltry annual rate of 1.6 percent, its slowest growth rate since the first quarter of 2003. U.S. stocks fell on fears of an economic downturn, while safe-haven government debt prices climbed on expectations that such softness could lead to interest-rate cuts next year. "There is more weakness out there than the average investor realizes," said Robert MacIntosh, chief economist at Eaton Vance Management. The housing sector was leading the way. U.S. construction spending fell 0.3 percent in September led by a sixth straight monthly drop in private residential building. In a separate report, a real estate group said pending sales of existing homes dropped 1.1 percent in September. News from the auto industry was also not too encouraging. U.S. domestic cars and light trucks were sold at an annual rate of 12.3 million units for October, short of estimates for 12.7 million. Many economists and Fed officials had predicted a pick-up in business investment would make up for a housing-related drop in consumer spending. But the data indicate they may have been overly optimistic.
