 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Security services provider Brink's Co. ( BCO.N ) on Wednesday posted stronger earnings from continuing operations, citing lower expenses related to discontinued operations. 

 The company reported earnings from continuing operations of 53 cents a share compared with 41 cents last year. This year's quarter included 3 cents per share in restructuring charges. The Richmond, Virginia-based company said revenue from continuing operations rose 11 percent to $720.6 million, beating the $707.85 million forecast by Reuters Estimates. Including its Bax Global operations, which were sold in January, Brink's said net income fell to $26.5 million, or 56 cents a share, from $65.8 million, or $1.15 a year earlier. Unsatisfactory performance in the United Kingdom, Germany and elsewhere in Europe constrained profits on the continent despite some progress, Chief Executive Michael Dan said during a conference call. He expects improvement in Europe, however. Third-quarter revenue from European operations was $271.2 million, up 10 percent from a year ago. "Management has made some missteps and miscues in the last couple of years <in Europe>," Dan said. "We should not have had as much volatility as we've had in the past few years. I'm a little embarrassed by it." Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. analyst Brian Butler said Brink's "will need a return of some price leverage in Europe." "Europe remains the issue," he wrote in a research note. Brink's Inc., the company's secure transportation and cash management unit, is on track to achieve an annual operating margin of about 7 percent or better this year with annual percentage revenue growth in the high single-digits, Dan said. While third-quarter results at the Brink's Home Security business also improved, the pace of installations continued to be slower than expected, he said. The company still expects full-year revenue, profit and subscriber growth to be about 10 percent. Brink's shares were up 47 cents at $52.96 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
