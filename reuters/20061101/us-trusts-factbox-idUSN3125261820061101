 (Reuters) - Here are five facts about Canadian income trusts from the Canadian Association of Income Funds. The rusts will be subject to new taxation rules from the 2007 tax year. 

 - More than 220 income funds are now listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and TSX Venture Exchange, with a total market capitalization of about C$200 billion ($180 billion). - Trusts operate in a huge variety of industrial sectors, including energy, utilities, retailing, fast food, real estate, and communications, among others. - Trusts have a structure that encourages a large portion of revenues to flow directly to investors in the form of regular distributions, avoiding most corporate taxes. Investors can defer the income taxes they pay by holding the units of trusts in registered retirement plans. - More than one million Canadians own units in income funds and several million more invest in income trusts through their mutual funds. - Large institutional investors, such as the Canada Pension Plan and Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, invest in income trusts on behalf of their clients.
