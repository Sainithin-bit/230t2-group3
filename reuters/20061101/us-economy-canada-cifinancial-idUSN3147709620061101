 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Policy changes aimed at leveling the tax playing field between corporations and income trusts are "beyond absurd," the chief executive of one of the country's largest trusts said late on Tuesday. 

 "This is the most bizarre, Third-World policy that I could imagine," Bill Holland, CEO of mutual-fund giant CI Financial Income Fund CIX_u.TO told Reuters in an interview. "It doesn't even make sense to me -- how can they keep changing the rules?"
