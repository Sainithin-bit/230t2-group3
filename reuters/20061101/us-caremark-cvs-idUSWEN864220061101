 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) and pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N on Wednesday said they were discussing a merger that analysts said would help the drugstore chain expand its prescription benefits and mail-delivery business. 

 The talks come at a time when the traditional pharmacy model is under pressure from intense competition, including from mail operations. But CVS shares fell more than 8 percent. Shares of Caremark, whose stock-option practices are under federal scrutiny, were up 2.5 percent after climbing as much as 8.5 percent. In a joint statement, Caremark and CVS, the No. 2 U.S. drug store chain, said they were discussing a possible "merger of equals" and would not comment further. Mail-delivery prescriptions have steadily eroded the business of retail pharmacies, taking away their customers who buy medicines and also shop for other items. Retail pharmacies have built their own mail-order operations to keep pace with the pharmacy benefit managers. Further adding to pressure on retailers, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said in September it would start selling some generic drugs for just $4. "The growth of the mail channel has been a concern to the retail pharmacies for several years," SG Cowen analyst Kemp Dolliver said. "That's the biggest thing: Mail not only takes business away from the back end of the retail pharmacy but essentially reduces the traffic." The New York Times reported earlier on Wednesday that CVS was in advanced talks to buy Caremark for more than $21 billion. Caremark's market capitalization was about $21.5 billion while CVS is valued at $26.7 billion, based on Tuesday's closing stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange. One arbitrage trader said he did not expect CVS to pay a large premium to Caremark's stock price because the companies' market capitalizations are so close and they are calling it a merger, rather than a takeover. "Any time the companies use the phrase 'merger of equals' you can expect that there won't be a significant premium," said Peter Lobravico, vice president of risk arbitrage trading and sales. Caremark shares were up $1.21, or 2.5 percent, at $50.44 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade after rising as high as $53.40. CVS dropped $2.57, or 8.2 percent, to $28.81. Premiums in a takeover are typically closer to 20 percent of the company's stock price and often higher. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AT RETAIL Caremark and other pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug benefits for employers and major health plans, brokering deals in part by buying the medicines in bulk from manufacturers. They also have large pharmacies that deliver prescriptions through the mail. "We believe such a transaction would fit well with CVS's long-term strategy to increase the size and offerings of its pharmacy benefits management business, eliminate a major competitor for its retail drug business and potentially result in scale and distribution efficiencies," Standard & Poor's analyst Joe Agnese said in a research note. CVS and market leader Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) have said that Wal-Mart's plan to offer some $4 generic drugs posed little threat to them as most of their customers are insured and shop based on convenience, not price. But one analyst said the competitive pressures were mounting. "It doesn't surprise me that retail pharmacies ... are under pressure and would want to consolidate or try to build out mail operations," said John Farrall of National City Private Client Group. Farrall said buying Caremark would also help boost CVS's offerings under the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. The retailer already owns PharmaCare Management Services, a pharmacy benefit management, mail order and specialty pharmacy business. Caremark, which was spun off from Baxter International Inc. ( BAX.N ) in 1992, bought rival AdvancePCS for about $6.7 billion in 2004. Farrall said it ranked second behind rival benefit manager Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N in terms of number of prescriptions managed. In May, Caremark said the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York subpoenaed its records on stock-option grants. The Nashville, Tennessee-based company also received a letter of informal inquiry from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. CVS has grown rapidly through acquisitions. In 2004, it acquired about 1,260 Eckerd drug stores and Eckerd's mail-order and pharmacy business, from J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ). The Woonsocket, Rhode Island, company bought about 700 Sav-On and Osco drugstores from Albertsons Inc. in June and MinuteClinic, the biggest U.S. operator of retail-based health clinics, in September. Both CVS and Caremark plan to report quarterly earnings on Thursday. News of their merger talks follows a spate of health-care industry deals, including the management buyout of hospital operator HCA Inc. ( HCA.N ) Among drugstore deals, Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ) plans to buy about 1,858 U.S. Brooks and Eckerd drugstores from Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ) for $2.6 billion. Medco bought specialty pharmacy Accredo Health for $2.3 billion. (Additional reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  in New York and  Jessica Wohl  in Chicago)
