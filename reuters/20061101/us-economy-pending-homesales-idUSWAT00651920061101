 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Pending sales of existing U.S. homes fell 1.1 percent in September but demand was expected to hold steady in the coming months, a realtors trade association said on Wednesday. 

 The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in September, fell to 109.1 from 110.3 in August, although it was higher than a median forecast of 108.1 seen in a Reuters poll of economists. The August index was revised upward from a previous reading of 110.1. September's index was also 13.6 percent lower than in September 2005. "The present level of home sales is relatively high in historic terms, and we can expect generally minor movements around this level," said NAR's chief economist David Lereah in a statement. "We don't expect to see any changes of note until early next year when we're likely to see a modest lift to home sales," he said.
