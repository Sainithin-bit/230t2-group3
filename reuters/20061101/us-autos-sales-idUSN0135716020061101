 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales bounced back in October from depressed year-earlier levels as U.S. and Japanese rivals took market share away from DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, which is struggling to unload costly inventory. 

 General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) posted a 22 percent gain in October sales, while Ford Motor Co.'s ( F.N ) sales were up 13 percent after adjusting for the additional selling day a year earlier. Both results were largely in line with expectations, but were stronger than the roughly 6 percent rise in industry-wide sales, halting for now a slide in share by the top two U.S. automakers. They were helped by better light truck sales, which also helped Japanese automakers' results. Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) recorded an almost 14 percent sales rise. Sales for Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) were up almost 4 percent, while Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) gained 8 percent. DaimlerChrysler's Chrysler Group trailed its U.S. counterparts badly with a sales gain of less than 1 percent in October, despite offering the industry-leading cash rebates and concessional financing. Chrysler said it would extend zero-percent financing for up to 60 months on 2006 models in November, continuing incentive offers that chipped away at inventories last month. Global Insight analyst George Magliano called the Chrysler sales result "disappointing," saying, "Chrysler has been spending a lot on incentives ... (and) we didn't see much in the way of sales." Lower gasoline prices drove a rebound in sales of some trucks and SUVs -- pricey vehicles that were shunned by American car buyers earlier this year and which remain a mainstay of revenue for Detroit. "Toyota is basically continuing the momentum of their growth," said Edmunds.com sales analyst Jesse Toprak, who said the Japanese automaker was on track to become the No. 2 U.S. automaker by the middle of 2007. Sales results for all the automakers benefited from comparison with October last year, which marked a seven-year low for U.S. vehicle sales after a summer of blowout discounts. INVENTORIES, CHRYSLER IN FOCUS The traditional Big Three -- GM, Ford and Chrysler -- have been under pressure to manage inventories from their dealers, who have slowed orders on new models in some cases because of the higher cost of financing unsold vehicles. The problem of unsold 2006 models has been particularly pressing for Chrysler, which ended September with the highest inventory in the industry relative to its sales. Chrysler also said last month it was keeping a previously undisclosed "sales bank" of some 50,000 unassigned cars not counted in its inventory numbers. The company declined to comment on how many vehicles were in that sales bank as of end October, but said its goal was to eliminate it by year-end. "We have got a very good plan with our dealers to get there," Steven Landry, Chrysler's vice president for sales said, adding the company's auditors had reviewed its treatment of unassigned inventory and were "OK with it." Chrysler's inventory of dealer stock declined slightly in October, falling to almost 509,000 units from 533,000 a month earlier, or 80 days of sales compared with 82 days in September. Unsold trucks represented 82 percent of that dealer inventory. Ford said discounts on its 2006 models, combined with its own steep production cuts, drove down its inventory in October, particularly for trucks and for SUVs such as the Explorer and Expedition. Inventory for Ford's mass-market brands -- Ford, Lincoln and Mercury -- dropped by 30,000 units in October from September to reach 622,000 units. Of that total, 69 percent were trucks and 76 percent were 2007 models, the company said. "Obviously, it's been painful these last few months -- in the second quarter and third quarter -- to see such a reduction in SUV sales. But I do think we have our inventories more aligned with demand and that's a positive thing as we head into 2007," said Ford sales analyst George Pipas. GM, which remains the No. 1 automaker by volume, said its own inventory was near 1 million units, including about 125,000 large SUVs and 250,000 pickup trucks. GM sales analyst Paul Ballew said unsold stock was too high for the large SUV category and said production would be cut accordingly. The segment has been a strength for GM this year, based on the launch of new models such as the Yukon. Ballew, like other industry executives, said the climate had improved for sales of trucks and SUVs, which represent about 65 percent of sales volume for the Detroit car makers. "The real pressure point we saw in April, May has eased," he said. "We have at least taken the real intense pressure off on those categories that we saw when the gas price was around $3 a gallon."
