 (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Tuesday the government will begin taxing income trusts and will cut corporate taxes to level the playing field between trusts and corporations. 

 Following is a chronology of some key dates in the rise of the income trust sector and various attempts by the government to rein in its growth. 1986 - Enerplus Resources Fund completes C$9 million ($8 million) IPO and starts operating as Canada's first oil and gas royalty trust. 1996 - Mark Resources, a C$500 million energy company, converts to the EnerMark Income fund, representing by far the largest trust conversion to that point. 2002 - By end of year, the trust market has ballooned to C$55.6 billion, nearly doubling from year 2000. 2004 - Income trust market estimated at C$83.5 billion. March 24, 2004 - Liberal federal budget puts tight limit on pension fund investment in trusts to 1 percent of funds' assets, but Ottawa says has no plans to limit trusts further. January 26, 2005 - Standard & Poor's says will begin including income trust on its key Canadian stock market indexes, opening the door to larger investment flows. Sector estimated at C$118 billion. September 8 - Finance Department says Canada lost about C$300 million in tax revenues to due rapid growth of sector. September 19 - Finance Minister Ralph Goodale freezes advance tax rulings on income trusts, essentially putting new conversions on hold. He later says concerns over the loss of tax revenues was one reason behind the decision. Investors sell trust shares heavily, worrying that taxes on trusts may be introduced. November 23 - Goodale cuts corporate dividend taxes in order to level playing field somewhat between trusts and dividend-paying stocks. He also lifts moratorium on advanced tax rulings, but says won't tax trusts directly. Markets rally. November 27 - Opposition parties call for police and regulatory investigation into allegation of suspicious trades in the hours ahead of Goodale's dividend tax cut announcement. December 28 - Royal Canadian Mounted Police launch criminal probe into whether income trust tax policy details were improperly leaked to financial community. The investigation is revealed in the midst of a federal election campaign. January 23, 2006 - Stephen Harper's Conservatives defeat the Liberals to form minority government, with many citing the RCMP's income trust investigation as a key reason for the Liberal's late slide in popularity. February 20 - Yellow Pages Group CEO Marc Tellier calls for standard set up rules governing trusts to avoid a repeat of previous fall's debacle. September 11 - Telus Corp. ( T.TO ), Canada's No. 2 phone company, says plans to convert into income trust. October 11 - BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ), the country's biggest communications firm, says will scrap its holding company structure and convert its core Bell Canada unit into a trust that will eclipse Telus as country's largest. October 12 - Prime Minister Harper says is monitoring trust market "very carefully" after BCE conversion announcement. October 31 - Finance Minister Flaherty says will begin taxing trusts, and concurrently announces corporate tax cut. Toronto Stock Exchange says the sector has grown to C$210 billion by the end of August. ($1=$1.12 Canadian)
