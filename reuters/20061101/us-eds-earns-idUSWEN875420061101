 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N on Wednesday reported higher quarterly profit after it stopped loses on a contract with the U.S. military that had put a drag on results in the year-earlier period. 

 EDS, the world's No. 2 technology services provider after IBM ( IBM.N ), reported third-quarter net income of $125 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $8 million, or 2 cents a year earlier. Quarterly revenue at the Plano, Texas company founded by former U.S. presidential candidate H. Ross Perot rose to $5.29 billion from $4.87 billion. EDS has previously said that it stopped losses on a multibillion-dollar project to build a communications network linking U.S. Navy facilities on land and sea around the globe. That contract lost money during the first three quarters of last year, putting an 8 cent a share drag on earnings for that period. The company's shares trade for about 19 times the average analyst forecast for next year's earnings per share, according to Reuters Estimates. That is a premium to rivals including International Business Machines Corp., which trades at a future price-to-earnings ratio of 14, and Computer Sciences Corp. ( CSC.N ), whose forward P/E ratio is 12.
