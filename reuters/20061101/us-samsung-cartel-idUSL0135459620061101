 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ), the world's biggest maker of memory chips, said its German offices were raided as part of a European Union probe into suspected price-fixing of SRAM chips. 

 "We were raided on October 11 in connection with our SRAM products," a spokesman for Samsung Germany said on Wednesday. "We are cooperating in full with the investigation." The European Commission said on Tuesday it had raided the offices of several makers of SRAM (static random-access memory) chips in Germany, suspecting price-fixing in the sector. The Commission did not name the companies concerned. U.S. antitrust regulators launched a similar investigation earlier this month, which involved Cypress Semiconductor Corp. CY.N, Samsung, Mitsubishi Electric Corp. ( 6503.T ) and Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ). The German offices of Cypress, Mitsubishi and Sony were not immediately reachable on Wednesday, which is a public holiday in many parts of Germany. Commission probes into cartels usually take months to complete, and sometimes years. If companies are found guilty, they can be fined up to 10 percent of their revenues. SRAM chips, unlike DRAM memory chips, retain the contents of their memory as long as power remains applied, and are also faster than DRAM chips. They are used for fast memory access, for example in the central processing units of computers.
