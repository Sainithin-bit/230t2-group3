 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said on Tuesday he does not expect the proposed income trust conversions of BCE Inc ( BCE.TO ) and Telus Corp. ( T.TO ) to proceed, given tax changes announced by the government on Tuesday. 

 Flaherty said the decision to tax income trust distributions would apply to the recently announced conversions.
