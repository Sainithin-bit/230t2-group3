 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday put on hold sanctions imposed on cigarette makers by a judge who had found they violated racketeering laws in a decades-long conspiracy to hide the dangers of smoking. 

 A three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted a request by the tobacco companies to stay the ruling and remedies imposed in August by District Judge Gladys Kessler. In a 2-1 decision, the appeals court judges said the tobacco companies had "satisfied the stringent standards" required to stay the lower court judgment while it considers the industry's appeal. Kessler had ordered the companies to make "corrective" public statements about the health effects and addictiveness of smoking starting in December. Her order also imposed a ban on the companies that would have gone into effect on January 1 preventing them from describing cigarettes in ways that convey health claims such as "low tar" and "light." Philip Morris parent group Altria Group Inc. said it was "pleased" with the appeals court action. "The company believes the trial court's decision is contrary to the law and facts presented during trial, and looks forward to the opportunity to present its arguments to the appellate court," Altria Associate General Counsel William Ohlemeyer said in a statement. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment on the appeals court action. William Corr, executive director of the anti-smoking group Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, said the court's decision to grant the stay came as no surprise. "The stay itself does not suggest that the industry is going to win anything on appeal," Corr said. Cigarette makers escaped major financial penalties in the August 17 ruling by Kessler, even though she found them liable for a decades-long conspiracy to hide the dangers of smoking. Kessler said in her 1,653-page opinion that the companies suppressed research, destroyed documents and manipulated nicotine levels to perpetuate addiction, but a ruling by the same appeals court prevented her from slapping the companies with costly remedies. Targeted in the 1999 lawsuit were Altria and its Philip Morris USA unit; Loews Corp.'s Lorillard Tobacco unit, which has a tracking stock, Carolina Group; Vector Group Ltd.'s Liggett Group; Reynolds American Inc.'s R.J. Reynolds Tobacco unit and British American Tobacco Plc unit British American Tobacco Investments Ltd. Kessler had ordered each company to post on its Web site all documents it submitted to prosecutors in the case and transcripts of letters and depositions of former employees about the health impacts of cigarette smoking or research. She said the corrective statements would have to appear on Web sites, in full-page advertisements in major newspapers, on three major television networks, and on cigarette packaging. She also had ruled that the tobacco companies would have to pay for the government's court costs.
