 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc. MAT.N said on Wednesday that its Barbie business will partner with cosmetics company MAC (Make-up Art Cosmetics) for an "adult-targeted project" that will be unveiled in the spring of 2007. 

 The toy company declined to give more details on the partnership. Mattel does not currently sell Barbie cosmetics in the United States, although it does sell Barbie children's cosmetics in markets such as Europe, Latin Americas and Asia. It said the collaboration is the first time that Barbie has partnered with "an adult prestige cosmetics company." Mattel, the No. 1 U.S. toy maker, has been working to revive sales of its Barbie business amid difficult market conditions and stiff competition from MGA Entertainment's Bratz fashion dolls. It has introduced new Barbie dolls, like its 12 Dancing Princesses line, and is trying to expand Barbie's reach beyond toys. Last year, Mattel extended Barbie's U.S. domain with Barbie Luxe, a line of high-end designer clothing and accessories for adult women. It has a similar line in Japan, where it has Barbie boutiques.
