 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Clorox Co. ( CLX.N ), known for its namesake bleach, posted a 2.8 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, on higher prices, but warned its annual profit should come in at the lower end of its forecast due to costs for its information technology restructuring. 

 The company, which already increased prices on bleach, Tilex cleaners, Glad trash bags and other products this year to help offset higher commodity costs, said it would also raise prices on Kingsford charcoal in January. Shares of Clorox were down slightly in morning trading after falling nearly 1.3 percent. "The quality of the quarter was very strong, which should help the stock mostly offset the surprising reduction in guidance," JP Morgan analyst John Faucher wrote in a research note. He has a "neutral" rating on Clorox. Clorox earned $112 million, or 73 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter ended September 30, compared with $109 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier. Oakland, California-based Clorox had projected earnings of 67 cents to 73 cents per share and analysts had expected it to earn 71 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company, whose other products include Hidden Valley Ranch salad dressing and Brita water filters, said sales rose 5 percent to $1.16 billion, driven by the price increases. Volume, which excludes price fluctuations, fell 1 percent. Clorox said that shipments of Glad trash bags fell due to competitive activity after Clorox raised U.S. prices on the bags by 15 percent, on average, in February. The price hike on Glad trash bags was one of the largest percentage increases that Clorox has instituted since feeling increased pressure for materials such as resins. Gross margin increased 70 basis points to 42.9 percent, driven by the cost cuts and price increases. CIBC analyst Joseph Altobello, who has a "sector underperformer" rating on Clorox, said the gross margin increase was the first in seven quarters, and the results topped his forecast of 42 percent. Clorox now expects fiscal year earnings to come in at the low end of its $3.20 to $3.30 per share range. Analysts had been calling for a profit of $3.25 per share. In August, Clorox said that it could take charges to restructure its IT area and might move some of that work to a third party. It now expects 8 cents to 9 cents per share in charges from that plan this year, up from a prior forecast of 5 cents to 6 cents per share. Clorox said it still expects fiscal 2007 sales to rise 3 percent to 5 percent and sales in the current second quarter to come in at the lower end of that range. The company now expects second-quarter earnings to come in at the lower end of its 48 cents to 54 cents per share range, due to increased marketing spending. Analysts had expected Clorox to earn 54 cents per share. Clorox also gave initial guidance for the third quarter, calling for 3 percent to 5 percent sales growth and earnings of 74 cents to 80 cents per share. Analysts' average forecast was 82 cents per share. Shares of Clorox, whose new chairman and chief executive, Don Knauss, has been at the helm for a month, were down 11 cents at $64.43 after slipping to $63.75 in morning trading.
