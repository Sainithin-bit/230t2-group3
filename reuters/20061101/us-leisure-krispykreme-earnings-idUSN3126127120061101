 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. ( KKD.N ) on Tuesday posted a wider loss for its fourth-quarter that ended January 29 and said in its delayed annual report that it has agreed to pay $75 million to partially settle a class action securities lawsuit and derivative action. 

 The doughnut maker said its net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 ended January 29 widened to $37.7 million, or 61 cents per share, from $36.1 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue at the company, under a criminal investigation and facing investor lawsuits, fell to $122.2 million from $161.7 million as Krispy Kreme blamed tough competition and a continued consumer shift to a healthier diet. The net loss for the year was $135.8 million, or $2.20 per share, compared with $198.3 million or $3.22 per share for fiscal 2005. Revenue for the year fell to $543.4 million from $707.8 million. The company, which went public in 2001 with a hugely successful offering, also has struggled with restatements, an SEC investigation into past accounting and a decline in doughnut sales that sent some of its franchisees into bankruptcy. Winston-Salem, North Carolina Krispy Kreme said in its regulatory filing with the SEC that it has tentatively agreed to pay $75 million to settle a securities class action lawsuit. However, derivative claims against former Chief Executive Scott Livengood were preserved and the company is in talks with him, it said. Krispy Kreme shares rose 39 cents, or nearly 4 percent, to $10.75 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company's stock has traded in a range from $4.25 to $12.11 over the past year.
