 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks look set to open flat on Wednesday as the U.S. earnings fest tapers off with media conglomerate Time Warner ( TWX.N ) and insurer Prudential ( PRU.N ) reporting and a batch of macro economic data expected. 

 Among other big companies to report on Wednesday are the world's top insurance broker, Marsh & McLennan ( MMC.N ), the maker of Botox anti-wrinkle treatment, Allergan ( AGN.N ), and health insurer Cigna Corp. ( CI.N ). On a day packed with economic data, high on investors' agenda will be the ISM manufacturing index for October, which hit its lowest since May 2005 last month. "Now that earnings season is coming to an end, positive impulses could run out. We expect an overheated market to calm down a bit now," Emil Heppel, analyst a Landesbank Berlin said. By 1005 GMT, U.S. stock futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were all indicated flat to 0.1 percent down. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  edged down 0.05 percent to 12,080.73 on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 0.01 percent at 1,377.95, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 0.12 percent to 2,366.71. "The majority of companies have exceeded or fulfilled expectations, which is why the market went up even though macro economic data points to a slowdown of the economy," said Carsten Jansing from German brokerage Consortia. Investors will also wait for U.S. automakers to post October sales figures, which economists polled by Reuters expect to have fallen compared to September. The Weekly Mortgage Market index at 1200 GMT and the quarterly refunding news conference by the U.S. Treasury will also be of interest. "Macro economic data is not that important at the moment, as earnings are still dominating the markets," Jansing said. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke speaks on "Community Development Financial Institutions" before the National Conference Opportunity Finance Network.
