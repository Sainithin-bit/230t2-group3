 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Time Warner Inc. said on Wednesday that profit grew at its cable and AOL Internet divisions, boosted by strong online advertising sales and new cable subscribers. 

 But shares of the world's largest media company fell as much as 3 percent in early trade after confusion over the presentation of its cable subscriber performance after buying the assets of bankrupt cable operator Adelphia Communications Corp. and investor concern over AOL's Web traffic after an August restructuring. Time Warner shares recovered by midday and on Wednesday were trading down 17 cents at $19.84 on the New York Stock Exchange. Time Warner's cable subscriber performance was difficult to understand as it appeared in the company's financial statement because prior quarter figures were recast to reflect the change in ownership of a joint venture previously held with Comcast Corp., said Oppenheimer & Co. analyst Tom Eagan. "The results were mixed. They were more positive than negative," Eagan said. "The cable numbers were a little complicated as they did not provide easily comparable pro forma metrics." Other analysts highlighted early signs of a turnaround at AOL, where a 46 percent rise in online advertising surpassed forecasts. "AOL was a star for a change," said Christopher Marangi of Gabelli & Co., which owned 13 million Time Warner shares as of June 30. "It appears the new strategy has taken hold." Time Warner, home to movie studio Warner Bros. and cable network CNN, said third-quarter net profit nearly tripled to $2.3 billion, or 57 cents per share, from $853 million, or 18 cents per share, a year ago. Results were boosted by a big gain from the purchase of Adelphia assets. Before special items, profit per share rose to 19 cents from 17 cents a year ago. The 2006 quarterly figure excludes 24 cents per share for cable systems swapped with Comcast as part of the Adelphia transaction and 14 cents per share for one-time gains like the sale of a stake in Time Warner Telecom. Revenue grew 7 percent to $10.9 billion. Wall Street analysts expected the company to post a profit of 20 cents per share, excluding items, on revenue of $11.05 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Expectations for an AOL turnaround and a cable sector stock rally have pushed up Time Warner's stock price by more than 21 percent in the last three months, bringing it to a four-year high on Tuesday. AOL TRAFFIC TO IMPROVE Operating performance was led by the ad sales gain at AOL. AOL announced a major overhaul in August to turn itself into an ad-supported Internet service instead of a subscription based business. The plan includes 5,000 job cuts. AOL's quarterly revenue fell 3 percent to $2 billion with the loss of 2.5 million Web subscribers. But operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) rose 21 percent to $563 million on cost cuts and the surge in ad sales. Time Warner Chief Executive Richard Parsons said the restructuring was on track to increase Web use by next year. "Not only are former AOL subscribers coming back, a host of new first-time users are signing up," he told analysts on a conference call. Parsons said he expected AOL ad sales growth would meet or improve upon industry levels in 2007. But some analysts noted that AOL's page views, a key measure of Web traffic, fell 5 percent in the quarter, and they questioned whether that trend could hurt growth. "We still think AOL has significant issues facing it and it's a key reason why we are unexcited about Time Warner stock on a valuation basis," said Pali Capital's Richard Greenfield. Time Warner Cable revenue rose 44 percent to $3.2 billion and OIBDA rose 28 percent to $1.1 billion. Including the newly acquired Adelphia cable systems, the unit added 3.2 million net new basic video subscribers. Excluding Adelphia, the cable unit added 33,000 basic video customers. Time Warner purchased Adelphia this year in a deal with Comcast for around $17 billion, securing its spot as the second-largest U.S. cable operator with strongholds in New York and Los Angeles. It filed to spin off 16 percent of its cable company in October. Time Warner's film division saw revenue drop 10 percent to $2.4 billion as last year's strong box office sales of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and "Batman Begins" surpassed box office sales of "Superman Returns" in the third quarter. Time Warner also affirmed its expectations for 2006 adjusted OIBDA to rise in a low double-digit percentage range.
