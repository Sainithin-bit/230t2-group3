 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Wednesday said its U.S. October sales rose in comparison to October 2005, when sales fell 23 percent after a summer of showroom discounts. 

 The world's largest automaker sold 301,317 vehicles in the United States last month, up 22 percent from a year earlier. GM said its retail sales rose 36 percent, driven by gains in its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks. The results are adjusted for an extra selling day in October 2005, the company said.
