 LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dissident shareholders are expected to win a bid for control of Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ( TTWO.O ) on Thursday, forcing change on the besieged maker of the blockbuster "Grand Theft Auto" video game series. 

 Shares in Take-Two were up about 0.5 percent ahead of a shareholder meeting planned for later in the day in New York, at which investors controlling 46 percent of the company plan to install their own slate of directors. The investor group includes OppenheimerFunds Inc., Take-Two's largest institutional shareholder, D. E. Shaw Valence Portfolios and S.A.C. Capital Management. If successful, the group plans to tap Strauss Zelnick, a former CEO of BMG Entertainment to be nonexecutive chairman. He would then boot out Chief Executive Paul Eibeler and consider replacing Chief Financial Officer Karl Winters. Analysts said that finding an effective leader for the controversial video game maker may prove difficult. "I think the odds of finding the right person who can manage and keep everyone happy and cut all the waste and bad games is 20 percent," said Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter. "Whoever that person is, they're making a lot of money doing something else," he said. Investors have long lobbied for new management at the company, which has depended on "Grand Theft Auto" to drive revenue while failing to turn out new hits. Compounding that, the company has weathered back-to-back scandals prompted by accounting issues, undisclosed sexual content in "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" and improper stock options grants. Take-Two shares were up 11 cents to $20.97 after trading as high as $21.18 earlier in the session.
