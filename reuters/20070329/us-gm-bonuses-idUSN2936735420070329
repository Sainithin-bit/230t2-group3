 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), which significantly improved its financial performance in 2006 but did not make a profit, will not pay cash bonuses to top executives for the second consecutive year, the New York Times reported. 

 GM spokeswoman Renee Rashid-Merem told the Times that the decision affected about 20 people, including Chief Executive Rick Wagoner and Vice-Chairman Robert A. Lutz. Full details on executives' compensation will be released next month when the company files its annual proxy statement, the Times said.
