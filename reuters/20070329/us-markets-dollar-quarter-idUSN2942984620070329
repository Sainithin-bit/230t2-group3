 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - As the first quarter of 2007 draws to a close, the U.S. dollar's demise, predicted for most of 2006, appears to be greatly exaggerated. 

 After a bounce this quarter from 20 month lows seen at the end of 2006, the dollar is only marginally lower than three months ago. Slow but resilient U.S. economic growth, helped by a mild northern hemisphere winter, in the absence of an expected Federal Reserve interest rate cut during the quarter, helped spur a rally in the greenback mostly in January. Concerns about falling U.S. house prices and defaults in the subprime mortgage sector contributed to some U.S. dollar weakness in February and March, but few analysts are calling for the dollar to be shorted aggressively in the months ahead. "A lot of people, myself included, were caught by surprise by the dollar's strength at the start of the quarter," said Chris Melendez, president of Tempest Asset Management, a currency hedge fund, in Newport Beach, California. "Much of its resilience came from some good economic reports and from the fact that rate cut expectations kept being pushed further away." Melendez said that despite of his long-standing bearish view on the dollar, he considered reversing his call to short the dollar after it rallied to $1.2866 against the euro on January 12. And he is now prepared to do it again if the dollar rebounds to $1.3080 per euro. On the downside, Melendez doesn't expect the dollar to weaken below $1.35 per euro. As of March 29, the dollar was about 1.0 percent lower versus the euro in the quarter, with the European currency trading at around $1.3330  EUR= . Against the yen, the dollar slid 1 percent in the same period to trade at 117.87 yen  JPY= . It weakened about 0.1 percent against the Swiss franc  CHF=  and 0.5 percent versus Canadian dollar  CAD= . And it was 0.15 percent lower versus sterling  GBP= . "That's far from a big plunge," said Daniel Katzive, a currency strategist for UBS AG, in Stamford, Connecticut. "Coming into the year, most people were betting on a more aggressive Fed and on a bigger fallout in the housing markets that didn't happen." "AMBIVALENT" FED Back in December, UBS analysts had a 3-month forecast for euro/dollar at $1.33, in line with the pairs' present level. At the start of that month, U.S. short-term interest rate futures priced chances of a Federal Reserve cut by March above 50 percent. Futures now price about a 30 percent chance for the Fed to cut rates from the present 5.25 percent by the end of June. "At a certain point during the quarter our forecast didn't look sustainable," said Katzive, who is maintaining the same $1.33 target for euro/dollar for the next thee months. "Looking forward, the dollar is probably going to keep struggling in particular against the euro," he said. "But because it's getting more difficult to predict what the Fed is going to do, I expect to see it trading on the sidelines for quite some time." If anything, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's Congressional testimony on Wednesday made the outlook for the U.S. dollar even murkier. Bernanke told the Joint Economic Committee the U.S. central bank has not moved away from its bias toward battling inflation, but warned that risks to the economy's health have also risen.

"I'm not surprised with that dollar's reaction," said Omer Esiner, a market analyst at Ruesch International in Washington, D.C. "The Fed's has become increasingly more ambivalent, and in the end, it is supporting both dollar bears and dollar bulls." To be sure, net short positioning on the U.S. dollar, a gauge of traders' willingness to go long or short in the currency, also mirrors some of the quarters' thug of war between dollar bulls and bears. Net short speculative dollar positioning stood at $14 billion in the week ended March 20, down from December's high of about $24 billion, but a reversal from a long positioning of about $5 billion in late January, according to Chicago Mercantil Exchange IMM data compiled by Citigroup. "It has been a very volatile quarter," said Todd Elmer, a currency analyst at Citigroup. "The market has been rebuilding its dollar shorts after going long in January. But still less aggressively than in December." EURO "QUARTER" But not everybody is convinced about the dollar's resilience. Axel Merk, the manager of the Merk Hard Currency Fund, says a bet against the dollar is still sound, and that investors should pay more attention to the strength in the euro than the weakness on the dollar in coming months. "The euro will keep beating the dollar," said Merk, who is long the European currency in his portfolios. "The trend is only going to accelerate because structural economic differences will become more apparent as the year progresses." Merk added that Samarjit Shankar, global foreign exchange strategist with Mellon Bank in Boston echoes some of Merk's views. "The euro is going to become a greater part of the equation," he said. "The ECB is still in tightening mode, while the Fed may start easing. And when it comes to currencies, it all boils down to rate differentials. That simple."
