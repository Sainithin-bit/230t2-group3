 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discount retailer Family Dollar Stores Inc. ( FDO.N ) posted higher quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by a 12 percent rise in sales, and year-ago results that were hurt by a charge. 

 The retailer, which prices most of its merchandise below $10, also forecast full-year earnings that could surpass current Wall Street expectations and said it would resume its stock buyback program. The company's shares rose 92 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $29.24 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Family Dollar, which is trying to improve sales by resetting merchandise displays in its stores and adding more food items, said fiscal second-quarter profit rose to $90.5 million, or 60 cents per share, from $54.5 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 58 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The latest quarter was a 14-week period that ended March 3, while last year's results were for a 13-week period ended February 25, 2006. Earlier this month the company said second-quarter earnings would be at or near the low end of its forecast of 58 to 64 cents a share because it would record about $12 million in legal and accounting expenses related to a stock option review. While it said the extra week added 5 cents per share to the quarter, the gain was offset by the $12 million in unplanned expenses, which hurt results by 5 cents per share. Year-ago results included a litigation charge of about 18 cents per share. BOOSTING SALES Family Dollar, in hopes of luring shoppers into its stores on a more frequent basis, is in the process of installing coolers so it can sell perishable items like milk and eggs. It is also stocking more quick-preparation and ready-to-eat products. While the strategy has disrupted shopping in the short term, it expects the changes will boost sales in the long run. Family Dollar, which has more than 6,300 stores, said today roughly 4,400 stores already have coolers and about 5,000 stores will have them by the end of the current fiscal year. Family Dollar is also trying to increase sales by filling its stores with more higher-margin, unexpected "treasure hunt" items, like prepaid cellular phone plans, that can offset increased sales of lower-margin products, like food. "Family Dollar is making steady, and rapid, progress evolving into a better-run business," wrote Oppenheimer retail analyst Bernard Sosnick in a note to clients. Second-quarter sales rose to $1.95 billion from $1.74 billion a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year -- a key retail gauge known as comparable-store sales -- rose 0.4 percent. An increase in the average customer transaction amount offset a decline in customer traffic, the company said. SLOWING STORE OPENINGS On a conference call, company executives said Family Dollar expects capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending September 1 to be about $155 million to $165 million. It said that is down about $35 million from its initial estimate as it cuts the number of stores it expects to open. "Several years ago we made a strategic course correction that shifted greater emphasis on driving financial returns. As a part of this shift, we slowed new store growth, and last year opened 350 stores," said Interim Chief Financial Officer James Kelly. "Initially we planned to gradually ramp up new store openings this year, but now believe we will open around 300 stores." It said comparable-store sales should accelerate modestly during the remainder of the fiscal year. It forecast full-year earnings of $1.63 per share to $1.69 per share. Analysts are expecting earnings of $1.63 per share. For its fiscal third-quarter, it forecast earnings of 39 to 43 cents per share, while analysts are expecting 41 cents. It also forecast March comparable-store sales rising 3 percent to 5 percent.
