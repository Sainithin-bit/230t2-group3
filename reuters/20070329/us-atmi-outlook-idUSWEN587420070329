 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ATMI Inc. ( ATMI.O ), which provides specialty materials to the semiconductor industry, on Thursday cut its first-quarter financial outlook, citing problems in its packaging business and operating costs it was taking earlier than it had planned. 

 The company lowered its earnings estimate to a range of 17 to 21 cents range from 28 to 32 cents, and shaved its revenue estimate to between $80 million and $84 million from $84 million to $88 million.
