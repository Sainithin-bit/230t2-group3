 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A.G. Edwards Inc. AGE.N, which operates one of the largest independent U.S. brokerages, posted a 45 percent increase in fourth-quarter profit on rising investment banking and asset management fees. 

 Profit easily topped analysts' estimates. A.G. Edwards shares rose as much as 5.5 percent to a record. Net income for the St. Louis-based company in the three months ended February 28 rose to $109.2 million, or $1.44 per share, from $75.4 million, or 99 cents, a year earlier. Excluding gains from investments in securities and commodities exchanges, profit was $1.36 per share, 30 cents above the average analyst estimate according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 17 percent to $865 million, topping the average $786.8 million forecast, while expenses rose just 11 percent. "The investment banking environment remains healthy, and underwriting is likely to remain an area of strength," wrote William Tanona, a Goldman Sachs & Co. analyst who rates A.G. Edwards "neutral." Investment banking revenue surged 126 percent to $112.5 million, including increases of 93 percent in underwriting and 217 percent in management and advisory fees. Fees from asset management and services rose 18 percent to $335.7 million. Commissions fell 1 percent to $270.3 million, hurt by lower trading activity in equities. Client assets rose 9 percent to $374 billion, despite a decline in the number of brokers to 6,618 from 6,824. "The lower absolute level of commissions and declining number of advisors is troubling and is likely to create challenging (year-over-year) comparisons once the one-time gains slow," Tanona wrote. A.G. Edwards shares were up $2.12, or 3.2 percent, at $68.54 in late morning trading, after earlier rising to $70.10. Through Wednesday, they were up 5 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent drop in the Amex Securities Broker Dealer Index .XBD. (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb )
