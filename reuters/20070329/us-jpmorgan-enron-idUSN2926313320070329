 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit by JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) investors who accused the third-largest U.S. bank of helping Enron Corp. hide fraud. 

 The plaintiffs had alleged they bought JPMorgan stock based on the New York bank's reputation for integrity and financial discipline, when in fact the company was helping Enron, a major client, hide billions of dollars of debt. In a 26-page ruling released on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein said the plaintiffs failed to show that JPMorgan deceived or intended to deceive them by downplaying its exposure to Enron, or overstating its own integrity. Stein dismissed the five-year-old case with prejudice, meaning the plaintiffs cannot raise their claims again. He had dismissed an earlier complaint in March 2005, but allowed the plaintiffs to refile their case. "This version of the complaint ... suffers from the same flaws as the first," the judge wrote. "If plaintiffs' allegations are borne out, it would be not they but the shareholders of Enron -- the real victims of the energy giant's collapse -- who would have been defrauded." Stein also rejected claims that William Harrison, JPMorgan's former chairman and chief executive, should be held liable in the case. A lawyer for the plaintiffs did not immediately return a call seeking comment. JPMorgan spokesman Adam Castellani declined to comment. JPMorgan agreed in June 2005 to pay $2.2 billion to settle its part of a class-action lawsuit brought on behalf of former Enron investors against the energy trader's former banks. Total payouts in that case topped $7 billion, including about $2.4 billion by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CM.TO ) and $2 billion by Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) In the JPMorgan class-action case, the plaintiffs had argued that the bank defrauded them from November 1999, when the shares traded as high as $58.25, to July 2002, when they were as low as $18.25. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 2, 2001. JPMorgan agreed in 2005 to pay $350 million in separate litigation brought by Enron's liquidators. JPMorgan shares closed on Thursday up 51 cents at $48.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
