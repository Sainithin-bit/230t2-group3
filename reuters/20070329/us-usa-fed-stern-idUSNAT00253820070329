 DAYTON, Ohio  (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Gary Stern said on Thursday the U.S. economic outlook is "positive" and unlikely to be derailed by the subprime mortgage crisis. 

 The United States enjoys "a flexible, resilient economy demonstrably capable of sustained economic growth even in the face of disruptions," Stern told a University of Dayton investment forum. He said the Fed must remain committed to keeping inflation low, especially as a probable slowdown in work-force growth in the years ahead raises the potential for higher wages. "I would not expect inflation to accelerate even if compensation does, as long as the Federal Reserve remains committed to a stable, low inflation policy," Stern said. Stern, the Fed's current longest-serving regional president, cited persistent gains in employment and consumer spending as positives for the economy. "The outlook would seem to be positive as, indeed, I think it is," he added. "To be sure, the housing sector has been a drag on activity and is of concern but I suspect that the bulk, although not all, of the adjustment in residential construction is behind us," he said. Answering questions from the audience, Stern said problems with subprime mortgage lending would probably not affect the overall mortgage market, let alone the broader economy. Subprime loans are extended to borrowers with poor credit. "The subprime market is just a fraction of the overall market. It is not big enough to become a major impact on a $13 trillion economy." Stern, who is not a voter on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2007, did not specifically address the interest rate outlook, and said that the Fed often gets too much credit for its influence on the economy. The FOMC last week voted to hold benchmark short-term rates at 5.25 percent for a sixth consecutive meeting. Financial markets expect steady rates from the Fed when it next meets on policy in May but are pricing a rate cut in the third quarter. While not foreseeing dark clouds on the economic horizon, Stern also said that the Fed could respond if conditions warranted without undermining its commitment to low inflation. TAKING THE LONG WAY In the wake of a string of weak data on the U.S. economy, most recently the February durable goods report on Wednesday, Stern cautioned against overinterpreting weekly and monthly data that are volatile and prone to revision. Durable goods orders, which over the past few months have prompted some economists to mark down their first-quarter economic growth estimates, are "notoriously noisy," he said. "To the extent that Federal Reserve communications leave the impression that high-frequency observations are of great value, then this is something which I think we need to address," he said. "In my experience, a considerable accumulation of evidence usually is required before it is wise to change your view," Stern said. A long-run view "reveals, I think, an economy anything but fragile." By contrast, Stern said longer-term demographic shifts could have bigger implications for growth, since in the decade ahead, monthly growth in the labor force could be in the 110,000 to 150,000 range, against 150,000 to 160,000 in recent years. "Other things equal, slow expansion of the labor force would imply slow growth of the overall economy," Stern said, adding that "there are reasons to think that productivity may fill at least some of the gap."
