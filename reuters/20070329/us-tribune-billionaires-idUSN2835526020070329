 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N has responded to a request for additional financial information from Los Angeles billionaires Eli Broad and Ronald Burkle, whose bid for the company appeared to have been dismissed, people close to the company's auction said in The New York Times. 

 The response could reopen a negotiating process that had been perceived as all but over, the Times said. Tribune had been expected to announce this week that it was selling itself to Sam Zell, the Chicago real estate mogul. Now that Tribune has reengaged with Burkle and Broad, the pair could sweeten an earlier offer and get back in the running, the Times noted.
