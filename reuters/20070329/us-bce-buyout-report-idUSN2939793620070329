 MONTREAL  (Reuters) - BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ) ( BCE.N ) said on Thursday it is not in talks with any private equity investor regarding taking the big telecommunications company private or any other similar transaction. 

 BCE, Canada's largest telecom and owner of Bell Canada, said it issued the statement at the request of TSX market regulations services. BCE's comment followed a report in the Globe and Mail newspaper on Thursday that said the company had had discussions with New York buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts regarding a possible transaction to take BCE private.
