 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth was moderately stronger in the fourth quarter than previously thought, primarily because businesses added more to inventories than was estimated a month ago, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday. 

 Gross Domestic Product or GDP, which measures total goods and services output within U.S. borders, expanded at a 2.5 percent annual rate instead of 2.2 percent, the department said in its final revision of fourth-quarter economic performance. Economists had expected the final fourth-quarter reading of GDP growth to be unrevised at 2.2 percent. The final figure was up from a 2 percent rate in the third quarter and meant the economy expanded by a solid 3.3 percent during the whole of 2006. It was the third straight year that GDP expanded at a rate over 3 percent, following growth of 3.2 percent in 2005 and 3.9 percent in 2004. The department said companies added to inventories at a $22.4-billion annual rate in the closing quarter of 2006 rather than the $17.3 billion rate it reported a month ago and said that was the main reason for the upward revision in fourth-quarter GDP. Higher inventories were mostly accounted for by larger stocks of motor vehicles. Larger inventories can reflect a backlog of unsold goods or businesses building stocks up in anticipation of better sales ahead. A prices gauge favored by the Federal Reserve -- personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy items -- advanced at a slightly slower 1.8 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter instead of the 1.9 percent estimated a month ago and was down from 2.2 percent in the third quarter. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, testifying before Congress on Wednesday, said potential inflation remains the U.S. central bank's primary policy concern. He also said that problems in the mortgage lending business were not expected to spill over and cause a widespread economic slowdown. Still, the fourth-quarter GDP report showed that investment in new-home building plummeted by 19.8 percent -- even steeper than the 19.1 percent fall estimated a month ago -- and has declined for five straight quarters. The fourth-quarter drop was the sharpest since a 21.7 percent plunge in the first quarter of 1991 when the economy was on the brink of recession. There was also a significant revision in spending on equipment and software, which dropped at a 4.8 percent annual rate during the fourth quarter -- the largest decline since 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2002 -- instead of the 3.2 percent drop reported a month ago. That was a sharp turnaround from the third quarter when equipment and software spending grew at a 7.7 percent rate. On Wednesday, the Commerce Department said orders for long-lasting durable goods rose 2.5 percent in February, only partly recovering from a 9.3 percent plunge in January. Softer orders potentially foreshadow a lingering reluctance by businesses to invest in more production machinery that, in turn, could act as a drag on overall growth in 2007. Nonresidential investment, a proxy for business spending on new equipment, declined at a revised 3.1 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter rather than the 2.4 percent decline the government estimated a month ago. That was a sharp reversal from the third quarter when investment spending jumped by 10 percent.
