 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Hitachi Ltd. ( 6501.T ), Japan's biggest electronics conglomerate, said on Thursday its parent company has shored up struggling subsidiary Hitachi America with a $1 billion injection. 

 The funds, Hitachi's largest one-time investment in the unit, were calculated into Hitachi's downward revision of its parent-only outlook earlier in March to a net loss of 200 billion yen from 55 billion yen, Hitachi spokesman Masahiro Takahashi said. The capital will be used in part to cover debt to parent Hitachi, he said. Parent Hitachi had set aside 64.8 billion yen ($553.7 million) for soured loans to its unit in September on bigger-than expected costs at Hitachi America to build a 790 megawatt coal-fired thermal power plant for MidAmerican Energy Co. MDPWN.OB in Iowa, to go online in May. Hitachi America had trouble finding workers with experience building large thermal plants in the U.S. and costs also grew to reverse delays on damage from Hurricane Katrina, Hitachi said. Ahead of the announcement, Hitachi shares rose 2.5 percent to 933 yen, outperforming the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  which rose 0.05 percent.
