 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Many on Wall Street have soured on Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ) after a series of setbacks to near-term growth prospects, making the future of the world's largest biotechnology company more dependent on its promising experimental drug for osteoporosis and cancer. 

 If approved, denosumab could catapult Amgen into a sphere dominated by big pharmaceutical companies, which sell most of the multibillion-dollar products aimed at large patient populations served by primary care doctors. Shares of the Thousand Oaks, California-based company have slid 26 percent since late January when Amgen announced disappointing clinical trial results for anemia treatment Aranesp and cancer drug Vectibix. The first pivotal-stage trial results for denosumab, in osteoporosis, are due in 2009, a company spokeswoman said, adding that interim results from a smaller Phase III trial of the drug are expected later this year. "Phase II data were terrific. This could be a terrific new drug in a huge therapeutic market," said Vincent Aita, a partner at hedge fund Kilkenny Capital Management, which owns Amgen shares. Denosumab, which is also being tested as a treatment for bone cancer, is an antibody designed to turn off the genetic switch that triggers bone-dissolving cells called osteoclasts. "Clearly the future of the company now rests on denosumab," said Geoffrey Porges, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein. He cautioned, however that the drug faces some tough hurdles, including proving in large trials that it boosts bone density, and warned that Amgen's track record for late-stage development has begun to look shaky. Phase II results show that denosumab, given twice a year by injection, increased bone density at the lumbar spine by more than 7 percent after two years, according to Amgen. The drug is seen as potentially filling a void in sales growth once projected for the company's existing products. Amgen said last week it had discontinued a trial of Vectibix, in combination with other drugs, after it was shown to reduce chances of survival for colon cancer patients, leading analysts to slash sales forecasts. Amgen's prospects have also been clouded by recent studies linking high doses of anemia drugs to an increased risk of stroke, heart attack, blood clots and even death in certain patient groups. The company's 2006 sales of anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen totaled $6.6 billion, or nearly half of total product sales. "The whole issue of Epogen-like drugs potentially helping cancer to grow has been around for several years ... I think physicians were not happy that they were aggressively pushing the usage higher," said Fariba Ghodsian, who helps manage Dafna Capital Management's $200 million biotechnology fund. Also at issue is last year's $2.2 billion purchase of Abgenix, which gave Amgen full control over Vectibix and eliminated any royalty obligations for denosumab. The deal looks more questionable amid Vectibix's diminished prospects. "This decision raises further concerns of the justification regarding the price of $2 billion paid for the Abgenix acquisition, which was done mainly to acquire Vectibix," First Global analyst Kavita Thomas said in a research note on Monday. The analyst cut her rating on the stock to "market perform" from "moderate outperform," citing the development setbacks and a weak outlook for Vectibix. Thomas described as "quite attractive," Amgen's current valuation of about 13 times estimated 2007 earnings, but downgraded the stock anyway, citing poor underlying growth for the company's older drugs, a lack of meaningful clinical milestones in the near term and a lack of new products to boost revenue and earnings before 2009. Aita said more clarity on Amgen's near-term outlook will come over the next couple of months as the company reports first-quarter financial results, faces an FDA advisory hearing on anemia drugs and releases results from a trial testing Aranesp's impact on lung cancer survival. He also cited a scheduled May decision by U.S. regulators on competitor Roche Holding AG's ( ROG.VX ) bid to launch an anemia drug. Approval of the Roche drug would add a competing treatment and potentially push Amgen shares down. "I wouldn't underestimate Amgen's ability to come back," Ghodsian said. "At the same time, they have had a string of negative events and they are very dependent on their (anemia drug) franchise."
