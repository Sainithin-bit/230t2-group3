 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares in Warner Music Group Corp. WMG.N, the fourth-largest music group, jumped nearly 8 percent on Thursday after an analyst upgraded the stock. 

 Shares rose by $1.23 to $17.13 on the New York Stock Exchange after Pali Research analyst Richard Greenfield upgraded the company to "Neutral" from a "Sell." Greenfield said shares in the company had fallen by more than 31 percent this year due to deteriorating music sales data and uncertainty surrounding a potential EMI merger and on Wednesday dropped below the $16 target price he had set for it. Sales of CDs fell by 20 percent in the first quarter, according to data from Nielsen SoundScan. Greenfield said there is still uncertainty about Warner Music's future and the music industry in general. "The key question becomes whether or not the weakness experienced in Q1 will persist throughout the entire year and if the industry improves, how much relative to Q1," he wrote in his note. Warner has had on-and-off merger discussions with London-based EMI Group EMI.L, the third-largest record company, since last year. But talks stalled after European regulators annulled the 2004 merger between Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T ). Sony Music and Bertelsmann AG's BERT.UL BMG Recorded Music to create Sony BMG Music Entertainment. Last week EU regulators froze the review, saying it lacked enough information.
