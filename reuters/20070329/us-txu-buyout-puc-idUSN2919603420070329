 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Texas regulators on Thursday proposed a six-month period to review power company sales and mergers, a move that, if enacted, would push to late in the year the closing of the $31.8 billion sale of TXU Corp. TXU.N to a group of private equity firms. 

 The three-member commission voted to publish amendments to current rules to advance the date a company must report a proposed sale of stock or transmission assets to "not later than six months" before the sale occurs. Texas' largest power company last month agreed to be bought by a group of private equity firms led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL in the largest leverage buyout ever. Publishing the proposed rules will start a period for comments and a possible public hearing. If enacted, the rule could take effect sometime in May, said a PUC spokesman. Under the current rule, an acquiring company is not required to report a sale until 30 days after a transaction closes. KKR officials told Texas legislators they plan to file the notice by April 25, well before closing, in an effort to dissuade lawmakers from giving the PUC more authority to review the deal. The Texas Senate already has passed a bill to give the PUC expanded authority to review the TXU sale. With little discussion, the commission also proposed a change to rules covering credit requirements for large retail electric providers, another way to scrutinize the TXU sale under current Texas law.
