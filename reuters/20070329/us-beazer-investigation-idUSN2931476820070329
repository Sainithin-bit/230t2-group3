 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Beazer Homes USA Inc.( BZH.N ) on Thursday said it has received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Justice Department for documents related to the company's mortgage origination business. 

 In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said the subpoena from the U.S. Attorney's Office in the Western District of North Carolina was issued upon application of the Office of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Inspector General. Beazer, the No. 6 U.S. home builder, said it has been in contact with the U.S. Attorney's Office and is cooperating with the investigation. Earlier this week, a representative at the FBI office in Charlotte said the agency was "conducting a potential fraud investigation" into Beazer, which builds houses for many first-time buyers. Atlanta-based Beazer said it has not received a request for information or documents from the FBI or Internal Revenue Service in this regard. "We believe many buyers entered into aggressive mortgages due to the stretched affordability in many markets, but we think it may be difficult to prove fraud," Bank of America Securities analyst Daniel Oppenheim wrote in a note. JP Morgan analyst Michael Rehaut said that while it was impossible to determine the outcome of such an investigation, it could ultimately focus on only a few subdivisions and result in only several millions of dollars in fines, which would not be material to the company. Still, the news comes on the heels of the departure of Chief Financial Officer Jim O'Leary, who resigned to become CEO of Kaydon Corp. KDN.N In February, the company said it fired General Counsel Kenneth Gary for a "personal pattern which includes violations of company policies." Combined, the disclosures create "red flags, which may fuel the investigative process," Rehaut said. Oppenheim said the attention may lead legislators to curb some of the riskier alternative loans such as loans with no or little documentation and ones that required scant downpayments, moves that could cut off about 15 percent of demand for new homes. Home builders with large mortgage businesses, such as Centex Corp. ( CTX.N ), and high exposure to entry-level buyers, are most at risk for spillover from allegations of aggressive lending at Beazer, Oppenheim said. Those that cater to buyers with a history of home ownership -- such as Standard Pacific Corp. ( SPF.N ), Meritage Homes Corp. ( MTH.N ) and Toll Brothers ( TOL.N ) -- or who cater to retirees and older buyers, such as Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. ( HOV.N ) and Pulte Homes Inc. ( PHM.N ), likely have less risk. Beazer earlier said that the U.S. Attorney's Office has made no allegations of wrongdoing by Beazer Homes and that the statements made by an FBI spokesperson about an investigation and the scope of the investigation were unauthorized and should not have been made. According to an article earlier this week by BusinessWeek, the probe into Beazer stems from a series of articles that appeared in the Charlotte Observer earlier this month. Those stories described questionable lending practices and high foreclosure rates among some Beazer customers.
