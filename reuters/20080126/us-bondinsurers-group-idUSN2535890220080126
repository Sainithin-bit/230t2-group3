 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A bond insurers group seeking to quell concern about the credit ratings of its members amid subprime mortgage trouble, said on Friday the industry is "strong" and does not want a taxpayer bailout. 

 The Association of Financial Guaranty Insurers, which represents firms, including industry leaders MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) and Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N, said its members are determined to preserve their good credit ratings. Fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis is causing growing concern about bond insurers' credit ratings and possible wider market repercussions should those ratings fall. Two committees of Congress are looking into the matter. After meeting with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Friday, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd told reporters he did not have a view on bond insurers. "We'll take a look at it. The committee's looking at it," said the Connecticut Democrat. The New York insurance regulator is pressing major banks to help the bond insurers, which guarantee principal and interest payments on trillions of dollars in bonds. "Our companies are absolutely intent on keeping the triple A rating, or getting it back if they lose it," Bob Mackin, executive director of the industry association, said in an interview, adding the industry is "financially strong." A representative of the association also distributed a statement that said: "The industry is not on the verge of insolvency. Nothing could be further from the truth." The statement added: "The financial guaranty industry is not seeking nor does it want any taxpayer bailout." The statement also said: "With the potential exception of ACA, all of the remaining companies will be able to pay their claims when and if they come due." ACA Capital Holdings Inc ACAH.PK said on Monday it won an extra month from customers to unwind an estimated $69 billion of subprime-related credit exposure. The company's main bond insurance unit has been taken over by regulators. ACA could not immediately be reached for comment. In addition to ACA, MBIA and Ambac, the association also represents Financial Security Assurance Holdings Ltd FSF.N, Assured Guaranty Ltd ( AGO.N ) and other firms. Representatives of Ambac and MBIA met in Washington on Thursday with staff members of Dodd's Senate Banking Committee and the House of Representatives' Financial Services Committee, said an association representative. Rep. Paul Kanjorski, chairman of the House capital markets subcommittee, said on Thursday he planned to hold a hearing next month on the issue. The Pennsylvania Democrat said the problems of bond insurers could spread. A week ago, a unit of Ambac, one of the biggest bond insurers, lost its top triple-AAA credit rating. MBIA's unit MBIA Insurance Corp faces possible ratings cuts. Some analysts have expressed concerns about the wider impact on bond markets if insurer downgrades were to spread.
