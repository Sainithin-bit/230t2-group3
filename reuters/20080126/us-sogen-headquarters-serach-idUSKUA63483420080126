 PARIS  (Reuters) - French police have searched the headquarters of Societe Generale, a SocGen spokeswoman said on Saturday, following an alleged $7 billion internal fraud case at the French bank. 

 "I confirm that it took place yesterday evening," said a Societe Generale spokeswoman. The spokeswoman declined to give further details, but a source familiar with the matter said the police had searched for the computer records of the young trader, Jerome Kerviel, who has been blamed for the fraud. Police also searched Kerviel's flat on the western outskirts of Paris on Friday night. SocGen's headquarters are in the Defense business district of Paris. Its twin tower skyscrapers are a distinctive part of the area's skyline. (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta ; editing by  Crispian Balmer )
