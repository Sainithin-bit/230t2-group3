 WASHINGTON/CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Top U.S. drug regulators on Friday defended cutting the bad type of cholesterol as a key measure of a drug's effectiveness, hoping to stem a frenzy after a study on the cholesterol-fighter Vytorin cast doubt on its usefulness. 

 U.S. health officials were responding to doctors' concerns over data released 11 days ago by Merck & Co Inc and Schering-Plough Corp on Vytorin, which -- in a joint company study -- failed to cut artery-clogging plaque better than a much cheaper generic drug known as a statin. However, Vytorin was shown to be significantly better at reducing "bad" LDL cholesterol, cutting it by 58 percent, compared with 41 percent for just Zocor, a popular statin made by Merck that is now available generically. Vytorin combines Zocor with the companies' shared drug Zetia, which fights cholesterol in a different way. Many studies of statins have shown that people who reduce their low-density lipoprotein or LDL can cut their risk of heart attacks and stroke. The evidence has been so convincing that studies showing a drug is effective at lowering LDL have been used in place of studies showing a drug actually reduces the risk of heart attacks and stroke. The Vytorin study cast a shadow on that theory because Vytorin reduced LDL levels much better than Zocor in the study. "We think it is premature to be thinking about changing the paradigm of lipid-lowering based on this study," Dr. John Jenkins, who directs the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's office of new drugs, told reporters in a telephone briefing. The 720-patient trial tested patients with a rare genetic predisposition to dangerously high cholesterol levels. Jenkins and other FDA officials said the agency would review whether to take action on Vytorin and the two-year study, called Enhance. But they said it was too early to change practice. "The surrogate that has worked over time has been LDL cholesterol. You have to go a long way to rebut that," said Dr. Robert Temple, director of the office of medical policy at the FDA. Vytorin and Zetia, which is also sold separately, have annual sales of $5 billion. Tim Anderson, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co, said he FDA needed to balance out the frenzy of media coverage that has inflated the importance of one small study. "The FDA had to put the brakes on this," said Anderson, which does no investment banking. Jenkins said the Vytorin label makes it clear that the drug has not been shown to reduce heart attacks and strokes. Millions of people take statins to lower cholesterol in the hope of preventing heart attacks or stroke. They can also raise high-density lipoprotein, or HDL -- the so-called "good" cholesterol -- and they reduce inflammation. (Editing by  Richard Chang )
