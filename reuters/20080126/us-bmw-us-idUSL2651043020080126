 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German premium car maker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) aims to increase its sales in the United States to 400,000 units per year in the medium term from 336,000, the German Auto Motor und Sport magazine reported. 

 "Today Europe is still our main market with a share of around 60 percent followed by North America with 24 percent and Asia with 11 percent," the magazine quoted BMW's head of sales and marketing, Stefan Krause, as saying. "Looking at countries, the United States with 336,000 units overtook Germany as our main market already a few years ago. And is there that we see the absolutely strongest growth worldwide," Krause said. (Reporting by  Peter Starck ; editing by Tony Austin)
