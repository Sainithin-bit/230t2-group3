 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German car maker Volkswagen VOWG.E 
plans production of engines and transmissions in North America 
to reduce its exposure to the U.S. dollar exchange rate, the 
German magazine Automobilwoche reported on Saturday. 

  "We will not be competitive unless we produce these 
components locally," the magazine quoted Stefan Jacoby, 
president and CEO of Volkswagen of America Inc, as saying.  A production facility could be located in the United 
States, Canada or Mexico, Jacoby said.  Volkswagen has earlier announced plans to build an assembly 
plant in the United States.  (Reporting by  Peter Starck ; editing by Tony Austin)
