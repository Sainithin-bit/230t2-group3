 LONDON  (Reuters) - British aerospace firm Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) said it was replacing a component on a number of its Trent 1000 engines which power Boeing's ( BA.N ) new 787 Dreamliner aeroplane. 
 "We have identified that a component on Trent 1000 engines fitted to Boeing 787 Dreamliners has a reduced service life. As a proactive measure, this component is being replaced in a number of engines," a Rolls-Royce spokesman said on Monday. The spokesman was responding to questions about reports that Japanese customer All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ) had carried out repairs on some of its 787 Dreamliners due to a defect with the Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.
