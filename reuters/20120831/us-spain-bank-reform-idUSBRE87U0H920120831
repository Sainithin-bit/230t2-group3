 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain's Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria said on Friday the government had approved the country's latest banking reform in which it will establish a 'bad bank' to hive off banks' rotten property assets. 
 She said the reform would complete the banking sector's restructuring and get credit flowing again. (Reporting by  Fiona Ortiz , writing by Nigel Davies, editing by Tracy Rucinski)
