 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ), Japan's third-largest automaker, will post an annual operating loss instead of a previously forecast profit, hurt by sliding sales and a soaring yen, a company source said. 

 Battered by a precipitous drop in global car demand, the automaker also said on Thursday it would cut domestic production further in February and March and may make more reductions depending on market conditions. Nissan is set to cut earnings forecasts this month, predicting its first operating loss since Carlos Ghosn became chief executive officer in 1999, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters, confirming a Yomiuri newspaper report. Nissan spokeswoman Masako Aoyama declined comment on possible earnings revisions. Industry leader Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) has also warned it would post its first-ever annual operating loss and other carmakers have been cutting their earnings outlooks. Automakers across the board are slashing production as consumers in the United States and in emerging markets stop spending and the global economy visibly contracts. "The yen is climbing, the U.S. economy is worsening at an unprecedented pitch, and structural changes in the car industry mean the pie will grow smaller and smaller for some time," said Tatsuya Mizuno, an analyst at Fitch Ratings. "I would not be surprised to see Nissan fall into the red." Nissan, maker of the Pathfinder SUV, the Z sports car and Infiniti luxury brand models, has yet to decide on the size of the projected loss, the source said, asking that his name not be used because Nissan has not officially revised its forecast. The Yomiuri said the loss was likely to amount to at least several tens of billion yen. That compares with a consensus for an operating profit of 81.8 billion yen ($919 million), according to a poll of 19 analysts by Reuters Estimates. In October, Nissan more than halved its operating profit forecast for the year to March 31 to 270 billion yen from 550 billion yen. The source said a steep appreciation in the yen was behind Nissan's fall to a loss. The dollar was trading at 89 yen and the euro was at 117 yen on Thursday, compared to Nissan's assumed exchange rates of 100 yen to the dollar and 135 yen to the euro for October-March. The company is also eyeing an increase in provisions against a fall in the residual value of its leased vehicles, as used car prices plunge, the source said. Nissan said it would cut domestic output by an extra 64,000 units in February and March, bringing total cuts for the year to March to 289,000 units from its plan to build 1.39 million vehicles. The auto industry downturn caused Nissan's vehicle sales to drop 31 percent last month in the United States, its key market, forcing the company to maintain a four-day work week indefinitely for its two U.S. auto assembly plants. On top of slumping sales in the mature markets of North America, Europe and Japan and slowing sales in emerging markets such as India, China and Russia, Japanese automakers are battling a stronger yen, which reduces the value of earnings made abroad and makes their products less competitive. An operating loss would increase the pressure on Ghosn, who is also grappling with sinking profitability at Renault SA ( RENA.PA ) in his dual-CEO role at the Franco-Japanese alliance. Nissan is 44 percent owned by Renault. Shares of Nissan finished down 3.4 percent at 314 yen, performing in line with the broader auto sector. The Topix subindex for transport equipment makers .ITEQP.T dropped 3.5 percent.
