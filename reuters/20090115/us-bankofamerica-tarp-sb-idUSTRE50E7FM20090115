 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp is in talks with the U.S. government to receive about $15 billion in additional capital from the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program, plus government guarantees, according to a financial policy source familiar with the talks. 

 The source told Reuters on Thursday that Bank of America will announce the government deal on Tuesday, when it reports earnings, and that the deal is structured to help Bank of America absorb the credit losses at Merrill Lynch & Co, which it bought on January 1. President-elect Barack Obama and President George W. Bush have both signed off on additional aid for Bank of America, the source said. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski ; editing by  Richard Chang )
