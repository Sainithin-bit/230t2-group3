 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment on a report on Thursday that Bank of America Corp would receive a government guarantee of about $100 billion to $200 billion. 

 CNBC Television reported that the Treasury, Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp would all be involved in the Bank of America guarantee, which would include additional capital from the Troubled Asset Relief Fund. Bank of America has sought additional government funds to help it digest losses related to its acquisition of Wall Street brokerage Merrill Lynch, according to people familiar with the situation.
