 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Bank of America and Citigroup tumbled in early trade Thursday on worries the banks are ill-prepared to handle soaring credit losses in a recession. 

 News that Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, is close to getting billions of dollars more in federal support from taxpayers sent shares down 25 percent to $7.63 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the session, they touched $7.35 -- a level not seen since 1991. Citi shares traded at $3.42, down 24 percent. The sectoral KBW Banks Index slid 8.9 percent. COMMENTS TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER FOR $22 BILLION IN ASSETS AT CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC IN PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "From price action in the market this looks, feels and smells like a redux of Lehman. Citi below 4 and BofA heading to 4 implies that investors are betting that the government needs to step in and that will wipe out the equity holder." LAWRENCE GLAZER, MANAGING PARTNER OF MAYFLOWER ADVISORS IN BOSTON: "Although the calendar year has changed, we are still dealing with the messy aftermath of the credit crisis. The damage was done but the ripple effects remain." "I don't think we will see a return to where riskier assets traded after Lehman." BILL HACKNEY, MANAGING PARTNER OF ATLANTA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA. "The market is sensing that they (Bank of America) are going to have to cut their dividend and that they would have to take more money from the government." "There is fear in the market that they bit off more than they could chew. It's the fear of the unknown." JONATHAN BASILE, ECONOMIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK "The more bad news you get from any industry will postpone an economic recovery. This is telling you that companies will cut costs and potentially lead to more job losses because labor is the biggest cost for most firms." ANTON SCHUTZ, PRESIDENT OF MENDON CAPITAL IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, OWNS BANK OF AMERICA: "Bank of America appears to be in meltdown. But what is the government going to do, and how big will it be? What if they are just buying $5 billion of toxic securities from Bank of America, is that a big deal? Everybody's assuming the worst, and that's probably paid off for people so far, but we just don't have the facts about what's happening yet." NANCY BUSH, AN INDEPENDENT BANK ANALYST, NAB RESEARCH. "My question when I read this today about Bank of America hitting TARP for Merrill is why did they not do this in the first place? I think that's the market's reaction." "It's evident (BofA Chief Executive) Ken Lewis overpaid for Merrill, that he did not do comprehensive due diligence. The question for next Tuesday, when Bank of America reports results, is do they have a loss? It's possible. Right now it's unknowable." JOHN STEIN, PRESIDENT OF FSI GROUP IN CINCINNATI, MANAGES ABOUT $20 BILLION, HOLDS BANK OF AMERICA SHARES "I think the market is overdoing it on Bank of America." "I don't believe that Bank of America has the same worries as Citigroup has." "My guess is when the dust settles on this, Bank of America is going to get something comparable to between what the government offered Citi to do the Wachovia deal and what JPMorgan got to do the Bear deal." "Bank of America has a solid banking core banking business, they have a lot of fee income, they have a great funding base. Merrill Lynch was probably worth less than zero, Countrywide was certainly worth less than zero. But the rest of Bank of America though, there's a lot of value in that enterprise that should throw off enough cash flow to work through all this stuff." HOWARD SIMONS, STRATEGIST WITH BIANCO RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "Is this crisis as severe as the Bear Stearns and Lehman crises? The problem then was that we had institutions that were too big too fail. Now we've created a smaller concentration of even larger institutions that are too big to fail. "A year ago at this point we had five functioning investment banks, and now we have none. We had two mortgage giants; today, we have none. WaMu and Wachovia were going concerns. We had an insurance company, AIG, that is now a ward of the state. What we have learned over the last year is that you can't be pessimistic enough. "Can we afford to let these banks go under? My guess is we can't. But can we afford to save them? "No institution can prosper if its customers are in trouble, and the banks' customers are in trouble. CARL BIRKELBACH, HEAD OF BIRKELBACH MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO: "I think it's tremendously disappointing that the banks continue to flounder. Paulson said in an interview that when your house is on fire, you first want to put out the fire, then worry about the fire codes. What's going on here is that the first batch of the TARP funds was supposed to put out the fire, but now it looks like the fire is coming up again. "The Barney Franks committee meetings are discouraging for the banking community because its looking at the fire code, not the fire. That's delaying the rest of the money. "The good news is that President-elect Obama will be in the White House as of Tuesday and he's been insisting that the money come right away. JOE KINAHAN, CHIEF DERIVATIVES STRATEGIST AT THINKORSWIM GROUP IN CHICAGO "On the surface, the severe drop in Citigroup and Bank of America shares is as bad as what we saw in Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers last year. But in reality, I don't think it will be. "The reason being is that TARP did not exist then, and I think the government learned a lesson as to how much these banks affect other banks. And if one bank fails, it would also weaken the banks that survive. In Citigroup's case, the need for them to raise cash has led to a loss of some confidence in their leadership. In Bank of America, a dividend cut would seem to be imminent despite what their management is saying." KEITH DAVIS, BANK ANALYST AT FARR, MILLER & WASHINGTON IN WASHINGTON, DC: "There's an inability for people to unravel all the deals Bank of America has done, and I'm not completely sure all the problems are confined to Merrill Lynch. Given their razor thin capitalization levels, there's a risk that credit losses continue to rise significantly as well as write downs. That continues to eat further into their very thin capital base, and that's why they're acquiring more capital from the government." "It's too big to fail, and they'll get the capital they need from the government. But I wouldn't want to be a common shareholder. The long-term earnings power of the franchise is significantly diluted. The deals they've done have been highly risky, and now things have deteriorated from a credit perspective." PETER KENNY, MANAGING DIRECTOR AT KNIGHT EQUITY MARKETS INJERSEY CITY, NEW JERSEY "Financials that have been addressed by accessed TARP have found that the TARP assistance is actually very therapeutic but it's not the cure. "The market will decide on the solution and the solution is going to be improved credit spreads and velocity of money." MATT MCCORMICK, ANALYST AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER, BAHL & GAYNOR INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CINCINNATI "The market believes that this (BofA news) could potentially mean other TARP recipients may also need additional funds. People wanted to see a floor, some stability, and thought the worst was behind us but are reminded we are not out of the woods yet. This was not expected by the Street so investors are selling accordingly.
