 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp executives were livid after uncovering heavy losses at Merrill Lynch & Co as it prepared to complete its purchase of the Wall Street bank, the Financial Times said on Thursday, without saying where it got the information. 

 It said that in December, after learning that Merrill's fourth quarter would be worse than expected, Bank of America sent lawyers to investigate whether results were so bad that it could break off the deal, invoking a contractual provision governing a "material adverse" change in Merrill's condition. Bank of America then told the U.S. government it would cancel the deal unless it received government funds, and closed on January 1 after a commitment was secured, the newspaper said. The newspaper said the problems have caused strain between Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis and former Merrill CEO John Thain. A Merrill spokeswoman declined to comment and a Bank of America spokesman did not immediately return a call. The companies announced their all-stock merger in the early morning on September 15, after fewer than 48 hours of frenzied negotiations that saw Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc file for bankruptcy protection the same morning. Bank of America is now blaming Merrill executives for glossing over the bank's problems ahead of the sale, the newspaper said. At a press conference hours after the deal was announced in September, Lewis had said he was able to do due diligence on Merrill over that weekend with the help of private equity firm J.C. Flowers, which had already done a lot of this research. Lewis also called the acquisition a "strategic opportunity" that another company might take if he did not. Tensions between Lewis and Thain spiked after the latter sought a bonus of more than $10 million for 2008, leaving Lewis "purple-faced" with rage, the newspaper said, citing an unnamed North Carolina executive. Bank of America is based in Charlotte, North Carolina. Thain, who was named president of global banking, securities and wealth management at Bank of America, said in December he would not seek a bonus for 2008. Many investors and analysts have questioned how long Thain will remain subordinate to Lewis, after having run two public companies himself: Merrill and NYSE Euronext (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
