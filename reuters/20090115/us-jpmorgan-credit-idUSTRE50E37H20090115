 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Thursday losses from its recent takeover of Washington Mutual Inc could total 17 percent more than it had originally forecast, and said credit card losses may also increase through 2009. 

 The forecast reflects deterioration in the economy and credit conditions, which are also expected to hurt rivals such as Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc. In a presentation accompanying its earnings release, JPMorgan projected $32 billion to $36 billion of remaining losses on the Washington Mutual portfolio, up from the $30.7 billion it forecast when it took over the business on Sept 25. The new forecast is based on updated home price expectations. Washington Mutual is the largest U.S. bank to fail. JPMorgan bought most of its assets for $1.9 billion in a government-arranged sale, adding more than 2,000 branches but taking on billions of dollars of risky mortgages. JPMorgan also said losses in its credit card portfolio, excluding Washington Mutual, should approach 7 percent in the first quarter and could reach 8 percent near the end of 2009. The managed net charge-off rate in the card portfolio was 5.29 percent in the fourth quarter, excluding Washington Mutual. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Derek Caney )
