 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and Citigroup ( C.N ) tumbled in early trade Thursday on deepening concerns about the strength of the financial sector. 

 News that Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, is close to getting billions of dollars more in federal support from taxpayers sent shares fell 20 percent to $8.12 on the New York Stock Exchange. Citi shares traded at $3.78, down 16 percent. The sectoral KBW Banks Index .BKX slid 8.9 percent. COMMENTS ANTON SCHUTZ, PRESIDENT OF MENDON CAPITAL IN ROCHESTER, NEW YORK, OWNS BANK OF AMERICA: "Bank of America appears to be in meltdown. But what is the government going to do, and how big will it be? What if they are just buying $5 billion of toxic securities from Bank of America, is that a big deal? Everybody's assuming the worst, and that's probably paid off for people so far, but we just don't have the facts about what's happening yet." NANCY BUSH, AN INDEPENDENT BANK ANALYST, NAB RESEARCH. "My question when I read this today about Bank of America hitting TARP for Merrill is why did they not do this in the first place? I think that's the market's reaction." "It's evident (BofA Chief Executive) Ken Lewis overpaid for Merrill, that he did not do comprehensive due diligence. The question for next Tuesday, when Bank of America reports results, is do they have a loss? It's possible. Right now it's unknowable." JOHN STEIN, PRESIDENT OF FSI GROUP IN CINCINNATI, MANAGES ABOUT $20 BILLION, HOLDS BANK OF AMERICA SHARES "I think the market is overdoing it on Bank of America." "I don't believe that Bank of America has the same worries as Citigroup has." "My guess is when the dust settles on this, Bank of America is going to get something comparable to between what the government offered Citi to do the Wachovia deal and what JPMorgan got to do the Bear deal." "Bank of America has a solid banking core banking business, they have a lot of fee income, they have a great funding base. Merrill Lynch was probably worth less than zero, Countrywide was certainly worth less than zero. But the rest of Bank of America though, there's a lot of value in that enterprise that should throw off enough cash flow to work through all this stuff." JOE KINAHAN, CHIEF DERIVATIVES STRATEGIST AT THINKORSWIM GROUP IN CHICAGO "On the surface, the severe drop in Citigroup and Bank of America shares is as bad as what we saw in Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers last year. But in reality, I don't think it will be. "The reason being is that TARP did not exist then, and I think the government learned a lesson as to how much these banks affect other banks. And if one bank fails, it would also weaken the banks that survive. In Citigroup's case, the need for them to raise cash has led to a loss of some confidence in their leadership. In Bank of America, a dividend cut would seem to be imminent despite what their management is saying." KEITH DAVIS, BANK ANALYST AT FARR, MILLER & WASHINGTON IN WASHINGTON, DC: "There's an inability for people to unravel all the deals Bank of America has done, and I'm not completely sure all the problems are confined to Merrill Lynch. Given their razor thin capitalization levels, there's a risk that credit losses continue to rise significantly as well as write downs. That continues to eat further into their very thin capital base, and that's why they're acquiring more capital from the government." "It's too big to fail, and they'll get the capital they need from the government. But I wouldn't want to be a common shareholder. The long-term earnings power of the franchise is significantly diluted. The deals they've done have been highly risky, and now things have deteriorated from a credit perspective."
