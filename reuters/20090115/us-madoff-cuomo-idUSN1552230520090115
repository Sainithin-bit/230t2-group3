 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York state's top legal officer has issued subpoenas to three investment funds run by hedge fund founder Ezra Merkin as part of a probe into accused swindler Bernard Madoff, a source close to the investigation said on Thursday. 

 New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo is seeking information from Merkin and his Gabriel Capital Corp, Ariel Fund Ltd and Ascot Partners funds. All of the funds have been sued by nonprofits and individual investors, who accuse them of investing with Madoff without their knowledge. "The subpoenas have been issued on Merkin and three of his investment funds," a source close to the investigation said. Fifteen nonprofits who entrusted their money to Madoff or were solicited to invest with his firm, have also been subpoenaed for information, the source said. The nonprofits are not targets in the investigation, according to the source. A lawyer for Merkin was not immediately available to comment. His lawyer has described Merkin as one of the victims of Madoff's purported $50 billion fraud that ensnared the wealthy, banks, funds, charities and universities worldwide. On Tuesday, Cuomo told reporters that his office was probing frauds perpetrated on charities and people who may have defrauded nonprofits in Madoff's purported scheme, but he declined to name individuals or organizations. Madoff, 70, a former chairman of the NASDAQ stock market and a once-respected figure in the financial industry for more than 40 years, is under house arrest and 24-hour surveillance in his Manhattan apartment. He was arrested and charged on December 11 with one count of securities fraud. Authorities said he confessed to his sons that for many years he had run "a giant Ponzi scheme" according to court documents. Madoff's lawyers have said their client has been cooperating with government investigations following his arrest for what could be the biggest Ponzi scheme in history. In a Ponzi scheme, early investors are paid with the money of new clients. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
