 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge-fund manager Doug Kass, who successfully shorted U.S. equities last year, said on Thursday that it's too late to short the shares of Citigroup and Bank of America and believes they are "too big to fail" following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy. 

 "Citigroup and Bank of America are not going out of business ... They both will likely become wards of the state," Kass, who heads hedge fund Seabreeze Partners Management, said in an interview with Reuters. "They are too big to fail. It was the failure of Lehman that had a domino effect on our financial system and provided the next leg of large investment writedowns and losses." Kass said it is too late to short the shares of Citi and BofA because current prices are too low. In afternoon trading, Citigroup shares were down 9.5 percent, at $4.10. Bank of America shares were down 14.2 percent, at $8.75. "The government -- as wards or conservators of Citi and BofA -- will begin the process of reducing the size of these holding companies to levels that will allow for them to be acquired by other institutions," Kass said. The newly announced joint venture of Citi and Morgan Stanley is the first step, he said. "The preferential move is separating the banks into good and bad banks," Kass said. "If that is not done, and the government simply replaces management, that new management will allow the government to buy and take possession of the bad parts and patiently liquidate those assets in time -- and hopefully get some upside over time."
