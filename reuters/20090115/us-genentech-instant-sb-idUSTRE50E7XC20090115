 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genentech Inc DNA.N reported higher fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, but sales of its most closely watched drug, Avastin, and its 2009 earnings forecast were shy of Wall Street expectations and its shares fell nearly 2 percent. 

 U.S. sales of the cancer drug Avastin, widely considered the most important barometer of Genentech's fortunes, rose 21 percent to $731 million, falling short of analyst estimates of about $740 million. COMMENTS ERIC SCHMIDT, ANALYST, COWEN & CO "The important thing is the U.S. products sales, and that was spot on with expectations." "A few of the lines maybe were a little bit weaker -- Avastin and Herceptin -- and a few lines a little stronger -- Rituxan and Lucentis." "Looks like they spent a smidge more on a Non-GAAP basis than consensus. That might explain the quarter coming in just a bit below." "For 2009, the Non-GAAP earnings is a big range, and it's not that attractive a range." "With this company, there isn't a lot of quarter-to-quarter focus any more. It's more about what Roche might do."
