 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - A European Commission spokesman said on Monday the EU executive was continuing contact with the government over Northern Rock, but stopped short of saying any British plan would get a green light from Brussels. 

 "We have been in regular contact since September with the British government and those contacts are continuing," spokesman Jonathan Todd said. But he did not say that such contacts amounted to approval of the government's plan. "We will have to examine the plan in great detail," Todd added. The government set a two-week deadline for a private-sector rescue of Northern Rock on Monday, as it confirmed plans to convert its billions of pounds of loans to the stricken bank into bonds in a bid to smooth a deal.
