 (Reuters) - The government set a two-week deadline for a private-sector rescue of Northern Rock on Monday as it confirmed plans to convert its billions of pounds of loans to the stricken bank into bonds in a bid to smooth a deal. 

 Here is a list of recent bailouts by the government: * RAILTRACK: -- Railtrack, British railway infrastructure company, was sold to the state-owned company Network Rail in October 2002 and renamed later as the RT Group. It is currently in members' voluntary liquidation and will remain in existence until the final liquidation payment is made to shareholders in 2008. The government gave a 300 million pound grant to Network Rail. * BRITISH ENERGY: -- The government gained a 64 percent interest in the country's biggest electrical power producer British Energy in 2002 when it led a rescue of the company driven to the brink of collapse by tumbling power prices and a big nuclear clean-up bill. In 2003 British Energy creditors signed a restructuring deal that handed them control of the stricken nuclear power producer in exchange for forgiving more than half its 1.3 billion pounds of debts, effectively avoiding a re-nationalisation. The government sold a 25 percent stake in the group in May 2007 for 2.1 billion pounds, cutting its stake to around 39 percent. * MG ROVER: -- The 100-year-old carmaker famous for its iconic Mini and Land Rover ran out of cash in April 2005 and cut up to 5,000 jobs after failing to secure a rescue deal with China's Shanghai Automotive Industry Corp. The government loaned Rover about 6.5 million pounds as part of a rescue plan. The company was later sold to Nanjing Automobile Group for an unknown sum. * NORTHERN ROCK: -- Bank of England helped Northern Rock in September 2007, promising emergency funds after the global credit crunch hit the bank's ability to raise cash in money markets.
