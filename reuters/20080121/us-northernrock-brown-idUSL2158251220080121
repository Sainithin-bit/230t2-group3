 LONDON  (Reuters) - Fallout from the rescue of Northern Rock NRK.L after Britain's first bank run in more than a century could end up haunting Prime Minister Gordon Brown for years to come. 

 Brown has already seen his popularity slump. A double-digit lead over the opposition Conservatives in the first few months of his premiership has turned into an equally large deficit in the wake of the bank crisis, a slowing economy, administrative blunders and perceived dithering over calling an election. The Treasury has now said that loans of almost 25 billion pounds ($48.73 billion) it has made to the bank since last September could be converted into bonds guaranteed by the government, in a bid to ensure a private sector takeover actually happens. "Our aim throughout this process is to ensure the best deal for the British taxpayer and ensure the stability of the British economy," Brown said while on a trip to New Delhi. But while a takeover would at least avert the politically damaging prospect of nationalization which carries with it the baggage of more left-wing Labour governments of the past, it also means the debt could stay on the public books for years. "No British government has provided taxpayer support on this scale," George Osborne, treasury spokesman for the opposition Conservatives said in parliament, recalling previous nationalizations of British Steel and carmaker British Leyland. "This is back to the 1970s," he said. Liberal Democrats treasury spokesman Vincent Cable said the plan was just a fig leaf for nationalization. "What we have here is naked King Gordon trying to cover his embarrassment over the 'N' word of nationalization," he said. Finance minister Alistair Darling said it is still not certain how the loans to Northern Rock -- made because the bank was no longer able to raise funding in wholesale markets -- would be classified but they were in any case temporary and did not reflect the true fiscal position. But he will be wary of consumer confidence, already battered, taking a further knock. Once lost, a reputation for economic competence is hard to win back. Almost exactly 15 years before the run on Northern Rock in September, the opposition Conservatives lost theirs because of the pound's forced exit from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. It ushered in three successive wins for the ruling Labour Party. Figures on Monday showed public borrowing hit a record for the month of December and pointed to a big overshoot of government forecasts. The housing market is also slowing and economic growth is expected to weaken significantly over 2008. Stock markets around the world, meanwhile, are tumbling. The FTSE-100 index of leading shares fell more than 5 percent on Monday. Osborne also attacked the government for costing London its reputation as a centre of world finance because of the Northern Rock debacle. While Britain's "light-touch" regulation has been lauded as a key reason for attracting so much business to the City of London, many critics are now wondering whether Britain's financial supervisory structure is wanting.
