 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National Semiconductor Corp. ( NSM.N ) 
said on Monday it will sell equipment and eliminate 200 jobs at 
its wafer fabrication plants to modernize facilities and reduce 
capacity. 

  The company will take a $20 million charge, mostly during 
the current fiscal third quarter, of which $12 million relates 
to severance costs.  The wafer fabrication facilities are in the U.S. states of 
Texas and Maine, and in Greenock, Scotland, the company said.  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by  Derek Caney )
