 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Two potential mega mergers involving four of the world's biggest mining companies could trigger shifts in the Canadian mining landscape, particularly in the nickel hub of Sudbury and the burgeoning northern diamond industry. 

 Brazilian mining giant Vale ( VALE5.SA ) said on Monday it has held takeover talks with Anglo-Swiss rival Xstrata XTA.L on a deal analysts said could be worth $100 billion. This follows world No. 1 miner BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX ) offer for Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ), a bid worth $140 billion when it was announced in November. If Vale does succeed in a takeover of Xstrata, it would trigger a consolidation of nickel assets in Sudbury, Ontario, which has been a stated goal of both companies since their 2006 acquisitions of Canadian nickel miners Inco and Falconbridge, respectively. "Putting the companies together would certainly finally monetize the synergies that are sitting up there," said Orest Wowkodaw, an analyst at Canaccord Adams. Combining the two operations, which in some areas of the historic Sudbury camp physically overlap each other, would unlock hundreds of millions of dollars of savings, and could also involve smaller player FNX Mining FNX.TO , which operates former Inco mines and processes ore at Vale smelters. While Xstrata said last year it had hoped to have a deal done by the end of 2007, nothing has been announced, and some analysts say Vale's appetite for an agreement has been overstated. If a takeover does happen, some analysts think a combined Vale-Xstrata might even consider packaging the Sudbury nickel operations off as a separate pure-play nickel company. "There is a potential for that to happen in the event that (Vale) and Xstrata do get together," said Desjardins Securities' John Hughes, who believed a cost-saving deal was unlikely unless the companies merge. "The only way we're going to see any form of rationalizing Sudbury is through one company versus two," he said. DIAMONDS, ALUMINUM MOVES For BHP and Rio, there is not such an obvious operational overlap in Canada, but a combination could trigger a smaller shake-up of Canada's diamond industry, as Rio's 60 percent interest in the Diavik mine would be combined with BHP's Ekati mine. Diavik produced nearly 10 million carats in 2006, while Ekati yields about 4 million carats per year. Analysts say the operations, which are seen as non-core for the base-metals focused companies, would be likely cast-offs should BHP need to raise funds following a takeover. With Rio having just recently completed its takeover of Canadian aluminum producer Alcan, BHP would also become a top player in that industry, and take control of Alcan's several billion dollars' worth of planned expansion projects in the Canadian provinces of British Columbia and Quebec, as well as others across the globe. John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities, said he doubted BHP would want to scale back on its aluminum assets, but that he thought the recent deterioration of stock prices and credit condition could prompt some expansion projects to be delayed. If the mega-deals do go through, the result might actually be less M&A demand for smaller Canadian miners, said David Whetham of Scotia Cassels. "These companies are going to be so big that to just add another little operation on isn't going to have any impact on them," he said. (Editing by  Bernadette Baum )
