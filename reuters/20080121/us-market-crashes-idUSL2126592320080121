 (Reuters) - Stock markets around the world tumbled on Monday. 

 Here is a list of some major stock market crashes: * The crash of 1929: - October 29, 1929 - The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 11 percent on "Black Tuesday", with a record volume of 16 million shares traded. It heralded the beginning of the "Great Depression" of the 1930s. It did not surpass the 1929 average again until 1954. * The crash of 1987: - News of a big U.S. monthly trade deficit on October 14 sparked the crash of 1987. The Dow took the first 100-point dive in its history on October 16, 1987 and again on October 19, "Black Monday". Wall Street lost 508.32 points taking the Dow down to 1,738.4. The crash wiped 22.6 percent off the value of the New York Stock Exchange, compared with 12.8 percent on the worst day of the 1929 Wall Street Crash. * The crash of 1997: - Financial turmoil in Asia that began in July when international currency speculators bet against the Thai baht helped trigger the biggest single-day point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average on Monday, October 27, 1997. - Stock markets in Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil dropped between 13 and 15 percent. It spilled over into European markets on October 28. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell 725.67 points or 4.26 percent to 16,312.69. Singapore's Straits Times Index ended 122.87 or 7.59 percent lower to 1,497.03. * The crash of 2001: - Another global stock crash was triggered by the 9/11 attack on the United States. Investors across the world snapped up traditional safe assets like gold and bonds after the attack pummeled global stocks, shook the U.S. dollar and drove up oil prices. - Main U.S. markets were closed after the attacks, which occurred just as the trading day was about to begin. After a delayed opening, Tokyo stocks slid to 17-year lows, with the Nikkei stock average losing 6.23 percent to 9,651.62 and breaching 10,000 for the first time since August 1984. - European stock indices fell to their lowest levels since December 1998. London's FTSE 100 index shed 5.7 percent in its biggest one-day fall since the crash of October 1987, wiping $98 billion off the value of shares. * The crash of 2007: - On February 27, the Dow index fell 3.3 percent, or 416 points, following a collapse in Chinese stocks and weak U.S. manufacturing data. The Nikkei share average lost more than 3 percent and the FTSE 100 was down 116.1 points, or 1.85 percent. Mexican stocks lost 4 percent and Chinese stocks plunged nearly 9 percent, erasing about $140 billion of value in their biggest fall for a decade.
