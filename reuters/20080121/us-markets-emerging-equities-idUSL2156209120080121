 LONDON  (Reuters) - Emerging market stocks plunged more than five percent on Monday to a fresh four-month low, taking their cue from a global equity selloff triggered by fears of a recession in the United States. 

 The MSCI emerging index hit a low of 1077.65 points to post its biggest one-day fall since August 2007. The index has lost 13.4 percent so far this year after gaining over 36 percent in 2007. The corresponding world index is at the weakest since November 2006 while European stocks sank 5.6 percent.
