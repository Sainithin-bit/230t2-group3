 MUNICH  (Reuters) - Private equity investor KKR KKR.UL, which acquired Germany's ProSiebenSat.1 PSMG_p.DE with Permira PERM.UL in December 2006, is placing its bets on the success of old media and will stick with ProSieben, it said. 

 "There is the question of survival in old media specifically in regard to TV advertising," Philipp Freise, a principal at KKR, told a digital media conference in Munich on Monday. "We have to face that." But he added: "I believe that (the purchase of the stake) is testament to the opportunities we have here...If it takes five years, if takes seven years, we'll ride with it." Traditional media such as free-to-air television, newspapers and media are struggling to compete with multi-channel opportunities such as mobile phones and the Internet for a piece of the lucrative advertising market. Freise helped negotiate the 5.6 billion-euro ($8.11 billion) acquisition of ProSiebenSat.1 as well as the purchase of pan-European TV company SBS Broadcasting in 2005. "If we can merge ProSieben into an integrated media house then that's a great opportunity," Freise said, adding that owning all of Germany's largest commercial broadcaster would help. Axel Springer, which once wanted to buy ProSieben but had to abandon its plans due to cartel concerns, sold its 12 percent stake in the broadcaster at the end of last year to KKR for around 500 million euros. ProSieben had evolved from a German broadcaster into a European one thanks to the content it sells and its merger with SBS Broadcasting, Freise said. He was optimistic that TV could survive if it created additional revenue streams such as offline campaigns to accompany a popular show. Freise cited ProSieben's program Germany's Next Top Model which generated extra sales through books, DVD and the like. "I am very bullish on old media," he added, but quipped that buying ProSieben was the riskiest deal he ever made. (Reporting by  Nicola Leske , editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)
