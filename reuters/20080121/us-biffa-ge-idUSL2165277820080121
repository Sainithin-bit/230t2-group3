 LONDON  (Reuters) - British waste-collection firm Biffa BIFF.L has received a counter-approach worth around 1.5 billion pounds ($3 billion) from a fund backed by General Electric ( GE.N ), said sources familiar with the matter. 

 GE's infrastructure fund, Global Infrastructure Partners, which is also backed by Swiss-based bank Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), is undertaking due diligence on Biffa, the sources said on Monday, confirming a report in the Sunday Telegraph. Shares in Biffa were up 4.1 percent at 345-1/2 pence at 9:34 a.m. EST. Biffa opened its books before Christmas to a rival consortium backed by private equity firms Montagu and Hg Capital, which have made an indicative offer at 350p per share, worth around 1.23 billion pounds, but a concrete offer has not yet been made. Spokespeople for Biffa and Global Infrastructure Partners declined to comment. (Reporting by  Mathieu Robbins ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
