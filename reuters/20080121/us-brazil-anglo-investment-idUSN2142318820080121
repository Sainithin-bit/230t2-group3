 RIO DE JANEIRO  (Reuters) - Mining group Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) will invest $16 billion through 2017 to boost iron ore output at its Brazilian mines to 100 million tonnes annually, chief executive Cynthia Carroll said Monday. 

 On Thursday, Anglo said it was in talks with Brazilian miner MMX Mineracao ( MMXM3.SA )( XMM.TO ) to buy two of its iron ore mines for $5.5 billion. Anglo's iron ore output in 2006 was 31.1 million tonnes worldwide and Brazil will account for two thirds of its planned global output of 150 million tonnes by 2017, with South Africa making up the balance.
