 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) plant in Belgium resumed production on Monday after workers voted to accept a provisional deal between union and management and to end their strike. 

 Some 70 percent of the workers accepted the agreement struck in the early hours of Monday for two one-off pay hikes of 500 euros gross, the offering of fixed contracts to 200 temporary staff and an easing of pressure with extra workers in one area. "Production resumed at about 4 p.m. today," a company spokesman said. A union official confirmed that workers had voted in favor. The workers at the plant downed tools late on Thursday in a dispute over pay, fixed contracts for temporary employees and the issue of work pressure. The plant in the eastern town of Genk employs almost 6,000 workers, including those on temporary contracts, and produces Ford's larger Mondeo, S-Max and Galaxy models. A union official had said workers at Ford Europe's other assembly plants at Cologne and Saarlouis in Germany and Valencia in Spain were paying close attention to the Belgian action and eventual settlement.
