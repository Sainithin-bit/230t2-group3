 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Virgin Group has submitted a fair offer for embattled mortgage bank Northern Rock NRK.L but the terms could still be tweaked, owner Richard Branson said on Monday. 

 "Until we see details of the deal, I can't say whether we will in any way change the terms of our offer, but we believe our offer was a fair one," Richard Branson told reporters. He said the government's proposal to convert its lending to Northern Rock was a workable one. "We believe from what we've seen that the package is workable and it should be possible for a private consortium like the Virgin bank to make a go of it but obviously we need to see the small print," he said. Asked whether other bidders could enter the frame, he said. "It's always a possibility. I think with two weeks to go it's obviously less likely than likely but it's certainly always a possibility." Branson is accompanying Prime Minister Gordon Brown on a trip to India. (Reporting by  Adrian Croft ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
