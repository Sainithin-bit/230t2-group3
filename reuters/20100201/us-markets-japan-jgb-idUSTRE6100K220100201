 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese government bonds were a touch weaker on Monday as investors sold cash bonds to make room in their portfolios before a sale of benchmark 10-year notes the following day. 

 But futures were little changed near a one-month high reached late last week, as a fall in Tokyo's Nikkei stock average  .N225  made traders cautious about selling safe-haven government bonds. "There are few reasons to sell JGBs other than tomorrow's auction," said Makoto Yamashita, chief Japan interest rate strategist at Deutsche Securities. "If the dollar/yen and the Nikkei finish the fiscal year in March around their current levels, then 10-year yields would definitely look attractive." March futures were down 0.02 point at 139.49 at the midday break, having traded in a relatively tight range. The lead futures contract on Friday rose as high as 139.71, its highest since late December. The benchmark 10-year yield rose 1 basis point to 1.325 percent. The Ministry of Finance will offer 2.2 trillion yen ($24 billion) of 10-year JGBs on Tuesday. The coupon is expected to be set at 1.3 percent, unchanged from the previous two auctions of the maturity. That means the ministry is likely to sell the notes in a reopening of the current No.305 issue. Market players expect the debt sale to go smoothly, especially after data showed last week that the economy was gripped by delation, which could prompt the Bank of Japan to ease monetary policy further. Investors are likely to increase their bond buying if Tuesday's debt sale draws solid demand, analysts said. Some players still need to boost their JGB holdings before the fiscal year ends, and as uncertainty grows over the strength of the Tokyo stock market. The Nikkei stock average  .N225  had fallen 0.4 percent by midday, crawling toward the psychologically important 10,000 mark, as fiscal concerns in Europe prompted investors to avert risks while lifting the yen against the euro. The five-year yield rose 0.5 basis point to 0.495 percent and the 20-year yield was up 0.5 basis point at 2.120 percent. (Reporting by Rika Otsuka; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
