 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama proposed on Monday to slow Lockheed Martin Corp's F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the Pentagon's costliest purchase at about $300 billion over the next 25 years. 

 The Defense Department wants $10.7 billion to continue F-35 development and to buy 43 of the radar-evading fighters in fiscal 2011, down from $10.8 billion this fiscal year, according a Pentagon budget overview. Following is a list of how Obama would fund other major weapons programs: * The Navy would spend $1.9 billion to buy 22 Boeing Co F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighter jets, up from $1.7 billion for 18 in the fiscal 2010 budget enacted by Congress. * The Navy would spend $1.1 billion to buy 12 Boeing E/A-18G carrier-based electronic attack aircraft, down from $1.7 billion for 22 this year. * The Pentagon would spend $1.86 billion for new unmanned Predator and Reaper planes built by privately held General Atomics, up from $1.18 billion. * The Army would spend $1.25 billion on Boeing CH-47 helicopters, and $587 million on AH-64 Apache Longbow helicopters, also built by Boeing. * The Air Force budget includes $864 million to begin replacing its aging KC-135 refueling planes, a competition that pits Boeing against Northrop Grumman Corp and its European partner EADS. * The Pentagon would spend $3.4 billion to sustain the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle program in fiscal 2011 after adding $1 billion to complete the program this year. * The Pentagon also would spend $9.9 billion on ballistic missile defense programs, up from $9.2 billion. The funding includes $1.56 billion for Lockheed's Aegis missile defense system, $1.3 billion for the company's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system and $1.3 billion on a ground-based midcourse defense program run by Boeing. * The budget would spend $12.9 billion for munitions and missiles, including $1.2 billion for Trident II ballistic missiles built by Lockheed, more than $700 million for Standard and Tomahawk missiles made by Raytheon Co and $253 million for precision-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munitions made by Boeing. * The budget includes over $25 billion in procurement and research funding for Navy shipbuilding programs. These include$2.73 billion for a new carrier built by Northrop, $2.97 billion for DDG-51 Aegis destroyers built by Northrop and General Dynamics Corp and $5.4 billion for Virginia-class attack submarines, also built by GD and Northrop. * Spending on space programs totals $9.9 billion in the fiscal 2011 base budget and war supplemental budget, a decline of just under 1 percent from a year earlier. The request includes $911 million for a next-generation communications satellite built by Lockheed, $598 million for an additional Advanced Extremely High Frequency Satellite, also built by Lockheed and $1.2 billion for launch vehicles built by a Lockheed-Boeing joint venture.
