 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China's insurance regulator published detailed rules late on Sunday allowing insurers to invest in private equity and real estate. 

 Chinese insurers are allowed to invest up to 5 percent of their assets in private equity and 10 percent in real estate, according to rules published on the website of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CSRC). Total assets at Chinese insurers stood at 4.5 trillion yuan ($661 billion) at the end of the second quarter, meaning insurers may potentially invest more than 450 billion yuan into real estate and 220 billion yuan into private equity, the official Shanghai Securities News reported.
