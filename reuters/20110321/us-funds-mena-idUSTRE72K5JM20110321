 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa has driven fund managers away from the region and into energy. 

 Since mass protests in Tunisia began in January and spread through the region, outflows have soared, with more than $27 million withdrawn from equity funds tied to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region this year, according to fund tracker EPFR Global. Investors are trying to play against it by betting on the commodity tied to the region, oil. Crude prices have risen close to 15 percent since the protests in Tunisia began. "In our international accounts we eliminated our exposure to the Persian Gulf and MENA," said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors in Sarasota, Florida. And yet, "We are at our highest overweight in energy, oil gas, oil drilling, natural gas positions," accounting for almost 19 percent of the portfolio. Investors are hedging the geopolitical risk by increasing their exposure to assets that would benefit from rising commodity prices and weather inflationary pressures. With a United Nations-backed coalition now bombing sites in Libya as protests continue in nations like Bahrain, it remains an uncertain environment for investing. Donald Elefson, co-lead portfolio manager of the frontier fund at Harding Loevner Funds, has investments in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait and other Gulf countries, but he's not yet ready to do more buying until the situation stabilizes. He holds several Saudi-based investments, however, and is not paring those positions. "I am just flabbergasted about how much fear there is out there," he said. He added that in the $210 million fund, "there are some companies that if they have substantial business exposure to areas like Libya we may lighten up on those." BNP Paribas Investment Partners advised clients to go overweight commodity exporters such as Russia in currencies and sovereign bonds, and underweight importers like Turkey, which imports 95 percent of its total energy needs. Russian equity funds have benefited from rising oil prices, with net inflows of $486 million, marking a 15th straight week of inflows ending March 9. Russian equity fund net inflows are $2.7 billion year-to-date versus $3.48 billion for all of 2010, according to EPFR. Analysts say oil, gas and coal companies will continue to benefit from rising oil prices, currently above $100 per barrel of U.S. light sweet crude. However utility companies are likely to suffer as they will see "pressure from high fuel costs and difficulty in getting tariff hikes," BNP Paribas said in a report. "I like natural gas in the US, oil, exploration and drilling in companies which have standards of governance. I don't own anything in Venezuela or Russia," Kotok added. Barclays Capital has recommended investors to consider adding exposure to higher energy prices and heightened equity market volatility as a hedge against the risk that unrest in the Middle East does reach a tipping point. RBS Securities and Bank of America Merrill Lynch have also recommended to stay overweight energy as a hedge on geopolitical and inflation risk. "We tend to still think that instability in the Middle East will prove prolonged, oil prices will remain elevated and hence continue to recommend long stable oil credits, such as Russia," said Timothy Ash, emerging markets strategist at RBS Securities. Commodity sector funds - including equity-oriented ones and those holding physical commodities - have inflows of $4.5 billion this year, according to EPFR Global. Flows were strongest when tensions peaked in mid-February. Meanwhile, emerging market fund manager Jerome Booth at Ashmore Investment, with assets under management of $46.7 billion at the end of 2010, said the main way to hedge higher energy prices is to "exit the United States." "You would go long Russia, you wouldn't go short Turkey, but you go short United States," said Booth. "Or you would reduce your exposure to the United States and to other oil importing developed countries." One of the biggest risks to the global recovery would be sharply higher oil prices resulting from increased tensions in the region, and an earlier-than-expected global monetary tightening arising from stronger inflationary pressures. Many investors however will likely stay away from putting their money back to work in the Middle East and North Africa for an extended period. "Right now (the region) has a virus and the virus is creating infection," Kotok said. (Reporting by Manuela Badawy; Editing by Andrew Hay)
