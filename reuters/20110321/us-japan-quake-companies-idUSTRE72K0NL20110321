 (Reuters) - Following is a roundup of the impact of Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami on auto makers and electronics makers. 

 Plant shutdowns in Japan threaten supplies to manufacturers across the globe of everything from semiconductors to car parts. AUTO MAKERS * Toyota Motor Co has halted operations at its 12 main assembly plants in Japan. That closure has been extended to Tuesday (March 22), and will result in lost production of 95,000 vehicles. From Monday (March 21), Toyota had said it would begin making car parts at plants near its base in Toyota City, central Japan, for overseas assembly facilities. It had said it would resume this week making parts for service centers to repair vehicles already on the road. * Honda Motor Co is extending the production halt in Japan to Wednesday (March 23) from March 20. Honda's announcement came after the automaker distributed a memo to U.S. dealers saying it would review each dealers' product allotments for vehicles to be built after May. Honda made 69,170 cars in January in Japan, which accounts for around a quarter of its production. * Nissan Motor Co said Monday it resumed limited operations at five of its plants in Japan with vehicle production set to start Thursday. Nissan said production of repair parts for overseas manufacturing restarted at its Oppama, Tochigi, Yokohama, Kyushu and Nissan Shatai plants. Vehicle production will start Thursday and will continue while supplies last, the company said. Restoration of its Iwaki engine plant in northern Japan will take longer than the other plants, the company said. Nissan made 81,851 cars in January in Japan, where it manufactures 23 percent of its vehicles. Goldman Sachs has calculated that one day's lost production costs Nissan about 2 billion yen in profit. * Mazda Motor Corp said it plans to suspend production at two plants in southwestern Japan until Sunday (March 20), but has not yet decided how to proceed after that. * Fuji Heavy Industries Co said all five of its car and parts-related plants for its Subaru-brand vehicles in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, will be shut at least until Sunday. * Renault Samsung, the South Korean unit of French car maker Renault SA, said it will cut back on weekend and overtime production because of a potential parts shortage. * General Motors, the largest U.S. automaker, said it would temporarily idle its pick-up truck plant in Louisiana due to a parts shortage. GM's South Korean unit said it, too, was considering cutting back on weekend and overtime production. ELECTRONICS MAKERS: * Sony Corp said on Monday it planned to partially re-start a lithium ion battery factory in Tochigi prefecture on Tuesday, leaving six plants, which make an array of devices from IC cards to Blu-ray discs, closed. Sony is not sure when the plants will resume operations. Some of the plants' output is supplied to other manufacturers, including customers overseas. * Toshiba said on Monday output was still halted at a factory in Iwate prefecture making system LSI chips for microprocessors and image sensors. It has begun work to bring the factory back on-line, but has no timeframe to resume output. Toshiba said an assembly line at a plant in Japan making small liquid crystal displays for smartphones and other devices will be closed for a month to repair damaged machinery. * Canon said late on Friday production would be halted at all three domestic camera factories on Tuesday and at least two of them will remain closed on Wednesday. The world's largest maker of digital cameras said it was having difficulty securing necessary parts. * Nikon Corp said four of its production facilities were closed, including two of its precision-equipment plants, but the effect on cameras and lenses is seen as minor, since most output for those devices is in Thailand. Nikon does not have a timetable to re-open the plants. * Panasonic said none of its northern Japan manufacturing facilities, including those making optical pick-ups and other electronic parts, digital cameras and audio equipment, were badly damaged, but it would take time to resume operations as infrastructure needed to be restored. * Renesas, the world's No.5 chipmaker, said it has halted operations at 8 of its facilities and was unsure when it would restart production there. OTHERS * Shin-Etsu Chemical, the world's leading maker of silicon wafers, said two of its plants near the worst-hit areas remain offline. The firm has not said when it will restart operations. Some of the wafers made here are shipped to chip companies overseas. Shin-Etsu is trying to boost production elsewhere, particularly of 300-millimetre wafers, to make up the shortfall. * Jamco, a Japanese company making galleys for the long-awaited Boeing 787 Dreamliner, said delivery of the component could be delayed if gasoline becomes even more scarce.
