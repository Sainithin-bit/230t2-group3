 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The impact on the earnings of S&P 500 companies from Japan's natural disaster will be offset, and investors should use the pullback as a buying opportunity, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. 

 "We expect Japan to lower S&P (earnings per share) by less than 25 cents in the first quarter and 50 cents in the second quarter, some of which should be offset by better than expected US manufacturing activity and higher euro and oil prices," the analysts said in a note on Monday. BofA Merrill Lynch left its S&P 500 earnings per shares estimate for 2011 unchanged as a results. Investors should use the fall in stock prices to buy into the market as the impact of natural disasters are shallow providing the shocks from the disasters are short-lived, said BofA Merrill Lynch. The S&P 500 fell as much as 6.5 percent from a peak in February but has erased about half of those losses and traded up 1.5 percent by midday Monday. The analysts see a trading range for the S&P 500 between 1,250 and 1,400 in the first half of the year. "The latest events are likely to stress the lower end of our trading range, but at 1,250 we would expect to find strong buying," they said. In a note to clients in February, BofA Merrill Lynch raised its 2011 S&P 500 earnings estimate to $95 from $93, and its 2012 estimate to $102 from $99.
