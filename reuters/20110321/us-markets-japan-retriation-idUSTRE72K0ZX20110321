 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Talk is rampant the yen might gain from Japanese repatriation of overseas assets after the devastating earthquake. But when digging into the hard numbers and investment profiles of Japanese life insurers and insurers, the speculation looks to be a false alarm. 

 Expectations of Japanese fund repatriation was one factor driving the yen to a record high of 76.25 against the dollar this week. But several market players in Tokyo said Japanese insurers are unlikely to sell a large amount of foreign assets to procure cash for payouts to policyholders. "Any impact on the yen from Japanese repatriation will be limited," said Kimihiko Tomita, head of foreign exchange at State Street in Tokyo. WHY IS JAPANESE REPATRIATION EXPECTED? Given the extent of the damage from the earthquake and tsunami, the complete picture of which is still fully not known, market players are betting that Japanese insurance companies, both life and non-life, will have to pay out a huge amount of money to policyholders. Also helping such speculation was lesson from January 1995 when a major earthquake struck a city of Kobe in western Japan. The Kobe earthquake was followed by a surge in the yen to a high of 79.75 yen per dollar, a peak that had not been broken until this week, with the yen soaring some 25 percent in just three months. As Japanese investors bought a total of $1.25 trillion yen of foreign securities in 2005-2010, traders speculated some of their buying could be unwound. HAVE JAPANESE INSURANCE COMPANIES BOUGHT YEN SINCE THE QUAKE? Highly unlikely. There is a sporadic talk that Japanese banks have sold Treasuries, and some asset management firms sold foreign assets to prepare for withdrawal of funds from retail investors. But there is limited anecdotal evidences to back up Japanese repatriation. To the contrary, several FX traders in Tokyo cited some Japanese investors were buying the dollar, suggesting they view these levels as a good time to buy foreign assets. The general view emerging is that the dollar will probably bottom out around 78 yen, especially after Group of Seven industrialized nations joined Japan in intervening to weaken the currency on Friday. Many traders in Tokyo say the yen's surge to a record high of 76.25 yen this week is mostly driven by speculation about repatriation, along with forced stop-loss and option-related buying, rather than actual repatriation flows. WILL THERE BE REPATRIATION? Many traders doubt insurer repatriation will have a major impact in the currency market. The head of Japanese non-life insurers business lobby said this week that they have no need to sell foreign currency assets to pay for claims. Japanese insurers are expected to face much larger payouts than their payments of 78.3 billion yen ($1 billion) after the Kobe earthquake, given the extensive damage from the earthquake and tsunami. Makoto Kasai, an analyst at Citigroup Securities, estimates the total payouts could reach around 300 billion yen ($3.7 billion). Analysts note, however, that their payment will be spread over a long period of time and that they could borrow funds to finance some of their payments. Japanese non-life insurers' securities holding amount to 18 trillion yen, of which about 5 trillion yen ($61 billion) is foreign securities -- just over a quarter of their total holdings. If they finance all of their payments by selling securities, without changing their portfolio makeup -- seen as a highly unlikely scenario -- sales of foreign securities would be less than 100 billion yen, assuming total payout will be a few hundred billion yen. That is less than a third of Japan's monthly current account surplus of around 1 trillion yen ($12.2 billion) and certainly not a huge sum in the currency market, where $4 trillion changes hands every day. Some of their foreign securities holding are likely to be currency-hedged, so their sales of dollar and euro would be even smaller than the face amounts involved with the securities. And they have no reason to reduce foreign assets when Japan will have to deal with the heavy burden from the natural disaster and any fallout from the nuclear disaster, many traders say. WHAT ABOUT THE LIFE INSURERS? As for life insurers, any selling from them is likely to be even smaller. Japan's top four life insurers manage combined assets of more than 125 trillion yen and hold about 16 trillion yen ($196 billion) of foreign currency-denominated assets -- about one-eighth of their total assets. But more than a half of their foreign bonds are currency-hedged, so their currency exposure is around 6 trillion yen, or about just 5 percent of their total assets. Their total payouts after the Kobe earthquake was 48.8 billion yen, said Sumino Kamei, senior analyst at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. Even if they have to pay a few hundred billion yen this time, and even if they finance all of insurance payment by selling their assets, their selling in foreign currencies would be in the tune of 10-20 billion yen, assuming they keep their asset allocation unchanged. And in fact, a few traders said Japanese life insurers were buying the dollar and Australian dollar this week. In Reuters interviews conducted last year, all of the top four life insurers saw 75-80 yen as the bottom of the range for the dollar -- making it a zone where they would want to buy U.S. assets.
