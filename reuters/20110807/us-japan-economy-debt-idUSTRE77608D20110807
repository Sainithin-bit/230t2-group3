 TOKYO  (Reuters) - A senior Japanese government official said on Sunday that U.S. Treasury bonds remain an attractive investment target for Japan despite a downgrading of the U.S. sovereign debt rating. 

 "There is no change in Japan's trust in U.S. bonds," the official told reporters. Japan's foreign reserves stood at $1.15 trillion at the end of July, the bulk of which is thought to be in Treasuries, making it the second largest foreign holder of U.S. sovereign debt.
