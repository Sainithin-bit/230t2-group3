 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Equipment rental group United Rentals Inc ( URI.N ) said on Monday it terminated its $4 billion takeover by Cerberus Capital Management and asked Cerberus to pay United Rentals a $100 million termination fee. 

 On December 21, a court denied United Rentals' ability to force Cerberus Capital Management to complete the takeover. United Rentals said on Monday it will not be appealing the Delaware Chancery Court opinion. (Reporting by  Mark McSherry ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
