 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wyeth WYE.N said on Monday it will sue Teva Pharmaceuticals USA TEVA.O for alleged patent infringement and said it received an approvable letter from U.S regulators for bazedoxifene, a drug that helps prevent post-menopausal osteoporosis. 

 Wyeth claims that Teva's pantoprazole -- a generic version of Wyeth's Protonix -- infringes on a patent exclusively licensed to Wyeth. Protonix helps treat heartburn and other stomach ailments. The drug company also said it received a second approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for bazedoxifene, a selective estrogen receptor modulator.
