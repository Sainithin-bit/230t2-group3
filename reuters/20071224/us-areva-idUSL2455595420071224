 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's atomic energy regulator is prepared to sell shares in nuclear reactor maker Areva CEPFi.PA to help the regulator's financing, the head of the organization told newspaper La Tribune. 

 "Nothing has been fixed. It will all depend on the value of Areva," Alain Bugat, the head of the organization, said in an interview published on Monday. The French state holds just under 80 percent of Areva's capital. (Reporting by Nicolas Rialan; Editing by  David Holmes )
