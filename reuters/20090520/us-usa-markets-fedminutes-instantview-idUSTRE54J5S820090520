 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve saw modest improvements in the economic outlook at its April meeting, but mulled increasing purchases of mortgage agency and government securities in the future to give the recovery an additional push, minutes of the meeting showed on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * "Some members noted that a further increase in the total amount of purchases might well be warranted at some point to spur a more rapid pace of recovery," minutes of the April 28-29 meeting said. * "All members concurred with waiting to see how the economy and financial conditions respond to the policy actions already in train before deciding whether to adjust the size or timing of asset purchases," the Fed said. * In April, the Fed held its target for benchmark interest rates unchanged at close to zero and took no other actions to boost the amount of money in the economy by increasing the size of its balance sheet. COMMENTS: JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "The euro went straight up about 30 points, so that means there's nothing in the minutes that's very worrisome. Good news has been bad for the dollar -- we've been trading that theme for weeks now. You also have Treasuries shooting up, which compliments this, because it keeps rates low. I'd say the lack of any dire news or new concerns coupled with the possibility of more quantitative easing allays market fears." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "I think what initially sent (stocks) down was they talked about downgrading the economic forecast...(But) they talked about economic stability, housing beginning to stabilize, and while the near-term outlook is uncertain, the long-term outlook remains favorable. This was actually somewhat of a positive announcement." PAUL NOLTE, DIRECTOR OF INVESTMENTS, HINSDALE ASSOCIATES, HINDSDALE, ILLINOIS: "It sounds as though they are a little less excited about the economy then they were originally or as we were led to believe ... they are anticipating unemployment to be a little bit higher, GDP growth may be a little bit lower. It's certainly not encouraging of the green shoots that everybody else is talking about." DAVID BIANCO, CHIEF U.S. EQUITY STRATEGIST, UBS, NEW YORK: "I think everybody knows the worst-case scenarios for the economy are less likely and that we still have yet to see growth and when it comes, it'll probably be moderate. "The market has gotten to where it is because people have acknowledged those worst case scenarios for the economy. "That's been our view that the economy is stabilizing, although we're still in recession and we won't see positive growth for another quarter or so." MICHAEL POND, TREASURY AND INFLATION-LINKED STRATEGIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "The market is clearly keying off on a couple of comments made within the minutes made in the purchase program. If they buy more Treasuries that could support the Treasury market. It's working and they might need to do more." CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "Definitely they're still bearish on the economy but the main thing for the bond market is this line: 'Some members noted that a further increase in the total amount of purchases might well be warranted.'" MATT ESTEVE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER AT TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON DC: "The key thing we are taking away from the minutes is the commentary that some policy makers saw the need for buying more toxic assets and if that happens, the market is going to be flooded with dollars. That's why we are seeing this knee-jerk reaction of traders selling the dollars versus most major currencies." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "I'm surprised that the Fed is revising its GDP forecast, suggesting a deeper recession. It's a recognition of the magnitude of the first quarter decline. It also surprised me that the 2010 GDP revised downward, usually if the inventory is down so severely in the first quarter. The rebound is usually stronger on the other side. "Part of the GDP forecast downgrade is structural. The Fed has cut its outlook long-term. But it also increased its inflation forecast long-term. Part of inflation revisions is a recognition of the enormous deficit and stimulus. They will help growth now but weigh on it later. "The tone of the minutes is a little more optimistic, and the forecasts are a little more pessimistic. It's a wash." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes declined. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices rallied. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar weakened.
