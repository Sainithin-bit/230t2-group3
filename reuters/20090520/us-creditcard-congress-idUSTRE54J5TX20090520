 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to approve legislation to curb sudden credit card interest rate hikes and hidden fees, with President Barack Obama expected to sign it within days. 

 In an unusual procedural maneuver, the House cast a divided vote on the bill. As approved by the Senate on Tuesday, the bill includes a Republican amendment to let people carry guns in national parks, in addition to the credit card provisions. A separate House vote was planned on the gun amendment to allow opponents to go on record as opposing it. But the gun amendment was expected to pass as well allowing the entire bill to be sent to Obama for consideration. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
