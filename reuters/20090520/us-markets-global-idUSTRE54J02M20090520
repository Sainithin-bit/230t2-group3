 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury prices rose and the dollar fell further on Wednesday after news the Federal Reserve discussed in April increasing purchases of securities, a move that would weaken the world's reserve currency. 

 U.S. stocks fell late in the session on profit-taking in financial shares and a downward revision in the Fed's forecast for economic growth over the next three years. Oil rose more than 3 percent to hit a six-month high over $62 a barrel as government data showed a steep drop in U.S. crude and gasoline inventories ahead of the U.S. summer driving season. Gold rose to an eight-week high above $940 an ounce as the dollar slid and oil prices rallied, boosting the status of gold as an alternative investment. In Europe, stocks finished higher for a fifth straight day, led by commodity-related shares. Minutes from the latest Fed policy meeting in April showed that central bank officials had discussed buying more securities, including government debt, to help fuel a recovery in the recessionary U.S. economy. The Fed cut its 2009 forecast for gross domestic product and raised its unemployment rate outlook, tempering recent market optimism that the economy might be turning the corner. "The key thing we are taking away from the minutes is the commentary that some policymakers saw the need for buying more toxic assets, and if that happens, the market is going to be flooded with dollars," said Matt Esteve, a foreign exchange trader at Tempus Consulting in Washington. "That's why we are seeing this knee-jerk reaction of traders selling the dollars versus most major currencies." The euro shot up 1.11 percent at $1.3774, and the dollar fell against a basket of major currencies. The U.S. Dollar Index .DXY slipped 1.19 percent at 81.118. Against the yen, the dollar was down 1.35 percent at 94.71. U.S. Treasuries rallied after the Fed cited significant risks to the U.S. economy, which officials said could take five to six years or more to return to its long-run potential. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 14/32 in price to yield 3.19 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note added 3/32 to yield 0.83 percent. After leading U.S. stocks higher earlier in the session, financial stocks reversed course as investors booked profits. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) fell 3.3 percent to $136.44, and JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) down 3.5 percent to $34.55. The KBW Bank index .BKX lost 2.8 percent. Hedge fund T2 Partners LLC is selling financial stocks that have soared since March amid expectations the fallout from the mortgage crisis will produce more losses for banks, founder Whitney Tilson told Reuters this week. Technology shares also fell after Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ) tempered its outlook for 2009. The stock fell 5.2 percent and was the biggest drag on the Dow. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 52.81 points, or 0.62 percent, at 8,422.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 4.66 points, or 0.51 percent, at 903.47. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was off 6.70 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,727.84. Earlier, MSCI's main world stock index .MIWD00000PUS hit 245.32, a new 2009 high that reached levels last seen in November. The euro strengthened to its highest in more than four months on hopes of economic recovery and after U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said the financial system was "starting to heal." Geithner's comments were positive for risky trades as it suggested that the financial crisis was abating. Money flowed out of dollar-denominated deposits and back into higher-risk assets. European shares extended a winning streak to five days in a choppy session. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares closed up 0.4 percent at 875.85 points. The index, which slumped 45 percent in 2008, is about 35 percent higher from its lifetime low on March 9. Crude rose after the Energy Information Administration said U.S. crude oil and gasoline stockpiles fell sharply last week. U.S. crude rose $1.94 to settle at $62.04 a barrel, before trading up to a six-month high of $62.26 in post-settlement activity. London Brent traded up $1.67 to $60.59 a barrel. U.S. gold futures for June delivery settled up $10.70 at $937.40 an ounce in New York. "Oil has reached the $60 mark. That is obviously a bellwether and a key for commodities in general, so gold is taking a cue from the strength in oil," said Brian Hicks, a portfolio manager at U.S. Global Investors. The weakness of the greenback, which makes gold and other dollar-denominated commodities cheaper for non-U.S. investors, sparked technical buying in the yellow metal, traders said. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was nearly unchanged while the Nikkei share average  .N225  edged up 0.6 percent despite the worst-ever contraction in Japan's economy in the first quarter.
