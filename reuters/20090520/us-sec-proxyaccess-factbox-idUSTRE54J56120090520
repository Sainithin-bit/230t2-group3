 (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is considering ways to give shareholders easier access to the annual corporate proxies that are used to nominate board directors. 

 The SEC's proposal would set ownership thresholds linked to the size of the company, limit the number of nominees by one shareholder and require certification that a shareholder is not attempting to change control of the company. The SEC will solicit suggestions and comments from Wall Street, shareholder activists, academic experts and others before deciding whether to finalize the proposal. SHAREHOLDER REQUIREMENTS: * Must own at least 1 percent of voting securities of company with market value over $700 million, or of a registered investment company with net assets over $700 million. * Must own at least 3 percent of company with market value of $75 million to $700 million, or of registered investment company with net assets of $75 million to $700 million. * Must own at least 5 percent of company with market value under $75 million, or of a registered investment company with net assets under $75 million. * Shareholders can aggregate holdings to meet thresholds. * Shareholders must have held shares for at least one year. NUMBER OF DIRECTOR NOMINEES: * Shareholder can nominate no more than one nominee, or up to 25 percent of the company's board of directors, whichever is greater. * Examples: if board has three members, one shareholder nominee could be included; if board has eight members, up to two nominees could be included. DISCLOSURES BY SHAREHOLDER: * Nominating shareholder must file with the SEC a Schedule 14N to disclose amount and percentage of securities owned, length of ownership, and intent to hold stake through the date of company's annual meeting. * Schedule 14N also requires certification that the shareholder is not seeking to change control of company or gain more than minority representation on the board of directors. * Company must include in its proxy materials disclosures about the nominating shareholder, as well as the shareholder nominee or nominees. This information is similar to disclosures now required in a contested election. SHAREHOLDER LIABILITY: * Nominating shareholder or group would be liable for any false or misleading statements in information given to the company for inclusion in proxy. * Company not responsible for information provided by shareholder, unless it has reason to know information is false. COMPANY GOVERNING DOCUMENTS: * SEC would narrow the Exchange Act law's so-called "election exclusion," which now lets companies reject shareholder proposals related to board elections. The agency would require companies to allow shareholder proposals to amend a company's governing documents for nomination procedures. * Shareholders could propose board election changes if they held at least $2,000 in market value or 1 percent, whichever is less, of company's securities for at least one year.
