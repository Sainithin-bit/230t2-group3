 DUESSELDORF/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The German state of North-Rhine Westphalia is prepared to contribute about 150 million euros ($203.9 million) to bridge financing for General Motors unit Opel, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 The four German states in which Opel has plants would account for about half of the total 1.5 billion euros worth of bridge financing, the person said on Wednesday. (Reporting by Matthias Inverardi, Writing by Maria Sheahan)
