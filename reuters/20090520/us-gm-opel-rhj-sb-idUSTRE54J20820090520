 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Private equity investor RHJ ( RHJI.BR ) will make an offer for General Motors' ( GM.N ) German carmaker Opel, a source with direct knowledge of the matter said on Wednesday. 

 The source said the offer would give General Motors a substantial stake in the business. Fiat ( FIA.MI ) and Magna International MGa.TO are also expected to make bids for Opel, which GM is spinning off with other European operations into a separate unit.
