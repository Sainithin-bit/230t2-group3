 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) on Wednesday reported a surprise quarterly profit as cost cuts offset softer sales at the operator of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains. 

 Net income came in at $2.6 million, or 1 cent a share, in the first quarter ended May 2, compared with $96.8 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to post a loss of 3 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales fell 10.4 percent to $1.725 billion. Limited shares were up 34 cents at $12 in after-hours trading, after closing at $11.66 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday. Months ago, the retailer vowed aggressive cost-cutting. The recession has hurt Limited Brand's sales of non-essential items as shoppers try to save. Sales at stores open for at least a year fell 7 percent in the first quarter. Limited is based in Columbus, Ohio. (Reporting by  Dhanya Skariachan )
