 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A wider range of firms are interested in becoming part of the select group that trades debt directly with the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Treasury, but the central bank will likely discourage those it doesn't think are in it for the long-haul. 

 The ranks of so-called primary dealers have been decimated as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Countrywide and Merrill Lynch dropped off in the crisis-driven reshaping of Wall Street last year. At the same time, the crisis has made a primary dealership more appealing to a broader variety of firms. It offers both the potential to profit as trillions of dollars of new government debt hit the market to fund the economic rescue and direct access to the Fed's emergency lending programs. It is rare for more than one firm to seek to become a primary dealer at any one time. The sudden surge in interest over the past year is a marked change from a couple of years ago; in 2007, three firms withdrew their names from the primary dealers' list at a time when there was less underwriting business to go around. Now, the Fed will likely want to be sure new dealers are not planning to drop their status once profit opportunities start to wane or when the emergency facilities are no longer needed, experts said. "The Fed likely will want to make sure that whoever they approve as a primary dealer is in it for the long run," said Ernest Patrikis, a former first vice president of the New York Fed and now partner at law firm White & Case. "I think they are going to be a little bit more cautious about that." RBS Greenwich economist Stephen Stanley agreed. "The Fed doesn't want to just give a free pass to those who want to take part in Treasury auctions and buybacks. They have to be able to really make markets and it takes a while to build up enough of a reputation and relationships to be effective in that." Nevertheless, analysts said the Fed is likely to soon add some new dealers. In a February report, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee said that a larger primary dealer community would help to reduce "the possibility of an undersubscribed auction." Futures and options broker MF Global and Japanese bank Nomura confirmed earlier this year that they were in talks with the Fed about becoming primary dealers, but have given no updates since then. Speculation that a number of firms are preparing for primary dealer status has swirled on trading desks as colleagues and competitors have been hired away. Toronto Dominion Bank, for example, has been subject to such speculation after the Canadian bank hired veteran rates trader Jim O'Brien from Morgan Stanley. Royal Bank of Canada and mid-market U.S. investment bank Jefferies have also reportedly registered their interest with the Fed. More firms now have access to expertise that once eluded them, as suffering primary dealers have laid off some of their most experienced staff or have been unable to offer them incentives to stay. But those hurdles may not stay low for long. "It is highly likely that you'll see those competitive barriers go up again as primary dealers try to ringfence their franchises," Russ Certo, managing director of the rates group at Broadpoint Descap. Apart from expertise, there are a number of other tough conditions firms that wish to be primary dealers have to fulfill in order to make the grade. They have to be already actively trading in the market, have a good reputation, sophisticated trading systems and market data, and, importantly, sufficient capital standards. A primary dealer is required to make bids or offers in the Fed's open market operations and to take part in U.S. Treasury securities auctions. The Fed also consults regularly with primary dealers as it gathers market intelligence and needs to be sure it is getting the best possible information. On the capital side, the Fed's requires that commercial banking institutions meet the minimum Tier I and Tier II capital standards under the Basle Capital Accord, while registered broker/dealers must have capital in excess of the Securities and Exchange Commission's or Treasury's warning levels as well as at least $50 million in regulatory capital. These requirements, posted on the New York Fed's website, have not been updated since the early 1990s, and lawyers said the Fed may look to tweak them to take into account changes in the industry as it vets potential primary dealers.
