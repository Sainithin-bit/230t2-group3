 (Reuters) - RHJ International will make an offer for General Motors Corp's European car maker Opel, a source told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 Below are key facts about the Belgian-listed holding company. RIPPLEWOOD, GERMAN LINK The company was founded in June 2004 by Timothy Collins, who also founded U.S. private equity group Ripplewood in 1995. Collins is RHJI's largest shareholder with 15.2 percent of the stock. He is also the chairman of its investment and strategy committee. RHJI Chief Executive Leonhard Fischer joined the group from Credit Suisse in 2007 after a colleague was chosen for the top job there. He had been behind the Swiss bank's auction of insurance arm Winterthur, now part of Axa. Fischer is well-versed in German politics, something that could give him an edge in discussing government subsidies for Opel. FOCUS ON JAPAN, AUTOMOTIVE RHJI has historically invested heavily in Japan and also focused on the automotive parts sector. It has expressed an interest to diversify geographically, particularly into Europe, and also push deeper into financial services. Its strategy is generally to buy businesses that are "under-managed" but that possess strong growth potential. So its businesses are in various stages of improvement and expansion. KEY HOLDINGS Its subsidiaries are: Asahi Tec Corp (60.18 percent stake) - Japanese cast auto parts maker Niles Co Ltd (95.3 percent) - Automotive switch manufacturer Honsel International Technologies SA (81.8 percent) - German cast auto parts maker Columbia Music Entertainment Inc (25.5 percent) - Japanese music entertainment group Phoenix Seagaia Resort (100 percent) - Japanese resort complex Its associates (significant interest but no control) are: Shaklee Global Group Inc (40.7 percent) - Japanese nutrition, personal care, air/water treatment products. U-Shin Ltd (20.0 percent) - Japanese auto components manufacturer, such as door locks, heater control panels. BRUSSELS LISTING RHJI floated on Euronext Brussels at 19.25 euros per share in March 2005. The shares were trading at 3.95 euros on Wednesday. The company had intended to float in Japan, but opted in the end for Belgium, where a number of holding companies are based due to favorable tax treatment. RHJI employs about 40 people, principally in Brussels, Zurich and Tokyo. (Compiled by Philip Blenkinsop in Brussels and Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; editing by Simon Jessop)
