 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from the testimony of U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to the Senate Banking Committee on Wednesday about the Troubled Assets Relief Program. 

 GEITHNER ON GOVERNMENT INFLUENCE ON DECISIONS BY AUTO MAKERS: "We are trying very carefully not to be involved in those decisions. We think those are the decisions for the board and management of these companies. Our job is to make sure that the overall plan leaves these companies in a position where over the longer term they are going to emerge viable. That's what we are focused on and that's what we are trying to facilitate." GEITHNER ON WHETHER FED, IF MADE SYSTEMIC RISK REGULATOR, MIGHT SUBORDINATE BANK REGULATORY OR MONETARY POLICY FUNCTIONS TO SYSTEM RISK REGULATION: "I don't think there is a significant risk of that, and I would not want to take that risk." ON LOOKING AT FED STRUCTURE AS PART OF REGULATORY OVERHAUL: "As part of regulatory reform ... we're going to have to take a comprehensive look at every aspect of our system. "Where there are appearances of conflict or actual conflicts, we're going to have to a very careful look at those." GEITHNER ON AIG CLAIMS: "We do not have the authority as a government and came into this crisis without the authority to intervene to manage better the risk posed to the economy by an institution such as AIG. Our system did not prevent taking too much risk and did not have the authority to manage its unwinding in a careful, measured way. "That make it incredibly difficult for us to negotiate effectively to reduce the value of those claims. We have no option now to selectively diminish the value of those claims without taking risk. I don't believe that the system today can withstand the effects of a failure of this institution to meet its obligations. I wish it were not the case, nothing would make me happier." GEITHNER ON UNWINDING GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION: "In my statement today I am not going to talk about ... exit strategy, but I want to say I agree very much with you that one of the biggest challenges we face, not just on the fiscal front but also in the financial sector, is how we set the foundation for walking back and unwinding. And doing that carefully and well will be one of the most important things facing us." "Crises this severe don't burn themselves out. To fix them requires the action of government. But for the thing to work there needs to be (credible limits) to walk this back and unwind it as quickly as conditions permit. That is central to the effectiveness of the strategy ... I'm not prepared to talk to that today. It is not quite time yet. We're not quite there yet." GEITHNER ON CONSERVING FINANCIAL BAILOUT FUND RESOURCES: "We still face a very challenging economic and financial environment, and we need to be careful to preserve substantial resources and flexibility to deal with future contingencies." GEITHNER ON BANK CAPITAL NEEDS: "It's very important that financial institutions take advantage of the recent modest improvement in markets to strengthen their institutions and raise capital." GEITHNER ON BANK CAPITAL: "Currently, the vast majority of banks have more capital than they need to be considered well capitalized by their regulators. However, concerns about economic conditions -- combined with the destabilizing impact of distressed 'legacy assets' -- have created an environment under which uncertainty about the health of individual banks has sharply reduced lending across the financial system, working against economic recovery." "A key component of any credible program to restore confidence to the financial system and get credit flowing again is to recapitalize the banking system, ensuring that the largest banks in the country have sufficient capital so they can support lending, even in a more severe economic scenario." GEITHNER ON FUNDS REMAINING IN FINANCIAL RESCUE FUND: "Treasury estimates that there is at least $123.7 billion in resources authorized under EESA (the $700 billion financial rescue package) still available." "Because the most relevant consideration is what funds will remain available for new programs, we believe that our estimates are conservative for two reasons. First, our estimates assume 100 percent take-up of the $220 billion made available for our housing and liquidity programs, which require significant voluntary participation from financial participants. If any of those programs experience less than full take-up, additional funds will be available. Secondly, our projections anticipate only $25 billion will be paid back under CPP (Capital Purchase Program) over the next year, a figure lower than many private analysts expect." GEITHNER ON AUTO SECTOR RESTRUCTURING: "As the President has made clear, this restructuring process will require sacrifice by all stakeholders in the auto industry, including auto workers, debt and equity investors, dealers, suppliers, and the communities in which they operate." "Through the Task Force, we will continue to work with GM and its stakeholders in the lead up to the June 1 deadline. We will also continue our significant efforts to ensure that financing is available to creditworthy dealers and to pursue efforts to help boost domestic demand for cars."
