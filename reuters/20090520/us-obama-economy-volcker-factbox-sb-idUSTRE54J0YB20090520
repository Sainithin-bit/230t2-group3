 (Reuters) - A panel of experts tapped by President Barack Obama to help shape his response to the economic crisis is led by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker. 

 Moving into the spotlight after playing a behind-the-scenes role, the 16-member board meets at the White House on Wednesday in the first of what are expected to be quarterly gatherings. The group includes Democrats and Republicans from a variety of backgrounds, including business, labor and academia. The meeting, scheduled for 10:00 a.m., will be open to the media and carried via a live video stream on the White House website. Austan Goolsbee, a longtime Obama adviser, is the board's staff director and chief economist. Goolsbee is also a member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Below is a list of the advisers and their backgrounds. * PAUL VOLCKER, former Federal Reserve Chairman. Volcker is credited with conquering runaway inflation in the early 1980s through interest-rate increases that also led to a recession. He was named to the Fed in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter and served throughout much of the Reagan administration until he was replaced by Alan Greenspan in 1987. Volcker, a Democrat, was a key adviser to Obama during his presidential campaign.
