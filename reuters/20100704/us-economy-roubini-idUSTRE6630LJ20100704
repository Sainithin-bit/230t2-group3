 AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France  (Reuters) - Euro zone growth in 2010 could be "closer to zero" after a volatile second quarter threatens to dash previous estimates of 1 percent, U.S. economist Nouriel Roubini said on Sunday. 

 The currency bloc does not face a double-dip recession, however, despite deteriorating financial-market confidence over economic growth in an age of fiscal austerity, Roubini told a conference in Aix-en-Provence. "Given the shocks of the last few month s... by year-end, euro zone growth could be closer to zero percent," said Roubini, who has been nicknamed "Doctor Doom" for his pessimistic forecasts. He said his previous estimate of 1 percent was similar to forecasts by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The past three months' stock-market correction, rising credit spreads and a jittery inter-bank lending market suggested there were serious concerns over economic growth at a global level, said Roubini. Growth in the U.S. economy could slow in the second half of this year to 1.5 percent from 3 percent in the first, he said. "For the global economy, by year-end, the picture is not a very nice one," said Roubini. (Reporting by Lionel Laurent, editing by Will Waterman)
