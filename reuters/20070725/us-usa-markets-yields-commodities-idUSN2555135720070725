 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Strong global demand for commodities, including food, could boost inflation and send Treasury bond yields marching higher even though U.S. economic growth has slowed. 

 While higher energy prices in the first half of 2007 may constrain consumer spending, curb economic growth, and so keep Treasury yields low, the longer term inflation outlook is worrisome for bonds and could send yields up, analysts warn. With China's economic growth accelerating to 11.0 percent per annum recently, demand for grains, metals and energy could eventually push inflation higher in the U.S. and see bond yields rise. "There is a different globalization process that could affect inflation here in the U.S. and ultimately Treasury yields," said William Sullivan, chief economist at JVB Financial Group in Boca Raton, Florida. "I don't think history provides an adequate guide for going ahead how Treasury yields may be influenced, because of the strength we see in emerging markets including China and India and the rest of Asia," Sullivan said. Crude oil prices rose back to near record levels around $76 dollars a barrel this month, while the demand for alternative fuels, like ethanol, made from corn in the U.S., helped to drive corn prices to 10 year highs earlier this year. "You are seeing increased demand for corn through ethanol and also a shift from corn to soy beans and barley and passthrough effects into animal feed," said Scott Brown, chief economist with Raymond James & Associates in St Petersburg, Florida. With the prospects for higher food prices, "overall, inflation does present the threat of higher yields on longer dated Treasuries over time," Brown said. Copper prices saw an all time high last year also, driven by five years of steady global economic growth led by China. Copper, still seen as a gauge of global economic growth prospects and which is widely used in construction, is one example of how inflation pressures coming from abroad may persist despite U.S. economic weakness. "There are historically high quotes for copper against the backdrop of the worst housing recession in a generation. How can copper prices be so high?," asks Sullivan. "Because of the international environment: the global economy remains very strong." The U.S. dollar's slide to its lowest levels in 15 years against major currencies this year is also boosting the cost of imported food and fuels in the United States. But with the weakening housing market dragging on U.S. economic growth, some analysts now expect a milder version of the inflation and faltering economic growth seen in the 1970s and 1980s. "There is a whiff of stagflation in the air," said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, New Jersey. Stagflation refers to persistent inflation pressures combined with slow economic growth. This time, the phenomenon could be headline inflation that is too stubbornly high for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates and below trend economic growth. Long maturity bond yields, which respond closely to inflation prospects, could still rise as a result, even against the backdrop of feeble economic growth, economists say, as inflation pressures erode bond values over time. Such rising inflation prospects may push the benchmark 10-year Treasury note's yield back to its five year highs above 5.30 percent hit in mid-June, from 4.90 percent on Wednesday. That would still be a far cry from the all-time high of 15.84 percent seen on the U.S. 10-year reached in September 1981 when inflation was rampant, the Federal Reserve was raising interest rates, and the U.S. economy succumbed to recession. That three-decade old specter of stagflation is unlikely to return, but a less dramatic version that some analysts have coined "sagflation" or "stagflation-lite" may be around the corner. "The Fed has defined 2 percent as its upper inflation band," Kotok said. "If the economy were to slow to 1.5 to 2 percent and inflation were to be 3 percent, that would be a modern version of stagflation," Kotok said. "It is milder in terms of lower numbers than in the 1970s and 80s," Kotok said. "But what it feels like is another matter, because right now the bite coming out of disposable income is exacerbated by energy and food," he said. U.S. gross domestic product growth slowed to 0.7 percent on an annual basis in the first quarter of 2007 but is expected to recover to around 3.2 percent in the second quarter in data due to be reported on Friday this week. For consumers as a whole, expensive gasoline and food may hurt, boosting inflation expectations and workers demands for higher wages. "If you don't eat and drive that's not a problem," Kotok said. One indication that U.S. government bond investors' long term inflation expectations are rising is growing demand for Treasury Inflation Protected Securities or TIPS. An auction on Tuesday's of $6 billion of 20-year reopened TIPS "saw its strongest underwriting in its 3-year history with large institutional participation," noted bond strategists with Jefferies & Co. in New York in a research note.
