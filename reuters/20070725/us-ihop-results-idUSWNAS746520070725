 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IHOP Corp. IHP.N, which earlier this month said it would buy bar-and-grill chain Applebee's International Inc. APPB.O for $1.9 billion, reported a rise in quarterly earnings on Wednesday, helped by higher prices and lower expenses. 

 Second-quarter net income was $14.1 million, or 82 cents per share, compared with $10.3 million, or 56 cents, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting the pancake restaurant operator to earn 60 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company reported quarterly revenue of $89.5 million, beating analysts' expectations of $88.5 million. IHOP said its quarterly sales at stores open at least a year rose 2.5 percent and that it expects full-year same-store sales growth of 2 to 4 percent. IHOP said it remains comfortable with its existing 2007 outlook on such things as franchise growth but that it is suspending its full-year earnings view as it does not take into account the effect of the Applebee's deal. Analysts on average expected the company to post a full-year profit of $2.62 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
