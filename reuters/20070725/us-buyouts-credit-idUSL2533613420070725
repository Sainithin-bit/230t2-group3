 LONDON  (Reuters) - The rout in global credit markets in the past six weeks has many worried that the flow of leveraged buyouts that have supported equity markets will slow or dry up, but surprisingly so far, there is little sign of this happening. 

 Buyout volume has nearly doubled year-over-year since credit fears started to emerge, reaching $184 billion globally from June 18 through July 24 from $98 billion in the same period in 2006, according to research firm Dealogic. Meanwhile, European high-yield credit spreads as measured by the iTraxx Crossover index have nearly doubled and over 25 loan and bond financings have been put on ice. UK health and beauty chain Alliance Boots AB.UL is facing a stiff test in raising 9 billion pounds to back its buyout, Europe's largest. Equity markets and private equity firms clearly still believe LBOs are possible. On Tuesday, shares in Dutch supermarket group Laurus LAUR.AS jumped as much as 20 percent as traders cited buyout talk and steel services company Ryerson Inc ( RYI.N ) agreed to go private, even as credit market turmoil continued. Canadian telecoms company BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ) is being bought in the largest buyout ever, a deal that was announced on June 30. But ambitions are set to be scaled back and leverage may be reduced from the dizzying levels reached in recent months, a consequence of the repricing of risk under way in the credit markets. "I think the first half will undoubtedly be the peak (in buyout volume)," Marek Gumienny, managing director at Candover ( CDI.L ), the private equity firm planning to buy Dutch industrial group Stork VMFN.AS, said on Wednesday in an interview with Reuters. "The main issue is the amount of debt stuck with underwriters, which could have an effect on deals going forward. We've heard rumors that some banks have shut up shop for the summer -- no more credit," he said. But Gumienny said overall financing conditions were moving just "from great to very good" and that terms for new deals had only moved back to where they were six to nine months ago. "'Mega-cap' LBOs of 20 billion euros plus are off the table until the existing pipeline of loans can be re-priced and placed," European equity analysts at UBS wrote in a note to clients. However, "medium-term, we are still optimistic that large LBOs will re-emerge." "Record amounts of private equity capital are being raised alongside new listed private equity vehicles," they wrote. "This still needs to be deployed." "Our expectation is for the emergence of the less leveraged buyout," UBS said. CREDIT STILL AVAILABLE, AT A PRICE The $1.875 billion high-yield bond sale for investment-fund owned power generator InterGen shows that the credit market is not closed -- albeit at a price -- and also why borrowers and buyers might go ahead and pay higher financing costs rather than pull deals. First, things may not get better. "Are the debt capital markets going to be stronger or more stable next week or next month? As they are currently driven by investor sentiment rather than fundamentals, no one can be sure," said Gareth Noonan, a managing director for leveraged finance capital markets at Merrill Lynch, which managed the InterGen bond sale. Second, there is a huge amount of work that is put into deals before they become public. "InterGen was committed to accessing the debt capital markets and capitalizing on the time and effort invested in the process," Noonan said. Baring Asset Management noted that lower-quality debt was still being issued. "It is clear that companies will have to pay more for their debt in light of the recent jolt to credit markets. However, banks are still willing to lend and investors still appear willing to buy," said Andrew Cole, director of asset allocation at Barings. But others are more gloomy and say the credit and loan markets still have the capacity to shock equity investors. "The largest risk for the credit markets is one where some of the announced-but-not-complete private equity deals fall through," credit strategists at Dresdner Kleinwort said in a note. "The equity market is vulnerable to this kind of risk, and currently underestimating it." (Additional reporting by  Jeffrey Goldfarb )
