 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. ( BUD.N ) reported higher second-quarter profit on Wednesday, matching expectations, as the brewer benefited from higher prices, increased productivity and strong sales of imported brands such as Tsingtao and Corona. 

 The brewer of Budweiser and Bud Light, which also distributes a number of InBev's INTB.BR European brands in the United States, said it was on track for earnings to accelerate in the second half of the year, and maintained that 2007 earnings growth would be higher than its long-term target of 7 percent to 10 percent. The No. 1 U.S. brewer also raised its quarterly dividend. Anheuser, which has sought to diversify through deals with InBev, Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), energy drink maker Hansen Natural Corp. HANS.O and Grolsch GROLc.AS, said net income rose 6 percent to $677 million, or 88 cents per share, from $638 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain of 1 cent per share from selling its stake in a Spanish theme park, the company met analysts' average estimate of 87 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Anheuser shares, which had gained roughly 2 percent over the past year, closed up 47 cents, or 1 percent, to $49.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said its upbeat outlook was based on its ability to raise prices, its broadened U.S. beer portfolio, and improved productivity that is offsetting higher raw materials costs. The St. Louis-based company has been facing stiff competition from imported beers and upmarket brews from small local breweries. Its popular Bud Light has been suffering from lower sales versus rivals such as Heineken Premium Light and Corona Light. What's more, many U.S. consumers have been moving away from beer toward wine and other spirits. The company said its share of the U.S. beer market fell slightly to 48.8 percent from 48.9 percent a year ago. BY THE NUMBERS Net sales rose to $4.52 billion from $4.26 billion. U.S. beer shipments to wholesalers gained 2.3 percent to 27.5 million barrels in the quarter, while sales to retailers increased 0.1 percent. Anheuser raised its quarterly dividend to 33 cents from 29.5 cents per share. The dividend is payable on September 10 to shareholders of record on August 9. Before the earnings report, the stock was trading at 17.5 times earnings estimates for the full year, a slight premium to rival Molson Coors Brewing Co. ( TAP.N ), which has a price-to-earnings ratio of 17.1. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by J.S. Benkoe)
