 LONDON  (Reuters) - Life insurer Resolution has agreed on an 8.6 billion pound ($18 billion) all-share merger with Friends Provident, almost doubling its size and marrying its cash with the sales potential of its rival. 

 Britain's two smallest bluechip life insurers, which announced talks just two days ago, confirmed Resolution shareholders would own 50.9 percent of the new group. Resolution, which has so far focused on consolidating closed life funds, will also get the top two management roles. Shareholders in Friends will retain their shares in the group -- to be renamed Friends Financial -- while Resolution investors will get 3.25 new Friends Financial shares for each one owned, effectively a slight premium at current prices. Analysts said the deal to create the fifth-largest UK-listed life insurer was positive for Resolution, which has almost doubled in size every year for the past three years, but questioned the value for Friends, which they said could have raised cash on the market to fund its growth. They also queried the value of a nil-premium deal for Friends investors, reviving nagging speculation of a counterbid. "This is a much better deal for Resolution than it is for Friends Provident," analyst Charles Graham at Evolution said in a research note to clients. Analysts said the deal values Friends at just over 1.1 times its embedded value -- a discount to the UK sector average of around 1.3 to 1.4 times. "If the appeal of this deal to Resolution is the opportunity it gives them to grow new business from Friends Provident's solid platform, it is paying a very low price for it," he said. At Wednesday's closing price of 194.1 pence, Friends is almost 14 percent below its 2001 IPO price of 225 pence. "(Friends) seem to have given away control without getting much of a premium," analyst Youssef Ziai at ABN AMRO said. "There has to be a chance that someone else will feel they can improve on the offer." COUNTER-BIDDERS? Resolution shares fell 2.38 percent to 616 pence. Its entrepreneurial founder Clive Cowdery will become chairman of the new company, and its chief executive, Mike Biggs, will have the same role at new firm. Friends Chief Executive Philip Moore will become deputy chief executive. Friends has been burning cash to write new business and seal a leading market share in group pensions amid a slowdown in its cash-generating protection market. The insurer said it had considered options over months but was not forced into a deal. "This is not about short-term cash flow," Moore told analysts. "This is about the opportunity to build something much bigger, much better, much more value creating than we could have done on our own." Moore said a counteroffer "remains possible" but that the value of the tie-up with Resolution would be hard to beat. Private equity bidders such as JC Flowers and industry giants such as French giant AXA and Italy's Generali have all been named as possible buyers for Friends. "Any nil-premium merger will be vulnerable to a premium takeout. The question is does anybody want to do it?" one banker close to the insurers said, adding both trade and financial suitors seemed unlikely. "The problem Friends is addressing is they have no cash flow. And it's cash flow financial bidders want." A source close to the matter confirmed earlier this week that Flowers had looked at Friends but said that did not mean he would make a move: "I'm not sure the numbers work." AXA, which has a 16 percent stake in Friends held largely via a subsidiary according to its annual report, has declined to comment on its interest. The two firms said the deal would generate at least 100 million pounds in annualized pretax cost savings and synergies by the end of 2010. The two sides declined to comment on possible job losses. "I think the only surprise on the upside will be the cost synergies. I think people were expecting there weren't going to be any," Peter Eliot at Man Securities said. Resolution and Friends also plan to combine Resolution Asset Management (RAM) with F&C Asset Management, which is 51 percent owned by Friends Provident, on terms to be agreed with F&C. They expect F&C, which rose 0.9 percent, to remain separately listed. ** For a separate story on F&C, please click on (Additional reporting by  Mark Potter ,  Simon Challis  and  Mathieu Robbins )
