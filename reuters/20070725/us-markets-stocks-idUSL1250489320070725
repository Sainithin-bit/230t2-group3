 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in volatile trading on Wednesday as a 3 percent rise in oil prices lifted energy shares while strong profits from Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) countered market concerns about merger financing. 

 Boeing shares jumped to a record high and led advancers on the Dow, while Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc. ( AMZN.O ) paced the Nasdaq with a 24-percent rise after tripling its profit. U.S. oil prices jumped to $75.88 a barrel after government data showed that crude stocks fell last week. Shares of energy companies followed, with Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) rising 2.2 percent on the day to $92.79. Earlier news that Chrysler Group had postponed a $12 billion loan to finance the private equity deal to buy the company from DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE aroused concerns that the widening fallout from the subprime mortgage industry was spreading to credit markets. The session was marked by volatility following Tuesday's selloff, when stock indexes posted their worst one-day performance in four months, fueled by worries about the widening fallout from the subprime mortgage industry on credit markets. "If you add up the earnings picture, there's no reason to think we should be falling off a cliff and need a fall-off like we had (Tuesday)," said Peter Dunay, investment strategist at Leeb Capital Management Inc. in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 68.12 points, or 0.50 percent, to end at 13,785.07. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 7.05 points, or 0.47 percent, at 1,518.09. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 8.31 points, or 0.31 percent, at 2,648.17. After the closing bell, shares of iPod and iPhone maker Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) rose 2.4 percent to $140.50. The stock was among the top advancers on the Nasdaq during the regular session, rising 1.8 percent to $137.26. The company reported earnings that beat expectations and said lower component prices and more sales from company-owned stores were behind a rise in profit margins.  During regular trading, Boeing rose 3.3 percent to end at $107.23, after hitting $107.80 earlier, while Amazon.com climbed 24.5 percent to $86.18. The American Stock Exchange index of oil companies  .XOI  rose 1.13 percent. Takeovers have contributed to the market's steady climb, but signs that financing for such deals may dry up as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis have made investors jittery. Besides the Chrysler news, Alliance Boots AB.UL has postponed syndication of the 5.05 billion pounds ($10.4 billion) of senior debt backing its leveraged buyout, Europe's largest ever, a source familiar with the situation told the Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. "Any news in the market right now that loans are not getting done or that credit spreads are jumping higher or that investors are becoming more risk averse is likely to have an impact," said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist with New York brokerage Spencer Clarke. Stocks showed little reaction to economic news, including the Federal Reserve's Beige Book summary, which said U.S. economic activity expanded further in June and early July. Another report from the National Association of Realtors showed existing-homes sales hit a lower-than-expected 5.75 million unit annual rate while prices and inventories remained flat. Trading was heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, with about 2.04 billion shares changing hands, above last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion. On Nasdaq, about 2.53 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Despite the higher close, declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 19 to 13 on the NYSE and by 16 to 13 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Herbert Lash )
