 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has opened up several investigations into whether borrowers faced discriminated by providers of mortgages and other credit products, an official told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday. 

 Grace Becker, deputy assistant attorney general in the civil rights division, told congressional lawmakers that the department opened investigations after studying lending data and receiving referrals from bank regulatory agencies. "For the investigations that are ongoing, we continue to evaluate whether enforcement action is appropriate," Becker said at a House Financial Services subcommittee on oversight and investigations hearing on fair lending practices under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HDMA). "We expect to initiate more investigations in the coming months," she said, adding that the department has already closed two cases. Becker did not identify the targets of the investigations. The Federal Reserve said since January cases involving two nationwide mortgage lenders were recently referred to the Justice Department because evidence suggested Hispanic and African-American borrowers paid more for their loans than white borrowers. Sandra Braunstein, the Fed's director of consumer and community affairs, said the central bank also referred three other cases involving race discrimination in the pricing of automobile loans, lending on Native American lands and unmarried people. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair previously has said the banking agency referred some cases to the Justice Department after examining data at some nondepositary institutions.
