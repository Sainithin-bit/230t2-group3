 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German drugs and chemicals firm Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ) posted a 58 percent rise in quarterly operating profit on Wednesday, boosted partly by its acquisition of Swiss biotech firm Serono. 

 Operating profit rose to 277.5 million euros ($383 million) in the second quarter from 176.1 million euros a year earlier, ahead of market expectations. A Reuters poll of 16 analysts had produced an average operating profit forecast of 273 million euros. The forecasts ranged from 245 million to 316 million euros.
