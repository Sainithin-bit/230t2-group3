 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG bumped up its 2007 outlook to see operating profit well above 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) this year after posting a 64 percent rise in first-half profit. 

 The airline's operating profit of 486 million euros in the first six months of the year beat the average forecast of 468 million in a Reuters poll of 15 analysts. The result on Wednesday was boosted by the performance at the carrier's Swiss subsidiary, which it bought two years ago, Lufthansa said in a statement, adding Swiss would give a lift to second-half earnings. "The executive board is raising its profit forecast and now anticipates an operating result for the full year -- in line with market expectations -- significantly above 1 billion euros," the airline said. Swiss was "developing better than previously anticipated", Lufthansa added. Shares in Lufthansa rose 3 percent to close at 20.97 euros, making them the second-best performers on a weaker German blue-chip DAX index. The airline had previously said only that it would reach its 1 billion euro annual operating earnings goal in 2007, a year earlier than had been planned. Lufthansa also said earlier this year it wanted to be more profitable than European rivals and that it had sufficient finances at its disposal to buy any attractive takeover target. Lufthansa had first-half sales of 10.1 billion euros, up from 9.6 billion a year earlier and just below the Reuters poll average forecast of 10.2 billion. Net income reached 992 million euros, up from just 85 million in the year-earlier half, helped by book gains on the disposal of its 50 percent stake in holiday firm Thomas Cook. Lufthansa is due to give more details about its first-half performance on Thursday.
