 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is "performing well" and defaults on commercial and industrial loans by banks remain "extremely low," New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday. 

 "Overall, the U.S. economy continues to display remarkable resilience and flexibility, despite a range of adverse shocks," he told an IBM forum on global leadership in Washington. Geithner did not comment on U.S. monetary policy in his speech. A copy of the text was made available in advance. Commenting on concerns that the U.S. financial system was losing its competitive edge, Geithner said regulators needed to be more attentive to the risk that regulation or other constraints create a disincentive to invest in the United States. But he also said weaker regulation or lower standards should not be considered to boost the presence of the U.S. market.
