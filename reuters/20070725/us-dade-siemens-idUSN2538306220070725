 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The $6.3 billion takeover bid for Dade Behring Holdings Inc. DADE.O by Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ), the latest deal in the hot clinical diagnostic business, is lifting shares of Dade rival Beckman Coulter Inc. BEC.N amid expectations it too will get an offer, analysts said on Wednesday. 

 Shares of Beckman Coulter, the last major stand-alone company in the sector, rose as much as 11.6 percent. Dade's deal with German industrial conglomerate Siemens is worth $77 per share, a 38 percent premium over Tuesday's closing price. Analysts said the large premium was causing investors to see Beckman Coulter as an acquisition target. A spokeswoman for Beckman Coulter declined to comment. Shares of Dade, which makes chemistry products and tests that measure cardiovascular activity and blood-clotting ability, were up 33 percent. Siemens fell 6 percent. Siemens' agreement to buy Dade follows a rash of recent deals in the sector, including a $3 billion hostile offer for Ventana Medical Systems Inc. VMSI.O from Roche Holding AG ( ROG.VX ) and a successful $1.67 billion bid for Biosite Inc. from Inverness Medical Innovations Inc. IMA.A after Beckman bowed out of a bidding war. Analysts said the trend, which has been in place for about a year, has accelerated and should continue to gather momentum. Siemens' bid for Dade demonstrates that buyers are not dissuaded by high stock prices of diagnostic companies as long as their profits and growth prospects are strong, said Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Quintin Lai. Lai noted that Dade shares had risen some 40 percent year-to-date before news of the deal. "On a valuation basis, I'd say this is on the high side ... but (Dade) has excellent cash flow generation and is in the process of launching a new instrument," he said. Morningstar analyst Alex Morozov said Dade's Vista technology gave it an advantage over Beckman Coulter in Siemens' eyes. The diagnostic tests are used widely in smaller-volume laboratories. The deal is not a surprise, he said. THE POOL IS SHRINKING "Soon there will be no pure plays left in diagnostics," Morozov said. "Beckman Coulter is the last pure play in the diagnostic business. The pool is shrinking for potential buyers." Others in this $10 billion market, which has been growing 6 to 7 percent annually for the past few years, include conglomerates like Abbott Laboratories Inc. ( ABT.N ), Roche, Siemens and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), Morozov noted. Siemens has about 12 percent of the market, he said, while Dade and Beckman each have about 11 percent to 12 percent. Roche has about 18 percent. "There's no clear leader here, and I think that was one of the drivers for Siemens' decision," he said. Earlier this month, General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) acknowledged that it would continue to seek acquisitions in the diagnostic sector after terminating an $8.1 billion deal to buy two such businesses from Abbott. The parties scrapped the deal as they could not agree on terms. Smaller players, which tend to focus on a few discrete areas in diagnostic testing, include Gen-Probe Inc. GPRO.O, Cepheid Inc. ( CPHD.O ), Quidel Corp. ( QDEL.O ), Luminex Corp. ( LMNX.O ) and Hologic Inc ( HOLX.O ). "Smaller companies with high growth in key areas, like molecular diagnostics and infectious disease, should get multiples of 5 or ten times revenue," said Jeff Frelick, an analyst with Lazard Capital Markets. But the tuck-in acquisitions are not the top choices for companies looking for a big footprint, analysts said. "Early and accurate diagnosis of an ailment just has a compounding financial benefit and the big boys realize that," said WBB Securities analyst Steve Brozak. "But there are fewer and fewer (companies) to choose from, and that's why they'll pay the high premiums. They want the one-stop shop and they want deals to be instantly accretive. The smaller ones have value, but they're difficult. I'm sure the corporate finance bankers are burning the midnight oil trying to figure out who, what, when and how much." Shares of Dade Behring were up $18.20, or 32.5 percent, at $74.11 in afternoon Nasdaq trade after touching a high of $75.25. Beckman Coulter rose $6.16, or 9.1 percent, to $73.90 on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching a record at  $75.61. (Additional reporting by  Jessica Hall )
