 PARIS  (Reuters) - French luxury goods group Hermes International ( HRMS.PA ) warned that full-year profits would fall short of forecasts, citing a slowdown in Japan and falls in the yen and the dollar against the euro. 

 Its shares fell almost 3 percent. Posting first-half revenues in line with expectations on Wednesday, the maker of trademark scarves, perfumes and leather goods, such as the iconic Kelly bag, cut its full-year sales growth forecast for the second time this year and said 2007 operating profit and net profit "should be about the same as in 2006". At 1100 GMT Hermes shares, which have fallen sharply from a record 108.7 euros in April, were down 2.9 percent at 75.85 euros, reversing gains made Tuesday ahead of the figures. According to Reuters Estimates, prior to Wednesday analysts on average forecast full-year net profit of 282 million euros ($389.6 million), compared with 268 million in 2006. The consensus for full-year operating profit was 430 million euros compared with 2006's 415 million, which included a 14 million euro gain on the sale of Leica LCAGk.DE shares. Chief Financial Officer Mireille Maury told Reuters in a telephone interview that first-half net profit should rise year-on-year but the company had become cautious for 2007 because of the slide in the yen and dollar against the euro. "This will have a slightly bigger impact than we expected," she said. HEDGING AGAINST DOLLAR, YEN Hermes has hedged 100 percent of expected 2007 dollar sales at $1.24 to the euro compared with a spot rate on Wednesday of $1.37. Against the yen, it is covered at 147 yen to the euro, compared with a spot rate of 165 yen. Maury said Hermes had already covered a "significant part" of likely 2008 exposure but declined to comment at what rates. "The strong euro will have a further negative impact on profits in 2008 as hedging fades," HSBC wrote in a research note following a company call with analysts. "We expect management of other luxury companies to become more vocal about (currencies) during the results season, which might limit earnings upgrades," the HSBC analysts added, noting this was one reason HSBC had a neutral stance on the sector. Both PPR ( PRTP.PA ), owner of the luxury Gucci Group, and LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton ( LVMH.PA ) are due to report first-half sales figures on Thursday. LVMH - whose flagship Vuitton brand has also been suffering in Japan - is also due to report profit figures. Hermes sought to offset the impact of currencies at the start of the year by raising its prices in Japan and the United States by around 8 percent and 4.5 percent respectively. Maury said the company did not plan any new price increases before January 1, 2008. Sales in the six months to June 30 were 721 million euros as second-quarter sales growth accelerated to a like-for-like 10.0 percent rise from 6.5 percent in the first quarter, helped by new store openings and the launch of an anniversary silk scarf. First-half turnover in Japan, which accounts for around 30 percent of group sales, fell to 172.3 million euros from 189.5 million but was up 1.7 percent at constant exchange rates, after a second-quarter gain of 5 percent. Maury said part of the underlying improvement in the second quarter in Japan was due to the opening of a new store in Osaka. Hermes new flagship on Wall Street in New York, which opened at the end of June, also got off to a good start, she said. The currency-induced weakness in Japan helped hold back first-half like-for-like growth in watch sales to 5.3 percent. But silk and textile sales were up 13.6 percent after a 20 percent rise in the second quarter, when Hermes launched a new "70" silk square to mark the 70th anniversary of its scarf business. Direct retail sales to consumers outside Japan in the first half were up 15 percent, Maury said. "This shows that the trend remains favorable," she added. Hermes this month opened an expanded store in Shanghai, part of a program to grow in mainland China. It is due to complete the renovation of its main Paris store in October and will next month begin promoting its new Kelly Caleche perfume.
