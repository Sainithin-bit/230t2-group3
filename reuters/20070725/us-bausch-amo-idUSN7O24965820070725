 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Advanced Medical Optics Inc. EYE.N on Tuesday reaffirmed its $75 per share bid for rival Bausch & Lomb Inc. BOL.N, which is preparing to accept a rival proposal and had asked AMO to improve its offer. 

 AMO said it would evaluate and respond to Bausch & Lomb's revision request, but that it believed its roughly $4.23 billion cash and stock bid to buy the eye care company "fully and fairly values" the company and is superior to a $3.67 billion offer from Warburg Pincus. Bausch & Lomb earlier on Tuesday had told AMO that without revisions, its bid would probably be rejected in favor of Warburg Pincus's $65 per share offer. AMO's third-largest shareholder, ValueAct Capital, earlier this month said it opposed the company's takeover bid. "We continue to believe in the strategic and financial rationale for this combination and are confident in our ability to consummate the transaction," AMO said. Bausch & Lomb must weigh the higher price and potential risks associated with AMO's cash and stock offer against the lower value, but greater security of the all-cash bid from Warburg Pincus. Warburg Pincus is not expected to raise its offer to thwart the AMO offer, sources said. Warburg's bid already has antitrust approval, while AMO's would require such a nod.
