 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Times Co. said on Wednesday quarterly profit rose, helped by a one-time gain from the sale of its broadcast operations, but revenue fell because of weaker newspaper advertising sales. 

 The results come on the same day that Los Angeles Times publisher Tribune Co. reported a lower second-quarter profit, due in part to an ad sales slowdown. Both companies are suffering from a downturn in print advertising as more people spend their time on the Internet and economic factors like the weakened U.S. housing market crimp marketing budgets. The New York Times, home to the flagship Times newspaper and the Boston Globe, said second-quarter net income rose to $118.4 million, or 82 cents a share, compared with $59.6 million, or 41 cents, a year ago. Earnings from continuing operations before special items totaled 34 cents a share, down from 37 cents a year ago but ahead of the Wall Street consensus forecast of 31 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 3.7 percent to $788.9 million. Ad revenue at its news media group fell 6.9 percent and circulation revenue fell 0.5 percent. Operating profit fell 48.7 percent at the group. But some analysts pointed to a slowdown in the pace of Internet revenue growth at the Times, to 23 percent from 34 percent a year ago. "Of particular concern is the slowdown in online revenue growth," Morgan Stanley analyst Lisa Monaco wrote in a research note. "The company has made significant investments in new digital products where results have been spotty at best in our view." The sale of the company's broadcast group added 66 cents per share to the bottom line. It also reported a loss of 29 cents a share on other asset sales and 5 cents a share on accelerated depreciation expense. It gained 15 cents per share on the sale of a radio station and a penny per share from broadcast income. "While our second-quarter results reflected weakness in the print advertising market ... we continued to move aggressively on new product development, cost reduction and the rebalancing of our portfolio," Chief Executive Janet Robinson said in a statement. The Times has been resisting calls from some of its shareholders to give all investors equal voting rights. The Sulzberger family controls the Times through its voting stock. The company is trying to cut costs as it deals with the advertising downturn, and expects to save $230 million in 2008 and 2009. About $130 million would come in 2008, it said. Monaco said the cost cuts are encouraging but would not be enough to generate growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the next few years. New York Times shares were up 24 cents, or 1 percent, to $23.46 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
