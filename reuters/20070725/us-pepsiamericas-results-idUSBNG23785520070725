 (Reuters) - PepsiAmericas Inc. PAS.N, the No. 2 Pepsi bottler, on Wednesday reported a higher second-quarter profit and raised its full-year outlook as operating margins doubled in Central Europe and U.S. performance improved. 

 Shares of the company rose to their highest level in more than nine years in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. In afternoon trade, they were off the day's high of $26.89 and were trading at $26.16, still up more than 7 percent. Earnings rose 20 percent to 61 cents a share. Analysts on average were expecting a flat quarter at 50 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales were up 12.6 percent at $1.20 billion, slightly ahead of analysts' average view of $1.17 billion. Pricing improvements helped offset higher cost of goods sold and helped boost gross margins on its U.S. sales, which contribute more than 75 percent to total revenue. "We continue to harbor some concerns due to the potential for meaningful aluminum cost pressure in 2008 if contract caps expire," Goldman Sachs analyst Andrew Sawyer said in a note. Rising costs of aluminum, used for making soda cans, have created pricing pressures for bottlers as well as soft drink makers. Bottlers generally enter into contracts to protect against rising prices. Sawyer said, however, that the company's current-quarter performance gave him confidence in its ability to manage the pressures. He also upgraded the stock to "neutral" from "sell," citing better valuation given the higher earnings base. ACQUISITION-DRIVEN GROWTH Gross profit for the Minneapolis-based company rose 15.7 percent company-wide, helped by growth from acquisition of bottling operations in Romania and distribution rights in Moldova. Net sales in Central Europe rose 85 percent to $207 million in the second quarter, while that in the United States grew 4.2 percent to $929.9 million. For the full year, the company now expects adjusted earnings of $1.55 to $1.60 a share, compared with its prior view of $1.35 to $1.40. The outlook includes 2 cents to 3 cents a share of dilution from an acquisition. Analysts are expecting it to earn $1.39 a share. NON-CARBONATED BUSINESS Volume in the United States, however, was down as carbonated soft drinks declined 6 percent, reflecting consumer preference to move away from carbonated beverages. The company aims to ramp up its non-carbonated business with the help of Lipton tea and the segment now provides 22 percent of volume sold in the United States.
