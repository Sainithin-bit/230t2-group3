 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The London and Toronto stock exchanges abandoned plans for a C$3.6 billion merger on Wednesday, as it became clear they would not win enough shareholder support for their transatlantic alliance. 

 The following are some comments from analysts and shareholders: RENEE COLYER, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF CAPITAL MARKETS CONSULTING FIRM FOREFACTOR "Disappointed is putting it mildly. It's very unfortunate, because I believe the Toronto Stock Exchange tried to take that next step toward globalization and it was met with a lot of challenges. Now, they have to start over. "As far as Maple goes and that bid, there's no guarantees that's even going to happen because they have the regulatory hurdles they have to go through and the shareholders vote ... and who even knows whether or not they're going to move forward with their offer? There's talk on the street they may just drop it once they stop the LSE bid. "I just hope, internationally, in terms of how people are looking at us now, that the Toronto Stock Exchange still has the opportunity for growth and opportunities to form alliances with other exchanges, and that those other exchanges aren't going to feel like, 'Well, if we even try to come into Canada, we're going to be challenged by the banks that are the oligopoly that is Canada.' What message did we just give the world?" ARNAUD GIBLAT, DIRECTOR AT UBS: "Maple still have to tackle the antitrust issue, particularly with the inclusion of Alpha. I'm surprised they have not forgone Alpha to ease antitrust issues." ALISON CROSTHWAIT, DIRECTOR OF GLOBAL TRADING STRATEGY AT INSTINET: "I'm not surprised. I had thought Maple was going to get this deal done. And that their lobby was very effective ... Now we need to see what the competition bureau thinks of Maple. We also need to see if shareholders support Maple; I think they will, I don't see how they won't. "This is a big moment for Canadian capital markets, because if LSE were to have gone through, it's big, but it wouldn't have been as big. This is a big change in terms of going back -- I do use those words intentionally -- we're going back to more of a closely held, interested parties controlling the exchange." ED DITMIRE, A NEW YORK-BASED ANALYST FOR MACQUARIE SECURITIES: "A lot of people are striking deals and not getting them across the finish line. Ultimately a lot of these deals had substantial risk and the companies plowed ahead anyway, because management is convinced this is a consolidating industry and they want to make sure they are not left out. "This reinforces my belief that we should expect more mergers, not less." JUSTIN SCHACK, A VICE-PRESIDENT OF MARKET STRUCTURE ANALYSIS AT ROSENBLATT SECURITIES: "I'm surprised but not shocked. It wasn't going to be a slam dunk either way, it was going to be tight. "The industry is definitely still going to continue to consolidate, there are too many forces pointing toward that. LSE and TMX were both in positions where they weren't quite big enough or diverse and fast-growing enough to control their own destiny. "They did the best deal that they probably could. Now that that's not going to happen TMX has Maple to deal with, while LSE is out on its own again and there aren't many partners out there where they could be the acquirer rather than the target." CHRIS DAMAS AN INDEPENDENT ANALYST AND TMX SHAREHOLDER: "I think the Greek credit crisis weighed on investors' minds. It may not have been the best time to lock into a deal, which would give investors more sensitivity to European capital markets."
