 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. financial industry on Wednesday succeeded in blunting a government proposal to sharply cut the billions of dollars banks annually charge retailers to process debit card purchases. 

 Amid a vigorous lobbying campaign by banks, the Federal Reserve voted to revise its original proposal to almost double the maximum so-called "swipe fee." The Fed defended its softened rule, saying it more accurately represented the intent of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial oversight law. The four largest U.S. card networks -- Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover -- gained roughly $14 billion in market cap after the Fed's vote. "Talk about generous -- wow," said payments consultant Eric Grover of Intrepid Ventures about the Fed's final rule. Under the rule, banks would be allowed to charge as much as 22 cents per debit card transaction, which includes a one-cent allowance for meeting certain fraud prevention standards. That is 10 cents more than the cap proposed in December. In addition, banks will be allowed to charge 5 basis points per transaction for fraud losses. The softened rule is a victory for banks such as Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, and card network companies such as Visa and MasterCard, who were taken by surprise by the strict cap laid out in the Fed's December proposal. Banks pay card networks like Visa and MasterCard for processing debit transactions, and investors had worried that a cut in the fees that banks earn from retailers would translate into a cut in the fees they were willing to pay the networks. The industry fought back against the proposal, launching a nationwide advertising campaign that painted the rule as padding the profits of big box retailers like Wal-Mart and Target. The Fed was flooded by more than 11,000 comment letters. Still, banks stand to lose billions of dollars in revenue under the final rule. Swipe fees in 2009 were $16.2 billion, according to the Fed. The cap would roughly halve that fee revenue. "This is better than the 12 cents anticipated, but still poses significant challenges to our business," Bank of America spokeswoman Betty Riess said in an email. Shares of MasterCard gained 11 percent and Visa closed 15 percent higher after news of the Fed final rule. Shares of major banks that issue debit cards got a more modest boost. WINNERS, LOSERS The final Fed rule was a blow to retailers. "Extremely disappointed," said Mallory Duncan, a senior vice president of the National Retail Federation. "The governors essentially ignored the law." Fed staff said that under the average debit card transaction of $38, a bank will be able to collect about 24 cents from retailers. The breakdown would be 21 cents coming from the base fee cap, up to 1 cent from the fraud prevention allowance, and about 2 cents from the fraud loss formula. Before the final rule was released, some bank analysts were expecting a 20-cent cap to be the best-case scenario for the industry. "The fact that they raised it is quite a win for the branded networks," like Visa and MasterCard, said Tom Layman, a former chief economist for Visa who now runs the payments consulting firm Global Vision Group. Fed board members meeting on Wednesday sounded unenthusiastic about having to write the rule, pointing out it was a requirement of the Dodd-Frank law and not something the Fed independently initiated. Senator Richard Durban, who authored the fee crackdown in Dodd-Frank, chided the Fed for having "yielded to the big banks" in a way that will "unnecessarily take money out of the pockets of consumers and small businesses." Fed staff said the central bank could bump up the cap because the Dodd-Frank language calling for the fee limit "is ambiguous and may be read in several ways." Left unanswered is how the new rule will impact consumers. Banks have said they will have to find ways to offset the losses through other fees and have raised doubts that merchants will pass along any savings to consumers. When asked by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke how consumers will fare under the new system, Fed staff said it was not clear. The Fed also failed to satisfy community banks' concerns that they will be adequately shielded from the crackdown. According to Dodd-Frank, banks with less than $10 billion in assets are exempt from the debit fee cap but they have argued the exemption will not work in practice. In an attempt to placate these concerns, the rule requires card networks to annually put out a list of the average fee it passes along to banks that fall above and below the $10 billion threshold to gauge how the exemption is working. "We are deeply troubled that the Fed did not include specific enforcement provisions in the final rule to ensure community banks receive the benefit of the statutory small bank exemption," the Independent Community Bankers of America said in a statement. Fed board members said the rule represented their best effort on dealing with the exemptions for community banks. Fed Governor Elizabeth Duke was the only one of the five board members to vote against the rule and gave her concerns about its impact on small banks as the reason.
