 (Reuters) - Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc has hired CB Richard Ellis Group ( CBG.N ) to sell its Steel Pier amusement park in Atlantic City, New Jersey, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. 

 The minimum bid for the pier will be $2.5 million, according to CB Richard Ellis, the Journal reported. The news of the sale comes after the company earlier this year said it will sell the Trump Marina Hotel Casino to Landry's Inc for $38 million. Trump Entertainment and CB Richard Ellis could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by Abhishek Takle in Bangalore; Editing by  Gary Hill )
