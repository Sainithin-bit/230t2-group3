 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Applications for home mortgages slipped last week as demand waned, even as mortgage rates dropped, an industry group said on Wednesday. 

 The Mortgage Bankers Association said its seasonally adjusted index of mortgage application activity, which includes both refinancing and home purchase demand, fell 2.7 percent in the week ended June 24. The MBA's seasonally adjusted index of refinancing applications fell 2.6 percent, while the gauge of loan requests for home purchases lost 3.0 percent. The refinance share of mortgage activity increased to 69.5 percent of total applications from 69.2 percent the week before. Fixed 30-year mortgage rates averaged 4.46 percent in the week, down from 4.57 percent. (Reporting by  Leah Schnurr ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
