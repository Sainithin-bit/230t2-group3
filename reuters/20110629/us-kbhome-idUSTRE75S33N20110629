 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ) reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss as margins and homes prices fell and writedowns of land values rose, sending shares of the fifth-largest U.S. homebuilder down 10 percent. 

 This summer marks the fifth anniversary of the U.S. housing slump, which followed years of rampant risky lending and speculation. Builders of new homes have tried to compete with the lower prices of used houses and foreclosures by building on cheaper land. But KB's second-quarter results show the company may have overpaid for the land it is building on now, which hurt its margins in the quarter, said FBN Securities analyst Joel Locker. "They thought pace and price would be better by now," Locker said. KB recorded $20.6 million in charges in the quarter to write down the value of land. That reduced earnings by 15 cents per share, UBS analyst David Goldberg said in a note to clients, far more than he and other analysts expected. According to the widely watched S&P/Case-Shiller home price index released on Tuesday, home prices in 20 cities fell 4 percent year-over-year in April. Economists cautioned that home prices will likely continue to crawl along at low levels, and could fall further, as the battered housing market works through a slew of headwinds like foreclosures that are depressing prices and weak demand due to low consumer confidence. Los-Angeles-based KB said it lost $68.5 million, or 89 cents per share, in its second quarter ended May 31, compared with a loss of $30.7 million, or 40 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had anticipated a loss of 31 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Also included in KB's quarterly results was a loss of $14.6 million to Inspirada, a bankrupt housing community near Las Vegas. Ultimately, the company will play lenders between $214 million and $225 million to settle related legal claims. Once expected to have about 11,500 homes, the project stalled as the Las Vegas housing market collapsed. Shares of KB, which has operations in nine states, were down 10 percent at $10.72 in midday trading. (Reporting by Helen Chernikoff, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and John Wallace)
