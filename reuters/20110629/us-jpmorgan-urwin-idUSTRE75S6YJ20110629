 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) promoted Jeff Urwin, a former Bear Stearns & Co banker who became co-head of its North American investment banking business, to a new role heading global investment banking industry groups, capital markets and mergers and acquisitions. 

 The move was announced in a memo to staff from Jes Staley, chief executive of JPMorgan's investment bank. Urwin, 55, will work with regional banking heads to coordinate the group's global investment banking business, according to the memo, which was obtained by Reuters. The job is a new position, a bank spokeswoman said. Urwin's replacement will be announced shortly, the bank said. Kevin Willsey will continue as co-head of North American investment banking, according to the memo. Urwin is one of only a handful of Bear Stearns executives who stayed on after JPMorgan bought Bear in the financial crisis in March 2008.
