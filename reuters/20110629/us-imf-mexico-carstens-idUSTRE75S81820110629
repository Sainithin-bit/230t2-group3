 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexico's losing candidate to take the helm of the International Monetary Fund hit out at international bodies on Wednesday, saying they had failed to live up to the standards they set for others. 

 Central bank governor Agustin Carstens said his candidacy for the top job at the IMF had been a "protest vote" about the way industrialized countries handled important issues. "The reality is that these institutions have always asked for transparency from us, they have asked us to adopt democratic principles that they do not enforce themselves," he told local radio. Carstens went on a whirlwind global tour to promote his candidacy in recent weeks, offering himself as a serious and experienced voice from the developing world. Mexico's central bank and finance ministry congratulated France's Christine Lagarde on Tuesday after she was named as the new head of the IMF, and Carstens said he hoped she would make progress in strengthening governance at the IMF. On the radio, Carstens said, "It's difficult for many member countries to receive, let alone accept, recommendations from the Fund if they don't see that the recommendations are made by the best people."
