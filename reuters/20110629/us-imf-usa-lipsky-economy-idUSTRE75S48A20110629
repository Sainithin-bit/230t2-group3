 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's No. 2 official, John Lipsky, said on Wednesday that a weak U.S. housing sector and a slow jobs market remain a challenge for the recovering economy. 

 "Financial conditions are improving slowly," Lipsky said at a news conference. "Households are improving their indebtedness, but falling house prices and unemployment rates still have hurt household balance sheets." (Reporting by  Margaret Chadbourn ; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
