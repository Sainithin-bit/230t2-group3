 (Reuters) - Clothing chain American Apparel Inc ( APP.A ) is in talks to replace two of its six board members, Bloomberg said, citing three people involved in the discussions. 

 In April, American Apparel -- facing a long-running sales slump -- said it raised $14.9 million by selling some of its shares at a discount of 43 percent to a group of private investors led by Canadian financier Michael Serruya and Delavaco Capital. The investors, led by Michael Serruya and private-equity firm Delavaco Capital, may buy about $8 million of additional shares in the coming weeks, Bloomberg said citing two of the sources. Peter Schey, a spokesman for American Apparel, did not immediately reply to an email requesting comment. (Reporting by Mihir Dalal in Bangalore; Editing by  Gary Hill )
