 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch biotech Crucell CRCL.AS swung to a full-year loss, hit by a vaccine impairment charge and higher operating costs, but said on Monday Korean regulators back the resumption of production at its key Korean facility. 

 Crucell, the target of a takeover by U.S. healthcare group Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N), halted shipments from the facility in October because of microbiological contamination and took a vaccine impairment charge of 23 million euros. On Monday, it reported a worse-than-expected operating loss of 34.3 million euros: it had previously forecast an operating loss of 20 to 25 million euros. It reported a net loss of 27.6 million euros compared with a 23.9 million euros net profit in 2009. The World Health Organisation previously said it expected to complete a review of how Crucell responded to the vaccine mishap by the end of January, but the review was delayed because of ongoing consultations with the Korean Food and Drug Administration (KFDA). "The KFDA has informed us that they support the restart of production and we soon expect to be able to release our vaccines to the market," Crucell Chief Executive Ronald Brus said in a statement on Monday. Crucell reported sales and total revenues and other operating income of 365.4 million euros for the full year, compared with 358 million euros in 2009, in line with its guidance.
