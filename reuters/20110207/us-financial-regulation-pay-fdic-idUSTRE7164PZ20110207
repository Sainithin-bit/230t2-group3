 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regulators on Monday revealed proposed curbs on bank pay that would require large financial firms to defer 50 percent of executives' bonuses for three years. 

 The board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp will vote shortly on whether to formally propose the rules, which were required under last year's Dodd-Frank financial reform law and are part of a global framework. (Reporting by  Dave Clarke ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
