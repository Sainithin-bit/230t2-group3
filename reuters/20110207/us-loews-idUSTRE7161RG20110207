 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Loews Corp ( L.N ) reported its best quarter of the year as strong investment income from its biggest holding, CNA Financial ( CNA.N ), helped the conglomerate post a better-than-expected 16 percent increase in quarterly profit.

Commercial insurer CNA Financial ( CNA.N ), also reported better-than-expected results, helped by strong investment income from its property and casualty operations. Apart from CNA, Loews has stakes in Diamond Offshore ( DO.N ) and Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP ( BWP.N ). CNA Financial resumed its quarterly dividend and said it will pay 10 cents as quarterly dividend on March 2, to shareholders of record on February 16.
