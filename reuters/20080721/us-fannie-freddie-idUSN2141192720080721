 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Demand for debt sold by mortgage finance company Freddie Mac weakened on Monday while a prominent analyst estimated Freddie and Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. home funding sources, each need to raise up to $15 billion in fresh capital. 

 But in Washington, the stalemate over legislation aimed at stabilizing the worst U.S. housing market since the Great Depression may be loosening. The White House on Monday said it hoped for movement on housing legislation being negotiated with Congress by the end of this week, although President George W. Bush would veto a bill if it included $4 billion in grants that would let local communities buy foreclosed homes. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he felt certain that Congress would pass the plan, which includes a safety net for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. "I am quite confident that we will get the sort of program that we need," Paulson told CNBC cable television in an interview. Despite the poor showing for Freddie's FRE.N debt sale, it may be premature to read too much into the weaker demand for the $3 billion in bills given that share prices of both Fannie and Freddie soared last week, an analyst said. Freddie Mac shares fell 4.7 percent on Monday, while Fannie Mae FNM.N shares gained 5.5 percent, after recently hitting 17-year lows. Better-than-expected results from Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), the latest in a series of positive surprises from a few big banks, suggested the sector may be stabilizing and drove up financial shares on Monday. A week ago Freddie was flooded with bids in the first test of its market access after the government's sweeping rescue plans for the two government-sponsored enterprises were announced.  Nancy Vanden Houten, agency analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, New Jersey, called Monday's bill auction results "pretty poor" considering some of the GSE-related market panic has ebbed. "We are reluctant to read too much into the results," she added. "Freddie Mac's stock price has nearly doubled since hitting a low last Tuesday. If a new crisis of confidence about the GSEs was developing, we think we would see in the stock market as well," she wrote in a report to clients. That said, both companies still must raise significant capital to shore up balance sheets, according to research firm Friedman Billings Ramsey. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac own or guarantee almost half of the country's $12 trillion in outstanding mortgage debt and face mounting losses and defaults and foreclosures escalate. Fannie and Freddie each need to raise $10 billion to $15 billion, FBR analyst Paul Miller wrote in a note to clients. "The best solution for everyone is for the GSEs to raise fresh equity to strengthen their balance sheets and continue to buy mortgages in order to stabilize the housing markets," he said. Freddie Mac, based in McLean, Virginia, said on Friday that it was committed to raising $5.5 billion of capital through offerings including common and preferred stock but that the fund raising would not be immediate. Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth Lewis, on Monday said the U.S. plans to rescue Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "absolutely necessary" and will help restore confidence. The White House has complained that some elements of the housing rescue bill are too costly and would wrongly aid speculators - such as the block grants.
