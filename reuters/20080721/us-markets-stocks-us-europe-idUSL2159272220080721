 (REUTERS) U.S. index futures point to a weak start on Wall Street. Futures for the S&P 500, for the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq are down 0.3 percent. 

 Genentech DNA.N will be in focus after Roche ( ROG.VX ) offered to acquire all outstanding shares in its U.S. partner for $43.7 billion in cash, a 9 percent premium to Friday's close. Busy day for corporate results, with numbers due from a clutch of companies including computer maker Apple ( AAPL.O ), Bank of America ( BAC.N ), medical device maker Boston Scientific ( BSX ), pharmaceutical data group IMS Health RX and drugmakers Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) and Schering-Plough SGP.N plus chipmaker Texas Instruments TXN.N Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Sunday that the U.S. economy needed months to recover from its slowdown but the banking system remained sound despite a home mortgage crisis that could cause more problems. Oil trades $1.80 a barrel higher at $130.68 after its biggest one-week slide on record last week. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 0.4 percent, S&P was flat and the Nasdaq lost 1.3 percent on disappointing results from Google ( GOOG.O ) and Microsoft ( MSFT.O ).
