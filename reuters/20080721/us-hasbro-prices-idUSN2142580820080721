 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hasbro Inc HAS.N will increase prices in the mid-single-digit range for its toys, effective September 1, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer David Hargreaves said on Monday. 

 The No. 2 U.S. toy company is increasing prices to maintain its margins to fend off rising commodity costs, Hargreaves said during a conference call. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
