 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) said on Monday that Michael Klein, a former head of investment banking, is leaving, in the latest management shakeup under Chief Executive Vikram Pandit. 

 Klein, a 23-year veteran of Citigroup, was widely seen within Citigroup as likely to depart after a reorganization in March left John Havens, Pandit's former colleague at Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), as chief executive of the group that includes the investment bank. In that same reorganization, Klein was named chairman of that group, known as the institutional clients group, as well as vice chairman of Citi, two titles often seen as entailing less day-to-day management responsibility. "Pandit is putting his own people in. Anyone who thought Klein would thrive in Pandit's Citigroup is foolish," said William Smith, chief executive officer of Smith Asset Management, which owns Citi shares. Klein, 44, was once considered a candidate to eventually become the company's chief executive. Klein had headed markets and banking along with Tom Maheras, who focused more on sales and trading while Klein focused on banking. Klein has multiple close relationships with clients, most notably with private equity firms, some of which may be interested in hiring him, according to people familiar with him. Klein did not return a call seeking comment. The bank, without elaborating, said he was quitting to pursue other opportunities. Citigroup in March granted Klein $19.3 million in deferred cash and stock awards as an incentive to stay. Pandit has brought in other senior executives since taking over in December. On March 31, Citi said it was hiring Teresa (Terri) Dial as global head of consumer strategy and CEO of consumer banking in North America. Dial previously worked at Lloyds TSB Group Plc. Pandit has overhauled top management as he tries to shed assets, slash costs, and stem write-downs tied to subprime mortgages, other debt and consumer credit. Citigroup, also on Monday, named Lawrence Ricciardi, a former chief financial officer and general counsel at IBM, ( IBM.N ) to its board of directors. Citigroup on Friday posted a milder-than-expected $2.5 billion second-quarter loss. In a statement, Pandit called Klein "a uniquely talented individual and partner" who has made "invaluable contributions" to the bank. Klein in a statement said "it has been particularly important for me to assist the company during this challenging year in the markets and in the management succession at the firm." Citigroup executives were not immediately available for further comment, a spokeswoman said. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Derek Caney , Gunna Dickson)
