 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Specialty chemical maker Albemarle Corp ( ALB.N ) on Monday posted higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings on strong results for catalysts and other technologies used in petroleum refining. 

 Net income rose to $61.7 million, or 67 cents a share, from $53.9 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 65 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 10.1 percent to $620.8 million, spurred by strong sales from the polymer additives and fine chemicals businesses. Wall Street was expecting $635 million. The company's polymer additives are used as flame retardants and antioxidants in a variety of applications, while the fine chemicals business supplies the agricultural, pharmaceutical, paper and other industries. Sales from the company's catalysts business rose slightly, but income from the segment increased sharply, helped by improved product pricing and higher earnings from joint ventures. Albemarle expects demand for its refinery catalysts to continue to increase due to regulations mandating cleaner fuels and the increasing percentage of sour crudes being processed by refiners. However, the company cautioned that it anticipated some seasonal weakness in the third quarter. Albemarle said margin compression due to rampant raw material costs had been its biggest challenge and remained its most important area of focus for the remainder of 2008.
