 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Timken Co ( TKR.N ), a maker of industrial bearings and specialty steel, on Monday issued earnings estimates that were higher than Wall Street expectations, as strong global demand offsets weakness in U.S. auto markets, sending shares up 25 percent. 

 Timken expects second-quarter profit of about 96 cents per share, excluding special items, and estimated 2008 profit in a range of $2.95 to $3.10 per share. Its previous range had been $2.75 to $2.95 per share. Those forecasts compare to average analyst estimates of 78 cents and $2.90 for the second quarter and the full year, respectively, according to Reuters Estimates. "We continue to build momentum as we shift the company's profile toward attractive global industrial market sectors where demand remains at historically high levels," Chief Executive James Griffith said in a statement. Final second-quarter results will be released July 30. Timken shares jumped $7.16, or 25 percent, to $35.84 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
