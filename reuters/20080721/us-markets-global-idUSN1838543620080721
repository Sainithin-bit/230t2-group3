 LONDON  (Reuters) - Global stocks picked up last week's rally on Monday, sharply boosted by easing concerns about banking earnings, while oil firmed to around $130 a barrel and the dollar weakened. 

 Wall Street looked set for a positive start, particularly after Bank of America reported far higher-than-expected second-quarter earnings. It built on higher-than-expected results from JPMorgan, Citigroup and IBM last week. "The results could set the stage for equity performance for the rest of the week giving tailwinds for the dollar," said John Hydeskov, senior FX analyst at Danske Markets in Copenhagen. European shares kicked off the week on a softer note but then reversed with the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was standing more than 1 percent higher. They were led higher by oil company stocks, which tracked the higher crude price, and by HSBC, which gained on a newspaper report of stake interest from a Chinese sovereign wealth fund. The positive sentiment from banking results, however, has been somewhat tempered by lower-than-forecast results from technology sector bellwethers such as Google Inc and Microsoft Corp. British lender HBOS also added some worry. It dropped 2 percent after it said shareholders subscribed for just 8.3 percent of shares in its 4 billion pound ($8 billion) rights issue, leaving its underwriters to try to sell almost 3.8 billion pounds of stock. OIL FIRMS, DOLLAR DRIFTS Oil was up around $1.60 a barrel above $130.50 following the biggest one-week slide on record as inconclusive talks between Iran and world powers over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme dimmed prospects of ending the row. Prices were also lifted by worries about Tropical Storm Dolly, the first storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season that could disrupt oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. The dollar slipped, staying near a record low against the euro. "We're waiting to see the degree to which markets, particularly equities, are starting to stabilize after the recent mayhem," said Stephen Koukoulas, global strategist at TD Securities. The euro edged up slightly to $1.5860, hovering in range of a record high of $1.6038 last week. The dollar fell 0.1 percent to 107.08 yen, while the euro hit an all time record high of 169.92 yen. Euro zone government bonds extended losses after the Bank of America results. Two-year bond yields were up 7 basis points at 4.607 percent while 10-year yields were 3 basis points higher at 4.618 percent. (Additional reporting by  Simon Falush ; Editing by Ron Askew)
