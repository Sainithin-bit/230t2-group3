 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnionBanCal UB.N on Monday reported lower second-quarter profit as the parent of Union Bank of California set aside more money for bad loans. 

 Net income for the San Francisco-based bank fell to $141.3 million, or $1.02 per share, from $165.4 million, or $1.19 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time gains from the sale of its insurance brokerage business and the partial redemption of MasterCard Inc stock, the company earned 91 cents a share, matching the analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. UnionBanCal set aside $95 million for bad loans, compared with $5 million a year earlier and $72 million in the first quarter. Revenue rose 12.6 percent to $712.5 million. Net income included an $11.5 million gain from the sale of UnionBanCal's insurance brokerage business to a BB&T Corp ( BBT.N ) unit. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc ( 8306.T ), one of the world's biggest banks by assets, owns a controlling stake in UnionBanCal. UnionBanCal shares closed up at $45.50 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. The stock had dropped 6 percent this year, compared with a 29 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index .BKX.
