 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Yahoo fell 2 percent to $22 in pre-market trading on Monday after the company said it will appoint activist investor Carl Icahn and two members of his slate of directors to the company's board, settling a proxy battle ahead of its August 1 annual shareholders meeting.
