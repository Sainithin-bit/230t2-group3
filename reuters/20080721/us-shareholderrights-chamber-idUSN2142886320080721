 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Shareholder proposals do not significantly boost a company's stock-market value in the short-run or long-run, according to a study to be released on Tuesday by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 

 Amid debate about how much say investors should have in corporate governance, the study found that shareholder attempts to use a company's proxy ballot as a reform tool did not result in a higher stock price or better operating performance. "Given the costs associated with the proxy process and the unproven impact on company value, some consideration should be given to the net benefits of such initiatives," the chamber said in its study. Done by Navigant Consulting Inc ( NCI.N ), a financial services and litigation consulting group, the study was conducted in the winter and spring of 2008 and used academic literature and an empirical test of 10 companies. The companies came from various industries facing shareholder proposals on political and social agendas. For example, shareholders of Safeway Inc ( SWY.N ) have been especially active in recent years, with pension fund California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) trying to unseat board members in 2004, the chamber said. The study looked at companies' stock performance, accounted for general market movement and other company news, and determined there was no significant increase in the companies' share prices two days after the shareholder proposals became public. It also found there was no significant increase in the subsequent few quarters after the proposals became public. "We had long suspected these kinds of proposals were not intended to increase shareholder value," said Glenn Spencer, director of research in the chamber's office of general counsel. "We were surprised to find a couple of instances in which the return was not just zero but actually negative." The value of shareholder proposals has been a contentious topic at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which in November restricted shareholder proxy access. It ruled that companies can exclude shareholder proposals for director nominations from their corporate ballots. Chairman Christopher Cox pledged to revisit the topic to vindicate shareholder rights, but the agency has not proposed a new rule on proxy access. Pension funds do not agree with the chamber's assessment. CalPERS spokesman Clark McKinley said it can take three to five years for the share price to show improvements, but shareholder proposals do have a positive effect. CalPERS released a study in 2007 that examined the stock performance from 1987 through 2006 of 128 companies the pension fund targeted. It found that for the five years prior to CalPERS' first involvement with the companies, they produced returns averaging 87 percent below their respective benchmarks on a cumulative basis. For the first five years after CalPERS got involved, the average targeted company produced excess returns of 12 percent above their respective benchmark return on a cumulative basis. "We've found that share values will go up after they've been called out for bad governance practices," McKinley said. "Otherwise we wouldn't be doing corporate governance." (Editing by Gerald E.
