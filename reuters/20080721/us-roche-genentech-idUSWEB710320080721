 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG said on Monday it sees substantial synergies from the Genentech deal and that there would be no need for a capital increase. 

 The group said it was confident of putting together a consortium of banks to finance the $43.7 billion buy of all outstanding shares in its U.S. partner and that it sees no problems financing the deal. (Reporting by  Sam Cage )
