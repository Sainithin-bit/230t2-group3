 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp WB.N, the 
fourth-largest U.S. bank, on Monday said its main mortgage unit 
will stop offering home loans through brokers this week, 
joining a growing number of lenders to curb wholesale lending. 

  "We thought it was important to focus on customers who have 
relationships with the bank, and in geographies where Wachovia 
has branches," spokesman Don Vecchiarello said. "Based on that, 
we've decided to discontinue doing business through our 
wholesale mortgage channel as of July 25."  Wachovia is assessing how many jobs will be affected by the 
decision, Vecchiarello said.  The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank is scheduled to 
report second-quarter results on Tuesday. It has projected a 
$2.6 billion to $2.8 billion loss, citing mounting credit 
problems tied to mortgages.  (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Carol Bishopric)
