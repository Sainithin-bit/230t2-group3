 BAGHDAD  (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama did not raise his plan to withdraw troops from Iraq within 16 months in his talks on Monday with Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, the Iraqi government's spokesman said. 

 "This issue, we do not discuss ... ," spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh told reporters when asked if Obama had brought up the 16-month timeframe. "Obama did not speak about anything which concerns the Iraqi government because he does not have any official (government) capacity."
