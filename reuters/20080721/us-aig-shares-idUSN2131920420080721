 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) rose 11 percent on Monday after Bank of America raised its rating on the insurer to "buy" from "neutral," saying the risk-to-reward ratio has become "very attractive." 

 Analyst Alain Karaoglan, in a research note, said the shares should rebound as AIG's new chief executive, Robert Willumstad, gets to work pruning and weeding the insurer's sprawling global network of businesses, as he has promised to do in his first few months in office. The shares jumped $2.78 to $27.85 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have tumbled in recent months and are down 50 percent since the beginning of the year as the world's largest insurer disclosed two consecutive quarters of record losses on investments linked to subprime mortgages. Willumstad, a former Citigroup executive, was named CEO last month, succeeding Martin Sullivan, who had held the post since 2005. "As the new CEO de-leverages, de-risks and simplifies, we see the market regaining confidence in the franchise, leading to the stock's multiple recovery," Karaoglan said in the research note. Karaoglan has a 12-month price target of $35 on the shares. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; editing by John Wallace)
