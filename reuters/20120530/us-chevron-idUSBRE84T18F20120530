 SAN RAMON, California  (Reuters) - Shareholders owning 27 percent of Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) voted for more disclosure on the risks to its operations and finances from both hydraulic fracturing regulation and growing public opposition to the oil and gas production practice. 
 A similar proposal on "fracking" received more than 40 percent support a year ago from investors in the second-largest U.S. oil company. At Chevron's annual meeting on Wednesday, an executive said an early count of votes showed about 23 percent supported a resolution calling for the appointment of a board director with environmental expertise, compared with 25 percent last year. Activists had seized on that resolution, which this time had the support of advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services, as a sign of heightened concern about Chevron's protracted legal battles over pollution in Ecuador.
