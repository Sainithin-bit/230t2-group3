 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada's government on Tuesday wished Research in Motion Ltd well with its restructuring efforts but declined to comment on speculation about a possible takeover of the troubled BlackBerry maker. 
 "I wish RIM every success and hope to see them grow and maintain their world leading position. However, I will not comment on speculation," Industry Minister Christian Paradis said in a statement e-mailed to Reuters. Paradis would have to approve any takeover bid from a foreign company. Speaking separately to reporters about RIM, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said: "They're an important Canadian company and I hope they succeed in their restructuring." (Reporting by  David Ljunggren )
