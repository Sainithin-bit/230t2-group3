 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - When the U.S. Congress passed the $814 billion economic stimulus plan in 2009, it included a bevy of measures to help a municipal bond market that froze at the end of 2008 begin functioning again. 

 When the stimulus plan ends on December 31, many of the municipal bond market measures expire. Here are the most notable ones: * Direct-Pay Bonds, taxable debt which pay states, local governments and other bond issuers federal rebates. The biggest program was Build America Bonds, intended for infrastructure projects and paying a rebate equal to 35 percent of interest costs. Recovery Zone Bonds paid a higher subsidy of 45 percent and could be issued by areas hit hard by the recession. There was a limit on how much issuers could sell, and so they had less impact than BABs. School construction bonds, capped at $11 billion, provided a rebate close to 100 percent. These were introduced as tax credit bonds, which give investors credits on their taxes in lieu of interest payments, and later changed to the direct-pay model. * Small issuer limit for bank-qualified bonds The limit on how many bonds issued by small communities and nonprofits that banks could hold was temporarily raised, boosting demand for the debt. * Alternative Minimum Tax exemption Interest paid on private-activity bonds, which are issued to finance facilities that fall out of the purview of typical public works, was exempted from calculations to determine if a bondholder had to pay the Alternative Minimum Tax. * Federal Home Loan Banks Federal Home Loan Banks, a group of cooperatives helping provide financing for economic development and housing, were allowed to issue letters of credit for tax-exempt debt, creating a source for guaranties after the municipal bond insurance industry broke down.
