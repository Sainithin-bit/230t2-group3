 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said Ireland faced big risks that could affect its ability to repay an aid loan as Moody's slashed Dublin's credit rating and European banks warned of future losses on Irish assets. 

 Ireland's 85 billion euro ($113 billion) EU/IMF bailout was conditional on a four-year austerity drive, which critics say risks tipping its economy into a prolonged downturn that will jeopardize its ability to pay down its debt. The International Monetary Fund itself forecast Ireland would miss a target, set by the European Union, of cutting its budget deficit to 3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2015. The Fund forecast a 5.1 percent deficit of GDP by 2014 and 4.8 percent by 2015, without further fiscal measures. "There are significant risks to the program that could affect Ireland's capacity to repay the Fund," the IMF said in a statement, published on Friday but dated December 8, outlining an assessment of risks to the world body from bailing out Ireland. For its part Ireland has pledged to shrink and radically restructure its banks and tackle the worst deficit in Europe. It will squeeze 15 billion euros -- equivalent to around 10 percent of annual economic output -- from its deficit over four years starting with the 2011 budget's record package of 6 billion euros in spending cuts and tax hikes. The IMF and the EU have forecast economic growth of 0.9 percent for 2011, prompting the IMF to question the ambitious 1.7 percent growth target set by Dublin. "The authorities share staff's view on the pattern of recovery, but are somewhat more optimistic about the magnitudes," the IMF said in a staff statement a day after it approved its 22.5 billion euro portion of the loan for Ireland. The bailout also includes 45 billion euros from Europe and 17.5 billion euros which Dublin will contribute itself. Analysts said the divergent forecasts were not welcome. "They should all be singing off a similar hymn sheet. The whole thing is pretty disjointed and it just shows a basic lack of communication," Brian Devine, chief economist at NCB stockbroker said. "DISAPPOINTING" The Irish finance minister on Thursday reiterated the government's forecast remained on track, after third quarter GDP rose 0.5 percent, rebounding from a 1 percent drop in the previous quarter. But on Friday Moody's downgraded Ireland's credit rating five notches to Baa1 -- three notches above junk status -- from Aa1 and warned that further downgrades could follow if Dublin was unable to stabilize its debt, an assessment Prime Minister Brian Cowen described as "disappointing" and "a bit excessive." Ireland's debt levels have quadrupled since late 2007 due to a banking sector meltdown that followed the collapse of a decade-long property boom. Fitch last week to become the first ratings agency to strip Ireland of its A credit status, cutting it by three notches to BBB+. S&P is the only ratings agency that still has Ireland in the top band but that may not last long as it has the country on review for a possible downgrade. The move pushed Irish 10-year government bond yields 7.5 basis points higher to 8.522 percent, and the yield spread over German Bunds widened about 10 bps on the day to 551 bps. CONTAGION THREAT SIGNIFICANT In an attempt to limit problems facing the Irish banking system, the European Central Bank set up a temporary 10 billion pound ($15.6 billion) swap arrangement with the Bank of England on Friday. National Irish Bank, owned by Denmark's Danske Bank's, and part-nationalized British bank Lloyds both warned on Friday of large impairments due to their Irish exposures. The IMF said that while Irish authorities had taken measures to strengthen the banking sector, "vulnerabilities remain acute" and there was a significant risk that further problems in Ireland could reverberate through the region. "Given market perceptions, spillover effects to other peripheral euro-area economies could be large. Greece, Portugal and Spain are the most vulnerable to volatility spillovers from an event in Ireland." The IMF also warned of political risks. An Irish election expected in February or March is likely to produce a new coalition government that wants to amend some bailout terms. Ajay Chopra, deputy director of the IMF's European department, said however the next government would not be able to renegotiate the IMF interest rate or force senior bondholders to shoulder losses.
