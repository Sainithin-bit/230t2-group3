 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday he was worried that EU leaders' piecemeal approach to Europe's debt crisis was encouraging markets to pick off weak countries one by one. 

 Dominique Strauss-Kahn appeared to endorse the idea of common euro bonds, saying they could be a useful tool, but added the political will to give power to the center of Europe was the main hurdle to their creation. "I am worried, and that's why I am urging the Europeans ... to provide a comprehensive solution because this piecemeal approach ... obviously doesn't work," Strauss-Kahn told Reuters. "The markets are just waiting for what's next." Due to its cumbersome decision-making structure, the euro zone has tended to offer countries such as Greece and Ireland rescues only once they were "at the edge of the cliff," he said. That approach has created a domino effect. Interviewed at a Thomson Reuters Newsmaker event, Strauss-Kahn spoke as European Union leaders began a two-day summit at which they agreed changes to the European Union's governing treaty to create a permanent mechanism for handling financial crises. "You can't have a single currency, especially in times when you have troubles, without having more coordination and economic policy," Strauss-Kahn said, also calling on the EU to revisit with more rigor the bank stress tests it carried out earlier this year. Saying decision-making among the 16 countries of the euro zone was too slow, Strauss-Kahn said he was confident that the resources to address countries' debt problems were available in Europe but "fair or unfair, there's skepticism in the markets so the problem has to be addressed." SPAIN SAFE Strauss-Kahn played down worries that Spain faced perils like those confronting debt-strapped Greece and Ireland, recipients of massive bailouts from the European Union and IMF. "I don't see that the risks for Spain will be that big in 2011," he said. "It doesn't mean there is no risk ... but I'm not that pessimistic about the Spanish economy." Spain, the euro zone's fourth-largest economy, paid a hefty premium at a bond auction on Thursday, a test of investor appetite a day after credit ratings agency Moody's said it may cut the country's rating. The IMF chief expressed confidence that the euro currency would survive the crisis and he said, in the end, European institutions would emerge more resilient. "It's a strong currency which behaved during the last 10 years better than even the Deutsche mark in the previous decade," Strauss-Kahn said. "I see many reasons why there may be a problem in the euro zone in terms of growth, unemployment, even, beyond unemployment, social problems ... but that doesn't mean at all that I see any threat to the euro." He added: "Any solution other than the euro would be worse for the euro zone members." He struck a positive note on Ireland's future, saying the EU/IMF rescue will enable the nation to find its way back to economic health. "It's going to work but of course it's difficult," he said. Ireland's parliament on Wednesday gave its stamp of approval to an 85 billion euro joint European Union-IMF bailout, and the IMF's Executive Board on Thursday formally approved its 22.5 billion euro contribution to the rescue. Strauss-Kahn said that, on a global basis, the economic recovery from the 2007-09 financial crisis is not yet secured, with growth at a sluggish pace in Europe and an uncertain outlook in the United States. Still, he said he did not see a risk of the United States slipping back into a recession. Strauss-Kahn pushed aside a question on whether he will give up leadership of the IMF to seek the presidency of France in elections in 2012 -- a source of wide speculation that he did not entirely dismiss. "You know, I have a job. I try to do my job (full time), instead of a part time, so I won't have time to think of something else," he said.
