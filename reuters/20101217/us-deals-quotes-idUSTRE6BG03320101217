 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global mergers and acquisition volumes totaled more than $2.26 trillion so far in 2010, up more than 19 percent from 2009. 

 The following are quotes from top dealmakers on topics including leveraged buyouts, cross border activity and deal size. MATT GRINNELL, HEAD OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS IN EUROPE, BARCLAYS CAPITAL ( BARC.L ) "Will you see more of the 4 to 8 billion euro deals? Yes, but not a lot. One factor is that, while European credit markets are much healthier than they were a year ago, they don't have the same depth that the U.S. markets do. Multiple deals of that size into the European market would be very challenging." JEFFREY RAICH, MANAGING DIRECTOR AND FOUNDER, MOELIS & CO "You're going to see continued cross-border activity. Historically, I thought of cross-border activity being more Europe into U.S. or U.S. into Europe. It's becoming prominently a more global game. I think there are more headlines about China than deals getting consummated, but I think there's going to be a continued trend, as they look to deploy trade surplus and capital into other parts of the world." JEFFREY KAPLAN, GLOBAL HEAD OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS AT BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH ( BAC.N ) "Valuation is always an issue for LBOs and financing markets don't have unlimited depth for all types of credit. Financing is generally available for well structured deals ... For large deals, a $1 billion equity commitment for a sponsor is a large size check. Also, large consortiums are often challenging, so that's not an easy route to go." NIKHIL EAPEN, HEAD OF ASIA PACIFIC TMT BANKING, CITIGROUP ( C.N ) "We expect telecom M&A to pick up next year, which will be driven by cross-border deals and further consolidation in both the telecom and telecom services and tower businesses ... European and Western buyers have less latitude from their shareholders to invest for growth. Their shareholders are more focused on certainty and are averse to anything that reduces the level of certainty around returns." ANDREW LIPSKY, HEAD OF M&A FOR THE AMERICAS, CREDIT SUISSE ( CSGN.VX ) "The conditions are pretty positive for continued M&A activity: inexpensive capital and no indication that is not going to continue; challenged organic growth environment, so companies are looking for external sources of growth; favorable shareholder environment, on a relative basis equities are inexpensive." MATTEO CANONACO, GLOBAL SECTOR HEAD FINANCIAL SPONSORS GROUP AND SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS, HSBC ( HSBA.L ) "Sponsors have accumulated a massive inventory in the run-up to the crisis. From 2001 they were increasing the size of funds they were raising and they were buying more companies and bigger companies. There is an unprecedented number of companies sitting in sponsors' portfolios, eventually, those companies have to get out." KARIM ASSEF, GLOBAL HEAD OF FINANCIAL SPONSORS, BANK OF AMERICA MERRILL LYNCH "We are now seeing a very healthy pipeline of LBOs, many of which are going-private transactions, and of a size that is consistently higher than we've seen all year."
