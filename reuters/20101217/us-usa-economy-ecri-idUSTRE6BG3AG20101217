 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - - A measure of future U.S. economic growth rose to its highest level since May in the latest week, a research group said on Friday. 

 The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group, said its Weekly Leading Index rose to 127.4 in the week ended December 10 from 126.5 the previous week, originally reported at 126.4. That's the highest since May 7, when it stood at 131.9. The index's annualized growth rate rose to minus 0.1 percent from minus 1.4 percent a week ago, originally reported as minus 1.5 percent. That was the highest since May 28, when it was positive 0.1 percent. ECRI will release the index for the week ending December 17 on December 23.
