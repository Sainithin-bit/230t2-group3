 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said Moody's downgrade of Ireland's credit rating by five notches was "disappointing" and a "bit excessive," state broadcaster RTE quoted him as saying on Friday. 

 "He said he was particularly disappointed about the agency's decision to adopt a negative rather than stable outlook," RTE said. Moody's cut Ireland's rating to Baa1 with a negative outlook from Aa2 and warned further downgrades could follow if Dublin was unable to stabilize its debt situation.
