 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The House of Representatives on Thursday approved a change in rules for debating President Barack Obama's $858 billion tax cut legislation, in a move designed to speed the bill toward passage. 

 By a vote of 230-186, the House approved the change. It paves the way for a fuller debate of some Democrats' opposition to the bill's tax treatment for the wealthy, which they argue is too generous at a time of severe fiscal problems. The tax bill, passed by the Senate on Wednesday, is expected to be approved by the House either late on Thursday or early Friday. It would then go to Obama for signing into law. Before that can happen, the House is expected to hold a few more procedural and substantive votes. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan ; editing by  Todd Eastham )
