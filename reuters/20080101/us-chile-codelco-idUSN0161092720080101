 SANTIAGO  (Reuters) - Chile's Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, is hoping for a resolution soon to a strike by workers at its Angamos port, which ships copper from its largest division, Codelco Norte. 

 Workers for the port operator Ultraport started the strike on December 26 to demand higher bonuses, but it has not affected the company's ability to fulfill obligations to customers, Codelco said. Codelco says it has "commercial mechanisms" to deal with the situation, and that it can also use the port of Antofagasta to ship copper if need be. The impact has further been minimized by slower activity over the New Year's holiday this week, a source said on Tuesday, adding that a resolution to the strike could come as early as Wednesday, after the January 1 holiday.
