 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's ruling party aims to set up a national fund that will use several trillion yen (tens of billions of dollars) from the foreign exchange fund special account to invest in overseas resource development projects, the Nikkei business daily said. 

 The plan is part of the Democratic Party of Japan's (DPJ) 5 trillion yen stimulus package proposal, the Nikkei said on Wednesday. (Reporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Edmund Klamann)
