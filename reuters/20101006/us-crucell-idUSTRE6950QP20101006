 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - U.S. healthcare group Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) got backing from Dutch vaccines group Crucell CRCL.AS for its unchanged $2.4 billion takeover bid, brushing aside objections from a small minority of Crucell shareholders. 

 New Jersey-based J&J is poised to be the latest large pharmaceutical company to invest in vaccines with the purchase of Crucell, which is on the cusp of sharp sales growth for its pediatric vaccine Quinvaxem. Crucell said on Wednesday it would recommend shareholders accept J&J's cash offer of 24.75 euros per share. Crucell shares rose to slightly below the offer price, indicating the market does not expect a higher bid. But one shareholder, who holds about 4 percent of Crucell, said the price was too low. "We would not tender our shares at this price, J&J gets a lot of value from this deal, given its client base and the sales potential involved. We consider this the starting point, Crucell's management would need to convince us in the coming days (on the price)," said Jack Jonk, head of equity at Delta Lloyd Asset Management. Delta Lloyd was one of three fund managers that jointly control at least 15.5 percent of Crucell who have previously suggested J&J's offer may undervalue the Dutch company. The others are Robeco and the Van Herk Group. A spokeswoman for Crucell, headed by Ronald Brus, would not comment on whether there had been contact with these investors. Robeco, which owns about 1.5 percent of Crucell, said it had not made a decision on whether it would tender its shares in the offer and would not comment on potential talks with Crucell and Johnson & Johnson. The offer represents a 58 percent premium over Crucell's closing price the day before takeover talks were announced. DIG A LITTLE FURTHER "We have not made our final decision yet because we have to dig a little further, especially into the conditions for the bid to become unconditional," Robeco spokesman Ronald Florisson said. "It could take some time." Van Herk did not immediately respond to requests for comment. J&J has yet to make public the level of acceptances needed for its offer to become unconditional. A J&J spokeswoman said the company expects to file the offer conditions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in coming days. If J&J acquires 95 percent of Crucell it will initiate a squeeze-out to obtain all of Crucell's shares, but if it acquires between 80 and 95 percent, it may use all other available legal measures to clinch full ownership, it said on Wednesday. This included a proposed sale of Crucell's entire business by Crucell to a J&J affiliate, followed by other appropriate steps, it added. "This is referring to an empty box strategy, whereby J&J could transfer Crucell's assets to another company, leaving minorities with nothing," Petercam analyst Jan van den Bossche said. Crucell shares were up 0.3 percent to 24.6250 euros at 1441 GMT, versus a 0.06 percent fall in the STOXX Europe 600 Health Care index .SXDP. J&J, with products from skin care to prescription medicines and headed by William Weldon, already had a 17.9 percent stake in the Dutch vaccines and anti-bodies group when it unveiled the offer in September. The transaction is expected to have a dilutive impact on J&J's 2011 earnings per share of $0.03 to $0.05, the company said. The offer memorandum was expected to be published by the end of November and the transaction was expected to close in the first quarter of 2011, the companies said. Crucell is on the cusp of sharp sales growth for its pediatric vaccine Quinvaxem after a production failure at rival Shantha Biotechnics which was bought by Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) last year for 6.1 times annual sales. The J&J offer for Crucell is at 5.5 times estimated sales. Barclays and Lazard are advising Crucell. (Additional reporting by  Marcel Michelson , Editing by Louise Heavens and Erica Billingham)
