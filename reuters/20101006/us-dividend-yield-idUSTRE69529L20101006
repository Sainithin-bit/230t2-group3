 LONDON  (Reuters) - European stock investors hunting for returns could strike it rich if they look past traditional dividend payers to cash-rich corporates in sectors such as pharmaceuticals, autos and mobile phones. 

 A rush to cut costs during the financial crisis means many firms have higher margins, stronger cash flow and lower debt, and could opt to sweeten investors facing a sluggish, jobless recovery by returning cash to shareholders. The dividend play has long focused on financials, utilities and oil firms, but the free cash flow (FCF) of firms such as drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ), carmaker BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and mobile phone maker Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), among others, could lead to some surprises. FCF is the cash that a company is able to generate after setting aside money for maintaining or expanding its asset base. JP Morgan Cazenove's Mislav Matejka is one of those championing a "surprise dividend" equities strategy in response to the underperformance in 2010 of traditional dividend paying sectors such as utilities. "To play a pure, simple vanilla dividend yield strategy actually failed this year and I think it's going to continue to fail," he said, describing the relative performance of traditional dividend payers, on a total returns basis. Citing BMW and Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) as examples, Matejka said their share price gains this year were largely because of a strong balance sheet and investors betting on a share buy back or dividend. For the quarter ended June 2010, Daimler had FCF of around 2 billion euros, with a FCF-to-enterprise value (EV) of 7.2 percent, according to Starmine data, up sharply from its end-2008 negative cash flow from operations. Daimler's forward 12-month dividend yield projection is currently around 3.7 percent, according to Starmine's SmartEstimate, leading comparative yields of 0.4 percent to 2.8 percent among its sector rivals. The German firm also outperforms sectorally -- on a forward 12-months relative valuation basis -- on EV-to-sales, price-to-cash flow and price-to-book value, Starmine data shows. Since hitting a year low of 29.9 euros at end-February, Daimler stock has risen steadily and now trades at around 44 euros. "Corporates are in a very strong position, surprisingly strong given the stage of the cycle," said Matejka, adding a lot of sectors that would historically have had weaker balance sheets "are actually generating a lot of cash, and have the scope to return cash to shareholders." With debt yields hammered by low interest rates and gold at a record high, equities remain a popular arena for those seeking a little more reward for their risk, and dividends historically form a central plank of that payback. "Dividends are the main source of total equity returns. The dividend and the dividend growth are the primary contributor for an equity investor," said Manu Vandenbulck, senior investment manager at ING Investment Management. "If you do a breakdown of total equity returns over the last 40 years, and longer, the dividend and dividend growth represent more than two-thirds of your total shareholder return, while capital gains represent less than 30 percent," he added. That fact was all but irrelevant last year as investors sought to play the bounce back from a post-Lehman Brothers low in stock valuations. But with many economic commentators now hinting at a sub-trend recovery, and European shares up less than 3 percent this year, the "divi" is back in play. Global growth would likely be sluggish into 2011, the International Monetary Fund said this week, and if strength in emerging markets is stripped out, the growth outlook is even worse. RELATIVE VALUE While dividend yield is traditionally a favored defensive, bear-market play, low interest rates mean the dividend yields of a number of large-cap companies are currently trading above their corporate bond yield. The inversion was "quite an exceptional occurrence," said Joelle Anamootoo, strategist at Deutsche Bank, citing firms such as engineer ABB ( ABBN.VX ), insurer Allianz ( ALVG.DE ) and chemicals group BASF BASF.DE as examples. Such a move was, Anamootoo said, evidence high dividend-payers could outperform in a rising market, with the added bonus of potential stock price upside should the economic recovery pick up pace. Other stocks to benefit, she said, include drugmakers GSK, Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ), Novartis ( NOVN.VX ) and Roche ( ROG.VX ), Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and more traditional payers such as electricity firm E.ON ( EONGn.DE ) and oil major ENI ( ENI.MI ). According to Thomson Reuters Datastream data, the average dividend yield in fiscal year 2010 of all the companies mentioned by Anamootoo is 4.58 percent, against an average 1.84 percent for their bonds. Playing the surprise dividend and yield disparity c an throw up winners but a strong investment story is also important, said Simon Gergel, fund manager at RCM. "I'm not just investing in companies where the dividend is safe, I'm also looking for good, long-term prospects; which could be structural growth or could be very strong cashflow and ability to buy back shares, and so on," he said. Gergel has already bought fixed income investment firm Ashmore ( ASHM.L ), for its growth story and strong balance sheet, and likes advertising giant WPP ( WPP.L ) and manufacturing buyout firm Melrose NYN.L, for their success in rebuilding margins. Melrose's current operating margin is 9.4 percent, Starmine data shows -- above its 5-year average of 7.9 percent -- helping it boost free cash flow and, potentially, fund dividends. While a dividend is just one way for companies to use excess cash, a recent Merrill Lynch fund manager survey showed an increase in the number who want a return to shareholders, over mergers and acquisitions or balance-sheet strengthening. "History shows M&A can be quite tricky in delivering value for the shareholder, said ING Investment Management's Vandenbulck. "It doesn't mean it makes no sense to do M&A, it just means it's harder to add value to a company through M&A than through increasing the dividend."
