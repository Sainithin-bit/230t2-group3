 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) has sold $1.6 billion in sales finance portfolios from its retail partner card business to GE Capital, the companies announced on Tuesday. 

 The terms of the deal were not disclosed. The assets were from the partner cards unit in Citi Holdings, the bank's repository for businesses that it is trying to sell or wind down. Retail Partner Cards provides consumer and commercial credit card products and services for U.S. retail customers. In the deal, GE Capital said it was acquiring about 36 retail portfolios. Citi said it plans to continue working on accounts on an interim basis until the first quarter of 2011. GE Capital said the deal would provide consumer financing programs in main segments of its business, including home furnishings, flooring, consumer electronics and heating, ventilation and air conditioning.
