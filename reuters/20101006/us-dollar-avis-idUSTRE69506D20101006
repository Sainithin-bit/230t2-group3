 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Car rental companies Avis Budget Group Inc CAR.N and Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc DTG.N said on Tuesday they will cooperate on efforts to win antitrust clearance for Avis to buy Dollar Thrifty. 

 Avis has agreed to Dollar Thrifty's request to defer making an exchange offer while they pursue approval for the proposed acquisition, the companies said in a joint statement. The companies said they would make no further announcement on the matter. Last month, Hertz Global Holdings ( HTZ.N )walked away from its $1.4 billion offer to buy Dollar Thrifty DTG.N, leaving an opening for competitor Avis Budget. The acquisition of Dollar Thrifty, one of the few major car rental companies to post a profit in 2009, would have given Hertz dominance in the low-cost car rental business, mainly focused on off-airport locations and leisure travelers. Avis has been working for months to wrest Dollar Thrifty from Hertz and has put a higher, roughly $1.5 billion bid on the table. But Dollar Thrifty's board remained loyal to Hertz despite the higher bid, citing worries about the ability of Avis to obtain antitrust approval. Avis had said on Sept 30 it would commence an exchange offer within 10 days. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; editing by Carol Bishopric)
