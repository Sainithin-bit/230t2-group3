 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) looked set to abandon its $116 billion iron-ore joint venture with BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ), a deal unpopular with regulators, customers and many of Rio Tinto's own investors. 

 The companies have been aiming to meet a year-end deadline for a binding agreement on the joint venture, which should save around $10 billion a year on capital and production costs. Some consumers of the raw material for steelmaking fear a tie-up would be monopolistic, as, along with top iron ore miner, Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ), the Anglo-Australian groups control about 70 percent of the globe's seaborne iron ore trade. Following is a TIMELINE on the attempts to form a joint venture. 2009 June 5 - Rio says to raise $21 billion through a rights issue and announces joint venture with BHP. June 9 - Japanese, Chinese and European steelmakers join forces to fight the Rio-BHP plan, while China calls for "a fully open international market." Eurofer says the jv poses competition issues, urges EU antitrust bodies to investigate. June 12 - Australia's government gives cautious support for the jv, as a newspaper reports China had threatened sanctions against the two if the deal went ahead. June 17 - A senior Chinese official from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) says proposed jv has "a strong monopolistic flavor," and Chinese firms are actively seeking ways to cope with it. Oct 15 - Rio and BHP say they have scrapped plans to co-market iron ore from the proposed jv. Oct 22 - BHP chairman says jv is on track. Nov 9 - Rio and BHP have not received any indications the Europe will block the deal, says the head of Rio's iron ore division. Nov 26 - BHP dismisses talk that Rio is baulking at the proposed $116 billion jv, says they are close to a binding agreement, which is due to be signed by December 5. 2010 June 21 - The Western Australia government approves requests by Rio and BHP to share port and rail lines and blend iron ore from in return for higher royalty payments Oct 6 - The Sydney Morning Herald quotes Rio Chairman Jan du Plessis addressing a board meeting in terms that indicate the joint venture was all but dead and buried. Rio statement acknowledges "communications from regulators that indicate potential obstacles to achieving clearance." Source: Reuters (Compiled by James Regan; Editing by  Ed Davies )
