 RIO DE JANEIRO  (Reuters) - Brazilian mining company Vale ( VALE.N )( VALE5.SA ), the world's largest producer of iron ore, will invest at least $20 billion in 2011, a source close to the company said on Wednesday. 

 Vale is slated to approve its investment plan during a board meeting next week and plans to formally announce the investment plans at an event at the New York Stock Exchange on October 18, said the source, who asked not to be named. "They are only going to make the final decision during the extraordinary board meeting, but it will not be less than $20 billion," the source said, adding that did not include costs associated with acquisitions. That figure is considerably higher than the $12.9 billion in outlays slated for 2010. It also exceeds the $14.2 billion investment budget it originally set out for 2009 but later cut to around $9 billion because of the financial crisis. That reduction, along with the dismissal of some workers, sparked heavy criticism by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Vale's principal investment projects include the Serra Sul mine, linked to the giant Carajas project, which is expected to add an additional 90 million tons per year of iron ore production by the second semester of 2013. The company is also developing projects in Canada and Africa and, according to Reuters sources, has bid on coal assets in Colombia. (Reporting by Denise Luna)
