 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Google has denied Oracle's complaint of copyright infringement in development of Android smartphone software and asked a U.S. court to dismiss Oracle's lawsuit, court documents showed. 

 Oracle sued Google in August, alleging patent and copyright infringement in the development of the popular Android smartphone software. In its response filed on Monday with a California federal court, Google said Oracle's complaint included vague and broad allegations of copyright infringement. "The complaint does not specifically identify any allegedly infringing works of Google," the web search company said. "Oracle's claim of copyright infringement fails to meet the pleading standards applicable to a claim of copyright infringement," Google said. Google said Android was an open-source platform and all relevant source code and documentation associated with the project has been publicly available for some time. The case is IN re: Oracle of America Inc v Google Inc, Case No: 10-03561, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by Dan Lalor)
