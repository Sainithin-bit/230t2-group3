 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) posted smaller-than-expected quarterly profit margins and slower U.S. same-store sales growth in September, raising concerns over its prospects for the key holiday season. 

 Several industry analysts noted that U.S. sales in September rose 2 percent at stores open at least a year, excluding gasoline, compared with their expectations of a 4 percent increase. The shortfall suggests Costco could see a decline in same-store sales later this year as it matches up with tough comparisons from the latter part of 2009, said Brian Sozzi, analyst at Wall Street Strategies. Costco Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said a decision to send out promotional materials to shoppers by mail later in September likely hurt sales that month, but could spur more purchases in October. Sales of some bigger-ticket items like televisions were also down. "The core stuff is doing great: fresh foods, small and medium-priced nonfood items," Galanti said. Costco also is taking a relatively positive, and aggressive, view in ordering merchandise for the holidays, he said. "We feel good about the stuff we're getting in the door. We feel good about selling through without risk of big markdowns," Galanti said. Costco shares had rallied more than 25 percent since the end of August as investors believed it was well positioned for any recovery in the U.S. economy. Costco had also seen improving sales of discretionary items, including apparel, which had been expected to boost margins. Shares of Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club operator, slid 0.5 percent on Wednesday, while discounter Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) rose 0.9 percent and BJ's Wholesale Corp BJ.N fell 1.2 percent. MARGIN DISAPPOINTS Costco's gross margin came in at 10.88 percent in its fiscal fourth quarter, compared with a consensus estimate of 10.93 percent, Sozzi said. That could indicate the retailer was more aggressive in cutting prices for food and other merchandise, he said. Costco, which sells bulk packages of everything from diapers to detergent, said profit was $432 million, or 97 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended August 29, compared with $374 million, or 85 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast a profit of 95 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at Costco stores open at least a year rose 5 percent in September, compared with the average analyst estimate of 4.5 percent compiled by Thomson Reuters Data. But that is a slowdown from the 7 percent increase seen in August. Still, a majority of analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S rate Costco a "buy" or "strong buy" based on its strength in international sales, a potential increase in membership fees next year and expectations the company could use cash to raise its dividend or buy back more shares. "Strong traffic and solid membership trends continue to impress us, suggesting that COST is poised to benefit from higher market share gains in an economic recovery," Janney Capital Markets analyst David Strasser said in a research note. Costco previously said that sales for the quarter rose 8 percent to $23.6 billion. Same-store sales rose 6 percent. Costco shares fell 81 cents to $63.85 on the New York Stock Exchange.
