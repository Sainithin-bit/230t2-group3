 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The prospect of more cheap money from world central banks fueled a rally in global bond prices on Wednesday and pushed the dollar to a 15-year low against the yen and an 8-1/2-month low against major currencies. 

 U.S. Treasuries, German bunds and Japanese Government Bonds extended their price gains as weak economic data bolstered speculation that governments will take additional actions to reinvigorate the global economic recovery. Speculation the Federal Reserve will engage in another round of "quantitative easing" -- effectively printing money to buy assets -- intensified after a report showed a drop in private U.S. payrolls last month. Moreover, the Bank of Japan on Tuesday cut interest rates close to zero and said it would pump cash into Japan's financial system through asset purchases. Investors also piled into gold, a favorite safe haven, pushing the metal to another record above $1,345 an ounce, while copper powered to its highest in more than two years on the weakening dollar. The Dow Jones industrial average settled modestly higher and the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500 index closed slightly lower. "Investors continue to dance to the tune of quantitative easing and its intended inflation of asset prices," hedge fund manager Doug Kass of Seabreeze Partners told clients. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were yielding 2.40 percent, down from 2.47 percent late on Tuesday, after an ADP Employer Services report showed private payrolls unexpectedly contracted in September. The yield fell as low as 2.38 percent, the lowest since January 2009. The five-year note rose 6/32 in price to yield 1.16 percent after dipping to a record low of 1.12 percent. The yield was down from 1.20 percent late on Tuesday. The December Bund future touched a session high of 132.04 after the ADP employment data. Private employers cut 39,000 jobs in September, the largest monthly loss since January, the report said. Analysts had forecast a rise of 24,000 jobs. "It is definitely a disappointing number and confirms the jobless recovery that we were all fearing," said Nick Kalivas, senior equity index analyst at MF Global in Chicago. Kalivas said the data was "one of the reasons why people believe the Fed is willing to essentially expand its quantitative easing program." BOJ SPARKS WORLD STIMULUS HOPE Speculation of more easing around the world has grown since the Bank of Japan cut interest rates close to zero on Tuesday and said it would pump cash into Japan's financial system through asset purchases. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans was quoted on Tuesday as saying the central back should conduct "much more" monetary easing. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares closed up 0.46 percent at 1,070.68 points, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index  .N225  rose 1.81 percent. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS rose 0.61 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 22.93 points, or 0.21 percent, to 10,967.65. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 0.78 point, or 0.07 percent, at 1,159.97. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 19.17 points, or 0.80 percent, to 2,380.66. Spot gold prices rose $8.05, or 0.60 percent, to $1348.30. Conversely, the dollar was down against major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.44 percent at 77.41 from a previous session close of 77.749. The euro rose above its 200-week moving average around $1.3921 to reach its highest level since February. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar was down 0.40 percent at 82.88 from a previous session close of 83.210. U.S. light sweet crude oil was up 0.41 percent at $83.16 a barrel. The Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index .CRB was up 0.73 points, or 0.25 percent, at 289.15.
