 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc ( STZ.N ) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit as U.S. consumers bought more higher-priced wine, sending its shares up more than 4 percent. 

 The world's largest branded winemaker, whose portfolio includes Robert Mondavi and Ravenswood, also attributed its strategy of having exclusive distributors as a reason for its improving performance, and affirmed its full-year forecast. Constellation said it was gaining share in the U.S. wine market and that sales of more expensive wines were outpacing cheaper wines, in a sign consumers are "trading up." "Consumers are buying a higher grade of wine, but as you move up the price ladder, you are seeing a reasonable amount of discounting," Chief Financial Officer Bob Ryder said on a conference call. Constellation expects its level of promotions for the second half of the year to be roughly in line with the year-ago period, which was more promotional than normal. "As to what's going on in the marketplace, we expect generally promotional activity to be fairly high," said Chief Executive Rob Sands. Net income fell to $91.3 million, or 43 cents per share, in Constellation's fiscal second quarter, ended on August 31, from $99.7 million, or 45 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, earnings were 52 cents per share, topping analysts' average estimate of 49 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net sales fell 1.6 percent to $862.8 million, due in part to the sale of Constellation's U.K. cider business, but topped analysts' estimate of $855.9 million. Organic net sales, which strip out acquisitions, divestitures and currency fluctuations, rose 2 percent. On that basis, wine sales in Australia and Europe rose 4 percent. North American wine sales also rose 4 percent, helped by an increase in sales volume and selling a larger proportion of higher-priced wines. D.A. Davidson analyst Tim Ramey said the improvement in the U.S. wine business was good news. "That maybe tells you something about the economy," Ramey said. Yet spirits sales fell 15 percent and Constellation blamed a tough comparison with the year-ago period, during which Svedka vodka sales rose about 90 percent. Equity earnings from Constellation's joint venture with Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), which imports beers such as Corona into the United States, fell 10 percent, with sales hurt by lower volume, higher promotions and the selling of more lower-priced beers. The company also blamed a brewery strike in Mexico and Hurricane Alex for supply disruptions. The company said it was not expecting any big changes in prices or promotions of beer. For its current fiscal year, which ends in February 2011, Constellation affirmed its outlook for earnings of $1.63 to $1.78 per share, excluding items. Constellation shares rose 74 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $18.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by  Derek Caney , Dave Zimmerman)
