 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ADP's national employment report on Wednesday said U.S. private employer payrolls fell by 39,000 jobs in September. 

 KEY POINTS: * Reuters consensus forecast for ADP payroll change for September was for increase of 24,000 jobs * US ADP August payroll change revised to +10,000 from -10,000 COMMENTS: NICK KALIVAS, SENIOR EQUITY INDEX ANALYST, MF GLOBAL, CHICAGO: "It is definitely a disappointing number relative to expectations. It is confirming a bit the jobless recovery that we are all kind of fearing. It certainly has taken a little bit of the wind out of the equity market. This is one of the reasons why people believe that the Fed in willing to essentially expand its quantative easing program. It's going to probably going to consolidate the market from yesterday's strong gains." RUDY NARVAS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK: "Whether you believe in the ADP forecast or not, there is downside risk to the government's non-farm payrolls survey on Friday. When you look at the mix of the jobs, the goods producing sector created most of them. "This not a good report for the U.S. economy, but you have take it a grain of salt since ADP has consistently undercounted what the government payrolls have shown. "Still it really cements the fact that the Fed has to step in with more stimulus. The labor market is still struggling here. S&P stock futures pulled back already and bonds have moved up in response to this, as the markets are pricing another round of stimulus from the Fed." ZACH PANDL, U.S. ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "It's not earth shatteringly bad, but it's worse than expected. We did get an upward revision to the last month. Over the past six months the ADP number has underperformed nonfarm payrolls by 80,000. "It's still possible to get a strong positive payrolls number, but it does suggest some downside risk and it trims the upper tail off of the potential outcomes for Friday. "The decline in manufacturing payrolls accelerated during the month. There's potential for a repeat of worsening manufacturing job market in Friday's report. "But in general if we get anything looking like this on Friday, QE-2 is a done deal at the November 3 (Fed) meeting." OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INC., WASHINGTON: "ADP is not the best gauge of Friday's non-farm payrolls but the fact we got such a negative print, below consensus, does increase the risk for a downside number on Friday. "If that's the case, it will cement expectations for additional Fed easing in November likely pushing the dollar down across the board while helping all the other risk assets, such as stocks, emerging currencies as well as the Australian and New Zealand dollars." ERIC VILORIA, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, NEW YORK: "The ADP number was disappointing, as it's still negative overall. It looks like the dollar has declined a bit, though ADP hasn't recently had that great a correlation with the official NFP number. But it all adds to the case for the Fed coming in to create more stimulus. Labor is the most important thing to look at, as that's what's really driving the economy. It all starts with employment, because if you have more jobs, people spend more, you see more hiring." FRANK LESH, FUTURES ANALYST, FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC, CHICAGO: "That's going the wrong way. But we're not really coming off too hard, actually. Maybe we'll take a little more time to react here today. Market just got done making new highs here, but we are sort of holding. So for the moment it seems like we are discounting this number and we'll wait for the real thing and hope for the better on Friday. But for now, it may well have stopped our advance. "The market has been looking pretty good and there seems to be some decent sentiment about earnings, which we are going to start dealing with real soon."
