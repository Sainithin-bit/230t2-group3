 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Monday that its U.S. sales slipped 2 percent in November as falling home prices and rising gas prices hurt consumer demand. 

 Chrysler said it delivered 161,088 new vehicles in the United States in November, compared with 164,556 a year earlier. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty )
