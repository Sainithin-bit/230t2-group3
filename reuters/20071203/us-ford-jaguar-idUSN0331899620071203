 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Monday that the automaker could announce the sale of its premium British brands Jaguar and Land Rover by the end of the year. 

 "We will probably have something to announce by the end of this year, toward the first part of next year," Mulally told reporters at a ceremony marking the formal signing of the four-year labor contract reached last month with the United Auto Workers union. Ford has narrowed the auction of Jaguar and Land Rover to three bids. The remaining bidders include Indian carmaker Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ) and rival Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd ( MAHM.BO ), which has teamed up with buyout firm Apollo. The U.S. automaker has been exploring a sale of the brands since June. The brands have been valued by a Merrill Lynch analyst at as much as $1.5 billion combined. Mulally was joined at the signing ceremony by Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. and UAW President Ron Gettelfinger at the automaker's headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. The Ford CEO said the automaker is keeping an eye on the slowing U.S. economy and will adjust production of vehicles according to market demand. U.S. vehicle sales are on track to finish the year with the lowest tally since 1998. With concern mounting about the risk of recession, many analysts are now expecting a continued slide in U.S. vehicle sales through 2008, which would mark the third consecutive year of lower sales. Ford, which on Monday posted a 0.4 percent increase in U.S. sales in November, set its targeted first-quarter production at 685,000 vehicles in North America, a 7.4 percent reduction from year-ago levels. "Clearly with the economy and the subprime and the credit (market) being down, we will continue to watch that very carefully through 2008 ... and adjust our production to match demand," Mulally said. In wide-ranging remarks, Mulally also said the automaker has made a "significant improvement" in the competitive gap with Asian automakers with the new labor contract. Ford and the other U.S. automakers were looking to reduce their operating costs through the new UAW contract to be more competitive with Japanese automakers such as Toyota Motor Corp  ( 7203.T ). Ford clinched a new four-year labor deal for over 54,000 UAW workers on November 3 that will pay new hires lower wages between $26 and $31 an hour, including benefits. Ford, which is restructuring its North American operations to return to sustained profits, also scaled back its plans to close 16 factories. Ford Chairman Bill Ford said the company will respond to new fuel economy standards passed last week by the U.S. Congress. "We have to do it," Bill Ford said, but added that meeting the goal would be a "stretch." (Reporting by Poornima Gupta, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and  Leslie Gevirtz )
