 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) on Monday said its U.S. sales rose 4.7 percent in November, driven by increased demand for its crossover vehicles and small cars. 

 The Japanese automaker said it sold 111,431 vehicles in the United States last month, including results for its luxury Acura brand. That compared with 106,446 vehicles a year earlier. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty ; editing by John Wallace)
