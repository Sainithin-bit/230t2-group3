 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Monday its November U.S. sales rose narrowly from a year earlier despite the pressure from rising fuel prices and declining home prices. 

 The Japanese automaker said its overall U.S. sales were up 0.3 percent from a year earlier. Toyota-brand sales were up 1.4 percent. Sales for the company's luxury Lexus unit were down. Lexus passenger car sales were down 7.8 percent, while Lexus-brand light truck sales were down 5.7 percent, Toyota said. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
