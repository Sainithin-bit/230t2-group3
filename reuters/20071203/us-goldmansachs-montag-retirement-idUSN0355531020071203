 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Thomas Montag, Goldman Sachs' ( GS.N ) co-head of global securities, said he plans to retire at year's end, the Wall Street Journal said Monday in its online edition. 

 Upon retiring, Montag will become a senior director, the Journal said, adding no successor has been named. Representatives of Goldman Sachs could not immediately be reached for comment. "Tom has played a leading role in the development of the firm's derivatives businesses in Europe and Asia," Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein and co-presidents Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried said Friday in a firm-wide email, the Journal said.
