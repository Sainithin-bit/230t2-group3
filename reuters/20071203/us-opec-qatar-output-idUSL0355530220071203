 DUBAI  (Reuters) - OPEC is unlikely to change crude oil output when its ministers meet in the United Arab Emirates this week, Qatar's Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah was quoted as saying in remarks published on Monday. 

 "Attiyah ... said it was unlikely OPEC would amend production levels at the Abu Dhabi meeting on Wednesday," al-Hayat newspaper reported without providing a direct quotation. It said he "had consultations with ministers from OPEC in Doha and they shared the view that oil supplies were sufficient..." The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is under pressure from consumer nations to boost supply to lower prices that late last month hit a record high near $100 a barrel. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said on the sidelines of a meeting in the Qatari capital Doha on Saturday that it was unclear if OPEC needs to raise output to meet a rise in demand in during the northern hemisphere's winter. Attiyah said on Saturday that oil group should tread softly to avoid flooding the market with oil it cannot absorb while paying heed to concerns about a possible global recession. OPEC oil ministers will weigh indications that supply and demand fundamentals are sound against the possibility of making a modest increase to calm consumers, OPEC sources have said.
