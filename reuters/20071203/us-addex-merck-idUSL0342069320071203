 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss biotech company Addex could receive up to $170.5 million from a collaboration and licensing deal with Merck & Co Inc to develop Parkinson's disease drugs, it said on Monday. 

 The two companies are aiming to develop a new class of oral drugs, initially to treat Parkinson's and potentially other, undisclosed indications, Addex said. Drugmaker Merck & Co will pay Addex $3 million upfront, plus possible milestones of $106.5 million for the first product developed for multiple indications, Addex said. Additional milestone payments of up to $61 million would be payable if the collaboration develops one or two more drugs. Addex is the latest in a line of biotechs that have listed on the Swiss bourse, raising 137 million Swiss francs ($122.4 million) in an initial public offering earlier this year. But its shares have suffered since the listing, losing almost half of their value to close at 36.50 Swiss francs on Friday. (Reporting by  Sam Cage ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
