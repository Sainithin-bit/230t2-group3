 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President Janet Yellen said on Monday she has an open mind for what monetary policy decision should be made when the Fed's rate-setting committee meets next week, but that she sees downside risks to the economic outlook. 

 "That decision is open, even in my own mind," she told reporters after a speech to business leaders in Seattle. Yellen also said she would consider steps the Fed could use to alleviate tight conditions in the money market, including a further narrowing of the spread between the rate at the discount window and the federal funds rate. Yellen is not a voting member this year on the Fed's rate-setting committee. The Fed has cut benchmark interest rates by a cumulative 75 basis points since mid-September. Markets widely expect another rate cut next week. (Reporting by Tamawa Kadoya; Editing by Dan Grebler)
