 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Teamsters union is seeking a membership vote to represent mechanics at United Airlines UAUA.O, the labor group said on Monday. 

 The Teamsters filed a petition with the National Mediation Board, saying it hoped to conduct a vote within the next six weeks. United's 10,000 active and furloughed mechanics have been represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association (AMFA) since 2003. Teamsters represent 40,000 airline workers, including 9,000 mechanics and related employees at 11 airlines. These include UPS Inc ( UPS.N ), AirTran Holdings AAI.N and Frontier Airlines Holdings Inc FRNT.O. "United's airline mechanics deserve a strong voice that will stand up to management's attack on their economic security and on the flying public's safety," Teamsters President Jim Hoffa said in a statement. Stephen MacFarlane, assistant national director of AMFA, said the Teamsters "have every right" to pursue United mechanics but AMFA will represent its position. "It's one thing to file for an election. It's another thing to get it," MacFarlane said. AMFA represents mechanics at Northwest Airlines NWA.N, Alaska Airlines ( ALK.N ) and other carriers. A spokeswoman for United had no immediate comment other than to say the choice of representation is up to the employees. The airline said it had not yet been notified by the mediation board of a petition to change union membership for the machinists. (Reporting by  John Crawley , editing by Dave Zimmerman,  Gary Hill )
