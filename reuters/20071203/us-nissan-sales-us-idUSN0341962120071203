 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) said on Monday its U.S. sales rose 6.1 percent in November from a year earlier despite signs that industry-wide sales had faltered because of weaker consumer confidence. 

 Sales for Nissan-brand vehicles rose 6.8 percent, while sales for the automaker's luxury Infiniti unit were up 2.1 percent from a year earlier, Nissan's Senior Vice President for U.S. Sales Mark McNabb told Reuters. "It was a tough market," McNabb said. "It was tougher than I anticipated." (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki , editing by Maureen Bavdek)
