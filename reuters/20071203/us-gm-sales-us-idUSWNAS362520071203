 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Monday its U.S. light vehicle sales fell 11 percent in November as consumer demand softened amid a weak housing market and high gas prices. 

 GM said it sold 261,273 light vehicles in the United States last month compared to 293,558 vehicles a year earlier. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
