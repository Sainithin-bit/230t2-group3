 PITTSBURGH  (Reuters) - Following are excerpts of comments by leaders and other officials from the Group of 20 on Friday at the end of their two-day meeting in Pittsburgh. 

 GLOBAL ECONOMY U.S. President Barack Obama "It is worth recalling the situation we faced six months ago -- a contracting economy, sky-rocketing unemployment, stagnant trade and a financial system that was nearly frozen. Some were warning of a second Great Depression." "But because of the bold and coordinated action that we took, millions of jobs have been saved or created, the decline in output has been stopped, financial markets have come back to life and we stopped the crisis from spreading further to the developing world." "Still, we know there is much further to go." "First, we agreed to sustain our recovery plans until growth is restored and a new framework for prosperity is in place ... But we can't stop there. Going forward, we cannot tolerate the same old boom-and-bust economy of the past. We can't grow complacent." "Second, we agreed to take concrete steps to move forward with tough new financial regulations so that a crisis like this can never happen again ... Those who abuse the system must be held accountable..." "Third, we agreed to phase out subsidies for fossil fuel ... This reform will increase our energy security. It will help transform our economy so that we're creating the clean-energy jobs of the future. And it will help us combat the threat posed by climate change." "Finally, we agreed to reform our system of global economic cooperation and governance. We can no longer meet the challenges of the 21st century with 20th century approaches. And that's why the G20 will take the lead in building a new approach to cooperation." Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper "Although we are seeing signs of economic recovery, the gains are fragile at best. We must stay the course. This is no time to be sinking into complacency." "We've still got big work ahead of us ... We're not out of the woods on the recession." British Prime Minister Gordon Brown "G20 leaders today confirmed that our combined response to last year's collapse in the global economy, the response we agreed in London in April, has been successful. To quote the communique: 'It worked'" "And today we have gone further. We agreed: - To sustain our strong policy response until a durable recovery is secured and avoid a premature withdrawal of the stimulus. As a result of our action this year and next, we estimate that 15 million jobs can be created or saved. - To launch a framework, a compact for strong sustainable and balanced growth. This heralds a new era of global economic management to ensure there is no repeat of the crisis we have witnessed. - To fundamentally reform the banking sector, including reforming the bonus system to reward long-term success and avoid excessive risk-taking -- there can be no return to the old ways. The commitment on bonuses will bring an end to the unacceptable and disgraced old system -- with bonuses now subject to deferral, clawback and the right of regulators to limit compensation." "Here in Pittsburgh, leaders representing two-thirds of the planet's population have agreed to a global plan for jobs, growth and a sustained economic recovery." "This week, we have taken steps toward building a better world." Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama "When demand and consumption was strong in the United States, Japan relied on external demand to develop enormously. Even now, Japanese industry relies quite extensively on external demand." "But world consumption is falling amid the financial crisis that began in the United States. In this age, Americans also believe they have to raise their savings." "The economic model of relying on external demand may no longer be able to lead Japan's economy. So we believe we must conduct policies to stimulate consumption even more than in the past." Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva "We decided no country should stop their counter-cyclical policies. The global crisis is not over -- it is easing in some countries but it is still strong in others. Saudi Arabian Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf "Everyone agrees we should think about the exit strategy but not yet talk about implementing the exit strategy." "It is still premature and we could still have a setback so it is too early to start a program of exit from stimulus packages and again I think it should be country specific." Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "There is no economic crisis in India. It is certainly true that as a sequel to the global economic crisis, our exports have suffered. That has effected the rate of growth. But even then, our economy is growing at a rate of 6.0 to 6.5 percent." - - - - BANKERS' BONUSES Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg "What was accepted here today is that we cannot regulate greed and greed will return after this crisis. But we have now got agreement on how we can at least balance this greed." - - - - TRADE World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy "Today the leaders have clearly spoken about what they expect on the Doha round, a conclusion in 2010. It is now up to their negotiators to walk the talk, starting Monday in Geneva." Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "I think things could be worse as regards to protectionism. There is evidence of creeping protectionism, which has not reached an alarming rate." "India is worried about protectionism facing its products in many developed countries, the United States included." "The United States is as interested as any country (in getting a Doha deal) and I have no reason to doubt his (Obama's) sincerity." - - - -
