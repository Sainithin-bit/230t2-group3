 PITTSBURGH  (Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso expressed concern on Friday that the G20 countries were not moving fast enough to help achieve a United Nations agreement on fighting climate change. 

 "We will only achieve a full and sustainable recovery if we also tackle climate change and kick-start trade. This is a test of credibility for the G20 -- failure is not an option," he said in a statement at the close of the leaders' summit. "I do not hide my concern at the slow rate of progress. Negotiations cannot be an open-ended process. It's time to get serious now, not later." (Reporting by  Jeff Mason  and  Darren Ennis ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
