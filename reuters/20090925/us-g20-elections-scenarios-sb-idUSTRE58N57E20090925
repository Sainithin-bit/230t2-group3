 PITTSBURGH  (Reuters) - The personal stakes are especially high for world leaders attending the G20 summit in Pittsburgh whose countries soon face elections -- or the possibility of them: 

 GERMANY Chancellor Angela Merkel had to interrupt her last days of campaigning for Sunday's election to attend the G20. The center-right Merkel looks on track to win a second term, but needs to shore up support to avoid another "grand coalition" with her center-left rivals, the Social Democrats. The G20 gives Merkel a chance to remind voters that she can hold her own on a world stage with leaders such as U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. It also gives her a forum to push for tighter regulation of the financial institutions whose risk-taking is blamed for unleashing the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Merkel could benefit from movement on regulation at the summit, and needs to be seen to be as tough on the topic as Social Democrats tap an anti-big business mood. Campaigning, she has warned Germans that Obama and Brown could yield to Wall Street and City of London bankers and soften the push for more regulation. Analysts worry that another awkward grand coalition with the SPD would be less stable and more prone to infighting than the one Merkel has led for four years. BRITAIN Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who must call a general election by June 2010, arrives in Pittsburgh needing to convince his demoralized Labor Party he can confound the polls and lead it to a fourth successive term on the back of an economy recovering from a deep recession. The G20 gives Brown the chance to portray himself as a leading player on the international stage, although that effort was dampened somewhat by British news reports -- denied by Washington and London -- that Brown had asked repeatedly for a private meeting with Obama and been snubbed. Like Obama, Brown has been the target of critics who say the U.S. and British governments, beholden to bankers, could be too reluctant to regulate the financial industry, or -- an issue resonant with voters -- to rein in bankers' massive bonuses. Brown could also benefit from anything on climate change at the summit, or look weak without an advance. He became the first world leader to announce that he would personally attend the climate change summit in Copenhagen in December. BRAZIL President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva cannot run for re-election in the next poll set for October 2010. Dilma Rousseff, his handpicked successor, is far behind in opinion polls, but there is still more than a year before the vote. Brazil wants more clout on the international stage and Lula is expected to be a powerful negotiator in Pittsburgh. He has blamed unfettered financial markets for causing the global economic crisis and demanded a greater role in global affairs for big developing nations at the United Nations on Wednesday. He also wants more influence at the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for developing countries. It could benefit his Workers Party if Lula could return home from Pittsburgh with a greater voting stake. Trade is another big issue for emerging economies, and Brazil is a leading advocate in the developing world for pushing the United States and Europe to cut back on agricultural subsidies. UNITED STATES Barack Obama took office in January, but the U.S. election cycle never ends, and politicians are thinking hard about the Congressional election in November 2010, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and one-third of the 100 seats in the Senate are up for grabs. Obama's Democrats would like to at least keep -- and preferably expand -- majorities in both houses. His rival Republicans, slapped in the November 2008 elections, would like to take back the majorities. Americans have been consumed by domestic issues such as Obama's handling of the economy and healthcare reform, but this week's U.N. General Assembly and G20 summit give him a chance to show leadership on the world stage and win concrete results. At the G20, held in the shadow of a global financial meltdown that triggered fears of another Great Depression, two of Obama's main agenda items are a push to rebalance the global economy and efforts to forge agreements on regulating the financial industry. CANADA Prime Minister Stephen Harper, whose ruling Conservatives control only a minority of seats in the House of Commons, is due to face a non-confidence motion next month. If all three opposition parties back the motion, the government will fall and Canada will hold its second election in little over a year. Although opinion polls show support for the Conservatives is now so strong that they could conceivably win a majority, Harper says an election now would disrupt government efforts to combat the effects of the world recession. There is no guarantee all three opposition parties will vote in favor of the non-confidence motion. The left-leaning New Democrats, sinking steadily in the polls, hinted strongly they would keep Harper in power for now after he unveiled plans to make jobless benefits more generous.
