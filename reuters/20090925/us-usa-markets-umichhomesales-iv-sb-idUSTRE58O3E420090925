 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment rose 

 in late September to the highest since January 2008, but sales of new homes were up just 0.7 percent in August, short of expectations. KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its final index of sentiment for September rose to 73.5 from 65.7 in August. This was above economists' median expectation for a reading of 70.3, according to a Reuters poll. * The index of consumer expectations rose to 73.5, its highest in two years, from 65.0 in August. The index of current conditions rose to 73.4 in late September from 66.6 in August. KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said sales rose 0.7 percent to a 429,000 annual pace, the highest since September last year, from a downwardly revised 426,000 in July. However, the increase was below market expectations for a 440,000 unit rate. * July's sales pace was previously reported at 433,000 units. Compared to August last year, total new homes sales fell 3.4 percent. The median home sales price in August fell percent 11.7 percent from a year earlier to $195,200, the lowest since October 2003, the department said. In July, the median home price was $215,600. * The inventory of new homes available for sale at the end of August fell 3.0 percent to 262,000 units, the lowest since November 1992.August's sales pace left the supply of new homes available for sale at 7.3 months' worth, the lowest since January 2007. COMMENTS: STEVEN WOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSIGHT ECONOMICS, DANVILLE, CALIFORNIA: "New home sales peaked in July 2005 and fell through January2009. In recent months, home sales have bottomed and even recovered slightly, boosted in part by the federal tax credit for first time home buyers. Although the inventory of unsold homes is falling, there is still an overhang of unsold homes at the current sales rate. This inventory overhang and mounting foreclosures are still pushing home prices down. The new home market is still quite weak but the recent data suggests that a bottom in sales has been reached." BRIAN KIM, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, UBS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "The risk assets have been given a push initially by the University of Michigan report and there was a pretty good adjustment from the preliminary number. New home sales, meanwhile, were mixed. We saw a rise in the headline figure, although there was a downward revision to the previous month. But it's positive overall. So we're seeing a risk rally in currencies such as the euro and a bit of selling in the dollar." KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT FOREX, NEW YORK "The absolute amount of homes sold in the month of August was stronger than the previous month, even though it's weaker than expected. Overall, stocks and euro/dollar have completely shrugged off the weaker durable goods numbers and focused on the improvement that we've seen in consumer confidence and the sheer fact that home sales continue to rise. Even though the data wasn't very good, it was still good enough to resurrect the risk rally in the currency market." HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, JOHNSON ILLINGTON ADVISORS IN ALBANY, NY "It's very hard to forecast new home sales and they tend to be very volatile on a month-to-month basis. But if we look at the last six months and take out the month-to-month swings, the trend in sales has been higher and importantly the trend in inventories, or month's supply overhang, has been downward. "Consumer sentiment is clear. This is the revision, and these numbers have been trending higher. Consumer confidence as measured by Michigan has been getting better, it's been improving. That is very important, consumer expectations are a component of the leading index of economic indicators and tell us something about consumer spending. That consumer spending may improve or be stronger that currently is forecast. These are good numbers, these should help the market." JOHN J. CANALLY JR., CFA, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, LPL FINANCIAL, BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS: "New home sales failed to meet raised expectations, marking back to back disappointments for housing sales in August. The good news: sales rose 0.7 percent month-over-month, the fifth consecutive month-over-month gain. The number of new homes for sales dropped again to 262,000. "New home sales inventories now close to 'normal.' Bad news: home prices dropped 9.5 percent between July and August. Market reaction to this data has been muted relative to the sell-off in equities seen after yesterday's disappointing existing home sales report." DAN FARETTA, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, LIND-WALDOCK, CHICAGO: "The sentiment was a little better than expected, but overall we got a lot of mixed information. Sentiment was better, while home sales were bad. Or at least worse than expected. "It's hard to say what the market is going to want to focus on. I thought the home sales would be more important, and that if they came in weak we'd see a pop in the dollar and a market selloff, but right now it looks like the market is paying more attention to sentiment. The dollar is lower right now, but that could just be a knee-jerk reaction." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK NEW HOME SALES: "The reaction to this will be small, but it wasn't a huge miss. But in light of the surprise drops in the existing homes yesterday and durable goods, it's another brick in the wall that the recovery is not as strong as we thought three days ago." REUTERS/U. MICHIGAN CONSUMER SENTIMENT: "It's a lot bigger than expected from the preliminaries. This suggests a significant improvement in sentiment since the middle of the month. My sense is a recovery in sentiment accompanies a recovery in credits, but credits are still so tight in this cycle. This also means consumers are willing to borrow, but it's stymied by the banks' unwillingness to lend." GARY THAYER, MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It looks like people feel better about both current conditions and the future. If we can only get business sentiment to improve a bit more, we'd probably go from a yellow light to a green light. If business sentiment picks up, the job situation would improve and consumer sentiment will improve further. "The inflation forecast also moderated. That bodes well for stable growth and suggests that people's perception of the risk of the Fed waiting too long to exit easy monetary policy has probably gone down. "The bottom line is that the economy probably has turned the corner. If we don't have any unexpected shocks, it looks like we're headed toward recovery." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes bounced, but then slipped . BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell against the yen and euro.
