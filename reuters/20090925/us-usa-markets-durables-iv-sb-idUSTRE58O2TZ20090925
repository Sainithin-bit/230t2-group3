 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S. manufactured goods unexpectedly fell in August, dropping by their biggest margin in seven months, following a plunge in commercial aircraft orders, a government report showed on Friday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said durable goods orders tumbled 2.4 percent, the largest decline since January, after rising by a revised 4.8 percent in July. * New orders for July were previously reported to have increased 5.1 percent. * Analysts polled by Reuters forecast orders rising 0.5 percent in August. Compared with the same period last year, new orders were down 24.9 percent. COMMENTS: MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA SECURITIES AMERICA, NEW YORK: "It was a little disappointing although it was not a horrible report. Orders were down overall, though much of the decline occurred in the aircraft category which normally is volatile. However, outside the transportation area, we did not see much activity; orders were flat excluding transportation. And over the past several months we have drifted only slightly higher for orders excluding transportation. "In addition, orders for capital goods other than aircraft and were down in August. That category gives insight into capital spending by businesses. That was one of the weaker areas in the first half of this year. It's not building momentum. It's off its low, but not moving ahead. It's hesitating." SEBASTIEN GALY, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "The durables report is a bump in the road for the U.S. recovery story. But we still expect upside surprises in the economic data going forward. We still expect a relatively positive trend for the economy, although we shouldn't get too excited. The reaction in the dollar was as expected. This correlation with negative data and a strong dollar has been in place for some time and this day is no different." CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "Orders were soft. The only strength in the report was the fact that you had a flat core reading on the category of non-defense orders excluding aircraft. People look at that because it plugs directly into GDP. It's mildly disappointing and it might carry some weight with the marketplace because the existing home sales were weak as well. It generally takes this sector about a year, to a year and a half, to bottom after bank tightening peaked. Based on the Fed's lending survey, the percentage of banks that reported they were tightening credit peaked early this year so you wouldn't expect much from the capital goods sector until maybe the middle of next year." MICHAEL ENGLUND, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ACTION ECONOMICS, BOULDER, COLORADO: "We see weakness across the broad. We're surprised by the gains in June and July, and August pretty much wiped them out. This truncates the upside risk to the Q3 GDP number. This drop in August will take a chunk out of that. The bounce in sentiments in July was tied to the expected vehicle demand. It will hard to see further bounce going forward." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH.COM, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "Basically, it's not good. What everybody is looking for now, is in essence some type of a rebound. It sounds like what we are seeing, especially since you are talking durable goods, and it's ex-transportation, it's really the government (who) is the spender of last resort. That doesn't mean it can't continue for awhile but it means that everyone has said we've primed the pump, but a lot of this is still being driven of the government. In essence, this is a bit of a reality check for people. It means there is more to be done and we are not out of the woods yet." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST. PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The durables report was disappointing. We were looking for positive increases and the numbers came in below expectations. That will weigh a bit on stock market sentiment and give a bit of a boost to (Treasury) bonds." DAN GREENHAUS, ANALYST, MILLER TABAK & CO, NEW YORK: "Obviously this is less than expected. There was some giveback in transportation after cash for clunkers, but this is a very volatile number and its difficult to read into it on a month by month basis. You need to focus on the trend, and that trend remains for growing numbers of orders. Despite that, I think it's clear the market will react negatively to this today, especially the non-defense excluding aircraft number, which is our proxy for business spending."
