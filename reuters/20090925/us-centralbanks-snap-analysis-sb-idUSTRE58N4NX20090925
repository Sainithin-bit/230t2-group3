 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Central banks around the world simultaneously scaled back some of their emergency lending programs on Thursday, but don't expect them to tighten monetary policy any time soon. 

 The joint effort took place amid growing talk central banks were preparing to pull cash from the financial system in a bid to forestall inflation as economic data points to recovery. Even with the wind-down of these programs, global central banks said they are committed to holding interest rates exceptionally low to keep economic recovery on track. * U.S. stocks fell and the dollar rose after the central banks' announcement stoked fears that the easy money supporting markets was fading away. * Usage of these central bank finance programs has subsided since they were created at the height of the global credit crunch when Lehman Brothers collapsed a year ago. * In the United States, banks' balance sheets have improved thanks to rising deposits and hefty write-downs on bad investments. More companies have been able to sell short-term debt like commercial paper to raise cash, instead of relying on the Fed to buy it. * On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve as expected said it would keep its policy rate at zero to 0.25 percent "for an extended period. * The Fed will reduce the sizes and maturity length of its Term Auction Facility program at least through January. TAF -- under which banks can obtain low-cost loans directly from the Fed for up to 84 days -- was $196 billion last Wednesday after peaking at $450 billion at the start of 2009. * "The process of winding down the TAF began in the summer and they are now moving more slowly than they have been," said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP in Jersey City, New Jersey. * "... and it also tells you that they do not want the market to think that they are getting close to tightening," Crandall added. * The Fed will also pare the size of its Term Securities Lending Facility -- which allow dealers to exchange riskier assets for Fed Treasuries holdings so they can raise cash. No dealers submitted bids at the previous two TSLF auctions. * The European Central Bank, Bank of England and Swiss National Bank said on Thursday they will stop offering long-term dollars via the Fed's credit lines with them as credit conditions improved. For more, see * The Fed's central bank "swap" lines for dollar averaged $61.1 billion a day last week, down sharply from the daily average rate of $465.6 billion in late January. * "They don't think they need to do anymore with these programs; that they were going to expire at the end of this year. But they don't want to step away at this point so they are buying some time by extending them into early next year." said Jay Bryson, global economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. "But we are still months away from the central banks actually draining liquidity." (Editing by Andrew Hay)
