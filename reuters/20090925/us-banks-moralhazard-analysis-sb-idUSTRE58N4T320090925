 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. banks seem to be riding high these days, but their future stability depends on the hidden hand of government. 

 Although financial firms have been weaning themselves off government support, their ability to raise capital depends on a leap of faith: investors' underlying belief that Uncle Sam will never again permit large institutions to fail. The decision to let Lehman Brothers go bankrupt one year ago rocked the financial system to its foundations, making policymakers unlikely to allow an encore, analysts say. Should that perception change in future, some worry the whole recovery of credit markets could be jeopardized. Trust in the financial system, along with global equity markets, hit a nadir in March. But since then, investors have plowed money back into the bonds and stocks of institutions they dared not touch just a few months back. Now some analysts fear that moral hazard, or the incentive for banks and investors to engage in reckless market behavior, may be on the rise. "Investors absolutely do believe that big banks can and will stand alone without explicit government assistance because they believe there is implicit government assistance," said Jack Malvey, a New York-based capital markets consultant and Lehman Brothers' former chief global fixed income strategist. That is one reason next month's scheduled winding down of a government guarantee program for financial institutions' bonds is not keeping money managers awake at night. The banking system's recovery has been a self-fulfilling prophecy, which began with government-administered "stress tests" in May. While many deemed the tests too easy, they were enough to trigger positive sentiment that allowed some institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, to return decisively to profitability. That prompted a broad rally in securities markets, ranging from U.S. stocks, which are up nearly 60 percent from their March lows, to U.S. high-yield bonds, up a record 48 percent year-to-date, gold and other commodities, which are flirting with record highs. Bank assets have led the parade. Financial stocks have outperformed the broader market, surging some 145 percent since March, according to the S&P Financial index. Financial institutions' bond prices have rallied dramatically, narrowing yield spreads over Treasuries to just 3.1 percentage points, from a record wide 8.8 percentage points in March. Yet U.S. banks still face challenges. The $6 trillion commercial real estate market is in a crash that will put renewed pressure on bank balance sheets. Elsewhere, the labor market is still so weak that many economists predict consumer spending will not be nearly enough to return growth to its full potential. Indeed at 9.7 percent, the jobless rate has already surpassed the more pessimistic assumptions included in the stress tests. That means highly-indebted households will face continued challenges, and may further damage banks' consumer credit portfolios -- particularly at large commercial banks like Citigroup and Bank of America. BAILOUT BETS While Pimco and some other big bond fund managers have shoveled money back into bank bonds at an accelerating rate in recent months, not all fixed-income portfolio managers have joined the throng. "As an investor I have always been uncomfortable buying an investment if the only reason is someone is going to bail you out later on," said Tom Atteberry, fixed income fund manager of First Pacific Advisors. "What if the FDIC runs out of money?" he asks. "What happens if the government decides they are not too big to fail?" Atteberry takes little comfort in the federal authorities' disparate reactions to various financial market crises -- for instance, its decision to bail out Bear Stearns but not Lehman. Another problem with the government's implicit guarantee of the banking sector is the skewed incentives it provides for the industry. A number of Federal Reserve officials have themselves noted too-big-to-fail institutions present a serious problem since they shield risk-takers from the results of their own actions. "Government guarantees of private debt, either explicit or implicit, can have profound effects on debtors' and creditors' incentives," Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker said in a speech last week. Such guarantees lower the cost of credit, encouraging greater risk taking, Lacker said. "Inexpensive debt financing will encourage an institution to seek greater leverage than it otherwise would."
