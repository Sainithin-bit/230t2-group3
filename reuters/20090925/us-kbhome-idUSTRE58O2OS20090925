 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Homebuilder KB Home ( KBH.N ) reported a deeper quarterly loss than Wall Street expected and its chief executive warned he does not expect meaningful improvement in the U.S. housing market in the near future. 

 The company's shares were down 8.6 percent on Friday, contributing to the fourth consecutive day of declines for the recently rallying U.S. homebuilding sector, with investors realizing that a possible bottoming out of a market does not necessarily signal rapid recovery. Unlike larger peer Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ) -- which reported a deeper-than-expected quarterly loss on Monday, but said it expected to return to profitability in 2010 -- Los Angeles- based KB Home said only that it had "more work to do" to begin earning money again. "The precise timing of a housing recovery remains uncertain. We expect the early stages of a recovery will be uneven with some inevitable setbacks before reaching stability," said CEO Jeff Mezger on a conference call with analysts. "It will be difficult for the housing sector to build significant momentum as long as potential home buyers lack the job security needed for them to make a major purchase." The news came on a day the U.S. government reported new- home sales rose at a weaker-than-expected pace and a day after a U.S. trade group reported an unexpected 2.7 percent drop in existing home sales. Friday's decline left the Standard & Poor's homebuilder index .GSPHOME off about 16 percent from last week's peak. "It's not a straight line, it's going to be pretty difficult," said Eric Landry, an analyst at Morningstar in Chicago who follows the sector. "There's been a ton of job losses and job losses have a huge impact on housing." Still, he noted that the company's 62 percent rise in orders was a good sign for the business. Analysts attributed the rise to a renewed focus on lower-cost homes. LOSS NARROWER THAN LAST YEAR KB reported a third-quarter net loss of $66 million, or 87 cents per share, less severe than the loss of $144.7 million, or $1.87 per share, recorded a year earlier. The loss was deeper than the 73 cents-per-share loss Wall Street had braced for, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue came to $456.3 million, down 32.8 percent from $679.1 million a year earlier. KB Home expects to generate positive cash flow from operations this year and looks for fourth quarter results to be their best of the year, executives told analysts and investors on a conference call. Homebuilder shares have been on a tear over the past three months, as the industry that was one of the first to be sucked into the worst U.S. economic downturn since the Great Depression starts to show signs of stabilization. KB shares were down $1.60 at $16.94 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares of fellow builders Lennar and Pulte Homes Inc ( PHM.N ) also traded lower on Friday, as did those of home improvement chains Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) and Lowe's Cos Inc ( LOW.N ) and appliance maker Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ), all of which have significant exposure to the housing market.
