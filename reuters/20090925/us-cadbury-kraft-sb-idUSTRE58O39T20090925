 LONDON  (Reuters) - Cadbury's CBRY.L CEO Todd Stitzer said on Friday he did not believe that Kraft's KFT.N bid for Cadbury made strategic or financial sense as he looked to clarify previously reported remarks. 

 "For the avoidance of doubt, Mr Stitzer does not believe that Kraft's proposal makes strategic or financial sense for Cadbury and his comments should not be interpreted in any other way," a Cadbury statement said. Cadbury added that commentary on this issue has misconstrued Stitzer's remarks to imply a softening of his view regarding a combination between Kraft and Cadbury.
