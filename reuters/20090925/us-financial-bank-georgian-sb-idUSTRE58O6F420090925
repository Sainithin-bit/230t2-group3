 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regulators closed Georgian Bank in Atlanta on Friday, an institution that catered to wealthy property developers and became the 95th U.S. bank to fail so far this year. 

 Focused on Atlanta's well-heeled northern suburbs, the bank even boasted an on-staff chef, who once served as a footman in Buckingham Palace. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said Georgian Bank, with five branches, had about $2 billion in assets and $2 billion in deposits. First Citizens Bank and Trust Co of South Carolina has agreed to assume all of the deposits of Georgian Bank. Georgia banks have been especially hard hit by the financial crisis, where home building outstripped demand. Nineteen of the 95 banks that have failed this year have been based in Georgia. The FDIC said the failure is expected to cost its dwindling insurance fund about $892 million. Bank regulators will meet next week to propose ways the FDIC can replenish the fund, which stood at $10.4 billion at the end of the second quarter, from $45 billion a year earlier. The FDIC says it has an additional $32 billion in reserves to handle failures over the next year. Georgian Bank provided "tailored banking services to high-net-worth individuals, entrepreneurs, and business owners," according to its website. It was chartered in 2001 and was one of the fastest growing banks in state history, relying heavily on residential construction and real estate loans to quickly become the second-largest bank based in Atlanta and fifth-largest in Georgia. In July, Georgian Bank shook up its leadership and brought in a new chief executive to help the bank deal with rising credit problems. CLOSING IN ON 100 Bank failures have sharply increased this year, compared to 25 last year and just three in 2007. FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair has warned that bank failures are a lagging indicator, and that the number of failures will remain elevated into next year even as the economy starts to recover. At the meeting next week, the FDIC will discuss how to bolster the deposit insurance fund, possibly through more emergency assessments on banks, or tapping the FDIC's $500-billion line of credit with the U.S. Treasury Department. The number of bank failures so far this year is edging closer to 100. "In some ways it's like witnessing Babe Ruth's 400th home run," said Lawrence Kaplan, a banking attorney at law firm Paul Hastings in Washington D.C. "You know its a large number, but you also know there are more to come." Other industry watchers said this year's tally is still far short of the peak during the savings and loan crisis when 534 U.S. banks failed in 1989 alone. "Those are huge numbers and we're nowhere near that," said Jim Wheeler, a banking attorney with Bryan Cave in Atlanta. Wheeler said it will take time for the banking industry to recover, and that bank examiners are continuing to aggressively downgrade institutions for poor asset quality linked to questionable loans and underlying real estate collateral. He said banks are facing fresh troubles as commercial real estate becomes more of a problem, and office and shopping mall vacancies creep up. FDIC's Bair has also warned that commercial real estate will increasingly become the driver of bank failures. She has said the industry has largely worked through its problems tied to subprime residential mortgage loans. The trend in bank failures is also shifting away from large-sized institutions and toward community banks, Wheeler said. "By and large I think we're going to start see smaller banks feel it," he said. (Reporting by Karey Wutkowski in Washington and Joe Rauch in New York; Editing by Carol Bishopric and  Tim Dobbyn )
