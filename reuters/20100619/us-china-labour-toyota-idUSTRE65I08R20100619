 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) halted production at its main factory in China on Friday after a strike at a maker of plastic parts disrupted supply, the carmaker said on Saturday. 

 Work was suspended in the middle of the day shift on Friday at its Tianjin factory, near Beijing, which has three assembly lines with combined annual production capacity of 420,000 vehicles, Toyota spokeswoman Ririko Takeuchi said. The day shift on Friday had planned to build 600 cars such as the Corolla, Crown and RAV4 models, she said. The plant is closed at the weekend, and plans for Monday depend on whether supply from strike-hit parts maker Toyoda Gosei ( 7282.T ) resumes, Toyota said.\ (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Ron Popeski )
