 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private-sector employers added 91,000 jobs in September, above economists' expectations, a report by a payrolls processor showed on Wednesday. 

 Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast the ADP National Employment Report would show a gain of 75,000 jobs. August private payrolls were revised down to an increase of 89,000 from the previously reported 91,000. The report is jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC.
