 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's European chief said on Wednesday the fund can only lend to countries and cannot intervene directly in bond markets. 

 Antonio Borges said in a statement that the IMF does not currently have any new requests from euro zone countries for funds and said it had no plans to have any market involvement with a European bailout fund. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
