 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Sallie Mae, SLM.N rose nearly 13 percent, and its bonds fell after The New York Times reported that the largest U.S. student-loan company was in talks to sell itself to private equity firms. 

 Any deal would come as student lenders wrestle with regulatory probes and calls for widespread industry changes. Sallie Mae settled with the New York Attorney General's office for $2 million on Wednesday and agreed to change some of its practices. A private equity deal would be unusual for a financial company, because leveraged buyout deals typically require companies to take on more debt. Borrowing more can raise a company's funding costs, which could seriously squeeze profit margins of a lender like Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae does not comment on market rumors or speculation, a spokesman said. Sallie Mae's shares were up $4.55, or 11.2 percent, at $45.30 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade after rising as high as $46. This was their biggest one-date gain in at least two years. Because of concerns of increased debt levels, the company's floating rate notes due in January 2014 fell 1.77 cents on the dollar to 97.44 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. The cost of protecting $10 million of Sallie Mae's debt against default rose to $70,500 a year, from $36,500 on Thursday, according to Barclays Capital.
