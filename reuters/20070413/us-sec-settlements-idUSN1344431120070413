 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Top officials at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are seeking more involvement in the process of levying financial penalties against companies, asking SEC staff to seek approval before they start settlement talks with defendants, according to a Washington Post report on Friday. 

 The pilot program will require SEC enforcement lawyers to first get approval from the investor protection agency's five commissioners and establish ranges for possible fines before negotiations start, the Post said. Under the current system, staff members negotiate with companies before presenting a settlement proposal to the commissioners for approval. The pilot plan has the potential to speed up settlements, as enforcement staff would already have an idea of the amount of financial penalty settlement the commissioners would be willing to approve. An SEC spokesman declined to comment about the pilot plan. The SEC on average in recent years has settled less than 10 cases per year involving financial penalties against companies. The agency settles far more cases with individuals each year. Critics have questioned the fairness of steep financial penalties against companies and whom they punish. There have been reports that settlements in the widespread stock option backdating scandal have been delayed within the SEC, specifically with Brocade Communications Systems Inc. ( BRCD.O ), because of internal disagreements over the appropriateness of financial penalties. SEC enforcement officials were not immediately available for comment.
