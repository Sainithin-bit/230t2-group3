 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch Philips Electronics ( PHG.AS )( PHG.N ) said on Friday it will take over United States-based Digital Lifestyle Outfitters (DLO), a producer of peripherals for mobile audio-visual devices such as MP3 players. 

 No financial details were disclosed of the transaction which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2007. DLO realized sales of approximately $100 million in 2006, mainly in the United States, and is expected to make a positive contribution to operating margins in Philips' Peripherals & Accessories business unit, Philips said. Philips is the world's biggest lighting maker, a top three hospital equipment maker and Europe's biggest consumer electronics producer.
