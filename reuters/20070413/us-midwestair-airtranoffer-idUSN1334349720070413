 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - AirTran Holdings Inc. AAI.N has no intention of increasing its offer for Midwest Air Group Inc. MEH.A after Midwest's board advised shareholders to reject the hostile bid, AirTran's chief operating officer said on Friday. 

 AirTran, parent of low-cost carrier AirTran Airways, will continue shopping its offer of $15 per share, or about $389 million, to Midwest investors despite criticisms from Midwest's board, which called the offer "inadequate," Bob Fornaro told Reuters. "This is a healthy offer and we're not looking at increasing the offer," he said. "That's it." The bid, which has been raised twice, now consists of $9 in cash and 0.5842 shares of AirTran common stock for each Midwest share. Midwest management has resisted the offer, saying Midwest has more value as an independent airline. "Our board determined that AirTran's revised offer does not take into account the long-term value of our strategic plan," said Midwest Chief Executive Timothy Hoeksema in a statement. Orlando, Florida-based AirTran, the 10th largest U.S. airline by revenue, made its initial offer worth $290 million in October and publicized it in December. It raised the offer to $345 million in January and to $389 million this month. Milwaukee-based Midwest has asked investors to pass on the bid and has offered a stand-alone expansion plan that calls for additional routes and fleet replacement. The airline industry is recovering from a years-long slump that pushed some carriers into bankruptcy. Experts had predicted airline mergers as carriers struggled for survival. But the outlook for consolidation has dimmed as airlines cut capacity and boost fares. Shares of AirTran were up 5 cents at $11.61 on the New York Stock Exchange. Midwest shares were down 20 cents at $14.42 on the American Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Anant Vijay Kala in Bangalore)
