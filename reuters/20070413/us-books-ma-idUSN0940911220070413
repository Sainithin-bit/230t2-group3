 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dana Vachon wasn't a very good banker, but he had plenty of laughs on Wall Street and when he left he had a $650,000 book deal in his pocket. 

 His novel, "Mergers & Acquisitions" (Riverhead, $23.95), is a tale of Wall Street titans and New York socialites who believe that making more money will fill the void in their lives. Loosely drawn on 28-year-old Vachon's short career at JPMorgan Chase & Co., the book is more high jinks than high finance. The central character, Thomas Quinn, works at J.S. Spenser, a fictional Wall Street bank run by self-important men who have $30 million but want $60 million. Quinn fits in because he went to the right schools and knows how to dress. But crunching numbers isn't Quinn's strength. He is so inept at building financial models that he converts the dollar into itself and undervalues Canadian oil field assets by several hundred million dollars. Like Quinn, Vachon found that his political science training from Duke University didn't help him much in his job as an analyst in JPMorgan's real estate department. He cared about doing a good job, but the aptitude wasn't there, he told Reuters over lunch in New York. "It should be noted that they did fire people, and I wasn't one of them," Vachon joked in his own defense. To illustrate how unforgiving Wall Street can be, he recounted how a managing director suffered a heart attack and was wheeled out on a gurney. Not long after, the managing director's performance review took issue with his choice of clothing. BLOGGER At JPMorgan, it was an open secret that Vachon spent part of his day working on an anonymous blog about Wall Street from inside his cubicle on the third floor of the company's building at 277 Park Avenue. His blog -- Dnasty - was read by the rank and file and senior executives alike. "People would say, 'Dana, after you get done blogging, could you help me on this project,'" Vachon said. In the end, Quinn doesn't get axed from his job at J.S. Spenser, and neither did Vachon, who said he left JPMorgan on good terms. Before his last day in the office, Vachon spent the night on the town and showed up at work wearing a white seersucker suit, an item that went of fashion on Wall Street generations ago. "It was my idea of what a banker's suit should look like," he said. Vachon, 28, said his mother loves the book, which is replete with sex, drugs and good-looking women who self mutilate. But he is mum on the review of his father, Jules Vachon, a managing director at municipal bond brokerage Gates Capital Corp., who pulled strings to get his son the job at JPMorgan. These days, the Westchester County native is working on his second novel, while hoping "Mergers & Acquisitions" will have the same impact as Tom Wolfe's "The Bonfire of the Vanities" and Michael Lewis' "Liar's Poker." And he has found that being a Wall Street washout can be lucrative. Anonymous Content, which produced "Babel" and "Being John Malkovich," has acquired the movie rights to "Mergers & Acquisitions" in a deal in the high six figures, according to Daily Variety.
