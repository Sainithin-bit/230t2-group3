 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) said on Friday it will buy Old Lane Partners LP, a hedge fund co-founded by former Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) executive Vikram Pandit, shoring up the leadership ranks at the largest U.S. bank. 

 Terms were not disclosed. People familiar with the matter have said the purchase price might top $600 million. Pandit will become chief executive of Citi Alternative Investments, where he will oversee $59 billion of assets, and join the bank's operating and management committees. The 50-year-old is a former institutional securities chief at Morgan Stanley. John Havens, a former Morgan Stanley global head of equities and Old Lane co-founder, will become president of alternative investments and also join the management committee. "This transaction is an investment as much as it is an acquisition," Citigroup Chief Executive Charles Prince said. Pandit was not immediately available for comment. Old Lane oversees $4.5 billion of assets and private equity commitments. It employs 120 people in New York, Pennsylvania, London and India -- the latter a key growth region for Citigroup, and where Pandit was born. While other Wall Street banks have also bought hedge funds, Citigroup has had a shortage of top management talent and potential successors for the 57-year-old Prince. Pandit joins a short list of candidates that includes investment banking chiefs Michael Klein and Thomas Maheras. "I know them all very well, and they're very bright, talented, aggressive people, all the things you like to see," Citigroup Vice Chairman Stephen Volk said in an interview. "They will work together very well. Buying a normal hedge fund would not provide the solution we're getting here." Gary Crittenden, the new chief financial officer, is another person on the short list. Prince faces pressure from investors to slash costs and increase revenue faster to boost a lagging stock price. On Wednesday, the bank announced plans to eliminate 17,000 jobs to help cut spending by $4.58 billion. Citi Alternative Investments is the smallest of Citigroup's four business units, with about 875 employees. It oversees private equity, hedge fund, real estate and other assets. INTERIM LEADERSHIP The unit has been without a permanent chief since Michael Carpenter left the company in March 2006. Chief Administrative Officer Lewis Kaden will continue to run it on an interim basis. Citigroup said the Old Lane purchase should close in the third quarter, and may slightly reduce earnings per share in the first year or two. Pandit had been considered a potential successor to Morgan Stanley's former chief executive, Philip Purcell. After Purcell elevated two less senior executives to co-president, Pandit quit Morgan Stanley in March 2005, leading an exodus of more than two dozen senior bankers and traders. Purcell resigned under pressure three months later. Citigroup said Old Lane's co-chief investment officers, Guru Ramakrishnan and George James, will respectively become Old Lane chief executive and Citi Alternative Investments vice chairman. In 2006, profit from alternative investments at Citigroup fell 11 percent to $1.28 billion, while revenue fell 15 percent to $2.9 billion. The unit is home to Tribeca Global Management LLC, a hedge fund unit that oversees about $2.5 billion. Citigroup shares closed down 5 cents at $51.60 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen 13 percent since Prince took over in October 2003, less than half the gains at Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ).
