 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The Texas House of Representatives late on Thursday passed a bill to give state regulators more oversight over future sales of electric delivery companies, while exempting the pending sale of TXU Corp. TXU.N to a group of private equity firms. 

 Dallas-based TXU, the state's largest power company, agreed in late February to be purchased for $32 billion by a group of private equity firms led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL. The size of the TXU transaction, and rising power prices in the state's five-year-old deregulated market, have raised concern among elected officials in Austin, the state capital, and Washington. The Texas Senate passed a measure last month giving the state Public Utility Commission authority to approve or reject the TXU transaction. KKR had said passage of any law to give the PUC expanded authority would jeopardize its deal with TXU. KKR has agreed to submit details of the sale to the PUC later this month for review, but regulators lack authority to block the deal under current law. House members amended the bill to force the state's three largest power retailers, TXU, Reliant Energy RRI.N and Centrica LP's ( CNA.L ) Direct Energy unit, to give 15 percent discounts to more than 2 million Texas electric customers who have not switched suppliers and are paying the highest rates. Differences in the House and Senate versions of the bill will have to be worked out in a conference committee.
