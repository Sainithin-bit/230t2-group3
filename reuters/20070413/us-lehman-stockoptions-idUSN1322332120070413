 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N was sued by an shareholder who said the investment bank manipulated stock option grants from 1998 to 2001 to secure a "huge financial windfall" for Chief Executive Richard Fuld and other top officials. 

 In a complaint filed Friday with the U.S. district court in Manhattan, Robert Garber, a Pittsburgh resident and Lehman shareholder, accused 22 current and former executives and directors of allowing the backdating of stock options. He said this allowed the improper reaping of "hundreds of millions of dollars" at shareholders' expense, and affected Lehman's financial results through at least 2005. Stock options let holders buy shares in the future at fixed prices. Backdating involves the retroactive award of options on dates when the stock price was low. Lehman spokesman Randall Whitestone declined to comment. Scott & Scott LLP, which filed the complaint, and a spokesman for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately return calls for comment. The complaint alleged that a "great number" of options awarded to Lehman executives and directors were dated just after a big drop or before a big rise in Lehman's stock price. Citing statistical analyses, it said the odds against the grant dates occurring by chance were more than 800 million to one. "Grant dates follow a striking pattern that is so advantageous to the grantees that it could not have been the result of chance," the 47-page complaint said. Among other executives to benefit improperly, according to the lawsuit, were chief operating officer Joseph Gregory, chief financial officer Christopher O'Meara, and chief legal officer Thomas Russo. Garber is seeking the recovery of improper profits, the voiding of unexercised stock options, and the forfeiting of incentive- and equity-based awards while wrongdoing took place. At least 200 companies have disclosed internal investigations or probes by the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service into stock option grant practices. Lehman is not one of these companies. Lehman shares closed Friday up 15 cents at $72.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. On a split-adjusted basis, the shares have more than doubled since most of the stock options described in the complaint were awarded.
