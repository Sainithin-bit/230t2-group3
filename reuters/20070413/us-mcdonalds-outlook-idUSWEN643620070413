 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) said on Friday that first-quarter earnings would top analysts' expectations due to the strength of U.S. products such as Snack Wrap chicken sandwiches and robust growth in Europe and Asia. 

 The news pushed shares of the world's largest restaurant company up 2 percent to a more than seven-year high. McDonald's said it expects to report first-quarter earnings of about 62 cents per share, while analysts on average had forecast 57 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at McDonald's restaurants open at least 13 months were well above forecasts in March, rising 8.2 percent, compared with an average estimate of 3.6 percent among four analysts, according to research notes. Restaurant analyst David Palmer of UBS said the results could indicate stronger-than-expected performance in the company's U.S. business this summer. Many analysts had been expecting growth to slow later this year due to difficult comparisons with strong increases in previous years. "U.S. share gains suggest high-single-digit same-store sales is possible this summer," UBS analyst David Palmer said in a note to clients. He had been expecting same-store sales gains of 3 percent in both the second and third quarters. Initiatives such as a focus on breakfast and extended restaurant hours have been key to revitalizing performance at McDonald's U.S. business over the last three years. In recent months, the company's businesses in Asia and Europe have also enjoyed sharp sales increases, in part because of a strategy of combining higher-priced products with cheaper selections on the menu. SALES STRONG IN ALL REGIONS March same-store sales rose 6.2 percent in the United States, 11.2 percent in Europe, and 9.6 percent in the company's Asia-Pacific business, McDonald's said. The chicken Snack Wrap, which has proven to be a blockbuster product since it was introduced in the United States last year, helped boost results in McDonald's home market. The Snack Wrap's recent introduction in the UK also spurred results there last month, spokeswoman Heidi Barker said. Barker also said a limited-time sandwich campaign in France and a promotion in which German consumers could vote for their favorite McDonald's sandwich had helped drive overall results in Europe. In Asia, McDonald's benefited from strong demand for McGriddles breakfast sandwiches in Japan and the introduction of a crispy chicken wrap in China, Barker said. Carl Sibilski, managing director of hedge fund Oyster Capital Management, said McDonald's was a "very good play" if the dollar weakened, since its international sales results would be inflated. In Europe, March systemwide sales, or sales at all restaurants, rose 23.5 percent but were up just 12.1 percent on a constant-currency basis. Overall, March systemwide sales rose 12.7 percent, and increased 9.4 percent on a constant-currency basis. First-quarter systemwide sales rose 10.3 percent, while same-store sales increased 6.3 percent. Quarterly same-store sales were up 4.4 percent in the United States, 8 percent in Europe and 8.5 percent in the Asia-Pacific region. McDonald's first-quarter earnings share forecast includes a 1-cent-per-share benefit from foreign currency translation and reflects a tax rate of about 30 percent. The company plans to report earnings on April 20. Shares of Oak Brook, Illinois-based McDonald's were up $1.05 to $47.68 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, their highest level since late 1999.
