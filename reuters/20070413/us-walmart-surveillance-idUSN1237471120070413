 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A lawyer representing employees of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) who are suing the world's largest retailer for sexual discrimination is seeking information on whether his clients were among the targets of the company's controversial surveillance activities, according to a letter seen by Reuters. 

 Brad Seligman, a lawyer at the Impact Fund, a nonprofit group in Berkeley, Calif. representing female plaintiffs in the Dukes sexual discrimination case requested the company investigate the surveillance matter and turn over any related documents or recordings. Wal-Mart had asked an internal security group to keep tabs on shareholders submitting proposals for a June shareholder meeting and its employees, according to a Wall Street Journal report last week. New York City Comptroller William Thompson, Jr. sent letters to the U.S. Attorney General's office and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asking for an investigation into what he called "ill-considered and possibly illegal surveillance operations." Betty Dukes sued Wal-Mart for bias in pay and promotions. A nearly 13-year veteran of the company, where she works as a greeter in a store east of San Francisco. She alleged that she and other female employees were neglected when openings for higher-paid positions were advertised within her store. "The prospect of any such activity in connection with the Dukes litigation implicates serious concerns of attorney-client and work product privileges," Seligman wrote in the letter sent to Wal-Mart's attorneys on Thursday. A Wal-Mart representative could not be immediately reached. A spokeswoman for Seligman verified the letter. In February, a top U.S. court ruled that more than a million women could join what is seen as the biggest sexual discrimination case in U.S. history.
