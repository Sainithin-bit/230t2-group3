 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Infosys Technologies Ltd., India's No.2 software exporter, beat expectations with a 70 percent jump in quarterly profit, on higher fees and overseas contracts, but forecast more modest earnings growth this year. 

 Infosys ( INFY.BO ), shares rose as much as 3.8 percent, helping push up Mumbai's benchmark index  .BSESN  2.1 percent. Infosys, the first big software firm to report quarterly earnings, said it was confident going forward, though a firmer rupee trimmed margins by 1 percent in January-March, and visa and wage costs may erode margins by 200 basis points in April-June. "We are bullish about the market. We are seeing a lot of opportunities for us in the marketplace. We are not seeing any concerns on IT spending slowing down with any of our customers," CFO V. Balakrishnan told Reuters. Nasdaq-listed Infosys INFY.O, which develops applications, designs supply chains and offers back-office services, said January-March consolidated net profit rose to 11.44 billion rupees ($267 million) from 6.73 billion a year earlier -- beating a forecast 10.31 billion rupees in a Reuters poll of 14 brokers. Analysts said the earnings, boosted by a 1.24 billion rupee tax provision write-back, augured well for Infosys shares, which had dipped below the 200-day moving average this month. "All the negativity is already factored in the stock price in last few sessions," said Pranav Securities analyst Sorbh Gupta. "I don't see any negatives unless management says something on the slowdown (in the United States)." U.S. "SOFT LANDING" Balakrishnan said January-March billing rates rose 1.7 percent, new clients were coming in at 2-3 percent higher rates and he was not unduly worried about prospects of a slowdown in the United States, which accounted for 63 percent of fiscal fourth quarter revenue. "Different data gives different signals, but the consensus view is the U.S. is not going to slow down. Probably, they may have a soft landing," he said. Infosys hedged $470 million in the March quarter to safeguard against exchange losses due to the rupee, Balakrishnan said. The Indian currency  INR=IN  has risen nearly 10 percent against the dollar from a three-year low last July. For earnings details, see Web site at: www.infosys.com Infosys, known for its conservative guidance, said pre-exceptional per share earnings for the year to end-March 2008 would rise 20-22 percent to 80.29-81.58 rupees, versus a 53.5 percent increase to 69.11 rupees for the year just ended. Balakrishnan said equity dilution on account of employee stock option plans would cut EPS in 2007/08 by 3 percent. Analysts say the software and back-office services industry, which earns nearly 90 percent of its revenue from overseas clients, will win more outsourcing jobs from foreign firms looking to cut costs at home. India's large pool of English-speaking workers and cheaper wages -- at nearly a fifth of Western salaries -- have helped attract outsourcing, but the wage gap is shrinking and Infosys, which plans to add 23,000 employees, including 10,000 for its business processing unit, in 2007/08, said offshore salaries for the current fiscal year had risen 12-15 percent. Small software firm iGATE Global Solutions Ltd. IGAT.BO said this week that higher wages would hurt April-June margins. Top exporter Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. ( TCS.BO ) and third-ranked Wipro Ltd. ( WIPR.BO ) are expected to report their profits grew 47.8 and 29 percent, respectively, the Reuters poll showed. TCS is due to report on Monday, and Wipro on April 20. India's software services exports are expected to have risen by a third to $31.3 billion in 2006/07, and are seen hitting $60 billion by 2010, as firms such as Infosys and TCS take advantage of low-cost labor to grab global outsourcing. Infosys, which counts ABN AMRO AAH.AS and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) among its clients, expects revenue to grow to $4 billion in 2007/08, said COO and Joint Managing Director S. Gopalakrishnan, who takes over as CEO on June 22. Current CEO Nandan Nilekani will become co-chairman, while global sales chief S.D. Shibulal will move to chief operating officer, Infosys said.
