 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Ohio joined on Friday the list of states launching probes to see if college and university officials have steered students to student loan companies in exchange for perks. 

 Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann's office said in a statement he has contacted university and college presidents across the state advising he will investigate claims concerning potential conflicts of interest, self-dealing and other illegal and unethical conduct involving lenders. Dann's office is seeking documents relating to student loan providers, including revenue sharing and referral fee agreements, preferred lender lists, consulting agreements and lender marketing materials. "This issue of potential deceptive practices will examine whether college officials have taken free trips, benefited from stock deals, or taken gifts that some in the student-loan industry offer to financial aid officers," the statement said. Students and their parents often rely on advice from school officials on how to borrow money to pay for tuition. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said on Thursday he is investigating possible improper deals between student loan companies and colleges and universities, revealing for the first time the state is probing the $85-billion-a-year industry. California Attorney General Jerry Brown is also keeping a close eye on the issue. Investigators for the state of New York have already discovered some lenders offered vacations and other perks to university officials to steer student borrowers their way. Earlier this week, SLM Corp., the country's biggest lender to college students and best known as Sallie Mae, said it would pay $2 million into a fund to educate students on financial aid to settle a probe by New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo has also settled a case with Citibank and New York University, Syracuse University, St. John's University, Fordham University and the University of Pennsylvania. They agreed to pay $5.2 million. Separately on Friday, U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings asked for the resignation of Ellen Frishberg, student financial services director at Johns Hopkins University, from a panel that helps develop financial aid regulations. Johns Hopkins said on Monday it put Frishberg on paid leave after learning she received about $65,000 in consulting fees from a student loan company.
