 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market ( NDAQ.O ) has held preliminary and intermittent talks with Nordic bourse operator OMX OMX.ST over the past year, but a deal is not imminent, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Thursday. 

 OMX said on Thursday it was in cooperation talks with several exchanges although it had not received any bids, after Swedish newspaper Dagens Industri reported that Nasdaq had made a 23-billion Swedish crown ($3.33 billion) indicative bid for its Nordic peer. Nasdaq's priority is to buy the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, and those talks are more real and advanced than any with OMX, the Journal said, citing unnamed sources. Nasdaq could not immediately be reached for comment.
