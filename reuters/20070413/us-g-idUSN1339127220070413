 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Finance chiefs from the world's rich nations meeting on Friday were expected to offer assurances that the global economy can withstand a U.S. slowdown while keeping a watchful eye on currency volatility. 

 Worries about trade protectionism, the influence of wealthy hedge funds and China's export juggernaut were high on the agenda for the Group of Seven ministers, who begin meeting officially in mid-afternoon. But the mood was largely upbeat amid predictions the global economy will grow 4.9 percent this year and again in 2008 after expanding 5.4 percent in 2006 -- on its best pace since the 1970s -- despite a sluggish performance in the United States, the world's biggest economy. "We have always wanted the world economy to fly on more than one wing," British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown told reporters. He pointed to strong growth in Europe, China and India, and said problems with rising U.S. mortgage defaults were not spilling over into the broader global economy. "It's not a worldwide phenomenon," Brown said. The G7 meeting, to be followed by semi-annual sessions of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank over the weekend, threatened to be overshadowed by a controversy involving World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz. The Bank's board of directors was considering whether to take action against him over a well-paid promotion for his girlfriend. One influential newspaper, the Financial Times, called for the former Pentagon deputy to resign from his position leading an institution that aims to fight poverty. "In the interests of the Bank itself, he should resign," the FT wrote. "If he does not, the board must ask him to go." NO CHANGE ON CURRENCIES The G7 comprises the United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. Finance chiefs and central bankers from those wealthy nations begin meeting at 2:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) at the U.S. Treasury and will issue a closing communique at around 7 p.m. (2300 GMT). A G7 source said the communique was not expected to contain any change in language on currencies from what was offered in February, when the group said excess volatility in exchange rates was "undesirable" for economic growth. The report eased concerns in currency markets that the G7 might offer a green light for U.S. dollar weakness. The dollar rose against the Japanese yen but stayed near a two-year low against the euro, which hit an all-time high against the yen. The IMF conceded in a report on Wednesday that the global economy still faced risks from sources ranging from financial market volatility to inflation. But it said risks were lower than six months ago. Still, tensions remained over huge imbalances between trade deficit nations like the United States and surplus economies like oil producers and export giant China, which is being pressed to let its currency rise in value to aid a correction. TRADE WAR TALK "OVERBLOWN" U.S. lawmakers' anger at China's currency policy has kept pressure on the Bush administration to take a tough stance against Beijing. The United States said on Monday it was filing two trade actions against China at the World Trade Organization to try to stop piracy and counterfeiting of American goods. U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said worries that recent U.S. trade actions against China signal the two countries are on the verge of a trade war are "way overblown." Gutierrez spoke after the Commerce Department released data showing the massive U.S. trade gap narrowed unexpectedly in February to $58.4 billion from $59.1 billion the prior month. A potential flaring of protectionist sentiments -- even if it is not on the formal agenda -- is a key risk that G7 finance leaders have in mind as they discuss how to give stalled global free-trade talks a boost. The G7 ministers will also discuss concerns among some of them that lightly regulated hedge funds -- big pools of private capital that cater to wealthy individuals and institutions -- are a threat to stability. But Britain and the United States, where most of the funds are based, have already struck positions in favor of letting market forces temper the funds' riskier practices, effectively backing down a European effort led by Germany to consider stiffer regulatory and disclosure requirements on them. G7 deputies will meet on Sunday with representatives of the hedge-fund industry, which is eager to thwart any potential regulatory drive. Germany's deputy finance minister, Thomas Mirow, said he was interested in creating a "code of conduct" for hedge funds.
