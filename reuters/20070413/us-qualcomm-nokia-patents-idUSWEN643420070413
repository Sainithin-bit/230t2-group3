 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) said on Friday Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) is the largest user of its technology and patents, firing the latest volley in a battle over patent royalties. 

 Finnish-based Nokia, the world's top cellphone maker, said it rejected chip supplier Qualcomm's statements that it does not use Nokia's patents. A cross-licensing agreement over technology patents between Qualcomm and Nokia partly expired on Monday. The legal dispute between the two centers on Nokia's use of Qualcomm patents for high-speed wireless technology, but it also has a bearing on Qualcomm's chips business, which according to Nokia uses many Nokia-patented technologies. "With its more than 200 million units annually, Qualcomm is the largest user in the world of Nokia's technology and patents," Nokia said in a statement. Qualcomm uses more than 100 of Nokia's GSM/WCDMA and CDMA2000 essential patents in its chipsets, Nokia said, adding the companies have yet to agree on compensation Qualcomm must pay for the patents. Nokia also said it is continuing negotiations with Qualcomm on a new fee agreement for Nokia royalties to Qualcomm. Qualcomm accused Nokia on Thursday of either misleading the industry or breaching their license agreement, and rejected as insufficient a $20 million payment from Nokia. Nokia paid Qualcomm $20 million last week for the use of patents for the second quarter -- a figure analysts estimated was one-tenth to one-fifth of what it would have paid under the expired agreement. Nokia says it has developed technology of its own since the previous licensing agreement, and now seeks royalty payments from Qualcomm. "Nokia's payment was made in good faith for the licenses Nokia has to Qualcomm's alleged essential patents," Nokia spokeswoman Anne Eckert said, adding the $20 million payment was not related to the agreement that expired on April 9. "It was about the future and was based on a royalty level which is a fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory compensation, for the possible use of any Qualcomm European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) essential patents in Nokia WCMDA handsets in the second quarter 2007," she said.
