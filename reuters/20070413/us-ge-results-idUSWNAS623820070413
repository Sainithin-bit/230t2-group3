 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) reported higher first-quarter earnings on Friday, with strong demand for electricity-generating turbines, jet engines and other heavy equipment driving its infrastructure business. 

 Foreign demand for infrastructure products and a 15 percent jump in commercial lending helped overcome weakness at the conglomerate's plastics and subprime-mortgage businesses, and drove a 0.5 percent rise in its shares. GE, whose operations also include healthcare equipment and NBC media, said net earnings rose to $4.51 billion, or 44 cents per diluted share, from $4.44 billion, or 42 cents, a year earlier. On a continuing operations basis, the company said profit was up 10 percent. Analysts on average had expected profit of 44 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "If you look at our infrastructure business today, we're in the very early phase of, I think, a long-term secular time period where we have high visibility, broad technologies, great global positioning, increasing margins and backlog on equipment and long-term service agreements that can span over the next 10 or 15 years," said GE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt, on a conference call with investors. Revenue at the world's second-largest company by market valuation, behind Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), came in at $40.2 billion, up 5.7 percent from $38.03 billion a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $39.76 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Profit at GE Infrastructure, the company's largest business, was up 28 percent. "That seemed like an impressive growth on the equipment side, which should bode well down the road," said Craig Hester, chief executive officer of Austin, Texas-based Hester Capital Management, which owns GE shares. Profit at GE's Industrial unit, which includes GE Plastics, was down 20 percent. GE in January placed its lagging plastics unit on the block, and Immelt on Friday said the company plans to complete the sale by the third quarter. "The sooner they get rid of the plastics business, the better off they'll be. That was obviously a penalty for them," said Douglas Ober of Adams Express Co. ( ADX.N ), a Baltimore, Maryland-based investment company, which owns GE shares and manages about $2.2 billion in assets. MORTGAGES A 'CHALLENGE' GE Money earnings were up 2 percent. "GE Money's earnings were tempered by challenges at its U.S. mortgage business," said Immelt, referring to the company's WMC Mortgage business. Last month, WMC, which lends to less credit-worthy homebuyers, laid off about 20 percent of its work force and said it would stop making new loans to people who do not make down payments. Ober said he was pleased to see the subprime troubles didn't take too much of a toll on results. "The GE Money business, which everybody thought was a potential hurting spot, didn't seem to bother them too much," Ober said. GE expects to report second-quarter earnings of 52 to 54 cents per share from continuing operations, with 20 percent profit growth in Infrastructure and a 10 to 15 percent drop in industrial profits. Analysts on average expected 53 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "It should be reassuring to those who are worried about the economy," James Hardesty, president of Hardesty Capital Management, also in Baltimore, said of the results. "This is a wonderful proxy for the economy telling us things are fine." Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE is regarded as a bellwether of the U.S. economy due to the size and variety of its operations. GE shares were up 16 cents to $35.35 on the New York Stock Exchange. That left them down 5 percent for the year, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , of which GE is a component, is up 0.6 percent.
