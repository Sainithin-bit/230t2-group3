 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Many U.S. corporate chiefs are forgoing annual cash bonuses but they are still reaping millions in another form of bonus award known as incentive compensation, a study released on Friday has found. 

 The report, by governance watchdog The Corporate Library, finds that new regulatory disclosure rules on executive pay can be confusing for the average investor, in part because of the multiple ways that annual bonus payments can now be tallied. "Instead of making the inconsistencies clear, the new disclosure rules have only made it more challenging to conclude whether a chief executive did in fact receive a bonus for the previous year," the research group said in the report. The study, of more than 600 corporate proxies filed so far this year, found that the average CEO "bonus" paid was $981,141, while the average "non-equity incentive compensation" -- a different kind of bonus award -- was $1.52 million. For example, the study cited annual proxy filing data showing that Motorola Inc. MOT.N did not report an annual bonus for Chairman and CEO Edward Zander last year. At the same time, the company reported that Zander received $1.26 million in non-equity incentive plan compensation. Under new U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission definitions, a bonus award is generally considered a non-equity discretionary payment. Non-equity incentives are awards based on pre-established performance targets the CEO needs to achieve. Of the proxies analyzed in the study, 17 percent of companies reported a bonus only for the CEO, in addition to salary, stock options and other pay, while 61 percent reported non-equity incentives but no bonus. Eleven percent of CEOs were awarded both a bonus and incentives, the Corporate Library said. The SEC changed its executive pay disclosure rules recently, requiring companies to provide expanded information about top officers' pay and perquisites.
