 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sallie Mae SLM.N, the largest U.S. 
student loan company, is in talks to be bought out by private 
equity in a deal that could top $20 billion, the New York Times 
reported on its Web site on Friday. 

  Negotiations appear to be at a late stage, but many hurdles 
remain and it was unclear that a deal would be reached, the 
Times said, citing unnamed sources.  The Blackstone Group is one potential bidder, the Times 
said.  Sallie Mae and Blackstone could not immediately be reached 
for comment.  Sallie Mae recently agreed to pay $2 million to settle an 
investigation into financial arrangements it was accused of 
making with U.S. colleges and universities and change some of 
its business practices.
