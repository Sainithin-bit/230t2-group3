 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cott Corp., a Toronto company that makes private-label drinks, is talking with private equity firms about joining operations with Cadbury Schweppes's CBRY.L beverage arm, said the Wall Street Journal, citing a person familiar with the talks. 

 Several private equity firms are considering a bid for Cadbury brands, which include Dr. Pepper and 7 Up, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the situation. Such a combination could create a third-ranked competitor to Coca-Cola ( KO.N ) and PepsiCo ( PEP.N ), the paper said.
