 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sallie Mae SLM.N, the largest U.S. student loan company, is in talks to be bought out by private equity in a deal that could top $20 billion, according to media reports on Friday. 

 The company's shares surged as much as 14.9 percent, and its bonds fell after the New York Times reported that negotiations are at a late stage. Both the Times and Bloomberg News said Blackstone Group is a potential bidder. A deal would come soon after Sallie Mae settled with New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo for $2 million and promised to change its lending practices. The settlement was part of a widening scandal in the $85-billion-a-year student loan industry as state investigators have found that some lenders offered vacations and other perks to university officials for steering student lenders to them. Shares of student lenders have broadly been under pressure since November, when Democrats won enough seats in Congress to control both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Investors are concerned that Democrats will find ways to reduce the role of private lenders in the student loan market. Senator Edward Kennedy, a Democrat, has introduced legislation that would threaten lenders including Sallie Mae by rewarding colleges for steering students into loans made directly by the government. A leveraged buyout of a student loan company would be unusual, because if financial firms take on too much debt, their profit margins get squeezed, said Bob Truesdell, the head of the bond department at MTBIA, which owns Sallie Mae bonds. Truesdell said private equity firms may instead look to make all-equity investments in Sallie Mae, with no debt financing. GOING TO JUNK? Sallie Mae has about $116.14 billion of total assets, supported by $4.4 billion of stockholders' equity. Adding another $19 billion of debt could result in another $1.1 billion in annual interest expense, an amount about equal to the company's 2006 net income, wrote Leslie Mapondera, an analyst at Credit Suisse in a note to investors. But two asset-backed bankers who asked not to be named said separately that Sallie Mae could boost its borrowings and possibly even accept junk credit ratings. It could then turn to the asset-backed market for all future borrowings. The bond market showed some concern about that possibility. Sallie Mae's notes due 2014 with a 5.375 percent coupon weakened relative to Treasuries and were the most actively traded U.S. dollar bond on Friday, according to MarketAxess. The cost to protect its debt in the credit default swaps market rose to 78 basis points on Friday, or $78,000 a year for every $10 million of principal insured for five years, from 38 basis points on Thursday and under 30 basis points earlier this week. A Sallie Mae spokesman declined to comment, citing a policy against speaking about market rumors. A Blackstone spokesman declined to comment. Sallie Mae's shares were up $5.75, or 14.1 percent, to $46.50 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Options volume jumped on Thursday, a day before the reports were released, which analysts said was unusual but did not necessarily indicate insider trading.
