 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - A Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led consortium pursuing Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX is considering partnering with a listed company in its bid, but no agreements have been reached, a source said. 

 "Options are clearly being assessed," a source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Friday, adding that it was premature to suggest that any agreements have been reached. KKR KKR.UL is facing a potential bidding war with conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX for Australia's second-largest retailer, which has offered A$19.7 billion ($16.4 billion) in a combination of cash and scrip. Analysts have said Wesfarmers may have an advantage with Coles shareholders since the scrip portion of the bid offers capital gains tax relief, which a cash-only bid cannot match. Local media have said Australian supermarket retailer Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ) is interested in finding a partner to make a possible bid for the Coles group or some of its divisions. ($=A$1.20)
