 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge approved on Friday a settlement that requires former CA Inc. CA.N Chief Executive Sanjay Kumar to pay nearly $800 million over his lifetime to victims of an accounting fraud at the company. 

 Kumar's restitution agreement follows his sentencing in November to 12 years in prison for his role in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud at the computer software company, previously known as Computer Associates. Kumar agreed to pay $52 million by the end of next year by liquidating assets belonging to him and his family including real estate, luxury cars and a yacht, according to court documents. "The objective was to get as much cash up front as possible," said Lawrence G. McMichael, an attorney for Kumar, in a hearing before Judge I. Leo Glasser in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. Kumar has already sold two Ferraris. The agreement allows him to retain his family home. "The settlement is going to allow his family to live reasonably well. That's fair. They didn't commit any crimes," McMichael told reporters after the hearing. Kumar will also be required to pay 20 percent of his annual income after he is released from prison to cover the unpaid portion of the restitution, according to court documents. The almost $800 million Kumar will pay is part of an overall $1.02 billion restitution settlement with victims of the fraud. The Feinberg Fund will distribute the restitution amount to the victims. The restitution agreement allows investors who lost more than $5 because of the fraud to recover about 2.32 percent of their losses, according to Feinberg. CA restated its results for fiscal 2001 through 2004 after Kumar left the Islandia, New York-based company following a career that spanned nearly two decades. As part of an accounting scheme, Kumar improperly booked software license revenue from 1999 to 2000 to meet Wall Street analysts' profit expectations and then lied to investigators about it, the government said earlier. Kumar, who has not yet reported to prison, still faces a civil suit over his role in the fraud.
