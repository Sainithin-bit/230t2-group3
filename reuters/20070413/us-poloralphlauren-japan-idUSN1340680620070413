 TOKYO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. said on Friday it would acquire Japanese licensee Impact 21 Co. for about $345 million, aiming to expand in its second-largest market after the United States. 

 Polo Ralph Lauren said it would buy the 80 percent stake in Impact 21 that it does not already own at 2,600 yen ($22) per share, or an 18 percent premium to the stock's closing price on Friday. Buying the stake would cost about 41 billion yen ($345 million) It plans to pay cash for the shares. The New York-based company, which makes clothing lines such as Ralph Lauren Purple Label and Club Monaco, also said it would buy the remaining 50 percent interest in its Japanese master licensee, Polo Ralph Lauren Japan, for about $23 million. That would bring the total transaction cost to about $370 million, the company said in a statement. Polo said it would boost its presence in major department stores and expand its portfolio of stores in Japan, which accounts for about 10 percent of its group sales and represents its largest footprint in Asia. But Japan is still dwarfed by the United States, by far Polo's largest market at 70 percent of group revenues. "Our long-term strategies are to build Ralph Lauren into a global business that is evenly spread between Europe, United States and Asia," Roger Farah, Polo Ralph Lauren President and COO, told a news conference in Tokyo. Impact 21 is Polo Ralph Lauren's Japanese sub-licensee for men's, women's and jeans apparel, and accessories. It is 26.5 percent owned by Onward Kashiyama Co., one of Japan's leading apparel companies. The tender offer will run from April 17 to May 21 and is conditional upon Polo achieving a minimum ownership of 66.67 percent of the outstanding shares. The offer is supported by the board of Impact 21 and Onward Kashiyama, Polo said.
