 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A jump in trading of SLM Corp. SLM.N calls on Thursday ahead of a New York Times report that the largest U.S. student loan company was in talks to go private was unusual, but not necessarily indicative of insider trading, option analysts said. 

 Upcoming earnings and the persistent rumors of a possible buyout could have been contributing factors to the surge of bullish options trading prior to Friday's report, analysts said. "There were rumors already circulating on Thursday that they may be the next takeover candidate," said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. SLM shares soared $5.30, or 13 percent, to $46.05 on Friday following the Times report that SLM was in talks to go private in a deal that could be worth over $20 billion. A Sallie Mae spokesman said the company does not comment on rumors or speculation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was not immediately available to comment on the options activity. Credit default swap spreads have also widened on LBO rumors, government probes into SLM's lending practices and concerns that proposed legislation that would encourage more direct lending to students will dampen SLM's profitability. "Political risk is an issue, as Congress continues to scrutinize the cost of student loan programs," Gimme Credit analyst Kathleen Shanley said in a report on Friday. The cost to insure SLM's debt with default swaps had widened from under 30 basis points in early March to 38 basis points on Thursday, before jumping to 78 basis points on the LBO report on Friday, or $78,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt. CALL OPTIONS Investors often turn to calls hoping to profit on a stock price rise. In all, 21,829 options traded on Thursday in SLM, according to the Options Clearing Corp. The activity was dominated by 15,280 calls, which grant the right to buy the stock at a preset price within a specified time period -- nearly twice the normal volume of 8,444 contracts. SLM shares had traded in a $40.60 to $41.17 range on Thursday and some of its April calls with strike prices above that share price were in demand. "The April $45 and April $50 calls appeared to be the most active and had the most contracts outstanding, indicating that there was consistent heavy option trading since the start of the year," said Michael Schwartz, chief options strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. in New York. Thursday's activity is typical of persistent takeover rumors. On the other side, SLM puts were also active, he said. Paul Foster, strategist at Web information site theflyonthewall.com, noted the demand for SLM options also pushed up its option-projected volatility as investors braced for a big stock move. Options implied volatility, a statistical measure related to how much a stock is expected to move up or down based on options prices, typically rises heading into uncertainty such as earnings. It usually falls after an event has passed. SLM is due to report quarterly results on April 24. Foster noted that SLM's overall May option implied volatility stood at 31 percent on Thursday -- way above its 26-week average of 25 percent, according to Track Data. That suggested larger price risks to the underlying stock, he said. "We are hearing that the company will be acquired for about $30 billion, including $10 billion in debt, which is approximately a 20 percent premium on the current price," vFinance's Lefkowitz said.
