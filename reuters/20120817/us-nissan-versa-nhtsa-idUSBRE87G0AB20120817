 (Reuters) - U.S. safety regulators are investigating reports that a damaged cable assembly in the 2012 Nissan Versa could prevent its airbag from deploying in a crash. 
 The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said its investigation covered an estimated 100,000 Versas sold in the United States. NHTSA, which has opened a preliminary investigation, said Nissan had notified it that the airbag cable assembly was founded pinched within the steering column on some Versas. "Damage or a short to this cable may cause the airbag to not deploy, which poses a safety risk," said NHTSA's Office of Defect Investigation. A NHTSA defect investigation can lead to a safety recall. The safety agency said it had received no complaints or reports of failures. (Reporting by Paul Lienert in Detroit; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
