 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Monday it would sell a 53 percent stake in its Yellow Pages business to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP [CBS.UL}, which will pay AT&T $750 million in cash and take on $200 million in debt. 
 AT&T had said in January that it would consider selling the dwindling business, which generated about $3.3 billion in revenue in 2011. After the deal the telephone directory business will honor existing union contracts, the company said. AT&T said it expects the deal to have a minimal effect on 2012 earnings and does not expect a material gain or loss. (Reporting By  Sinead Carew ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
