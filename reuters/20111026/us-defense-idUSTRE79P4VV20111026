 (Reuters) - Three big defense contractors posted solid profits on Wednesday, but their shares fell on concerns that leaner budgets would hurt performance. 
 Industry leader Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) said business was strong as its third-quarter sales rose, but added it expected flat sales for 2012 in an uncertain backdrop for defense spending. Quarterly sales from Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ) and General Dynamics missed expectations, showing effects of existing Washington efforts to curb defense spending. Lockheed's shares fell 3.6 percent to $76.06, while Northrop's shares were down 2.6 percent to $55.11 and General Dynamics shed 2.5 percent to $63.62. "The problem I see is uncertainty, uncertainty, uncertainty," Morgan Keegan defense analyst Brian Ruttenbur said. "Nobody knows what is going to happen." After spending heavily for a decade on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. Defense Department faces the prospect of cuts of up to about $1 trillion. Under the debt reduction agreement signed by President Barack Obama last summer, the Defense Department is looking to cut at least $350 billion from its projected spending over the next 10 years. It could face an additional $600 billion in automatic spending cuts unless a congressional supercommittee agrees on alternatives. "It's hard to imagine everybody's immune from a trillion-dollar cut," Ruttenbur said of the defense contractors. Lockheed, the developer of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and F-16 fighter jet, said earnings were $700 million, or $2.10 a share, for the third quarter, compared with $560 million, or $1.54 a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.99, compared with $1.81 expected by analysts on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly revenue at Lockheed rose nearly 7 percent to $12.1 billion. It said it expected flat sales for 2012, assuming the U.S. defense budget is approved in a timely manner with funding at levels consistent with President Barack Obama's proposed budget. Stock buybacks and cost-cutting helped Northrop and General Dynamics top Wall Street profit estimates as defense revenues fell. Northrop, a supplier of unmanned spy planes, had earnings of $520 million, or $1.86 a diluted share, in the third quarter. Analysts expected $1.68 a share. Its quarterly revenue fell 6 percent to $6.6 billion. General Dynamics ( GD.N ), which makes business jets as well as tanks and other military equipment, said its third-quarter net earnings were $652 million, or $1.80 a share. Earnings from continuing operations were $1.83, compared with $1.77 expected by analysts. Quarterly revenue at General Dynamics fell 2 percent to $7.85 billion.
