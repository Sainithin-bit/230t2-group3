 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Co ( 9501.T ), operator of the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, is likely to announce its earnings for April-September on November 14, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Wednesday. 
 A spokesman for the utility, known as Tepco, denied it has set a date for the announcement, however. The firm is preparing a business plan that must win government approval by early November so that a bailout body, funded by public money and contributions from nuclear operators, will provide unlimited funds to help compensate those affected by the ongoing radiation crisis in Fukushima.
