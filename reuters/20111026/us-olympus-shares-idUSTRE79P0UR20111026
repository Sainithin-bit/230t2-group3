 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Shares of scandal-plagued Olympus Corp ( 7733.T ) fell more than 10 percent on Wednesday after gaining 8.2 percent in the previous session. 
 On Wednesday, a senior Japanese lawmaker demanded a probe of "outlandish" advisory payments and its ousted chief executive said he was in contact with the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), piling pressure on the embattled company. The company's shares had fallen for seven straight sessions through Tuesday, losing more than half their value, after the camera and endoscope maker fired its chief executive, who has questioned hefty fees paid to financial advisers in past M&A deals. Olympus was down 9.9 percent at 1,072 yen, after falling as low as 1,060 yen. (Reporting by Lisa Twaronite; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
