 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The head of the euro zone's financial assistance fund, Klaus Regling, will travel to China on Friday for talks with buyers of bonds issued by the European Financial Stability Facility, a spokesman for the fund said. 
 "Mr. Regling will hold talks on Friday in China with important investors in EFSF bonds," EFSF spokesman Christof Roche said on Wednesday. The EFSF is a 440 billion euro ($600 billion) fund set up in May last year to provide emergency aid to euro zone member states unable to fund themselves via financial markets. China has been a buyer of bonds issued by the EFSF, which is rated triple-A by credit agencies. Roche said he could not confirm that China planned to invest in a special purpose vehicle that could be set up by the EFSF to buy up the distressed debt of euro zone governments.
