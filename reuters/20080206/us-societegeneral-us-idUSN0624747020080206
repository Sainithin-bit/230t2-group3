 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are looking for U.S. ties to French bank Societe Generale's ( SOGN.PA ) trading scandal, for example transactions that went through a U.S. broker, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 The report, quoting a person close to the bank, said the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn was trying to find out whether Societe Generale employee Jerome Kerviel, who has been blamed for about $7.3 billon in trading losses, had traded on a U.S. index or if any deals ran through a U.S. broker. Representatives at the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of New York were not immediately available for comment. Separately, a source close to investigations told Reuters the U.S. Department of Justice is looking into stock sales by a member of Societe Generale's board shortly before the bank announced the huge losses.
