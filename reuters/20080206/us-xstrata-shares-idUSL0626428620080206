 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in Anglo-Swiss miner Xstrata XTA.L climbed as much as 3.2 percent on Wednesday, as traders cited persistent market talk of a bid from Brazilian mining giant Vale ( VALE5.SA ). 

 One trader said there was talk of a bid of 4,500 pence per share. Xstrata declined to comment. In January, Vale said it was in talks with Xstrata about a takeover, a deal that analysts said could top $100 billion. At 3:35 a.m. EST shares in Xstrata were up 1.5 percent at 3,848 pence while other miners dipped broadly and Britain's FTSE 100  .FTSE  was down 0.4 percent.
