 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MetLife Inc ( MET.N ), the largest U.S. life insurer, said on Wednesday that net income fell in the fourth quarter, based on a comparison with a $3 billion after-tax gain a year ago. 

 MetLife said net income was $1.08 billion or $1.44 a share, down from $3.83 billion or $4.95 a share in the year earlier quarter when the insurer reported gains from the sale of two large apartment complexes. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
