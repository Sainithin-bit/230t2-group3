 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Shares in automakers General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) slid in early trade on Wednesday after Bear Stearns downgraded both companies citing concerns over weakening consumer purchasing power. 

 Bear Stearns downgraded No 1 U.S. automaker GM to "underperform" and Ford to "peer perform." In a research note to clients, analyst Peter Nesvold wrote that the "facts are changing at an accelerating rate; and when the facts change, we must change our view." "Our downgrades reflect renewed concerns that both the propensity and ability of the automotive consumer to purchase vehicles is deteriorating at an accelerating rate," he added. Last Friday GM reported a surprise 2.6 percent increase in January U.S. vehicle sales, while Ford said sales declined by 3.6 percent during the month. High gasoline prices plus the U.S. housing meltdown have raised concerns that the U.S. economy may be headed for a recession, causing consumers to err on the side of caution and delay big-ticket purchases such as new vehicles. As a result, many in the auto industry have predicted a second straight year of lower sales. Bear Stearns' Nesvold wrote that in the case of GM "we expect heightened incentives and continued market share losses for the foreseeable future into a fading product cadence and a declining '08 market." On Ford, Nesvold wrote "the trajectory of the turnaround is encouraging... we simply believe it prudent to keep some pow(d)er dry until the macro horizon clears." In New York Stock Exchange trade, GM shares were down 2.5 percent to $25.80, while Ford was down 1.2 percent to $6.35. (Reporting by  Nick Carey ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
