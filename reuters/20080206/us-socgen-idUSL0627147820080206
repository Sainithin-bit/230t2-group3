 PARIS  (Reuters) - With a slew of potentially damaging public hearings on the Societe Generale rogue dealing scandal over for the time being, attention turned on Wednesday to a capital increase needed to shore up the French bank's finances. 

 Le Figaro reported SocGen's board would meet on Wednesday, a day after Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer expressed astonishment at the failure of SocGen systems to spot illicit deals that led to 4.9 billion euros ($7.2 billion) trading loss. The board could give the go-ahead for a quick launch to a 5.5 billion euro capital increase following days of private presentations and talks with shareholders, the newspaper said. With global share markets crumbling and doubts swirling over SocGen's independence, the bank is expected to offer a steep discount to ensure the operation's success, traders said. SocGen said it had no immediate comment. The bank is also under pressure to secure the capital increase and stake out its future amid persistent speculation of a takeover bid for SocGen worth at least 40 billion euros. "We might see someone coming in and blocking the capital increase with a takeover offer, that's the rumor today," said a Paris-based trader with a foreign brokerage. "The timing is indeed very bad for a capital increase, with markets falling on fears of recession after more weak U.S. data. In this negative macro environment, it won't be easy to raise 5.5 billion," the trader said. SocGen shares rose 2.2 percent to 80.95 euros against weaker European markets in which bank stocks were down on average by just over 1 percent. Fuelled by takeover rumors, SocGen has clawed back 21 percent from its low in the immediate aftermath of the trading crisis but has lagged the DJ Stoxx eurozone bank index by 2.5 percent so far this year. BID TALK Historic rival BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), France's largest listed bank ahead of SocGen, has said it is looking at SocGen. French bank Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) may also be interested and traders on Wednesday reported fresh speculation of an approach from Britain's HSBC ( HSBA.L ). France has warned off foreign predators and says it would prefer a local solution and that any merger must be friendly. Bouton, who fought off a bid from BNP in 1999, said last week SocGen had the financial strength to stay independent. SocGen's rights issue, which will be underwritten by JPMorgan ( JPM.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), is designed to shore up the bank's key Tier 1 risked-weighted capital solvency ratio to 8.0 percent, from 6.6 percent. This includes the effect of its raised stake in Russia's Rosbank ( ROSB.MM ) and compares with a ratio of 7.2 percent at larger French bank BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ). While the size of the rights issue has already been announced, the board could discuss the size of the discount offered to shareholders after Executive Chairman Daniel Bouton visited several institutional investors. On January 24, SocGen unveiled a 4.9 billion euros loss which it said was caused by rogue deals executed by Jerome Kerviel, a 31-year old junior trader at the French bank. Kerviel has been placed under formal investigation for breach of trust, computer abuse and falsification and freed under judicial supervision, which resembles bail. Judges dismissed the bank's harsher accusations of attempted fraud. Kerviel told Agence France Presse in an interview on Tuesday he would not be turned into a scapegoat for the bank's woes. "I take my share of the responsibility but I will not be turned into a scapegoat of Societe Generale," he was quoted as saying. Noyer expressed amazement on Tuesday that the trader at the heart of a Societe Generale scandal had evaded detection for so long and backed tougher fines on banks for lapses in controls. In an earlier hearing he disclosed that the central bank had warned SocGen about its risk control systems in March 2007.
