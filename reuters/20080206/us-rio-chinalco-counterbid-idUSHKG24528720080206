 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's state-owned aluminum giant Chinalco is not currently mounting a bid for miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ) to counter the $147 billion offer made on Wednesday by BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX )BHP.L, sources familiar with the situation said. 

 A report in Britain's Times newspaper said that Chinalco and its U.S. partner, Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ), which hold 9 percent of Rio, are preparing to counter the BHP bid. But sources familiar with the matter said Chinalco is in no rush to make the next move. BHP's bid for Rio would be the second-biggest takeover in corporate history.
