 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Yields on Japanese government bonds are unlikely to head back towards the two-year lows touched last month as the market's brief flirtation with the possibility of a Bank of Japan rate cut starts to fade. 

 Worries about the Japanese economy have eased a little, with investors hoping the United States can avert a deep recession after aggressive rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, a mooted $150 billion economic stimulus package and hefty capital injections at banks and bond insurers hit by the credit crunch. The 10-year government bond (JGB) yield has jumped back up as high as 1.475 percent from a 28-month low of 1.310 percent in January, when share prices were plunging. "U.S. fiscal and monetary policies to avert a recession have helped to calm the market, so 10-year JGB yields are unlikely to fall and stay below 1.3 percent," said Mari Iwashita, a senior market economist at Daiwa Securities SMBC. "It's possible that now could be seen as a turning point," she added, reflecting views in some quarters that any U.S. recession could be mild, especially with companies still generally remaining healthy. Japanese economic growth has slowed but has yet to show the severe distress from troubles in the United States that would be needed to justify a Bank of Japan (BOJ) rate cut. BOJ Governor Toshihiko Fukui has long wanted to raise rates from the abnormally low levels used over the past few years to fight deflation, but the credit crisis has prevented that, apart from two modest increases in mid-2006 and February 2007. Indeed, speculation about a rate cut took hold this year, although money markets now see the chances of that happening at about 40 percent, compared with nearly 80 percent last month. As a result, the two-year JGB yield rose above 0.600 percent this week after hitting a two-year low of 0.485 percent last month -- below the BOJ's 0.5 percent overnight rate target, which showed how strong the rate cut speculation was. LOOKING FOR RECOVERY The 10-year JGB yield is expected to trade broadly in a range between 1.4 percent and 1.5 percent until the end of March, when investors close their books for Japan's business year. That range is some way below the recent peak of 1.585 percent seen in early December, and that easing in yields should underpin the Japanese economy, alleviating the spike in corporate borrowing costs resulting from the trouble in global markets. Data on Tuesday showing a big contraction in the U.S. service sector in January underscored worries about recession. But rather than fretting too much about that, investors in Japan are trying to assess the timing and extent of any recovery. "JGB yields already factor in expectations that deceleration in the U.S. housing and jobs markets will drag down growth," said Atsushi Ito, a JGB strategist at Morgan Stanley. "But companies are still posting profits. If their earnings start to drop, that will point to recession. But so far, there are few such signs." Analysts also say major U.S. banks and financial institutions have largely finished writing down their multi-billion-dollar losses stemming mainly from subprime mortgage defaults. "Views are very pessimistic if you are close to the financial markets and less so if you are watching fundamentals," said Kazuto Uchida, general manager for economic research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. NO REASON TO CUT Japanese data points to a slowdown. But exports remain solid, helped by Asian demand, industrial output has not faltered and consumer spending has held up despite the tumble in Tokyo shares. The BOJ has stuck to its view that Japan's economy will grow steadily, while acknowledging the risks from the United States. A fall in Japanese exports and broad economic deterioration would be needed to justify any easing and that has not happened. "There has been no decisive data justifying a rate cut," said Tatsuo Ichikawa, chief JGB strategist at ABN AMRO Securities. Uchida at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi agreed, saying it would take extreme circumstances -- repercussions from the failure of major overseas financial institutions or a stock market slide of 30-40 percent, for example -- to force the BOJ to ease. Consumer prices are edging up in Japan -- inflation excluding fresh food prices hit 0.8 percent in December -- and that means the BOJ's policy stance is already quite accommodative, raising doubts about how effective any rate cut would be. Some analysts think yields could briefly test the two-year lows before March because some investors may not have bought JGBs for the fiscal year due to expectations of a BOJ rate rise in late 2007. Stock market volatility also makes bonds attractive. But major market players such as the big Japanese banks evidently do not believe a BOJ rate cut is on the cards. Data from the Japanese Securities and Dealers Association shows big banks were buyers of yen bonds in November for the first time in five months, then dumped them again in December. "We don't want to go long on five-year JGBs with yields at 0.7-0.8 percent or two-year yields around 0.5 percent, as these are levels reflecting a BOJ rate cut as the main scenario," said the chief JGB portfolio manager at a large Japanese bank.
