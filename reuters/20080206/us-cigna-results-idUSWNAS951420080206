 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp ( CI.N ) said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter profit rose, helped by its international operations and disability and life business. 

 Net income at the Philadelphia-based company rose to $263 million, or 93 cents per share, from $232 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, adjusted income from operations was 98 cents per share. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
