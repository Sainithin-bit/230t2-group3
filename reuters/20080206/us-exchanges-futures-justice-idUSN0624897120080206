 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has called for change in financial futures exchanges, saying they should not own the trade clearing business as it inhibits competition, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 The report said the Justice Department's recommendation could affect the potential merger of CME Group Inc CME.N, parent of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and Nymex Holdings Inc NMX.N, parent of the New York Mercantile Exchange. Department officials were not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando )
