 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Diversified miner Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) said on Wednesday it has made a significant coal discovery in South Africa, which has total resource size of over 1.04 billion tons. 

 The coal was found in Limpopo province, a coal basin located in the north of South Africa. It is bituminous thermal coal that is suitable for generating electricity, Rio said in a statement. Rio said preliminary studies have shown that up to 40 percent of the resource at Chapudi coal discovery might be recoverable, and it was in talks with South Africa's state utility Eskom ESCJ.UL as well as other independent power producers to discuss the feasibility and economics of commercializing the project. "This is a significant find in an area that has previously been viewed as having little geological potential," chief executive of Rio Tinto Energy & Minerals, Preston Chiaro, said in a statement. "The project's potential to produce thermal coal for electricity generation comes at a time when South African needs to rapidly increase its generating capacity." Coal shortages, broken power plants and summer maintenance in South Africa have led to a severe power crisis in the country last month, forcing many major mining firms, such as BHP Billiton Ltd ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT ) and Anglo American Plc ( AAL.L ) to shut down their operations. Rio, which on Wednesday received a $147 billion hostile takeover offer from rival BHP, said the basin also offers opportunities to produce a range of products, from thermal to hard coking coal for the exports market. Shares in Rio were up 1.9 percent to A$129.80 by 0014 GMT (7:14 p.m. EST), beating a 2.7 percent decline in the broader index, largely lifted by BHP's takeover bid. Exploration rights to the Chapudi coal discovery are held by two joint venture companies; Chapudi Coal Pty Ltd, in which Rio holds a 70 percent stake, and Kwezi Mining Exploration Pty Ltd, in which Rio has a 49 percent interest.
