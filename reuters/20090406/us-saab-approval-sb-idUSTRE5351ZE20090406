 VANERSBORG, Sweden  (Reuters) - A local Swedish court on Monday granted General Motors' ( GM.N ) loss-making unit Saab an extension of the period it is protected from creditors, giving it further time to restructure. 

 The Swedish carmaker, which sought protection from creditors in February, outlined plans for its continued reorganization, including a reduction of non-prioritized debt by 75 percent, at its first formal meeting with creditors earlier on Monday. "The court has decided that the reconstruction can continue until May 20 at the latest, if no other decision is taken before then," the court said. Saab has to seek another extension of the reconstruction period by May 19, according to documents presented to the court by the company's administrator. (Reporting by Sven Nordenstam)
