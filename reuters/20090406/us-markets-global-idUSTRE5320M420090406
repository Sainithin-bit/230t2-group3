 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks reversed course on Monday and fell as fading optimism over the global economy and renewed concerns about banks prompted investors to seek the safety of the U.S. dollar. 

 Oil prices fell to almost $51 a barrel, tracking the decline in stock prices, while gold prices fell almost 3 percent with the rise in the dollar and weaker oil. Copper ended down for the first time in five sessions, falling 2 percent to settle at $1.9590 a pound, as a slide in stocks rekindled concerns about demand for industrial metals and helped offset optimism over Chinese buying. Renewed worries about the troubled banking sector led investors to book gains after a sharp four-week global stock rally, while the potential collapse of IBM's takeover of Sun Microsystems bruised sentiment in the technology sector. Sun fell 22.5 percent and shares of International Business Machines ( IBM.N ) slipped 0.65 percent, making it one of the biggest drags on the Dow. Shares of big manufacturers, whose fortunes are closely linked to the economic cycle, were among the top laggards, with Caterpillar ( CAT.N ) down 2.6 percent to $31.31. The biggest drag on the Dow was JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ), which fell 3.7 percent to $28.20. Bank shares stumbled after veteran banking analyst Mike Mayo of Calyon Securities initiated coverage on several large banks and said the sector's problems still have further to run and government action may not help as much as expected. Also weighing on bank shares were comments by billionaire investor George Soros, who told Reuters Financial Television that the "banking system as a whole is basically insolvent." He also said the U.S. economy is in for "a lasting slowdown. "A few people came out and said the banks weren't in great shape and that's all it's going to take," said Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Arkansas. "Uncertainty leads to fear and fear leads to selling." U.S. stocks closed well off their session lows, however, after Meredith Whitney, another closely followed bank analyst, said most banks will have made "a little bit of money" in the first quarter and capital ratios were sure to get better. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 41.74 points, or 0.52 percent, to 7,975.85. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 7.02 points, or 0.83 percent, to 835.48. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  shed 15.16 points, or 0.93 percent, at 1,606.71. In late afternoon trading in New York, the euro fell 0.6 percent versus the dollar to $1.3399. The ICE Futures' dollar index, a gauge of the dollar's value against six major currencies, was 0.7 percent higher at 84.73 .DXY. "When equities move up, euro/dollar goes higher, and when stocks move down, euro/dollar goes lower," said Greg Salvaggio, senior vice president for capital markets at Tempus Consulting in Washington. U.S. Treasuries fell, pressured by looming supply and disappointment in the market over how much debt the Federal Reserve bought. Losses were limited as the weakness in stocks lent some safe-haven appeal to government debt. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note traded 11/32 lower in price to yield 2.94 percent, while the two-year note traded unchanged in price to yield 0.96 percent. Benchmark euro zone government bonds pared losses after the stock rally in Asia and early in Europe fizzled as risk aversion seeped back into the market. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed 0.7 percent lower at 766.09 points. The benchmark index is up 18 percent since sliding to an all-time low on March 9. "The bulls are getting a bit ahead of themselves. We're poised for some profit taking," said Ad van Tiggelen, senior strategist at ING Investment Management. "We've seen a violent sector shift in a very short period, with some cyclicals up between 50 percent and 100 percent in about 3 weeks. But at current prices, these cyclicals are not as cheap as they should be at this point of the cycle." U.S. light crude for May delivery fell $1.46 to settle at $51.05 a barrel. London Brent crude fell $1.23 to $52.24 a barrel. Gold for June delivery declined $24.50 to close at $872.80 in New York. Overnight in Asia shares climbed to almost a six-month high as hopes that the global economic downturn is nearing its bottom spurred demand for riskier assets. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 1.8 percent, touching highs last seen on October 16, while Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  gained 1.2 percent to a three-month closing high.
