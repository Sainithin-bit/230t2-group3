 (Reuters) - Wireless carrier T-Mobile is planning an aggressive push into the home with a variety of communication devices that will use Google's new Android operating software, the New York Times said. 

 According to the paper, confidential documents obtained from a company partner indicate that T-Mobile plans to sell a home phone early next year and a tablet computer soon after, both running Android. A T-Mobile spokesman, Peter Dobrow declined to discuss any future company products but confirmed plans for several devices based on Android, the paper said. The Android operating system, already run on a T-Mobile cell phone, handles basic functions for mobile devices and competes with operating systems made by Apple, Microsoft, Nokia and others.
