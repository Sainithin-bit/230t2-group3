 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Allen Stanford, the billionaire Texan accused of an $8 billion fraud by U.S. regulators, said he expects to be indicted by a federal grand jury in the next two weeks, according to an ABC News interview released on Monday. 

 Stanford, who ABC said cried during the interview, also denied running a Ponzi scheme. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Stanford, two of his top aides and three of his companies of a long-running Ponzi scheme using high-yield certificates of deposit issued by his bank in Antigua. "I would die and go to hell if it's a Ponzi scheme, Stanford told the television network. "If it was a Ponzi scheme, why are they finding billions and billions of dollars all over the place?" In a Ponzi scheme, early investors are paid returns from funds with later investors. Stanford, a high-flying sports patron with luxury homes in the Caribbean, Texas and Florida, told a federal court in Dallas he has been unable to hire an attorney to represent him because his accounts have been frozen by a court-appointed attorney. He has been in talks with well-known Houston criminal lawyer Dick DeGuerin to put together a team to handle the civil and possible criminal charges, DeGuerin told Reuters last month.
