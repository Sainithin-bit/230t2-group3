 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will continue to face fundamental business risks and remains a highly risky credit in spite of its debt reduction, Standard & Poor's said on Monday. 

 Ford said on Monday it had slashed automotive debt by 38 percent, or $9.9 billion, which will trim its cash interest expenses by more than $500 million per year. The company paid $1 billion to buy back $2.2 billion in bonds at 47 cents on the dollar to reduce its debt load. The below-par debt tender represents a selective default on its bonds, S&P said in a statement. S&P said it expects to rerate the debt by mid-April and Ford's corporate credit rating is unlikely to be higher than the CCC range, eight steps below default and still a deeply distressed rating. "We believe Ford's fundamental business risks remain unchanged for at least the rest of 2009 and perhaps longer: most notably, deteriorating vehicle demand globally and the substantial execution risk of the ongoing restructuring," S&P said.
