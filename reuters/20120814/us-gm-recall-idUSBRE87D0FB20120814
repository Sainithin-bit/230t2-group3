 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) is recalling 10,315 Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana vans from model years 2003-2004 in 20 cold-weather U.S. states and in Canada because road salt may have corroded a fueling pipe, GM said. 
 There are 9,389 vans recalled in the United States and 926 in Canada. The affected vans have "60/40" swing-out driver side doors. U.S. safety regulators said there is a higher risk of fire if the pipe that carries gasoline is corroded. No injuries or fires have been reported as a result of this issue, GM said. GM said owners already have been notified that they can bring their vehicles to dealers for repairs if necessary. Dealers will install a new fuel filler neck assembly.
