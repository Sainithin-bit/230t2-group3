 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - There are still downside risks to the global economy, Group of Seven policymakers say in a draft of their communique, a G7 source told Reuters on Saturday. 

 "The view is that the tentative recovery we are seeing is down to government action," said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. "The risks are to the downside." The source said the draft also called for pressing ahead with financial regulation. Its statement on currencies was "the blandest possible," but was still in brackets, meaning it could still be revised or not included in the official communique at all. G7 nations are expected to release a communique later on Saturday after a meeting of their finance ministers and central bank chiefs. (Editing by  Andrew Torchia )
