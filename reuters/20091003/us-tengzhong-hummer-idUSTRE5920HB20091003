 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China's Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery is poised to complete its purchase of General Motor Corp's Hummer division within days, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday. 

 The paper said executives were in Detroit this weekend putting the finishing touches on the deal. A Tengzhong spokesman was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Michael Flaherty ; Editing by  Sanjeev Miglani )
