 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - The following are comments from finance officials in Istanbul for the Group of Seven, IMF and World Bank meetings. 

 CANADIAN FINANCE MINISTER JIM FLAHERTY ON CURRENCIES, G20: "It's easier to discuss (foreign exchange) at the G20 because the Asian countries are represented. We do talk about it at the G7 as well." IMF CHIEF DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN ON ECONOMIC RISKS: "There are a lot of downside risks, particularly in the financial sector ... It is not my preferred scenario but a double dip is always possible." BUNDESBANK PRESIDENT AXEL WEBER: "We are in a stabilization period now." "The third quarter will be quite clearly be stronger than the second one. (German) growth in third quarter will be at a level of 0.75 percent. This is realistic." "There will be a high volatility of quarterly data." "Because of the finance crisis, the German growth potential seems to have decreased to around one percent compared to around 1.5 pct before." "We will return around 2013 to the economic level we had 2008." FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER CHRISTINE LAGARDE ON EXIT STRATEGY: "I have my eyes riveted on the unemployment rate ... that is going to be my (indicator) to decide when to tiptoe gradually out of the thing. We are better pulling out a little bit later than a little bit early. If we do it too early the whole package we have put in place in the last 12 months will be a complete waste."
