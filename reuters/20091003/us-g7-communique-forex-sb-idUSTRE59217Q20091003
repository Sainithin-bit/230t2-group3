 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven will retain the language on currencies it used in a statement after its last meeting in April in a communique expected on Saturday, a G7 source said. 

 "There is no change from the previous communique," the G7 source said when asked what the G7 finance ministers and central bankers would say about currencies. This included references to China's currency, the source said. "There is a perfect continuity on the appreciation of the yuan." The source also said there was no discussion in a meeting of G7 deputies on Saturday about potentially transforming the G7 club of rich nations into a smaller Group of Four. "The idea was not mentioned," the source said. (Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
