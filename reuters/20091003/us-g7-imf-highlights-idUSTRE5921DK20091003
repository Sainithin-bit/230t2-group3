 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - The following are comments from finance officials in Istanbul for the Group of Seven, IMF and World Bank meetings. 

 G7 OFFICIAL, REQUESTING ANONYMITY: The official said the G7 would issue a communique and would likely discuss the group's future role and the possibility of different groupings, although those subjects would not be mentioned in the statement. The official said the communique would employ language on currencies similar to that used by the G7 finance officials after their last meeting in April. It would also contain similar language on the outlook for the global economy and the need for stimulus, the official said. JOSEPH ACKERMAN, IIF CHAIRMAN AND DEUTSCHE BANK CEO: "I believe there is a very real risk that as central banks and governments strive to avoid premature shifts away from supportive monetary and fiscal policies, regulatory reforms come into force that could undermine global recovery and job creation." "Regulatory measures need to be weighed in substantive dialogue with the industry to enable banks to play their vital role in the economy," he said in a news release. CANADIAN FINANCE MINISTER JIM FLAHERTY ON CURRENCIES, G20: "It's easier to discuss (foreign exchange) at the G20 because the Asian countries are represented. We do talk about it at the G7 as well." IMF CHIEF DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN ON ECONOMIC RISKS: "There are a lot of downside risks, particularly in the financial sector ... It is not my preferred scenario but a double dip is always possible." BUNDESBANK PRESIDENT AXEL WEBER: "We are in a stabilization period now." "The third quarter will be quite clearly be stronger than the second one. (German) growth in third quarter will be at a level of 0.75 percent. This is realistic." "There will be a high volatility of quarterly data." "Because of the finance crisis, the German growth potential seems to have decreased to around one percent compared to around 1.5 pct before." "We will return around 2013 to the economic level we had 2008." FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER CHRISTINE LAGARDE ON EXIT STRATEGY: "I have my eyes riveted on the unemployment rate ... that is going to be my (indicator) to decide when to tiptoe gradually out of the thing. We are better pulling out a little bit later than a little bit early. If we do it too early the whole package we have put in place in the last 12 months will be a complete waste."
