 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - The Group of Seven rich nations on Saturday said too much volatility in foreign exchange markets could hurt the global economy and the financial system, and again welcomed China's pledge to move toward greater currency flexibility. 

 The language on currencies in a final communique issued by the G7 finance ministers and central bankers after a meeting in Istanbul was nearly identical to a statement released after their last meeting in April. "Excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates have adverse implications for economic and financial stability. We continue to monitor exchange markets closely, and cooperate as appropriate," the communique said. (Reporting by  Sumeet Desai )
