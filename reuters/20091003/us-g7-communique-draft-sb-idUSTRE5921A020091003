 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - The global economy is recovering but "fragile", and officials must be careful not to withdraw stimulus too soon, the Group of Seven rich nations said on Saturday, according to a draft communique. 

 "We are monitoring economic developments to ensure that the unwinding of supportive measures does not occur prematurely, before the global recovery has clearly taken hold," the draft statement prepared by G7 deputies and obtained by Reuters said. G7 finance ministers and central bankers were expected to publicly release a final statement later on Saturday after a meeting in Istanbul. "In recent months we have started to see encouraging signs of a global economic recovery and continued improvement in financial market conditions. However, there is no room for complacency," the draft said. "The situation remains fragile, particularly as regards labor market conditions." The draft statement left room for officials to insert language regarding currencies. A G7 source said the language on foreign exchange was expected to mirror the group's last statement released in April. "We are preparing cooperative and coordinated exit strategies now and will communicate them clearly, in order to anchor expectations and reinforce confidence," the draft communique said. The statement also expressed support for measures to shore up the global financial system announced by the Group of 20 developed and emerging nations in Pittsburgh last week. "We strongly support the international commitment to increase the quality and quantity of capital by end-2012 and fully endorse the reform of compensation practices," the draft statement said, referring to the banking sector.
