 LONDON  (Reuters) - British finance minister Alistair Darling played down suggestions on Saturday that a new G4 body might be set up. 

 A G7 source told Reuters earlier that the United States was pushing for the creation of a new group comprising itself, Japan, China and Europe to supplant the Group of Seven rich economies as an economic policymaking group. Asked about this, Darling said: "These proposals have been around for a long time ... You shouldn't read too much into these proposals." He said the G20 was now going to be the premier global economic policymaking group and Britain was also a member of the European Union. But he added: "It is not our position that the G7 is going to be wound up." (Reporting by  Sumeet Desai ; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
