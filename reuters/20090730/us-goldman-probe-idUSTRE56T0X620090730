The people told the paper Washington Mutual Inc, which is now mostly owned by JP Morgan Chase & Co, was also issued a subpoena by the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations The paper said several other financial institutions may also have received subpoenas from the sub-committee that is headed by Senator Carl Levin. A Goldman Sachs spokesman declined to comment on the subpoena to the paper, while Deutsche Bank did not immediately respond to a request for comment by the paper.
