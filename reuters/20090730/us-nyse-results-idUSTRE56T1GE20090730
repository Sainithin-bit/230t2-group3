 LONDON  (Reuters) - Transatlantic exchange group NYSE Euronext NYX.N NYX.PA on Thursday said it planned to cut 290 jobs in Europe and the U.S. as second-quarter earnings before one-off items dropped 34 percent to $132 million. 

 The New York Stock Exchange and Euronext markets owner said a contract termination charge for NYSE Liffe Clearing and provisions for the expected cost of cutting 230 jobs in Europe and 60 in the U.S. pulled it to a net loss of $182 million. Revenue was up 9.5 percent at $1.13 billion. Shares of NYSE Euronext edged up 0.81 percent at 0745 GMT to 19.72 euros each. The exchange said its ongoing cost saving initiatives continued in the second quarter, with fixed costs down 6 percent from a year ago to $398 million. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and investment in new business, the underlying fixed expenses were down $50 million or 12 percent from the same quarter a year earlier. NYSE Euronext's headcount was 3,500 as of June 30, down 9 percent from a year ago. (Reporting by  Daisy Ku , editing by Will Waterman)
