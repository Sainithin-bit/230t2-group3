 TOPEKA, Kansas  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury remains opposed to banning trade in any specific derivatives but is looking for "robust and thorough" regulation of derivatives dealers and markets, U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Neal Wolin said on Thursday. 

 Citing a need to continue to provide companies with adequate risk management opportunities, Wolin said regulatory overhaul of the complex marketplace for securities and futures should be strict but not constraining. In an interview with Reuters, he said the Treasury does not want to see a prohibition of "naked" credit default swaps, as some U.S. lawmakers have proposed. "We're not for banning any particular category of derivatives, but rather we're for a robust, thorough framework of regulation ... with appropriate capital standards, appropriate anti-fraud and anti-manipulation rules," Wolin said. Credit default swaps are used to bet on whether a company will default on its bonds within a certain fixed period of time. Naked credit default swaps are those in which an investor doesn't own the underlying debt on which the contracts are based. Wolin said it was important to preserve the risk management benefits of derivatives. "The extent to which they are used to manipulate or otherwise do nefarious things ought to be constrained," Wolin said. "Regulating both the dealers of these products and the markets themselves is the right way to make sure and get the upside of risk management while closing off opportunities for them to be misused." Derivatives are financial instruments that derive value from an underlying asset like a Treasury bond, a commodity like oil or copper, or a mortgage-backed security. Wolin reiterated that Treasury officials want to see new capital standards as part of tighter regulation of credit default swaps, but said specific details were up to regulators, including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. "We're engaged in a study now to come up with some recommendations but in the end it will be for regulators to make specific judgments about appropriate levels of capital," Wolin said. The heads of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services and Agriculture committees on Thursday said legislation they are drafting would give regulators power to limit dealer and investor holdings of over-the-counter derivatives and to impose other anti-speculative restrictions. These could include requiring the reporting of short-sale interest in CDS contracts and possible prohibitions on CDS purchases by investors who are not hedging risks, said Rep. Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the Financial Services Committee. Frank has said he sees value in a ban on naked credit default, and lawmakers will consider such a move as the bill progresses. RISKY MANAGEMENT TOOL? Heavy reliance on credit default swaps and a lack of oversight has been blamed in part for the problems that pushed insurer American International Group near bankruptcy and roiled many U.S. financial institutions. But industry defenders have said derivatives are central to maintaining a flow of capital for U.S. corporations, concerns that Wolin said were valid. "We want to make sure we don't eliminate important tools of risk management," he said. Wolin, the Treasury's number two official, was in Topeka to announce the award of $90 million in new economic stimulus funds for affordable housing projects, bringing the Treasury's total announced awards of these funds to $1.3 billion. The money is part of a $3 billion slice of the Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus program earmarked for affordable housing projects. Wolin attended the opening of a housing project for the elderly in Osawatomie, Kansas, which was the first to be completed under the program, with a $2.3 million grant. The awards announced on Monday will provide funding for projects of $53 million in Illinois, $18 million in Colorado, $10 million in Maine, $4 million in Nebraska and $4 million in Delaware.
