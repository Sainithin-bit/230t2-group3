 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc, the world's second-largest credit card network, said on Thursday that a recent decline in cross-border transactions moderated in July, in a possible sign of stabilization in the payments market after the economic downturn. 

 Chief Financial Officer Martina Hund-Mejean also said in an interview that the number of global transactions in July had expanded at a similar pace to the second quarter, but cautioned that it was still too early to call the tentative signs of recovery a trend. "There are some potential signs of stabilization," Hund-Mejean told Reuters. "I just think it is too early to call it a trend." Transactions grew 7.9 percent in the second quarter, while cross-border volumes declined 2.1 percent. The company reported better-then-expected quarterly earnings on Thursday as it raised fees charged to banks and cut expenses, sending its shares to a 10-month high.
