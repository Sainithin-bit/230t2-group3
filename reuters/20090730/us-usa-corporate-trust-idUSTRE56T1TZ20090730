 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Trust in business has rebounded from 10-year lows in the United States, but the majority of Americans still do not count on corporate America to do what is right, according to a survey released on Thursday. 

 The Edelman Trust Barometer found that 48 percent of U.S. respondents trust businesses to do the right thing, up from 36 percent who said that in January, but still below 59 percent at the beginning of 2008. The survey also found upticks in business's reputation in France, India and Germany, with declines in the United Kingdom and China. "Trust in business is on the way back, but we're still in the middle of the game," said Richard Edelman, president and chief executive of Edelman, a public relations company. The survey, conducted from May 26 through July 3, was based on telephone surveys of 1,675 adults aged 25 to 64 in six countries. Respondents were screened to be college educated, have a household income in the top quartile for their country and to follow the news. (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; editing by  Andre Grenon )
