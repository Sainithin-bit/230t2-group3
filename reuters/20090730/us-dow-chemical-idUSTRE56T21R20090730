 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) posted a second-quarter loss on Thursday, as sales slumped and the company took large charges to revamp its operations. 

 The company reported a net loss of $435 million, or 47 cents per share, compared with a profit of $24 million, or 3 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Excluding one-time items and discontinued operations, the company reported a profit of 5 cents per share. Sales fell 31 percent to $11.3 billion. Separately, Dow said Thursday it will sell some operations in Malaysia to Petronas for $660 million. (Reporting by  Ernest Scheyder ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
