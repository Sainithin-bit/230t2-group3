 (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said it will use a combination of funds from operations and debt to pay the $6.64 billion fee to the Federal Communication Commission, after winning 227 regional wireless spectrum licenses. 

 In a filing with U.S. regulators, the No. 1 U.S. mobile phone company said it will have to make the initial down payment of $1.33 billion to the FCC, of which it has already paid $500 million, by 10 business days from March 20. The remaining $5.31 billion will be paid on or before 20 business days from March 20, the company said. AT&T and the No. 2 wireless provider Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ) dominated the FCC's auction that started January 24 and ended Tuesday after 260 rounds of bidding.
