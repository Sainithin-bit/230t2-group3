 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Netflix Inc ( NFLX.O ) shares jumped 11 percent on Thursday after several analysts raised price targets on the stock and cheered the company's attempt to build a dominant service around streaming movies and TV shows. 

 The shares rose as high as $174.94, surpassing their previous 52-week peak, before later slipping back to $170.84 in midday trading, which was still up $17.69 for the session. The stock has more than tripled in price this year. One of today's hottest companies in media, Netflix's third-quarter earnings report on Wednesday confirmed its popularity with consumers who use its service to rent TV shows and movies. It recorded better-than-expected subscriber growth for the quarter, which in turn helped fuel a 31 percent increase in revenue. Netflix, once known for its by-mail DVD rental service, now has nearly 17 million subscribers, meaning only Comcast Corp ( CMCSA.O ) and DirecTV ( DTV.O ) can count more video subscription customers. "Netflix is emerging as a key winner in the digital entertainment category, given a great value proposition and astute positioning," Jefferies and Co analyst Youssef Squali wrote in a research note. "The company's early push into streaming is paying off." While it started in 1999 in the United States as a mail-in DVD service, Netflix now says a vast majority of its U.S. subscribers stream content on a variety of devices. It already runs a Canadian streaming-only service and said it could soon launch a similar one in the United States. It is a transition that Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings has driven, making Netflix a key player in digital media. "Three years ago, we were a DVD-by-mail company that offered some streaming," Hastings said during a conference call on Wednesday. "We are now a streaming company, which also offers DVD-by-mail." Other analysts also noted on Thursday that the company, is doing well on the digital transition and consumers seem to be satisfied with its streaming service, which is reflected in a lower churn rate and customer acquisition costs (SAC) during the quarter. Oppenheimer upgraded the stock to "outperform" and said Netflix is effectively attracting mainstream consumers with Internet-connected devices and should see growth as it expands into international markets in 2011. Analysts noted that Netflix seems to have a good start with its Canadian operations. "We believe Canada is an important testing ground for Netflix as net neutrality does not exist. A successful ramp in Canada could set the stage for more international growth," Janney Capital said and upgraded the stock to "neutral." In the United States, the debate over net neutrality -- whether high-speed Internet providers should be allowed to give preferential treatment to content providers who pay for faster transmission -- is a political issue. Janney said comments by the Federal Communications Commission, the U.S. communications regulator, suggest usage based billing could be on the horizon and if that occurs, Netflix could lose its significant price advantage over cable. Among the price target upgrades, JP Morgan raised its target to $186 from $181. Jefferies raised its target to $195 from $175 and Barclays went to $140 from $128.
