 GYEONGJU, South Korea (Reuters) Financial leaders from the Group of 20 major economies meet in South Korea from Friday to try to take tackle global economic imbalances and currency tensions that are feeding worries of trade protectionism as the world economy struggles for a smooth recovery from the financial crisis: 

 Investors are turning away from low-growth rich nations to fast-growing emerging ones, prompting steps by some countries to control the wave of capital threatening to destabilize their economies. The following is a collection of official comments highlighting the concerns and strains: -------------------------------------------------------------- TIMOTHY GEITHNER, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: -- Interview with Wall Street Journal, Oct 21: "Right now, there is no established sense of what's fair. "We would like countries to move toward a set of norms on exchange rate policy." Geithner repeated his view that China's yuan was significantly undervalued, but said: "If China knew that if it moved more rapidly, other emerging markets would move with them, it would be easier for them to move." He also told the newspaper that the major currencies, the dollar, the euro and the yen were "roughly in alignment." Turning to efforts to bring the global economy more in balance, Geithner said: "We're encouraging our partners to put a little more flesh on the skeleton of the rebalancing commitment. "We are exploring whether we can agree to commit to keep the external imbalances to levels that are more sustainable, making allowances for different kinds of countries, such as commodity producers." DMITRY PANKIN, RUSSIAN DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER -- Comments to reporters, Oct 21: "There are such initiatives (on current account limits) but for now it is hard to say if this will be realized. The United States will try to put the question of exchange rates and current account balances at the top of the agenda, to try to press China to make some commitments on this issue. In my view it is unlikely that they will succeed. Most likely, there will be some general words, along the lines of 'let's all live in peace'. "Our (surplus) is reducing. so we are in a fairly comfortable situation - no one has any complaints over our macroeconomic policy." "Our position is that it is not so much a question of exchange rates or balance of payments, but of a basic economic policy -- tendency to save, tendency to spend... Americans, by trying to press emerging markets in this way ... are trying to pass on their problems." CHRISTINE LAGARDE, FRENCH ECONOMY MINISTER -- Press briefing, Oct 21: "The Asia area plays and will play an increasingly important role in the desirable currency balance," she said. "I say desirable ... because we can see there are imbalances, that coordination is at times lacking on policy." RAINER BRUEDERLE, GERMAN ECONOMY MINISTER -- Reuters interview, Oct 21: "Exchange rates must reflect economic fundamentals. That goes for all currencies, including the U.S. dollar and the yuan." YIM JONG-YONG, SOUTH KOREAN VICE-FINANCE MINISTER -- Press briefing, Oct 21: "I expect (G20 members) to reach an agreement. China has already been making moves aimed at showing it is cooperating. They raised interest rates. Both parties (in currency tensions) will get damaged because (the tension) will eventually lead to protectionism." YOSHIHIKO NODA, JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER -- Speech in parliament, Oct 21: "In trade many Asian countries are Japan's rivals, and compared to South Korea Japan is trailing in Free Trade Agreements and Economic Partnership Agreements. So the currency issue would be an additional disadvantage for Japan. I will attend the G20 meeting with this view in mind. "The Toronto G20 summit called for currency flexibility in emerging economies. I would like to attend the G20 with this in mind. "Japan's economy is in a difficult situation as deflation has deepened ... We cannot overlook excessive currency moves ... We will take decisive steps, including intervention, when needed. -- News conference, Oct 19 (referring to his Oct 14 comments on South Korea and China): "There seems to be some misunderstanding." -- To parliamentary panel, Oct 14: "As chair of the G20, South Korea's role will be seriously questioned. "In South Korea, intervention happens regularly, and in China, the pace of yuan reform has been slow." MERVYN KING, GOVERNOR BANK OF ENGLAND: -- Speech, Oct 19: "The need to act in the collective interest has yet to be recognized, and, unless it is, it will be only a matter of time before one or more countries resort to trade protectionism as the only domestic instrument to support a necessary rebalancing." "That could, as it did in the 1930s, lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world. Every country would suffer ruinous consequences -- including our own." WORLD BANK: -- East Asia and Pacific Economic Update report, October 19: "Larger inflows combined with ample domestic liquidity and rising confidence have boosted stock markets, real estate prices and other asset valuations in some countries, precipitating fears of a new bubble." "The authorities in East Asia need to take adequate precautions to ensure that they do not repeat the same mistake twice in slightly over a decade." TIMOTHY GEITHNER, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: -- Comments to business leaders, October 18: "It is very important for people to understand that the United States of America and no country around the world can devalue its way to prosperity, to (be) competitive." "It is not a viable, feasible strategy and we will not engage in it." GUIDO MANTEGA, BRAZIL FINANCE MINISTER -- On G20 meetings, October 18: "This has to end in an agreement. While there isn't this co-ordination, we will not sit around watching our currency strengthen." -- Speech, Sept 27: "We're in the midst of an international currency war. This threatens us because it takes away our competitiveness." CHINESE MINISTRY OF COMMERCE SPOKESMAN YAO JIAN: -- Press briefing, Oct 15: "It is entirely wrong for the U.S. to make an issue of China's trade surplus and hence put pressure on the yuan exchange rate. "Other countries have no right to comment on what is a reasonable level for a country's trade surplus. IMF MANAGING DIRECTOR DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN: -- Financial Times interview, Oct 5: "There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate that currencies can be used as a policy weapon." "Translated into action, such an idea would represent a very serious risk to the global recovery... Any such approach would have a negative and very damaging longer-run impact." -------------------------------------------------------------- Compiled by G20 Newsroom, Gyeongju, South Korea --------------------------------------------------------------
