 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj's new chief Stephen Elop put his imprint on the company on Thursday, cutting 1,800 jobs and delaying a key product after the world's largest handset maker reported stronger-than-expected profits. 

 Third-quarter underlying earnings per share (EPS) dropped to 0.14 euros from 0.17 euros a year ago, but solid demand for its cheap smartphones helped it beat all forecasts -- which ranged from 0.08 to 0.12 euros -- in a Reuters poll of 36 analysts. Canadian Elop, a former Microsoft executive, took the helm on September 21 from Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, who presided over a halving in Nokia's market value during his four years in charge as smartphone rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc surged ahead. The strong numbers on Thursday sent Nokia shares up more than 9 percent to their highest level in 20 weeks. They closed in Helsinki up 6.3 percent and were 5.9 percent higher in New York at 1531 GMT. "I think it's an excellent report given that the company's portfolio of products was very weak in the quarter," Morgan Stanley analyst James Dawson said. Several analysts said they expected the average forecast for Nokia's 2011 earning per share to rise 5 to 10 percent. Before the results were unveiled the consensus for underlying 2011 EPS was 0.67 euros. Nokia stopped the profit slide this year through vigorous cost cuts. Now it plans to cut close to 3 percent of the staff at its main business in a move that would hit most product creation at Symbian Smartphones and its Services organization. PRICES RISE ON LOW-END PROBLEMS The average sale price in its key phone unit rose to 65 euros -- the first annual price rise in almost a decade -- as new, cheap smartphones like the C5 and the E5 went on sale and parts shortages capped sales of the cheapest cellphones. "The main contribution here is really from component shortages and that hit us more in the lower end were Nokia is strong," Chief Financial Officer Timo Ihamuotila told a conference call with analysts. Nokia sold 110.4 million phones in the quarter, with its market share dropping to just 30 percent, missing all analysts expectations. "We lost market share in Q3 as we were not able to keep up with demand in the low end," CEO Elop told the call. Nokia said it expects part shortages to continue weighing on the cellphone business into 2011, while it forecast its phone unit's underlying operating profit margin to be 10-12 percent in the December quarter. Analysts had expected a margin of 11.4 percent in the poll. SMARTPHONE WOES Nokia shares have still dropped around 7.5 percent so far this year -- mostly due to problems on the fatter-margin high-end market -- compared with a 10 percent gain in the STOXX Europe 600 technology index. Nokia is benefiting from a boom of cheap smartphones -- with Strategy Analytics saying on Thursday the overall smartphone market jumped 78 percent year-on-year in the quarter -- but it has lacked a high-end hit model since the N95, launched in 1996. "It's about selling family cars rather than sports cars -- that's where Nokia is making the money," said Gartner analyst Carolina Milanesi. Nokia's N8 model, its first serious rival to Apple's iPhone, started shipping on the last day of September and sales are yet to start on many markets. "Their newer devices have got strong technological reviews, but, many times, that is not enough," said Todd Koffman, analyst at Raymond James. On Thursday, Elop said he has decided to delay launching Nokia's first product using the new MeeGo software platform, which is seen as the Finnish group's key asset in the battle for a larger share of the high-end market. "My assessment was that it would be a 2011 event," he said. Elop had risen rapidly over the past five years from CEO of Web software maker Macromedia to chief operating officer of Juniper Networks to head of Microsoft's Business Division, which makes Office software.
