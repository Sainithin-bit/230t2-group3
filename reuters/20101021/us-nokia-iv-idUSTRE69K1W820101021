 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia, the world's largest cellphone maker, reported third-quarter results above expectations on Thursday. 

 The company's underlying earnings per share came in at 0.14 euro against an average forecast of 0.10. Sales totaled 10.3 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in the quarter versus expectations for 10.0 billion. ***************************************************************** KEY POINTS: - Shares in Nokia were up 8.6 percent after the results - The average sales price (ASP) for cellphones was 65 euros, above the 60 euro forecast in a Reuters poll - The company, which sold a lower-than-expected 110.4 million cellphones, said it expects a lower cellphone market share in 2010 COMMENTARY: NEIL MAWSTON, STRATEGY ANALYTICS "Nokia's Q3 performance was mixed. Total handset shipments were much lower than expected and its volume share fell. But the handset division's average selling price rose on an annual basis for the first time in almost a decade. Falling low-end end handset shipments were offset partly by higher smartphone volumes. Weak handset sales in Asia and Africa were partly offset by higher volumes in Latin America. Tight component supply restricted Nokia's volumes and we're a little concerned that a company of Nokia's power has not been able to secure all the necessary parts for its phones. With challenges in emerging markets and high-end smartphones, as well as component supply issues, Mr Elop clearly has a huge to-do list in his first quarter as CEO." MARTIN GARNER, CCS INSIGHT "Nokia's outlook lowers guidance again, although it is expecting the market to grow more strongly than before. This is reflecting lateness with the recent launches, missing some key distribution slots and lowering prices. Nokia has also announced changes to the way it runs its Ovi services and the development of Symbian phones. These are very necessary and will deliver tangible benefits from H1 2011." JAMES DAWSON, MORGAN STANLEY "I think it's an excellent report given that the company's portfolio of products was very weak in the quarter. The handset profits are 30 percent ahead of expectations, so it's clearly a very big beat versus what the market was looking for." "I think the guidance for the fourth quarter is also ahead of what the street is looking for, but it's still sensible." "I think people will think that earnings have troughed for the company, and with new management and new phones things will be better. So we would expect the stock to be up more than 10 percent today." TIM SHEPHERD, CANALYS "Nokia's financials show record volumes and strong growth in smart phones, up 61 percent year on year to 26.5 million units. This offsets a decline in mobile phone shipments - excluding smart phones - of 9 percent year on year to 83.9 million units. This represents a strong performance for Nokia in the smart phone space, achieved despite delays to shipments of the N8 and the lack of a truly high-end product to compete at the high end of the market against the iPhone and leading Android devices." MARTIN NILSSON, HANDELSBANKEN: "A much better result than expected in Q3 for Devices and Services, and a much better margin than expected. The guidance for Q4 is more or less in line with expectations. It is positive that they focus on costs. They are reducing the number of employees." MICHAEL SCHRODER, FIM "It seem like Q3 was ahead of forecasts, and especially Nokia smartphone sales were somewhat bigger than expected. Also, Q4 guidance is a bit ahead of the analysts' forecasts, and I think that the positive share price reaction is warranted in that sense." INGE HEYDORN, FUND MANAGER, SENTAT ASSET MANAGEMENT: "They give firmer guidance for topline for handsets. I think that's behind the share reaction. I do not think that reaction is justified, but over the past three to four quarters there have been share reactions of close to 10 percent, which is ridiculous. "There are no big deviations in the report, that's why I think the reaction is odd. I don't think there are any strange items in the report." NICOLAS VON STACKELBERG, MACQUARIE RESEARCH "What's noticeable is that the ASP has held up better than expected, so that's clearly a positive. And that also explains why, despite the fact that they now lower the outlook for their volume market share, they guide for a higher sales number than what's in consensus for the Device & Services business." "Also the non-ifrs operating profit is clearly ahead of consensus, and that's why the share is up." "There has been so much negativity toward the share so I think you could expect that the share price will continue to rise. There has been so much negative newsflow around Apple and Android, so I think people have been positioned for a very negative event here."
