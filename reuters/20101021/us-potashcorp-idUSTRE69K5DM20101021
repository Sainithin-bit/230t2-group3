 REGINA, Saskatchewan  (Reuters) - The Canadian province that's home to Potash Corp ( POT.TO ) on Thursday declared its opposition to BHP's $39 billion bid to buy the fertilizer supplier, setting the stage for a politically charged final decision by the federal government. 

 Saskatchewan will urge Ottawa to block BHP Billiton's ( BHP.AX ) attempt to take over Potash, one of Canada's largest resource companies, because a successful bid by the Anglo-Australian miner would potentially hurt the province in terms of jobs and revenues.. "In the interests of jobs for Saskatchewan families, in the interest of the quality of life that we prize that is funded by revenues to the government ... we must say no to this hostile takeover," Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said in a speech in the provincial capital of Regina. Under the Investment Canada Act, the federal government can only allow a takeover by a foreign company to proceed if it deems that a deal would bring a "net benefit" to Canada. "It's our government's belief that the people of Saskatchewan deserve nothing less than a potash industry unequivocally managed, operated and marketed for the benefit of Canada and Saskatchewan," said Wall, considered a political ally of the ruling federal Conservatives. Saskatchewan estimates it will lose about C$3 billion ($2.9 billion) in revenues over the next 10 years if the deal goes through because of the royalty payments are structured. If Ottawa allows a takeover to proceed, Wall said, Saskatchewan would make tax changes applicable to BHP that could generate an extra C$3 billion for the province, compensating it for revenue it might otherwise lose. "This is just another roadblock," said Soleil Securities analyst Mark Gulley. "To me BHP is prepared to invest only so much in this property." The focus of the two-month-old takeover battle now shifts to Ottawa, where the federal government will have to decide whether to stand by its supporters in the prairie province and accept the recommendation to block the bid. But Prime Minister Stephen Harper will come under pressure to stay true to the pro-business philosophy his minority government has championed and allow the bid to proceed. "I have a feeling he's going to say to Brad Wall 'no'," said David McGrane, professor of political science at the University of Saskatchewan. If Canada rejects BHP, "a lot of people in Ottawa are going to say to him, 'you're sending the wrong signal to investors around the world'." Industry Minister Tony Clement said soon after Wall's speech that the Canadian government would take all points of view into consideration. "I'm neither a headwaiter to the premier of Saskatchewan, nor am I a butler to the president of BHP," said Clement, whose department is conducting the official review. The deadline for a ruling is November 3. GOVERNMENT CRITICISM Since BHP revealed its offer two months ago, Ottawa has said it would pay close attention to Saskatchewan's views in light of a takeover's impact on provincial revenues. That said, Harper downplayed Potash Corp's Canadian roots on Wednesday, calling it an American-controlled company. His remark suggested to some that the prime minister may not be particularly concerned by BHP's Anglo-Australian entity. In a passionate speech that underscored the growing importance of agricultural-related commodities, Wall said Saskatchewan should treat potash like a strategic resource. He also criticized the Canadian government's record in forcing foreign companies to keep promises made after takeovers of national resource companies. The bulk of Canada's reserves of potash, a key crop nutrient, is located within the prairie province. Potash Corp was once a crown corporation, as companies owned by the state are known in Canada. Before Wall's speech, BHP Chief Executive Marius Kloppers said on Thursday he was confident all parties would overcome Saskatchewan's revenue concerns. But Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of BHP's non-Ferrous division, said he was puzzled by Wall's opposition. "We've lined up a number of net benefits on jobs and on revenues and on bringing back jobs to Saskatchewan," he said. In rejecting BHP's $130-a-share bid, Potash Corp has repeatedly said it expects competing offers to emerge, though none have materialized. The takeover offer is the largest in any industry this year. Potash Corp shares rose about 0.5 percent to $143.09 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, but the stock is still well about BHP's offer price, suggesting investors believe the miner may have to sweeten its offer to carry the day.
