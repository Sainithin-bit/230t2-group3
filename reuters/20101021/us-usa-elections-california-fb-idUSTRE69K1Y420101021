 (Reuters) - California elects a new governor on November 2 and state finances are a major issue cited by voters in almost every poll, especially with a new budget hole expected to open shortly after the election. 

 Front-runner and Democratic nominee Jerry Brown has been criticized for a budget plan that is heavy on process -- how to agree on the next budget -- and light on details. Here are chief elements of the plan from his Web site. * Brown aims to manage the budget process by starting budget talks months earlier than is usual. Brown says he would meet all legislators rather than just leaders. * Each budget would be crafted "from scratch" rather than using a previous year's plan. * The Democrat is calling for spending cuts, including for prison health costs. * Brown says he would cut wasteful spending, change the state's pension system to reduce its costs and fight court-imposed spending orders. * The state government would bolster efforts to collect unpaid taxes. * It could increase revenue by leasing its rights-of-way and rooftops and parking lots of its facilities to renewable energy developers. * Brown aims to get more funds from the federal government, a frequent goal of California leaders, create a tax commission to change the state's personal income-heavy tax structure, eliminate duplicative functions and upgrade the state's technology. * Brown would return more authority to local governments.
