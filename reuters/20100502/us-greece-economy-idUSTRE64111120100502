 (Reuters) - Here is a timeline of economic events in Greece in 2010. 

 January 2010 - Greece unveils a stability program on January 14 saying it will aim to cut its budget gap to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009. Unions protesting against the austerity plan announce strikes for February. February 2010 - Prime Minister George Papandreou says on February 2 the government will extend a public sector wage freeze to those making below 2,000 euros a month for 2010, excluding seniority pay hikes. -- February 3 - The EU Commission says it backs Greece's plan to reduce its budget deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2012 and urges Greece to cut its overall wage bill. -- Greece must refinance 54 billion euros in debt in 2010, with a crunch in second quarter as more than 20 billion euros becomes due. A 5-year bond issue in January is five times oversubscribed but the government has to pay a hefty premium. -- A one-day general strike on February 24 against the austerity measures cripples Greece's transport and public services. -- An EU mission to Athens with IMF experts delivers a grim assessment of the nation's economy on February 25. March 2010 - EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn asks Greece to announce further measures to tackle its budget crisis. -- March 5 - New package of public sector pay cuts and tax increases is passed by the government to save an extra 4.8 billion euros.

Under the accord, Athens will receive coordinated bilateral loans from other countries that use the euro and money from the IMF, but only if all states agree to the bailout and if it has exhausted its borrowing options. April 2010 - On April 11 Euro zone finance ministers approve a giant 30-billion-euro ($40 billion) emergency aid mechanism for Greece but stress that Athens has not yet asked for the plan to be activated. -- April 13 - ECB policymakers give the thumbs-up to the euro zone's rescue package as Greece passed a key test of its ability to raise fresh funds. -- April 15 - Parliament adopts a tax reform bill, backing government moves to tackle tax evasion and shift the fiscal burden to higher-income earners as Athens. -- April 21 - Greece starts talks to hammer out details of a potential aid deal but investors dump Greek assets on a lack of clarity over whether the funds would come in time. Germany's opposition Social Democrats say they oppose "fast-track" approval for the deal in parliament.
