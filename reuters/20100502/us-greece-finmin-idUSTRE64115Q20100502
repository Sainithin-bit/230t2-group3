 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece committed to deeper budget cuts in an austerity package unveiled Sunday, but pushed back by two years a goal to bring its deficit below EU limits, a move economists said made the plan more realistic and achievable. 

 The deal with the European Union and International Monetary Fund (IMF) involves a frontloaded multi-year fiscal adjustment that aims to push the budget deficit down a full 5.5 percentage points in 2010 to 8.1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP). This reduction will be driven by cuts in the public sector wage bill, lower pension outlays and an additional two percentage point rise in value-added tax (VAT) to 23 percent. But the deficit is forecast to fall much more slowly in subsequent years, dipping below the EU's 3 percent of GDP threshold in 2014 instead of in 2012 as previously envisioned. "I'm very pleased to see the deficit reduction assumptions pushed back," said Erik Nielsen, chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. He called the program "tough and impressive" but said the government could face problems implementing it, given the threat of protests from both public and private sector workers. Nielsen also said it was unclear whether the program would generate enough of a reduction in private sector wages. The government resisted demands for cuts in private sector salaries, which are more difficult for it to control. Instead, it agreed to loosen firing rules which prevent companies from dismissing more than 2 percent of their workforce in a single month and change rules on severance payments. ECONOMIC FORECAST SLASHED Under the new plan, Greece sharply revised down its expectations for the economy. GDP is now expected to contract by 4.0 percent in 2010, compared with a prior government forecast of a 2.25 percent drop, and return to growth in 2012 rather than 2011, as previously anticipated. Government debt projections were also dramatically altered. Previous forecasts had called for debt to peak at 120.6 percent of GDP in 2011. Under the new plans, it will continue rising for four years, peaking at nearly 150 percent in 2013. On top of the VAT hike, wage and pension cuts, Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou told a news conference that levies on fuel, alcohol and tobacco would be increased by a further 10 percent. Costas Panagopoulos, head of the Alco polling group, said the government's decision not to order changes to private sector salaries could help it to sell the measures to the public. "The hundreds of thousands working in the private sector should feel somehow relieved," he said. "In the short term, this means that the program will be accepted ... that the government will keep its core supporters." However, the country's main unions showed no signs of backing down, urging people to join in nationwide strikes planned for Wednesday. "These measures are tough and unfair," said Stathis Anestis, a spokesman for private sector union GSEE. "They lead workers to misery and the country deeper into recession." Public sector union ADEDY, which represents about 500,000 workers, also vowed to fight the measures. "We will continue and we will intensify our protests," said Ilias Ilipopoulos, the union's general secretary. But Papaconstantinou said the country had no other choice, saying Greeks must decide between "collapse or salvation." Prime Minister George Papandreou also made clear that the population must be prepared to make major sacrifices. "I want to tell Greeks very honestly that we have a big trial ahead of us," he said.
