 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank's Governing Council welcomed on Sunday the austerity programme agreed by the Greek government but said Greece may have to take additional steps. 

 In a statement, the ECB said the measures should help restore confidence and safeguard financial stability in the eurozone. It noted that it was essential that Greek authorities stand ready to take further steps if needed. "The Governing Council of the ECB welcomes the economic and financial adjustment programme which was approved today by the Greek government following the successful conclusion of the negotiations with the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB and the International Monetary Fund." The ECB added: "The ambitious fiscal adjustment and comprehensive structural reforms under the programme are appropriate to achieving the programme's objectives of stabilizing the fiscal and economic situation over time and addressing the fiscal and structural challenges of the Greek economy." The ECB said that the programme was "comprehensive" and supported by "strong conditionality." "It addresses the relevant policy challenges in a decisive manner. It will thereby help to restore confidence and safeguard financial stability in the euro area," it said. "The Governing Council also considers essential that the Greek public authorities stand ready to take further measures that may become appropriate to achieve the objectives of the programme."
