 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The financial rescue that Greece agreed with the International Monetary Fund and the European Union on Sunday is even tougher than earlier EU proposals, German government sources told Reuters. 

 The agreement includes quarterly benchmarking goals that the IMF has set up for Greece, the sources in Berlin said on Sunday. "Thus, it was well worth it to get the IMF involved," one government source said. "The IMF will establish quarterly goals for Greece that will be verified." Greece will face sanctions if it fails to meet the obligations, the government sources said. The IMF goals agreed are not only tougher but at the same time more realistic than an earlier EU proposal. For example, Greece has until 2014 to achieve the stability pact goals. "The original goal year of 2012 was completely unrealistic," one source said.
