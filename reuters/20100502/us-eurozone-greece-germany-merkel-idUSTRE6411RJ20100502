 BONN  (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Sunday said she was optimistic that the German parliament would pass legislation clearing the way for a multi-billion euro Greek bailout by Friday and that she would work toward that goal. 

 Speaking to reporters in Bonn, Merkel said she welcomed Greece's agreement with the European Union and IMF. She said her cabinet would review the deal on Monday in Berlin, setting in motion the legislative process that could be done by Friday. "If everything goes well, Germany could pass the measures for the Greek help by Friday," said Merkel, adding she was extraordinarily pleased that talks over the successful talks. "I'm going to work for the Greece programme and its passage." The aid package, expected to total around 120 billion euros ($160 billion) over three years, still needs backing from Greece's European peers as a May 19 deadline looms when Athens badly needs funds to make a big debt repayment to its creditors. Earlier, Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle had a more guarded reaction. He said Germany will examine closely the agreement before deciding whether to contribute. His cautious response reflected deep German resentment at having to rescue Greece, which manipulated its figures to join the euro zone in 2001 and has lived beyond its means ever since. Germany is the EU's biggest economy and chief paymaster. Any doubt about its willingness to join the rescue would cause renewed turmoil on financial markets. Speaking in Bonn, Merkel said that she had already had a telephone call with Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou. "It's a very ambitious austerity programme that has on the one hand ambitious savings targets but on the other hand is designed to help improve Greece's economic position," she said, adding it was a programme set up with a long-term view. "It will be an arduous journey for Greece," she said. "But it is absolutely necessary." Greece is tackling the problems at the roots and that is important for the euro's stability. Merkel said it was "good and important" that the EU Commission and the IMF will monitor the implementation of the programme so that "the credibility in the country can be restored." She also said it proved to be the right decision to involve the IMF; that insured "worldwide a maximum of credibility for a programme of stability and consolidation." Merkel did not want to comment on the amount of the German contribution. She said that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble would discuss the details.
