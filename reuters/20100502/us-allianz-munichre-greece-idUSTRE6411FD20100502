 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Insurers Allianz and MunichRe are willing to contribute to a Greek rescue package supporting efforts from Deutsche Bank, a German daily reported. 

 Allianz and MunichRe have promised to contribute loans of 300 million euros ($399 million) and 200 million euros respectively, the Financial Times Deutschland (FTD) said without citing sources in a preview of its Monday edition. MunichRe declined to comment, Allianz was not immediately available for comment. Deutsche Bank chief executive Josef Ackermann is helping to coordinate efforts by the private sector, a senior banking source told Reuters on Friday. FTD also reported that Deutsche Bank would offer 500 million euro as credit and that Ackermann had asked carmaker Daimler and engineering group Siemens to join the rescue efforts as well but only received promises to help from the two insurers. Daimler was not immediately available for comment. Siemens declined to comment. Negotiations on the rescue package would to continue on Sunday and would also include the option of buying Greek government bonds, the FTD reported. The consortium has pledged to contribute 1-2 billion euros ($1.33-2.66 billion) toward the effort, although no formal agreement has been struck, the source had told Reuters, declining to give details on how the plan would work. European Union and IMF aid for Greece is seen at up to 120 billion euros. Ackermann, one of Germany's top executives and chairman of the Institute of International Finance bank lobby, got involved in assembling the consortium after a conversation with German finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, the person said. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in an interview with Bild am Sonntag newspaper on Sunday that she would welcome a contribution from Germany's private sector to support a Greek rescue package. Germany is preparing to agree to contribute to a euro zone/International Monetary Fund aid package for debt-stricken Greece once IMF and European officials have agreed an austerity package for Athens.
