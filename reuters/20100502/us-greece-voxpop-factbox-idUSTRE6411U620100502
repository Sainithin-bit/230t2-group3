 (Reuters) - Greece announced on Sunday a package of austerity measures it has agreed with the European Union and the IMF as part of a multi-billion euro deal to rescue the country from its debt crisis. 

 Measures include a further reduction in public sector pay and pensions, a rise in value added tax (VAT) to 23 percent from 21 percent and a 10 percent hike in fuel and alcohol taxes. A poll showed on Friday that more than half of Greeks would take to the streets if the government agreed to new austerity measures. Here are some comments from Greek people and unions: IRAKLIS VOLTER, 50, NEWS KIOSK OWNER "Since they were not able to foresee that a tsunami was coming, and to protect us, we will stand in their way. I will take to the streets together with the rest of the people." "People don't have money and they don't buy anything. We only sell cigarettes and water. It's a domino effect." "These measures are killing people... We are on the brink of war, a war between those who are directly affected and those who are left untouched, between the poor and the rich." "If they don't catch the thieves, we will never exit the crisis. ELEFTHERIA VAGALI, PRIVATE SECTOR PENSIONER "We are all in an uproar. They should take the money from those who stole it, put them in jail." "I'm not giving my grandchildren presents anymore. My friends give me clothes." "I fear young people with no hope will take to the streets, there will be blood." ANNA KALOGEROPOULOU, 21, CHEMISTRY STUDENT "The government had no other choice but to take the measures the IMF and the EU had decided. What brought the country to this point is corruption and the Greek mentality." "Young people with degrees have no alternative but to leave the country... there are no job opportunities here." "If we don't exit the crisis with these measures, it will be the end for Greece." DIMITRA ALEXIOU, 27, SALESWOMAN "I don't agree with the measures. They won't get us out of this crisis. I've already cut my expenses, I don't go out and I shop less because I'm afraid they will cut my salary." "I want to get out of here, live abroad." EVRIVIADIS TOUNTAS, 35, PRIVATE SECTOR EMPLOYEE "I don't agree with the measures. Only ordinary people pay, not the ones who are responsible. The government will not succeed in getting the country out of the crisis with these measures only. More measures are needed." "There will certainly be a social reaction. People will become poorer and will protest." ILIAS ILIOPOULOS, PUBLIC SECTOR UNION (ADEDY), GENERAL SECRETARY "The real culprits are out of jail. Society is turning into a volcano ready to erupt. If we work together we can stop this decline, stop these measures from being applied." "We will continue and we will intensify our protests." "The government today announced the destruction of workers, pensioners and even the unemployed. It erased all hope for job opportunities and the future of young people." STATHIS ANESTIS, PRIVATE SECTOR UNION (GSEE), SPOKESMAN "These measures are tough and unfair. They will lead workers into misery and the country into a deeper recession. Greek workers have become guinea pigs but Europe will be affected as a whole." "We urge people to participate in Wednesday's nationwide strike. We call on them to intensify protests."
