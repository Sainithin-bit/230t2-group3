 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Talbots Inc TLB.N missed quarterly sales estimates and issued a weaker-than-expected profit forecast in the current quarter, sending shares of the women's clothing retailer down 3.3 percent. 

 Talbots saw competitors become more promotional during the quarter while the company tried to hold to its own calendar for promotional events, Chief Executive Trudy Sullivan said. The disappointing sales came even as higher margins helped the company beat Wall Street's earnings expectations and highlight the fine line retailers must tread between making sure they have goods on hand when consumers want to buy but do not have so much that they have to resort to deep discounts. Its sales fell 1.3 percent to $300.7 million in the second quarter that ended July 31 and missed the analysts' average estimate of $313.9 million. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 1.4 percent while the company reduced total inventory 10.4 percent. Talbots has been in a process of turning around its business, which has been hindered by heavy debt and declining sales. It is now trying to offer more fashionable merchandise to its target female customers in their 50s and 60s, while aiming to pull in younger shoppers. Net profit was $941,000, or 1 cent a share, in the second quarter that ended July 31, compared with a year-earlier net loss of $24.5 million, or 45 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, Talbots earned 14 cents a share, beating analysts' average forecast of 5 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. TURNAROUND ON TRACK Despite the sales miss and the lackluster third-quarter outlook, analysts advised investors to stick with the stock. "What remains clear to us is (that) the health of the business is returning," Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said in a research note, citing improving earnings, cash flow and debt levels. Total outstanding debt in the quarter was $37.4 million, a decrease of $459.7 million, or 92.5 percent, from the same period last year. For the third quarter, the company forecast adjusted earnings of 22 cents a share to 28 cents a share, while analysts were looking for a profit of 30 cents a share. Talbots sees full-year earnings before items of about 84 cents a share to 92 cents a share, up from a prior profit forecast of about 75 cents a share to 83 cents a share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 83 cents a share. "We believe that Talbots is positioned better than most retailers for sales and earnings growth in the next 12 months," Lazard Capital's Todd Slater said. "(It) is at an important inflection point in its recovery."
