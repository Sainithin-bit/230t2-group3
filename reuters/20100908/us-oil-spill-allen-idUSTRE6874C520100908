 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - BP Plc may not start the final kill of its ruptured Gulf of Mexico oil well until mid- to late September, the top U.S. official overseeing the spill response said on Wednesday. 

 Retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said BP and government scientists want to evaluate the blown-out Macondo well before drilling resumes on a relief well intended to intercept and kill it for good. "We're in a little bit of a diagnostic phase right now," Allen said at a briefing. "We have the opportunity at this point to learn more about the well." He said the final plugging of the Macondo well could start September 18 or September 28, depending on how much study occurs in the interim. A September 28 start for the week-long process would push the final kill to early October. Allen said BP secured the well and eliminated any threat that it would spew crude oil again late on Friday when a working blowout preventer replaced a failed one at the seabed. That assurance allows a more deliberate approach, he said. "There's no reason to take a risk at this point," Allen said. He said BP likely will inject heavy drilling mud into the well from the top -- a new step in the process -- before the relief well bores into it near the bottom, about 13,000 feet beneath the seabed. That additional step will satisfy a regulatory requirement to plug and abandon the well, Allen said. (Reporting by Kristen Hays; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
