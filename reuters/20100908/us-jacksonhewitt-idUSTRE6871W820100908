 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - No. 2 U.S. tax-preparer Jackson Hewitt Tax Service Inc JTX.N posted a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss, as a drop in total expenses offset the decline in revenue. 

 Net loss for the first quarter was $19.2 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with a loss $21.8 million, or 76 cents a share, a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company lost 65 cents a share, compared with analysts' estimates of a loss of 75 cents a share. Total revenue fell to $4.4 million from $5 million. Analysts were expecting the company to report revenue of $5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total expenses decreased to about $31 million from $37.6 million. Last week, larger rival H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ) also posted a narrower-than-expected quarterly loss. Parsippany, New Jersey-based Jackson Hewitt's stock, which has crashed 80 percent year-to-date, closed at 91 cents Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
