 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday the United States is recovering slowly from a "savage" recession that has caused deep job cuts and a loss of confidence. 

 Geithner, speaking to CNBC television, also said he believed that there was support in Congress for President Barack Obama's latest proposed package of tax breaks for businesses and spending on infrastructure to stimulate the economy. (Reporting by  David Lawder )
