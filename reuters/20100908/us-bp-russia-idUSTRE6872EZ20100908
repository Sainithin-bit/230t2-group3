 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Oil giant BP ( BP.L ) is open to talks about selling assets to Russian companies as part of its $30 billion fund raising programme to help pay for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the group's Russia chief said on Wednesday. 

 "If Russian companies like Lukoil ( LKOH.MM ) and TNK-BP are interested, we are happy to talk ... and could give them the opportunity to expand outside Russia," Jeremy Huck told reporters. He added that the company had no plans to sell the group's stakes in lucrative Russian joint venture TNK-BP TNBPI.RTS and state-controlled Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ).
