 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said on Monday the U.S. central bank can withdraw its massive economic stimulus measures without allowing dangerous inflation to take hold. 

 "We have tools to manage our balance sheet so that we're not going to have an inflation outcome, bad inflation outcome," Dudley told CNBC in an interview. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; editing by  David Stamp )
