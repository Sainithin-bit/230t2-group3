 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) wealth management chief, Sallie Krawcheck, forecast strong revenue growth for the unit but said it could do better on attracting new client assets. 

 Krawcheck, speaking at the bank's investor day in New York, said the unit's revenue would grow 6 percent to 7 percent but declined to give a time frame. She also expects pretax margins of 20 percent as merger expenses decrease. At the end of 2010, the unit had a pretax profit margin of 14.6 percent. Still, Krawcheck said the business was "not where (it) should be" in terms of adding new client assets. The unit is still digesting several hundred million dollars in retention payments handed out to Merrill Lynch brokers after Bank of America bought the brokerage in 2009. These payments should be completed by 2016 or 2017, she said. "We're not sitting back and saying, 'Let things roll off the balance sheet and we'll be fine,'" Krawcheck said. "We are looking to grow adviser headcount and accelerate the shift to higher margin (services)." She emphasized the success of the bank's cross-selling efforts. In 2010, the wealth management division, which is primarily comprised of the Merrill Lynch brokerage and the U.S. Trust business, received more than 5,300 referrals from other divisions at Bank of America, more than three times the 1,510 referrals it received in 2009. The wealth management unit also referred more than 8,000 clients to the commercial and banking and markets divisions, a 71 percent increase over 2009. "This is a good start (that) occurred during a period of transition and integration," said Krawcheck. "Clearly, there is a lot more we can do here." Krawcheck said turnover among the unit's top advisers is at historically low levels. Still, the unit has lost one key executive. Last Friday, Lyle LaMothe, head of Merrill's U.S. brokerage force, retired at the age of 49, a Merrill Lynch spokeswoman confirmed. No replacement has been named.
