 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Comments at the 2011 CERAWeek world energy conference about the situation in the oil-producing countries of North Africa and the Middle East and the potential impact on global oil supply, petroleum prices and the world economy. 

 CHRISTOPHE DE MARGERIE, CHAIRMAN & CEO, TOTAL "Frankly, I don't see today a major concern for the situation in the Middle East as far as the production of oil and gas." JOSE MARIA BOTELHO DE VASCONCELOS, MINISTER OF PETROLEUM, ANGOLA "The market is supplied enough." YOUCEF YOUSFI, OIL & ENERGY MINISTER, ALGERIA "There is an exchange of views between members of OPEC... We are very concerned about the situation. But, for the time being, I think there is no physical deficit in the market. I think it is more a psychological effect (on oil prices) than a physical deficit of oil in the market." FAROUK AL-ZANKI, CEO, KUWAIT PETROLEUM CORP "Any shortfall can be mitigated in the short run." JOHN HESS, CEO OF HESS CORP Hess Corp "There's plenty of capacity in the world today of oil to meet the shortfall from Libya. That will stabilize prices from getting out of hand. Give it time to work its way through the system. Current instabilities in the oil-producing regions of the world, but specifically in Libya, are something that make you realize that that 3-4 million barrels a day of spare capacity we have is very precious."
