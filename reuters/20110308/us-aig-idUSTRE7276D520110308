 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group ( AIG.N ) repaid another $6.9 billion of its bailout on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury said. 

 With that payment, the Treasury said it has now recovered 70 percent of the $411 billion distributed under the crisis-era Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. AIG paid the Treasury $6.6 billion from the proceeds of its sale of shares in insurer MetLife ( MET.N ), shares it acquired when it sold its international unit Alico to MetLife last year. AIG paid Treasury another $300 million in funds it had retained for expenses related to the Alico deal. After those payments, the Treasury still holds about $11.3 billion in preferred interests in AIG. It also owns about 92 percent of AIG's common stock. At Tuesday's closing share price, the sale of that stock would generate a profit for the taxpayer of about $14.22 billion. The Treasury said it expects taxpayers to recover "every dollar" of AIG's bailout, which at one point swelled to $182 billion. Of the TARP funds still outstanding, about 70 percent are concentrated in AIG, finance company Ally Financial and automaker General Motors. ( GM.N ) Any ultimate profit on the AIG shares would help offset any possible loss from the sale of the auto businesses. (Reporting by  Ben Berkowitz , editing by Matthew Lewis)
