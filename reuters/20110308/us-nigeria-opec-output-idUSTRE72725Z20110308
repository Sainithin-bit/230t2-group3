 ABUJA  (Reuters) - Nigeria would increase its crude production if OPEC requested higher output to cool soaring oil prices, state oil company NNPC said on Tuesday, but it is unclear how much spare capacity Africa's largest producer has. 

 Oil prices last month rose to their highest point in more than two years as a brewing civil war in Libya cut out as much as two-thirds of the North African country's oil output, or 1 million barrels per day (bpd). Nigeria's light, sweet crude oil is similar to the type of oil produced by Libya and would be a good replacement for European refiners, who are lacking adequate supplies because of the North African crisis. "We will do whatever OPEC asks its members to do. Whatever is needed under OPEC directives," NNPC spokesman Levi Ajuonoma said. He said Nigeria had the spare capacity to increase its production if needed but did not state by how much. Kuwait's oil minister said on Tuesday OPEC was in talks to boost production for the first time in more than two years after the recent surge in oil prices on supply worries stemming from unrest in the Middle East. Brent crude for April edged below $115 a barrel on Tuesday on expectations of a reduction in OPEC production. That's down about $6 from a February 24 peak of $119.79, the highest price since 2008, when it reached a record $147.50. Nigeria's oil ministry said last month its combined crude oil and condensate output was around 2.4 million bpd but it had production capacity of around 3 million bpd. Analysts said Nigeria would be able to increase output but doubted the spare capacity figures given by the government. SPARE CAPACITY "They can probably go slightly higher, maybe by around 200,000 barrels per day but even that would help to stabilize the oil market," said Bismarck Rewane, head of Lagos-based consultancy Financial Derivatives. The chances of a boost in output from Africa's largest crude producer will be hampered by a significant temporary outage due to maintenance on Royal Dutch Shell's Bonga offshore facility, which started at the beginning of this month. Bonga crude exports were due to fall to 32,000 bpd in March from 184,000 bpd in January, according to loading programmes. Militant gangs operating in the oil-rich Niger Delta wetlands region have also posed a risk to Nigeria's production in the past, with attacks which cut out more than a quarter of the OPEC-member's oil production five years ago. But the restive region is relatively calm and the security outlook is as positive as it has been for several years. President Goodluck Jonathan brokered an amnesty with militants in 2009 and there have been no major attacks on infrastructure since then, allowing oil companies to repair damaged facilities and boost output. A brief surge in violence at the end of last year was ended by a series of raids on militant camps by a joint military task force, aided by intelligence provided by ex-militants who had accepted the amnesty offer. The Niger Delta remains a potential flash point ahead of nationwide elections in April, although isolated acts of violence have so far targeted politicians and campaign rallies rather than oil infrastructure. Jonathan is the first head of state from the heartland of Africa's largest energy industry and his administration has much resting on continued peace in the region. (Editing by  Nick Tattersall )
