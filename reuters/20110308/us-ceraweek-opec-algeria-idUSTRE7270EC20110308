 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - There are no plans for an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at this time, despite continuing unrest in the Middle East, Algeria's minister of energy and mines Yousef Yousfi told Reuters Insider on Monday. 

 He added that current high oil prices are a short-term thing, in a television interview in Houston. (Reporting by Rhonda Schaffler, writing by Edward McAllister)
