 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline sales fell last week for the first time since the start of the year as motorists tightened their purses when prices spiked to nearly $3.50 a gallon, MasterCard data showed on Tuesday. 

 In an early sign that higher prices may be starting to pare demand in the world's biggest oil consumer, retail gasoline sales last week fell 1 percent from a year ago, the first seasonal decline since early January. Gasoline demand fell 1.8 percent from the previous week. "There was a national reaction to prices. Every region was a red," said Michael McNamara, Vice President of MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse, which uses its own credit card data and other estimates to assess nationwide demand. He said the year-on-year decline started nine to 10 days ago. Retail gasoline prices spiked more than 10 percent over the past two weeks, the second largest two-week rise on record. Gasoline climbed along with U.S. crude oil prices, which shot to 2-1/2 year highs as escalating violence in Libya cut that country's production by two-thirds and sanctions all but halted its exports. Surging oil prices have heightened concerns among economists that the U.S. economy could be shaken by increased fuel costs. Some oil traders are growing concerned that the sudden spike could sap demand, tempering the rally. "We saw signs of demand destruction in 2008, when gasoline was priced between $3.15 and $3.20 a gallon. This year, it's hard to know when that will happen because prices grew so quickly," said McNamara. U.S. demand for gasoline -- which accounts for about one in 10 barrels of global use -- has historically been high in March as drivers take advantage of spring weather. Still, the full effect of rising prices on demand will not be evident until the coming weeks. The four-week average demand, which corrects for weekly aberrations in data, for example, rose 1.6 percent year-over-year.

Weekly data from the American Petroleum Institute showed there was a 3.7 million barrels draw in gasoline inventories last week, an indication of strong demand. Industry operators are waiting for confirmation of this data in the U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) weekly inventory data. BIGGER PICTURE Analysts are divided over how high gasoline prices should climb for consumers to cut back on driving demand. They peg the cutoff price point, after which drivers will change their consuming habits, anywhere between $3.50 and $4.00 a gallon. Still, gasoline's share of consumer spending has plummeted over the past three decades. It accounted for about 3.08 percent of spending in 2010 based on data from the U.S. Commerce Department. In 1981, energy consumption represented 9.1 percent of spending of which gasoline made up about 55 percent. MasterCard also expects the slightly improved employment outlook will temper sharp year-over-year drops in demand as more consumers drive to work. "Historically, however, when prices rise toward record territory and as consumers expect higher prices in the near term, drivers begin to cut back on leisure travel and consolidate shopping trips," said John Gamel, director of economic analysis for SpendingPulse. MasterCard Advisors estimates retail gasoline demand based on aggregate sales activity in the MasterCard payments system, coupled with estimates for all other payment forms including cash and checks.
