 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said on Tuesday its management believes the company has ample liquidity and capital. 

 In a statement, Countrywide said it had $35.4 billion in "highly reliable liquidity" available at October 31, 2007, up from $33.6 billion available at September 2007. Further, Countrywide said it "will be a beneficiary of ongoing mortgage market consolidation." Countrywide shares had plummeted as much as 22 percent earlier on Tuesday on speculation the mortgage lender was running short of cash. By late afternoon, Countrywide shares had recovered to close down about 3.3 percent at $10.22. (Reporting by  Mark McSherry ; editing by  Andre Grenon )
