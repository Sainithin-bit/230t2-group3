 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has won a U.S. court ruling that could limit lawsuits alleging its painkiller Celebrex caused heart attacks and strokes. 

 Judge Charles Breyer of U.S. district court for the Northern District of California ruled on Monday that plaintiffs have not presented "scientifically reliable evidence" that Celebrex causes heart attacks or strokes when taken at a strength of 200 milligrams, according to court documents. Most Celebrex patients are prescribed the 200 mg dosage, according to Pfizer. More than 3,000 plaintiffs have claimed Celebrex caused heart problems, in federal lawsuits against the drug maker. "We are pleased with the decision of the federal court which recognizes the lack of any credible evidence linking Celebrex, at its most common dosage form, with heart attacks or strokes," Pfizer general counsel Allen Waxman said in a statement. "We believe that this ruling will greatly limit the scope of this litigation, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend the cases against us," Waxman said. Celebrex is part of the Cox-2 class of painkillers, which includes two drugs no longer on the market: Merck & Co's Vioxx and Pfizer's Bextra.
