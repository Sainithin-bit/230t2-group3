 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said on 
Tuesday the United States was not concerned about the debate 
within OPEC on whether it should seek an alternative to the 
dollar in pricing oil. 

  Bodman also told reporters that OPEC should increase output 
at its next meeting in Abu Dhabi in December.  The slump in the U.S. currency to record lows on global 
markets this month has hit export revenues of oil exporters 
because oil is priced in dollars.  This has prompted calls from Iran and Venezuela at an OPEC 
heads of state summit in Riyadh at the weekend that the oil 
exporting group drop the dollar and price oil against a basket 
of currencies instead.  Asked whether this discussion in the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries was giving the United States 
cause for concern, Bodman said: "No."  In response to a question on how much OPEC should increase 
its output at the December 5 meeting, Bodman declined to answer 
directly but said that OECD crude oil stocks were about 100 
million barrels below the five-year average.  "This is the number the market may be looking at," Bodman 
told reporters in London at a news briefing after addressing a 
British-U.S. business group.  The dollar's fall on global markets has helped to fuel 
oil's rally to a record $98.62 on November 7 and the rise has 
caused Western consumer nations to call for more OPEC supplies 
to cool the price.  (Reporting by  Randy Fabi ; Editing by Anthony Barker)
