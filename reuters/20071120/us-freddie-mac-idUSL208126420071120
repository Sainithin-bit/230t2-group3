 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Freddie Mac FRE.N, the second-largest U.S. mortgage finance company, on Wednesday posted a wider third quarter loss, hurt by a weak housing market and increased foreclosures. 

 The company reported a net loss of $2 billion, or $3.29 a share, compared with a loss of $715 million, or $1.17 a share, in the year-ago period. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected Freddie Mac to report a third quarter loss of $2.16 per share. Slumping home prices and tighter credit conditions have increased losses at mortgage finance companies such Freddie Mac and its bigger rival Fannie Mae FNM.N. Through Monday's close, shares of Freddie Mac are down about 45 percent year to date, in line with the drop in the KBW Mortgage Finance Index .MFX over the same period.
