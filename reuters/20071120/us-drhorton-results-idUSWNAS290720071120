 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, reported a quarterly loss on Tuesday but recorded smaller land-related charges than most analysts expected and said it would generate at least $1 billion in cash this fiscal year. 

 The company's shares initially rose more than 6 percent, then fell about the same after Freddie Mac FRE.N, the second- largest buyer of U.S. mortgages, said it may have to raise new capital to get through the ongoing U.S. credit crisis. That sent the U.S. home-builder stocks plummeting. "Freddie's basically saying they need to raise capital so the question now is: Who's going to be left to buy mortgages?" Agency Trading Group analyst Alex Barron said. Before the opening of the market, D.R. Horton posted a loss of $50.1 million or 16 cents per share for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, compared with a profit of $277.7 million or 88 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. The quarterly results included land impairment and write-off charges totaling $318.6 million, and $48.5 million for goodwill impairment -- much lower than some analysts had feared. D.R. Horton shares, which dropped as low as $10.46, their lowest price since April 2003, finished up 28 cents, or 2.5 percent at $11.53. Most others did not. The shares of Standard Pacific Corp ( SPF.N ), builder of homes in California and the West, fell 20 percent, its biggest percentage drop in more than 20 years, and closed at $2.31. Shares of Pulte Homes Inc ( PHM.N ), the No. 3 U.S. home builder, hit a five-year low before closing down 10 percent at $10.60. The benchmark Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB was off 4 percent. Of the 98 D.R. Horton communities impaired, 55 percent were in California, a market that went from piping hot in 2005 to stone cold today. Don Tomnitz, D.R. Horton's chief executive, said the company expects home prices to continue falling and cost cutting to remain a priority. The once-hottest markets, such as California, Las Vegas, and Phoenix are not responding to price cuts, as mortgages are more difficult to obtain and prospective buyers are less confident, Tomnitz said. "Cleary we anticipate '08 to be more difficult than '07," Tomnitz said in a conference call. The U.S. housing market has been in a steep decline for more than a year, following such a quick escalation in home prices that many buyers were priced out of the market. As the number of unsold homes swelled, the mortgage market also turned sour, with defaults rising. To weather the downturn, home builders have been slashing the number of homes they start and cutting prices on unsold new homes, reducing land holdings and payroll while looking to generate cash to pay down debt and shore up their balance sheet. "The strongest balance sheet wins this fight and we will have the strongest balance sheet when this is all over," Tomnitz said. D.R. Horton has slashed the number of lots it holds for development by 42 percent since March 2006 to 230,000. A planned sale of 20,000 lots that will generate $70 million in revenue means the company will have reduced its land supply to 5.1 years from 6.1 years at the start of the fiscal year. Horton also has pared its holdings of speculative homes -- those it starts building before it finds buyers -- by 18 percent to 10,600. Some 299 of those were completed at least a year ago. Built-to-order homes are about 3 percent more expensive than similar speculative homes, Tomnitz said. Fort Worth, Texas-based D.R. Horton expects to spend $500 million to $1 billion on for land acquisitions and development in fiscal 2008. That would be well down from $2.5 billion in fiscal 2007, and Tomnitz said he believes actual expenditure will be at the low end of the projected range. The company generated about $1.3 billion in free cash flow for the year, exceeding its goal of $1 billion and expects to generate at least $1 billion in fiscal 2008.
