 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Markets Inc WFMI.O posted a 15 percent drop in quarterly net profit on Tuesday due in part to costs from its acquisition of Wild Oats Markets, but sales topped Wall Street expectations and its stock rose more than 3 percent. 

 The grocer, which features natural and organic foods, said net profit fell to $33.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, from $39.8 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 30 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. It was not immediately clear if the expectations were directly comparable. The company said merger-related expenses and higher costs for opening and relocating stores weighed on its bottom line. Whole Foods opened eight stores during the quarter. Sales rose 25 percent to $1.74 billion. Analysts had been expecting $1.614 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales, which tracks sales at stores open at least a year, were up 8.2 percent. It was the company's best quarterly same-store sales performance since last year's fourth quarter. "We are very excited about the progress of our integration of Wild Oats and the healthy increase in sales growth we are seeing at the Wild Oats stores," Whole Foods Chief Executive John Mackey said in a statement. Whole Foods, which bought smaller rival Wild Oats in August, has faced increasing competition as other grocers expand their offerings of organic, natural and prepared foods. For fiscal 2008, Whole Foods expects same-store sales to rise between 7.5 percent and 9.5 percent. For the first seven weeks of the first quarter, same-store sales are up 9.5 percent, the company said. At Wild Oats stores, same-store sales are up 6.6 percent so far in the current quarter compared with a rise of 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter. For the year, total sales are expected to rise between 25 percent and 30 percent, Whole Foods said. About 10 percent of that is expected to come from Wild Oats stores. Whole Foods, based in Austin, Texas, also said its board of directors raised its common stock dividend by 11 percent to 20 cents a share. Whole Foods operates 269 stores and has a goal of reaching $12 billion in sales in fiscal 2010. Its shares rose to $43.65 in after-hours trading after closing at $42.25 on Nasdaq.
