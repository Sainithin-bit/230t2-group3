 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Deep earnings losses that slashed capital levels ensure Freddie Mac FRE.N and Fannie Mae FNM.N, the two largest U.S. home funding companies, will not be rescuing the ailing housing market any time soon. 

 These government-sponsored enterprises were expected to be, and posited themselves as, providers of stability to credit markets roiled by soured subprime loans that forced billions of dollars in write-offs at private mortgage companies and banks. Instead, third-quarter losses at both GSEs are compelling them to dump bonds on the market rather than being net buyers, escalating the turbulence. The housing slump will drag on longer with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two largest U.S. mortgage asset purchasers, hamstrung, some strategists said. "Their capacity is severely constrained," said Gregory Miller, chief economist at SunTrust Banks Inc in Atlanta. "I think that it will lengthen this correction process." Freddie Mac on Tuesday reported a $2 billion net loss for the third quarter as home prices sank, lenders made it harder for borrowers to get loans and foreclosures jumped. The company said it might cut dividends, sell preferred shares or convertible securities, and keep selling bonds from its portfolio to boost capital. Freddie Mac sold about $20 billion in September from its retained portfolio to help shore up capital. The sales continued last month, not captured by the third-quarter earnings, as it sold about $25 billion from the portfolio. "During the remainder of 2007, the unpaid principal balance of the retained portfolio may decline given the impact of the continued earnings volatility created by the current market environment and the need to manage to the 30 percent mandatory target capital surplus," Freddie Mac said in its report. Last week, Fannie Mae reported its third-quarter net loss doubled from a year earlier to $1.52 billion. Even if the portfolio limits mandated by their regulator are lifted, as some lawmakers suggest would help stabilize the mortgage market, the companies are low on surplus capital to grow with, the earnings reports showed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac cannot be backstops for the market and for housing to the degree that many in the industry were hoping, some economists said. The two GSEs buy mortgages from lenders to free up funds for more lending. They are publicly-traded companies with federal charters to promote home ownership. "Fannie and Freddie dumping (bonds) is still a part of this repricing process," Miller said. "I'm extremely concerned about the housing market," he added. "Although I don't think the housing market will cause recession ... it's certainly complicit, it can be the straw that breaks the camel's back." U.S. home builder sentiment is at all-time lows this month, according to the National Association of Home Builders. Permits to build homes hit a 14-year low in October, the U.S. Commerce Department said, suggesting housing sector woes will worsen. GAINING SHARE, NOT TRACTION The GSEs, ironically, have gained share of the shrinking mortgage pie from private mortgage companies during the credit crisis. More banks and lenders have shifted their business to the government-chartered companies, selling them loans as other entities shut their doors or struggle with credit troubles. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac need to keep curbing their activities, the ripple effects could grow. "Countrywide won't make as many loans as they do because they won't have access to the capital since Fannie and Freddie are probably going to have to cut back," said Neil Massa, senior U.S. trader at MFC Global Investment Management in Boston. Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N is the largest U.S. mortgage lender. Its shares plummeted as much as 22 percent on Tuesday on speculation it was running short of cash, before wiping out most of the losses after the company said it had ample capital. Julia Coronado, senior U.S. economist at Barclays Capital in New York, is more sanguine, calling for GSE growth in "fits and starts." "We do expect some credit to be flowing, particularly in the conforming markets, and if Congress has to make changes so that happens, then those changes will be made," she said. "Ultimately Congress is very, very focused, especially in election year, on the housing market and the troubles in the housing market, so I think we will see certain concessions made over time." After Freddie Mac's earnings were released, Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, said: "We must continue to pursue both strong regulatory and legislative responses to the crisis, both to protect homeowners and to create a set of standards so that home buyers, investors and lenders can safely reenter the mortgage markets." For now, some Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds are at their weakest since early this decade and others at record lows. Investors have instead fled to the safety of Treasuries. Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac plunged over 24 percent Tuesday to their lowest in more than a decade. "I don't think that Fannie and Freddie are going to shut their doors for the holidays and not reopen until next year," said Miller. "They will continue to operate at a reduced scale, and some producers are going to get squeezed out because the buyers are more limited."
