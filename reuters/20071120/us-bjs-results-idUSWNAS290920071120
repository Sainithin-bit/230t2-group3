 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N reported higher quarterly profit on Tuesday as the warehouse club operator works to turn its business around. 

 The third-largest U.S. warehouse club operator said net income rose to $22.7 million, or 35 cents per share, for the third quarter ended November 3, up from $18.3 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier. BJ's, which competes with larger rivals Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc's ( WMT.N ) Sam's Club, is trying to get its business back on track after facing disappointing sales and declining customer traffic.
