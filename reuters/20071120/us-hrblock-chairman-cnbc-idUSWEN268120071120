 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Richard Breeden, the new chairman of H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ), said he hoped the largest U.S. tax preparer will find a permanent chief executive within six months to replace Mark Ernst, who resigned. 

 Speaking on CNBC television, Breeden also said that "one way or another," H&R Block is determined to exit the subprime mortgage business. H&R Block is trying to salvage a sale of part of its Option One Mortgage Corp subprime unit to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP CBS.UL, after an agreement to sell the entire unit broke down.
