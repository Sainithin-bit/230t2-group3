 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. buyout firms JC Flowers and Cerberus have submitted offers for Northern Rock NRK.L, people familiar with the situation said, as shares in the stricken British bank tumbled on fears that any offers would be low. 

 JC Flowers' proposal includes an offer to Northern Rock shareholders at a "nominal value", a person familiar with the matter told Reuters. Cerberus also remains interested in the bank and submitted a proposal on Friday, another person said. Northern Rock shares fell as much as 42 percent earlier on Tuesday due to mounting concern that shareholders would not get much value from their holdings, but pared losses to close down 6.9 percent at 97 pence, valuing the bank at about 400 million pounds ($825 million). The share price slide came as Britain's Building Societies Association reported record receipts of 3 billion pounds last month, up from 2.8 billion in September, the bulk of which it believed to be withdrawals from Northern Rock. JC Flowers' proposal includes the repayment of 15 billion pounds in emergency loans to the Bank of England, and the repayment of further borrowing estimated at 10 billion pounds over time, probably by the end of 2010, the person said. It would take the business private and inject at least 1 billion pounds in new investment to support the bank's balance sheet and underwrite a new business plan. It would keep the Northern Rock name and presence in the northeast of England, he said. Cerberus is not alone in its proposal but is leading a group of potential investors, the second source said. A report that Cerberus had dropped out contributed to Tuesday's fall in Northern Rock shares, dealers had said. Britain's Treasury said on Monday it would be partial to bids that minimized government involvement, and would be willing to extend help for potential buyers beyond a sale or past February as long as it satisfied European Union law and the government's own fiscal rules. The government has also said its guarantee would be maintained as long as market conditions persisted. The Treasury said on Tuesday there would be a minimum of three months' notice before lifting any guarantee. None of the offers that had been received by Monday were for all of the bank, and all valued the equity "materially below" its value at the end of last week, Northern Rock has said. LOW OFFERS The Newcastle-based bank is Britain's most prominent casualty of the global credit market turmoil, which has also hit other mortgage lenders such as Alliance & Leicester ALLL.L. Northern Rock's advisers expect to attract interest from eight to 10 parties, banking sources say. Some shareholders have urged advisers to scrap the auction, however, and put more focus on reviving the business. "I firmly agree that a sale is the wrong thing. The situation is a shambles, and probably managing the business for a turnaround rather than a sale right now is the right way forward, given the bids on the table are probably below 1 pound (per share)," said Mike Trippitt, analyst at Oriel Securities. "The problem right now is with the level of retail deposits that have walked out the door and the emergency funding, it becomes less and less attractive," he added. Northern Rock is estimated to have borrowed about 25 billion pounds from the Bank of England since it was forced to turn to it for funds in mid-September after being unable to raise finances in wholesale markets. "No one knows which way it is going to go. No one knows whether it is going to be broken up, whether it is going to be privatized, whether it is going to be taken over," said Mark Priest, a trader at TradIndex. "Uncertainties in these conditions are just going to make this stock worse and worse and worse. We also have UBS and Swiss Re in Switzerland going limit down today. This banking sector is walking on a knife edge." Shares in midcap British buy-to-let lender Paragon ( PARA.L ) tumbled 40 percent after it said it may need to tap shareholders for 280 million pounds due to problems raising funding.
