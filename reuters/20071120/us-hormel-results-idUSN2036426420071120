 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp ( HRL.N ) said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose a better-than-expected 12 percent, helped by higher sales across all product lines. 

 The company, which sells Hormel meats, Spam processed meats and Jennie-O Turkey said profit was $101.2 million, or 73 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended October 28, compared with $90.0 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding 3 cents a share in one-time gains, earnings were 70 cents a share, topping analysts' average estimate of 65 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose about 7 percent to $1.66 billion, helped by an 8 percent sales increase in the refrigerated foods segment and a 7 percent gain for Jennie-O Turkey. The grocery products segment saw sales rise 4 percent. The Austin, Minnesota-based company forecast 2008 earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.40 and expects to return to its earnings per share growth objective of 10 percent. Starting in 2008, it plans to issue its forecasts on an annual basis. "Although we anticipate pressure from higher grain and energy costs, we expect to benefit from lower protein input costs," the company said. Hormel also declared an annual dividend of 74 cents per share for 2008, up from its dividend of 60 cents per share in 2007. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
