 SEOUL  (Reuters) - The head of the world's biggest mining group, BHP Billiton Ltd ( BHP.AX ), pushed his case for a mega-merger with rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) on Tuesday in the face of growing opposition from big Asian customers. 

 Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.L ), meanwhile, was considering offering joint ventures with BHP as an alternative to its bigger rival's takeover offer, Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper said. Without citing sources, the paper said in its online edition that Rio was preparing a preliminary defense plan -- Project Manchester -- against BHP's proposed three-shares-for-one bid. Rio Tinto declined to comment on the report. "We think this is a good proposal for shareholders and customers, but we have a lot of work to go through," BHP ( BLT.L ) CEO Marius Kloppers told Reuters on his way into talks with POSCO ( 005490.KS ), the world's fourth-biggest steel maker, in the South Korean capital. Kloppers has said a merger could mean $3.7 billion in annual savings after seven years through synergies in iron ore, coal and other activities. "We think the overlap of the operations, the fact that we have a solution on how to put the companies together, and the benefits ... is a very good proposition," he said on Tuesday. "We have a very compelling value proposition." BHP said on November 8 it had approached third-ranked miner Rio with an all-paper offer, now valued at around $122 billion. Rio was quick to reject the approach as too low. A BHP/Rio tie-up would create the world's biggest mining force, with control of huge amounts of iron ore, copper, coal, uranium, diamonds and other commodities for industrial use. Industry officials have said a merged entity would control 40 percent of the world's iron ore seaborne trade and 60 percent of Japan's iron ore imports. Japanese steelmakers said on Monday they strongly oppose a merger. That global clout could drive up costs for Asian steel firms as consolidation would reduce their bargaining power over long-term supply contracts for iron ore. BHP shares in London dipped 0.8 percent to 1,507 pence while Rio shares shed 0.9 percent to 5,009 pence by 1150 GMT, underperforming a flat UK mining index .FTNMX1770. CHINESE CONCERN China's steel industry, the biggest in the world, is concerned a merger would create "an even bigger monopoly" in iron ore, the industry's main feedstock, the China Metallurgical News quoted an unnamed senior official of the China Iron and Steel Association as saying. China already takes half of all the iron ore that BHP mines. BHP, Rio and Brazil's CVRD ( VALE5.SA ) control about 70 percent of the iron ore that China buys. POSCO Executive Vice-President Kwon Young-tae told Reuters his firm, too, was concerned that a BHP/Rio merger would form a monopoly in raw materials. He said a merger was "undesirable". In Brussels, the lobby group for the European steel industry, Eurofer, joined the chorus, saying it will ask the European Commission to block the proposal since the combined firm would have too much leverage on pricing. "We will be urging the Commission to take a negative view on it," Eurofer Director General Gordon Moffat told Reuters, adding that contacts with the EU executive body would be made this week. Kloppers' whirlwind tour of Japan, South Korea and China this week to explain his offer has generated customer concern about the size and power of the proposed mining behemoth. But analysts reckon it's unlikely to put BHP off course. "I don't see these protests changing Kloppers' mind. This is a well thought out move," DJ Carmichael & Co mining analyst James Wilson said in Perth, Australia. "BHP has made it very clear it wants to buy Rio Tinto." "BHP sees consolidation as making it easier to negotiate with customers in iron ore, where the steel mills have assumed a position of divide and conquer, which they would not have if BHP and Rio become one," Wilson said. Kloppers visits Shanghai and Beijing from Wednesday to Friday. (Additional reporting by  James Regan  in SYDNEY and Julien Ponthus in BRUSSELS; Editing by Keiron Henderson and  Ian Geoghegan )
