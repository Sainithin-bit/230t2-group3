 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, on Tuesday characterized rumors of a possible bankruptcy filing as "absolutely false," The Wall Street Journal said. 

 No further information was immediately available. Countrywide has not returned several requests for comment after its shares fell as much as 22 percent earlier Tuesday, on speculation it was having liquidity problems. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
