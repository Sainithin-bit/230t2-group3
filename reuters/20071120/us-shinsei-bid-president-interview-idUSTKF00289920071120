 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Shinsei Bank Ltd ( 8303.T ) will not pull out of the consumer finance business and instead sees opportunities for growth in the troubled industry, President Thierry Porte said on Tuesday. 

 Porte also said in an interview with Reuters that Shinsei was in no rush to repay the public funds injected into the bank during a government bailout in the late 1990s. "We are not pulling out," Porte said when asked about the possibility of leaving the industry. "We think we can make a better business out of this." Profits at Japan's consumer loan firms have suffered since the government imposed new caps on the interest rates they can charge. Banks, many of which have substantial holdings in moneylenders, have been hit by the slump, leading to speculation that some would cut their ties to the industry. Porte also said the bank would not hurry to repay the public funds it received in exchange for its preferred shares. "It's going to happen when it's going to happen," he said. "It depends on what happens to the stock price, and that is a function of many different factors, but there is no rush on our part to do so." The Japanese government received preferred shares in the bank in exchange for the bailout. If all of its current preferred share holdings in Shinsei were converted to common stock, the government would own a little more than 20 percent of the bank. Porte said he was not bothered by such a scenario. "I can think of no more prestigious shareholder than the Japanese government." (Reporting by  David Dolan  and Taro Fuse)
