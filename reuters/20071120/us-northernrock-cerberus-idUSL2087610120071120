 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S.-based buyout firm Cerberus CBS.UL remains interested in Northern Rock NRK.L and submitted a bid for the distressed UK mortgage lender on Friday, said a person close to the matter on Tuesday. 

 The person added that Cerberus is not alone in its proposal but leading a group of potential investors in Northern Rock, the person, who requested anonymity, added. A spokeswoman for Cerberus declined to comment on the matter, as did a spokesman for Northern Rock. Media had earlier reported Cerberus had dropped its plans for an offer.
