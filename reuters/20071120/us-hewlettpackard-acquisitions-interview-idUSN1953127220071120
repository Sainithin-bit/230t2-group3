 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) expects to buy more software companies in addition to expanding its software business internally, Chief Executive Mark Hurd said on Monday. 

 "We'll continue to be active in the organic R&D (research and development) area in addition to (making) selective acquisitions," Hurd told Reuters in an interview after HP reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings. HP, the world's largest personal computer maker, recently bought Opsware Inc for about $1.6 billion to bolster its business of helping corporate customers manage computer systems. HP has spent about $6.5 billion buying software companies in recent years, including Opsware. "We're very active in what's defined best as the management software space," including systems management, network management, server management and data storage management, Hurd said. "What we try to do is bring all these things together. You can see us in the software space continuing in this area." (Reporting by  Philipp Gollner ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
