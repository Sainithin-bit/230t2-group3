 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Book retailer Borders Group Inc BGP.N reported a wider than expected quarterly loss on Tuesday and booked a $116.5 million charge related to the sale of most of its British and Irish subsidiaries. 

 Third-quarter net loss grew to $161.1 million, or $2.74 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $39.1 million or 64 cents per share a year earlier. The company posted an operating loss of $39.1 million or 66 cents a share, four cents larger than analysts' average estimate for an operating loss of 62 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales rose 5.3 percent to $805.2 million. Sales at domestic superstores open more than a year rose 1.1 percent, fueled by the company's member rewards program. The company's total revenue rose 5.5 percent to $813.6 million, but fell short of Wall Street's target of $838.02 million. Borders' shares closed up 7.3 percent, or 83 cents, at $12.14 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Dana Ford; Editing by  Toni Reinhold )
