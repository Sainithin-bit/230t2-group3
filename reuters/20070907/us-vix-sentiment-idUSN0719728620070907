 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Options traders were on the defensive on Friday as a bleak jobs report and a newly released video by al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden just days before the anniversary of the September 11 attacks prompted many to reassess their portfolio risk ahead of the weekend. 

 The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index .VIX, or VIX, rose 9.34 percent to 26.23 as U.S. stocks tumbled after the government reported the nation's payrolls shrank for the first time in four years in August, stoking concerns about a recession. The VIX, often called Wall Street's main barometer of investor fear, finished the week surpassing the previous week's closing high of 26.30 on August 28. "The huge miss on the monthly payroll numbers had some market watchers muttering the "R" word (for recession) early in the day and that led to a broad stock market sell-off, which also caused a shift in risk perceptions," said Frederic Ruffy, analyst at education firm Optionetics in California. Fears of recession are heightened now because of the recent U.S. economic data, including the disappointing jobs report, said Herb Kurlan, president of Vtrader Pro, an online trading firm in San Francisco. The VIX, which measures projected stock market volatility conveyed by Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  option prices, tends to move in the opposite direction to the S&P benchmark. It rises as jittery investors are inclined to bid up index options to manage their stock market risk. "We are seeing a nearly 10 percent rise in the VIX which highlights that investors have an increased level of worry and are likely buying index puts for protection in a much more meaningful manner today," said Tim Biggam, lead option strategist at online brokerage thinkorswim in Chicago.. Investors were also nervous about the anniversary of 9/11, a newly released video by bin Laden and the upcoming Federal Reserve policy meeting on September 18, Biggam said. Bin Laden, on the video, said President George W. Bush was repeating the mistakes of Soviet leaders by refusing to acknowledge losses in Iraq. He also said U.S. Democrats had failed to stop the war in Iraq because of the power corporations wield in the United States. U.S. officials have not verified the authenticity of the tape. Meanwhile, in the futures market, front-month VIX futures failed to match the rise in the VIX. September VIX futures ended up at 25.83, The futures contracts have been basically trading in the 25 range for the last two weeks. In VIX options, there has also been a lot of contract neutral trading such as butterfly and vertical spread trading, said Ben Londergan, co-chief executive of Group One Trading in Chicago. "This tells us that investors are interested in limited risk strategies and that a lot of people think the VIX will move in the next few weeks but are not clear on which direction," Londergan said.
