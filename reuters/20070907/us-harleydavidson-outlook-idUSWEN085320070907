 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc ( HOG.N ) said on Friday that 2007 earnings would come in 4 percent to 6 percent lower than last year because of a sharp slowdown in August retail sales, and the motorcycle company's shares fell as much as 9 percent. 

 The outlook cut comes as the U.S. economy faces tightening credit markets, a housing slump and employment worries. Harley said the general uncertainty seemed to be prompting consumers to hold off on discretionary purchases like its high-end motorcycles, which can cost upward of $20,000 for top-of-the-line models. The company said it expected 2008 earnings to rise by 4 percent to 7 percent and withdrew its 2009 outlook. In July, it had forecast growth of 11 percent to 17 percent for the two-year period. "We entered August, and there was a sharp decline in retail sales," Chief Executive Jim Ziemer said in a phone interview. While declining to provide a specific number, Ziemer described the percentage drop as "double-digit." The company had gone into August expecting retail sales to rise in the second half of the year as its dealers cleared out old models and started selling 2008 bikes. But that proved not to be the case, Ziemer said. "There's not one single thing; it's the uncertainty in the economic environment which has the greatest impact," Ziemer said. "Whether we look at the credit squeeze ... or what houses are selling for, there's a lot of things." Harley-Davidson said it expected to ship 86,000 to 88,000 motorcycles in the third quarter, after originally planning for 91,000 to 95,000. The Milwaukee-based company forecast 2007 earnings of $3.69 to $3.77 per share, compared with $3.93 in 2006, and said revenue would decline modestly. As recently as July, the company had said it expected earnings per share to rise by 4 percent to 6 percent this year. The profit warning came the same day as a report showing that U.S. employers had cut jobs in August, the first time they have done so in four years. FORECAST OF REBOUND IN 2008 For 2008, Harley said it expected moderate revenue growth and lower operating margins as it sees continued challenges in the U.S. retail motorcycle market. In a note to clients, UBS equity analyst Robin Farley said a three-week strike at Harley's largest factory would crimp 2007 results. That means that even if the company meets its 2008 growth forecast, its results next year would be even with last year, Farley wrote. Harley shares had rallied through the second half of 2006, climbing as high as $75.87. Friday's decline brought them back to levels last seen in June 2006. "Harley is coming off an unusually long and robust growth cycle, which (makes) it very difficult to handicap the magnitude and duration of this slowdown," RBC Capital Markets analyst Edward Aaron wrote in a note to clients. In morning New York Stock Exchange trade, Harley shares were down $4.43, or 8.2 percent, at $49.66 on the New York Stock Exchange, their biggest one-day slide in more than two years. Earlier the stock fell to $49.10. So far this year, the shares are down 29.6 percent for the year, while the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  has gained 2.6 percent.
