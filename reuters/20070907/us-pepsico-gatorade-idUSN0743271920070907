 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) said on Friday it was launching new drinks, including the caffeinated Propel Invigorating Water and a lighter version of the Gatorade sports beverage. 

 The new Gatorade, called G2, has fewer calories than the original and is aimed at people when they are not working out. Pepsi said its bottlers would begin delivering the new products to convenience stores, independent retailers and gas stations later this year. The world's second-largest beverage company behind Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) first mentioned the new products in July, but did not say what they would be called. Pepsi is aiming to boost sales growth of Gatorade, one of its biggest brands, since it has slowed recently, in part because of cooler weather and price increases. The slowdown, coupled with the acquisition of "vitaminwater" maker Glaceau earlier this year by Coca-Cola, has led analysts and investors to question Gatorade's future prospects. However Sanford Bernstein analyst Robert van Brugge said in a recent research note that the threat to Gatorade from vitaminwater was modest, since people tend to drink Gatorade when they are exercising and vitaminwater at other times. G2, however, may compete more directly with vitaminwater because it also is not meant for athletic activities. Van Brugge forecast that Gatorade growth would rebound next year in the absence of price increases by Pepsi and discounts by Coke on its Powerade sports drink.
