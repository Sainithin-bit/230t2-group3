 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A bleak U.S. jobs report on Friday inflamed fears that mortgage troubles are coming home to roost in the U.S. economy, while lenders Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N and IndyMac Bancorp Inc IMB.N announced steep cuts to their work forces. 

 Analysts said the surprisingly weak U.S. job figures, which showed that monthly payrolls shrank for the first time in four years, will force the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates at its September 18 meeting or even before then, a move they said is vital to take the edge off market upheaval. A rate cut "seems in the bag, and frankly I wouldn't be surprised if it were sooner than the 18th, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were 50 basis points," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. The U.S. August payrolls report showed a fall of 4,000 nonfarm jobs. The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters had been for a rise of 110,000. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said he was not totally surprised about the decline in jobs last month given housing troubles and less government hiring, but said he still sees the economy as healthy. Forecasts on interest rates have altered dramatically since the credit crisis, stemming from mass defaults on U.S. subprime mortgages made mainly to lower income people, prompted banks to clam up on lending as they strive to calculate exposure to the sector. Alan Greenspan, who stepped down as chairman of the Federal Reserve in January 2006, said on Thursday that ongoing credit turmoil reminded him of the 1987 and 1998 market crises. "What we are observing in the last seven weeks is identical in many respects to what we saw in 1998, what we saw in the stock market crash of 1987," the Wall Street Journal's Friday online edition quoted him as saying. Greenspan took over as Fed chief shortly before the Dow Jones stock index slumped 23 percent in one day in October 1987. In 1998, hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management controlled $100 billion of assets but collapsed in the wake of a Russian debt crisis, wreaking havoc in many derivatives markets. Other news of subprime damage kept investors on edge on Friday. Countrywide was the latest lender bringing bad news in the mortgage sector, saying it plans to cut 10,000 to 12,000 jobs over the next three months, as it copes with declining housing volume and difficult credit markets. The job cuts represent up to 20 percent of its work force. In addition, IndyMac Bancorp said it will cut 1,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and said it may halve its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share to combat a slowdown in mortgage lending. Rumors also swirled on Friday about bankers' efforts to finance Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co's $26 billion leveraged buyout of First Data Corp FDC.N. The financing process, expected to close later this month, is being closely watched across Wall Street as a litmus test for the more than $300 billion of leveraged buyout debt clogging the balance sheets of such banking giants as Citigroup ( C.N ), JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Lehman Brothers.  "Questions still remain as to whether the bond market has the appetite for what the financial sponsors wish to serve up," analysts at research firm CreditSights wrote on Friday. First Data "is a significantly levered company and the proposed structure (of the debt financing) could be un-doable in today's market," they said. COMMERCIAL PAPER STILL SMARTING The U.S. commercial paper market shrank 13 percent in the past month as U.S. companies struggle to raise short-term capital, while U.S. homes going into foreclosure hit a record in the second quarter, data showed on Thursday. nN06451082 Various estimates show corporate financing markets under strain, with some $300 billion to $500 billion of commercial paper due to be rolled over before the Fed meeting. Central banks have poured money into money markets over the past month to improve liquidity. London interbank offered rates for the euro fixed below the ECB's benchmark interest rate of 4 percent for the first time since August 28. But three-month sterling Libor rates hit 6.8875 percent, their highest level since November 1998. "We suspect money market pressure will be slow to fade and the impact on the real economy will be more notable than expected," Morgan Stanley said. "The question is, where are the surprises?" The European Central Bank, Bank of England and their equivalents in Australia and Canada all left rates on hold this week. Until recently, they had all been expected to tighten policy sooner rather than later. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Friday his bank was still poised to act on inflation risks, but the mood of uncertainty meant no change in rates was imminent. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said he expected a downward revision of world growth estimates for 2007 and 2008 as a result of the subprime crisis.
