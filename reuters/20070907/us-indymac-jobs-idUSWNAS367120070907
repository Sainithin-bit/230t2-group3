 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IndyMac Bancorp Inc IMB.N said on Friday it will cut 1,000 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, and may halve its quarterly dividend to 25 cents per share to combat a slowdown in mortgage lending. 

 Chief Executive Michael Perry said the current quarter probably represents the "trough" for the company's earnings, and that IndyMac should be "solidly profitable" in the fourth quarter and in 2008. Perry said he plans to recommend the lowered dividend to IndyMac's board of directors, saying that the lower dividend would be "a normal ratio to earnings." (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
