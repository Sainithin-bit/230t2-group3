 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) now expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates aggressively in September to combat the economic impact of an ongoing credit crunch. 

 U.S. employment declined unexpectedly in August, prompting economists at the investment bank to shift their forecasts for monetary policy. Goldman now believes the Fed will cut its benchmark federal funds rate by a full 50 basis points, rather than the quarter percentage point cut it had foreseen previously.
