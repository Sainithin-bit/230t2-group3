 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Conglomerate Loews Corp LTR.N said on Friday it expects to record a loss of about $98 million related to an arbitration settlement by its insurance business, CNA Financial ( CNA.N ). 

 CNA Financial, a property casualty insurer that is 89 percent owned by Loews, said on Thursday it reached an agreement with John Hancock Life Insurance Co to settle four reinsurance treaties issued by a former CNA subsidiary. CNA will make a one-time payment of $250 million as part of the agreement.
