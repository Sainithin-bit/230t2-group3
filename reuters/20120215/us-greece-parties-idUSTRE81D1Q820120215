 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek conservative party leader Antonis Samaras has not yet signed a written commitment to the country's international lenders on implementing an austerity package, a source close to negotiations on securing a new EU/IMF bailout said on Tuesday. 
 "So far Samaras has not given a letter of commitment and this is a problem," the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. His New Democracy party declined comment. A separate source at the PASOK socialist party said its leader, George Papandreou, had already provided a signed undertaking to support the measures passed by parliament early on Monday.
