 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investors in banks may need to scale back their profit expectations as new rules to curb risk-taking will likely halve pre-crisis returns, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said. 

 In its annual report published on Sunday the BIS said the evolution in bank business models will necessarily be reflected in lower, more stable returns on equity (ROEs), a key measure of profitability, since bank balance sheets will be less risky. "However, it is not yet clear that bank managers and shareholders have revised their targeted ROEs accordingly," the report from the world's main forum for central bankers said. Pre-crisis, bank returns hit 20 percent or more and some banks are still targeting the high teens. Britain's Barclays Plc for instance is aiming to increase returns to 13 percent by 2013 from an "unacceptable" 7.2 percent last year; Deutsche Bank AG is targeting a pretax investment bank return of 20 to 25 percent after 2013, still down from 28 percent in 2010. The BIS said that over a longer time horizon, financial companies have tended to achieve returns of 11 to 12 percent, which is close to the average for non-financial corporations. The dampener on profits comes from rules such as Basel III, a set of tougher global bank capital requirements due in 2013. But the BIS said countries should move faster to implement Basel III if local banks are profitable and able to apply the standards without having to restrict credit. "Banks should not be permitted to increase their capital distributions simply because the deadline for achieving the minimum standards is still some way off, particularly if there are signs of growing macroeconomic risks and imbalances," the report said. BANK DATA FRAMEWORK The BIS welcomed efforts by Britain, the European Union, the United States and other countries to set up a new breed of watchdogs to spot broad, systemic risks to financial stability and tackle them with "macroprudential" tools. Such tools include forcing banks to top up capital cushions in good times for tapping when markets turn sour, a step that also may help to cool overheated credit markets. "Nonetheless, a substantial amount of trial and error is likely to be needed for the time being, given the still-limited history of macroprudential policy usage," the BIS said. The BIS report said gaps are also evident in both the analytical framework and company-level and aggregate data which policymakers will need to take action. An international data-sharing framework should be set up to give supervisors a common view of the balance-sheet positions of the largest global banks, the report said. This was crucial when the 10 biggest banks each have about 3,500 subsidiaries in about 80 countries. "A key data gap during the crisis was the lack of information on banks' asset and liability positions, broken down by currency, counterparty sector, counterparty country and instrument type," the report said. Regulators must be able to jointly analyze the balance sheets of many banks to determine exposures to particular asset classes or concentrations. The report also said deeper consideration is needed to assess the systemic importance of insurance companies and their role in financial stability. There has also been a revival of financial innovation, such as in the growth of synthetic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and commodity-linked investment vehicles. This poses a challenge to supervisors trying to decide if action is needed, the report said. (Editing by  David Holmes )
