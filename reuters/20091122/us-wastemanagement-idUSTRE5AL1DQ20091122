 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Current valuations of waste managers such as Waste Connections Inc ( WCN.N ), Waste Management Inc ( WM.N ) and Republic Services Inc ( RSG.N ) give the company's shares a lot of room to rise, according to a Barron's story. 

 In its November 23 edition, Barron's said Waste Connections shares could rise to $37.50 in a year, citing Raymond James analyst William Fisher's price target for the stock, which closed at $31.79 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday. According to Barron's, investor Todd Lowenstein of Highmark Value Momentum Fund sees Waste Management shares rising as high as $40 from their Friday NYSE close at $32.30. Republic Service's Chairman Jim O'Connor has said that analysts' discounted cash-flow analysis pegs his company's value in the mid $30s range, according to the story. This compares to Republic Services NYSE close of $27.40 on Friday. The story also noted that Warren Buffett has bought 1 percent of Republic Services, based on Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) filings. It said that Bill Gates investment vehicle had doubled its shares in Waste Management, giving it a 15 percent stake. (Reporting by  Sinead Carew ; Editing Bernard Orr)
