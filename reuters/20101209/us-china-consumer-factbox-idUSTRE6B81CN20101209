 (Reuters) - A clutch of companies has recently announced plans for a sales drive in smaller Chinese towns and cities where they see potential for strong revenue growth. 

 Here are some of those expanding into the less prosperous interior. -- German sports goods company Adidas AG plans to open more than 2,500 stores in smaller Chinese cities by 2015, expanding its coverage to 1,400 cities from 550 now. It is even looking at Tier-6 and Tier 7 towns, the bottom rungs of the administrative and retailing ladder. -- Ford Motor, expecting record sales in China this year, is adding 100 dealers to its network, mostly in inland cities, not on the richer seaboard. -- Electronics giant Foxconn is planning a major push for its retail business in China, drawing on former employees to set up thousands of stores in smaller third- and fourth-tier cities. The parent company of Hon Hai and Foxconn International will encourage long-time employees who want to return to their hometowns to open up shops selling electronics by investing over 300,000 yuan ($45,000) in each store. -- General Motors, the biggest overseas automaker in China, is rolling out affordable models aimed at Tier-3 and Tier-4 cities, which it says could account for 60 percent of its business within five years. -- Britain's Tesco, the world's No.3 retailer, plans to quadruple revenue in China over the next five years by more than doubling its number of hypermarkets to more than 200, including a push into second- and third-tier cities. In addition, other foreign companies continue to move into the Chinese market. -- American retailer Gap Inc and U.S. steakhouse Morton's Restaurant Group Inc opened their first outlets in China in November. -- French department store operator Galeries Lafayette will open its first store in Beijing in 2013 and is planning a total of 10-15, including in second- and third-tier cities, in the next five years (Reporting by  Alan Wheatley ; editing by  Bill Tarrant ) (Created by William Tarrant)
