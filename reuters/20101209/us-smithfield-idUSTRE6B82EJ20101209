 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Smithfield Foods Inc SFD.N expects to post a record profit this year as its moves to cut meat supplies are paying off with higher prices, and its shares rose more than 10 percent. 

 Smithfield is recovering from two years of losses that resulted from high feed prices, a glut of hogs and a recession that slowed meat sales. The company responded by trimming down. It now produces about 2 million fewer hogs a year, it sold off a beef unit, closed an inefficient pork plant, and just recently sold its share in the Butterball turkey operation. "I am more optimistic than I have been in a very long time," Chief Executive Larry Pope said during a conference call with investors. D.A. Davidon analyst Tim Ramey maintains a "buy" rating on the stock and said hog supplies should remain tight over 12 to 18 months despite recent profitable hog prices. Smithfield officials said they do not anticipate herd expansion in the United States or overseas. On Thursday, Smithfield reported a record quarterly profit that topped expectations due to higher hog and pork prices. "The (pork) margins they achieved this quarter were stunning," said Ramey. "I would not forecast a continuance of that, but I am forecasting good margins." "It sounds as though Smithfield is going to earn comfortably more than $2.66 (per share) this year," JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect $1.88 per share for the current year, fiscal 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. While the results were impressive, they may be hard to repeat, particularly in pork processing. FEED PRICES TO REMAIN HIGH Hog numbers will stay tight because of high corn prices. Corn prices are above $5 per bushel, which is still historically high. Smithfield officials said those prices should remain high, but stronger hog prices have helped offset that cost. In the quarter that ended October 31, Smithfield's hogs, on average, sold for $56 per hundred pounds, up from $36 a year earlier. Smithfield's hog unit earned $78.3 million in the quarter on an operating basis, versus a year-earlier loss of $194.7 million. "I don't think we are going back to $4. But I think there is an opportunity for it to drop a bit," Pope said of corn prices. Hog producers remain fearful of corn after prices doubled to more than $7 per bushel in 2008. That increase raised production costs for Smithfield and other livestock and poultry producers, and prompted industry-wide reductions in cattle, hogs and chickens. Smithfield's pork unit -- which sells meat under brands such as Armor and Eckrich -- also benefited from higher prices, with earnings up 8 percent. Smithfield earned $143.7 million, or 86 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter, ended October 31, compared with a year-ago loss of $26.4 million, or 17 cents a share. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 80 cents a share, far above the average forecast of 56 cents among analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue was $3 billion, up 11 percent from a year earlier. Wall Street, on average, expected $3.21 billion. The pork unit earned nearly $189 million. Export demand for pork was strong in the latest quarter, helped by the weak U.S. dollar, the company said. Smithfield exports pork to countries including Mexico, Japan and Taiwan. Smithfield shares were up $1.81, at $19.51 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Ben Klayman  in Detroit; Editing by John Wallace, Maureen Bavdek and Steve Orlofsky)
