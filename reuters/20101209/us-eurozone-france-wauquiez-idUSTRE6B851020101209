 PARIS  (Reuters) - The euro protects the single currency bloc in the current debt crisis and without it there would be a regional currency war and competitive devaluations, France's European affairs minister said. 

 In a preview of an interview to be published by financial daily Les Echos on Friday, the newly appointed minister, Laurent Wauquiez, said the Franco-German relationship was "solid." "In the current crisis, the euro is protecting us," he said, ahead of a Franco-German ministerial meeting in Freiburg on Friday. "Without it, there would be a fratricidal war between the currencies that would trigger a spiral of competitive devaluations, synonymous with a weakening economy." Wauquiez added that macroeconomic surveillance in the euro zone had been too loose. "We should in the future control the external balances of euro zone countries and the exposure of their banking sector to ensure growth is sustainable and that they can repay their debt."
