 LONDON  (Reuters) - Helicopter manufacturer AgustaWestland issued a statement in support of its chief executive after he was caught up in a corruption case over a contract with the Indian government. 
 Bruno Spagnolini, head of the helicopter business, has been placed under house arrest, a source said. Police arrested Giuseppe Orsi, CEO of parent company Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ), as part of the same inquiry. "The company expresses its support to both of them and confirms its confidence in the judges," the statement said. (Writing by  Keith Weir , 44 20 7542 8022)
