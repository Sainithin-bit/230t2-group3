 ROME  (Reuters) - The head of Italy's engineering association Federmeccanica condemned actions by prosecutors against defense group Finmeccanica ( SIFI.MI ), oil giant ENI ( ENI.MI ) and steel maker ILVA, saying they exposed the groups to "uncontrollable risks". 
 "The investigations will run their course and we'll see what result they bring," Pier Luigi Ceccardi said in a statement. "What's clear is that they are exposing our country's big industrial groups to uncontrollable risks at a very delicate moment for the future of our productive industry," he said.
