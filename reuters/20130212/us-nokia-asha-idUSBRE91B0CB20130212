 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Nokia expanded its line of low-end smartphones on Tuesday with the Asha 310, which comes with dual-SIM and wi-fi access, aiming to bolster its market share in developing markets. 
 Nokia has been losing market share to Samsung and Apple in the high-end smartphone market and is also struggling at the low end against growing competition from Chinese manufacturers. The Finnish company said that the new Asha 310 will come with a full-touch 3-inch display and 2 megapixel camera. The phone allows users to switch between SIM cards and wi-fi to keep down costs. Nokia plans for the phone to be in stores in Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Brazil this quarter at a price of $102. (Reporting by Helsinki Newsroom; Editing by David Goodman)
