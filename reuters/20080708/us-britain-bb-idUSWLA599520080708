 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in troubled British bank Bradford & Bingley Plc BB.L accelerated their losses on Tuesday, hitting a fresh low amid concerns over its outlook even after an enlarged 400 million pound ($789 million) cash call. 

 At 0812 GMT, stock in Britain's largest buy-to-let mortgage lender was down 19 percent at 34 pence, recovering slightly from an all-time low of 31p touched earlier but still well below its planned rights issue price of 55p. B&B was forced to increase its planned rights issue last week, after a credit rating downgrade from Moody's prompted U.S. private equity investor TPG to pull out of buying a stake. TPG had been brought in just weeks earlier, when the bank slashed its rights issue price as trading conditions deteriorated. B&B has said the latest issue, which will cost it more than 55 million pounds in underwriting, legal and other expenses, is supported by top investors and is fully underwritten -- but its shares have tumbled. "This third attempt at a rights issue looks like a dog's breakfast. Though depositors' funds are safe, and in no way can this bank's problems be seen as a replication of Northern Rock, we can only hope that the management of this beleaguered mortgage lender and its advisors have plan B in place," David Buik at Cantor Index said in a morning note. WHITE KNIGHT "Hopefully it will take the shape of a white knight in shining armor who will sweep up this damsel in distress, removing any possibility of further embarrassment to the banking sector in the market place." Analysts, though, say finding a buyer could be tough. Entrepreneur Clive Cowdery, who tried to gatecrash the TPG deal with his own plan to inject 400 million pounds through vehicle Resolution, has indicated he is not preparing to return after walking away late last month. UK banks, however, will be watching with interest over the fate of their rival, less than a year after the crisis at Northern Rock, which was nationalized earlier this year. Newspaper reports on Tuesday said major UK commercial lenders had struck sub-underwriting agreements with B&B's underwriters. This move could leave HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Lloyds TSB ( LLOY.L ), HBOS HBOS.L, Barclays ( BARC.L ), Santander's ( SAN.MC ) Abbey and Royal Bank of Scotland with a combined 33 percent stake in B&B as a result of the cash call. They could face 50 million pounds of losses, the Financial Times reported, if they had to honor the commitment. B&B declined to comment. Shares fell across the UK and European banking sector in early trade on Tuesday, on concerns over the economic outlook and tracking steep declines in Asian and U.S. markets.
