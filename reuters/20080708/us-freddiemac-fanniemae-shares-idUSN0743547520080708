 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N, the two largest providers of U.S. mortgage finance, rose after their regulator said on Tuesday that they should have adequate returns to raise capital. 

 Shares of both Fannie and Freddie plunged on Monday to their lowest levels since the early 1990s on concern the two companies may need to raise billions of dollars in fresh capital amid larger-than-expected losses. James Lockhart, director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, said that an accounting rule change should not drive capital changes at the two state-sponsored agencies. Freddie shares were at $12.92 in pre-open trade, up from Monday's close of $11.91, and Fannie shares rose to $16.80, up from Monday's close of $15.74.
