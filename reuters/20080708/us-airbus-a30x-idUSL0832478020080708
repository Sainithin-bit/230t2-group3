 PARIS  (Reuters) - European aircraft maker Airbus is planning to launch the successor generation of A320s in 2014 and put them in service around 2018, French daily La Tribune reported on Tuesday. 

 Development cost of the project, called A30X, is estimated at between 8 billion euros ($12.52 billion) and 10 billion euros, the newspaper added without citing sources. One of the new aircraft's targets is to reduce fuel consumption, it added. However, the newspaper said the timing was not set in stone as it depended on what the competition did and the fluctuation of oil prices. Airbus is owned by European aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ).
