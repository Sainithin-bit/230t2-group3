 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc ( CAH.N ) said on Tuesday it would eliminate 600 jobs and consolidate its businesses to cut costs. 

 The Dublin, Ohio-based company said it expects restructuring costs of $63 million in fiscal 2009. The 600 job cuts represent about 2 percent of the company's work force. Cardinal stood by its fiscal 2008 earnings forecast of $3.75 to $3.85 per share excluding one-time items. Analysts' average forecast is $3.79, according to Reuters Estimates. The moves come two months after Cardinal, the second-largest U.S. distributor of pharmaceuticals, recalled a mouthwash from 900 U.S. hospitals due to safety concerns. The company also faces a federal tax probe. "A new restructuring plan signals that the issues that have bedeviled the company in the past are likely to persist," Morgan Stanley analyst David Veal wrote in a research note. "Even so, we are encouraged by an apparent willingness to consider ever bolder steps to unlock value that could lead us to a more positive stance toward the shares." Cardinal said it would streamline its businesses into three segments: health-care supply chain services, clinical and medical products, and other. On May 1, the company posted net earnings of $366 million, or $1.02 a share, for the fiscal third quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $5 million a year earlier. On May 5, it recalled 60,000 bottles of alcohol-free mouthwash from 900 U.S. hospitals after the mouthwash tested positive for a bacteria called Burkholderia cepacia. Relatively harmless in healthy people, the bacteria may cause infection for people with health problems. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that the mouthwash was associated with eight infections. On May 29, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service revealed a tax probe of Cardinal related to a deal with the Dutch bank Rabobank Group RABN.UL. Cardinal shares were up $1.11, or 2.2 percent, to $51.75 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares hit a four-year low of $49.73 in March.
