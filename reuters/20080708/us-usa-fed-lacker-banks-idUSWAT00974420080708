 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - With the exception of the housing sector, the U.S. banking system is going through a normal credit cycle, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker said on Tuesday. 

 "(I believe the) credit tightening we've seen in the last half-year or so has been driven by changes in the fundamental credit-worthiness of borrowers," Lacker told an audience after a speech. "The banking system is solvent. That is not true of every single bank in the system," Lacker said, adding that housing aside, "in the rest of the credit space, we're going through a garden-variety credit cycle."
