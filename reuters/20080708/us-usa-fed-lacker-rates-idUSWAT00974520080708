 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve must be ready to raise U.S. interest rates despite high unemployment and weak growth in order to keep inflation at bay, one of its top policy-makers said on Tuesday. 

 "It could happen that we find it necessary to raise rates even if unemployment is still rising and growth is still weak," Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond President Jeffrey Lacker told reporters after delivering a speech. "That is a possibility ... it is something that we need to be prepared to do," he said. (Reporting by  Alister Bull )
