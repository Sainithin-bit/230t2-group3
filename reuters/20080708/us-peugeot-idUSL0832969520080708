 PARIS  (Reuters) - PSA Peugeot Citroen, Europe's second-biggest carmaker, warned of a worsening in western Europe's car market and forecast a 4 percent decline in vehicle sales for the whole of 2008. 

 Peugeot, second to Volkswagen AG in passenger car sales in Europe, gave no reasons on Tuesday for its outlook but called the economic environment "tough". Its shares fell more than 4 percent to their lowest level in nine years as the auto sector as a whole fell 3.6 percent, led by a 5.2 percent fall in Renault. Peugeot's outlook is in line with comments from consultancy J.D. Power Automotive Forecasting, which said on Friday it expected European vehicle sales to fall 4 percent in 2008 and 1.3 percent in 2009, from a previous outlook of a decline of 2.1 percent for 2008. J.D. Power blamed a "toxic" mix of falling asset prices, slowing economic growth, financial crisis and rising inflation for the deteriorating outlook. Renault boss Carlos Ghosn said on Saturday he expected a difficult French car market after the summer holidays and said everybody had underestimated the extent of the U.S. recession. Peugeot said in priority growth markets -- the Mercosur area in south America, China, Russia and eastern Europe -- it still expected a double-digit growth rate for the full year. It maintained its target of global consolidated sales growth of around 5 percent in 2008. This compares to a 4.6 percent growth in vehicle unit sales and car kits (shipped for assembly in other markets such as Iran) to 1.84 million for the first half while assembled vehicle sales were up 0.5 percent to 1.7 million units. NOT AS CONFIDENT Some analysts said prospects could be even worse than Peugeot believes. "We fail to be as confident as the group," said analysts at brokerage Landesbanki Kepler, noting the French market may soften while rising commodity prices could force carmakers to raise selling prices -- which would depress sales further. Analysts doubt whether the group can reach its 2008 operating margin target of 3.5 percent. The average expectation of analysts is 3.38 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Germany's BMW AG said on Monday it had its worst unit sales month in June with a 2.8 percent world-wide drop. Elsewhere Fiat SpA has said it will temporarily shut factories due to weak sales. Peugeot said registrations fell 3.5 percent to 1.23 million units in the first half, in a European passenger car and light commercial vehicle market that was down 3 percent. Over the period, its market share was 14.0 percent compared with 14.1 percent a year ago and 13.8 percent for 2007. It said first-half sales were underpinned by its Peugeot 308 and Citroen C5 models as well as sound sales of the Peugeot 207. PSA added it would benefit from its leadership in low consumption and low-CO2 emission vehicles. It would also see the full impact of new models such as the Peugeot 308 and 308 SW, the new Citroen C5 in its sedan and Tourer versions and the latest LCV range, with the Peugeot Bipper and Partner and Citroen Nemo and Berlingo. Peugeot shares had dropped 38.4 percent so far this year by Monday's close and were trading at  5.25 times expected 2008 earnings -- the lowest multiple of the European major makers. Renault will publish its first-half unit sales on Wednesday. (Editing by  David Holmes )
