 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N posted better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as a result of price increases and cost-cutting, but trimmed its full-year outlook for revenue and operating profit, and shares fell 4 percent in morning trade. 

 The largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) drinks said net income rose 7.4 percent to $174 million, or 78 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended June 14, from $162 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts' average forecast was 75 cents per share for the bottler, which operates in the United States, Canada, Greece, Mexico, Russia, Spain and Turkey, according to Reuters Estimates. The weakness of the dollar boosted net revenue by 3 percentage points and operating income by 2 percentage points, the company said. Profit was also helped by share repurchases, lower taxes and cost cuts. "'Making the numbers' is something we expect PBG to continue doing," wrote Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg in a research note. "But we believe the results reflect a difficult environment." Swartzberg, who has a "Hold" rating on the shares, called the results "uninspiring," and said they represented the fundamental challenges facing most of the beverage sector -- continuing pressure on costs of commodities such as corn syrup, dampening U.S. sales and slowing growth in emerging markets. Swartzberg, like other analysts, said he does not see these challenges abating in the foreseeable future. Pepsi Bottling's quarterly net revenue rose nearly 5 percent to $3.52 billion despite a 3 percent decline in case volume. The company, which is 40 percent owned by PepsiCo, said revenue per case rose 8 percent worldwide, led by strength in Europe and Mexico, and was up 5 percent in the United States and Canada, due mostly to price increases. In North America, volume fell 4 percent due to the absence of the Easter holiday -- which fell in the first quarter this year -- and "overall weakness in the liquid refreshment beverage category," the company said. Volume fell 3 percent in Mexico and grew 1 percent in Europe as growth in Russia and Turkey was partially offset by a decline in Spain. Pepsi Bottling affirmed its full-year earnings forecast, which calls for profit of $2.30 to $2.38 per share and operating free cash flow of at least $620 million. Yet the company said it now expects top-line growth of 5 to 6 percent and its comparable operating profit to grow at a low single-digit percentage rate. That compares to an earlier view which called for topline growth of 6 to 7 percent and operating profit growth of 4 to 6 percent. Pepsi Bottling shares have fallen 27 percent this year, compared with a 34 percent decline for Coca-Cola Co's ( KO.N ) largest bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ). "Bottlers have been shunned in light of increasing commodities (costs) and economic slowdown in the U.S.," Credit Suisse analyst Carlos Laboy wrote in a research note. "But (Pepsi Bottling) continues to deliver on promises." Laboy said Pepsi Bottling shares, which were down $1.03 at $27.63 in late-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, could reach $30 in the near-term, given the company's full-year earnings forecast.
