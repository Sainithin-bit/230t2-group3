 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) is three 
quarters of the way through the toughest part of its 
integration of Bear Stearns and has halved that bank's 
risk-weighted assets, according to Chief Executive Jamie Dimon. 

  "We've had all the people decisions, we've made all the 
management teams have been integrated, we've started to move 
people between the buildings," Dimon said in an interview with 
Charlie Rose on PBS televised on Monday.  "If you look at what they call risk-weighted assets -- of 
$220 billion, it's probably half that today. And so we had to 
get that risk down ... So I think we're 75 percent through the 
toughest parts of it," he said.  JPMorgan completed its fire-sale acquisition of Bear 
Stearns in May, following that bank's stock plunge and collapse 
earlier this year.  (Reporting by  Michael Erman )
