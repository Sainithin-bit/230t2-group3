 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's working group on sovereign wealth funds will meet in Singapore on July 9-10 to work out guidelines for government-managed funds, which have gained prominence due to large investments in Western banks.
   

 The following are state entities with estimated assets in excess of $100 billion: 1. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), United Arab Emirates website: www.adia.ae ASSETS: $500 billion to $1 trillion Established in 1976, ADIA's mission is to secure and maintain the future prosperity of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi. ADIA is the largest shareholder in two of UAE's largest banks, National Bank of Abu Dhabi and Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank. MANAGEMENT: UAE President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan chairs the fund. TRANSPARENCY: ADIA does not disclose its total assets and does not regularly disclose its investment activity. RECENT ACTIVITY: Sheikh Khalifa said in a June interview with Lebanon's al-Nahar newspaper that ADIA had less than $800 billion in overseas investments, contrary to many estimates.  The fund invested $7.5 billion in Citigroup ( C.N ) in November 2007. 2. Government Pension Fund - Global, Norway website: www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/fin/Selected-topics/The-Government-Pen sion-Fund.html ASSETS: $375 billion Formed in 1990, the Government Pension Fund - Global, previously called the Petroleum Fund, was set up to facilitate government savings necessary to meet public pension expenditures in coming years, and to support long-term management of petroleum revenues. MANAGEMENT: The operational management of the fund is carried out by Norges Bank, which invests the fund's capital in bonds and equities outside of Norway. TRANSPARENCY: The fund is the most transparent of the 20 biggest global sovereign wealth funds, according to Standard Chartered. It publishes its portfolio holdings annually. The fund typically holds stakes of less than 1 percent. RECENT ACTIVITY: The fund said in April there were plans to increase its limit on ownership stakes to 10 percent from 5 percent, expand the benchmark portfolio to include more emerging markets and include real estate as a separate asset class in its portfolio. 3. Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) website: www.sama.gov.sa ASSETS: $327 billion While not structured like a sovereign wealth fund, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA), which was set up in 1952, has substantial investments in public equity markets. JPMorgan said most of the SAMA's equity portfolio and part of its fixed-income assets are managed by external fund managers. MANAGEMENT: The board of directors comprises a governor, deputy governor and three representatives from the private sector. TRANSPARENCY: SAMA publishes monthly reports as well as an annual report that contain a breakdown of the balance sheet. RECENT ACTIVITY: Saudi Arabia said in May it is setting up a $5.33 billion investment firm that may be open to partners, distinguishing the fund from SWFs that are 100 percent held by the government. The proposed Saudi fund could initially focus investments in the technology sector.  4. Government of Singapore Investment Corp (GIC) website: www.gic.com.sg ASSETS: $100 billion to $330 billion (GIC says on its website that it manages well over $100 billion but some analysts estimate the figure is around $300 billion) In 1981, the Singapore government set up the GIC after it decided that the bulk of the country's foreign exchange reserves should be invested in longer-term and higher-yielding assets. MANAGEMENT: Lee Kuan Yew, former prime minister of Singapore, is chairman. His son Lee Hsien Loong, the current prime minister, is deputy chairman. The fund uses external investment professionals to handle about a quarter of its holdings. TRANSPARENCY: The fund does not make available financial statements but the elder Lee said in 2006 that the fund had earned an average return of 9.5 percent annually over the last 25 years in U.S. dollar terms. Lee Hsien Loong told Reuters in May GIC will not be as open as sister fund Temasek TEM.UL. RECENT ACTIVITY: In January, GIC invested $6.88 billion in Citigroup convertible preferred securities that, if converted, would give it about 4 percent stake in the U.S. bank. In December 2007, GIC bought 11 billion Swiss francs worth of convertible notes issued by UBS. GIC subsequently acquired more shares in UBS' 16 billion Swiss franc rights offering based on its 0.4 percent holding of UBS common stock. 5. Kuwait Investment Authority website: www.kia.gov.kw ASSETS: $264 billion as of March 2008 The Kuwait Investment Authority is an autonomous government body responsible for the management and administration of funds entrusted to it by Kuwait. It has its roots in the Kuwait Investment Board which was set up in 1953 in London, eight years before the country gained independence, with the goal of reducing the state's dependence on its depleting oil assets. MANAGEMENT: The managing director is Bader Al Sa'ad. TRANSPARENCY: KIA has to provide details on its managed assets to the government but is prohibited from sharing the information with the public. RECENT ACTIVITY: KIA said in June it might consider increasing its stakes in U.S. banks Merrill Lynch and Citigroup.
