 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) reported strong first-half growth in China, the world's No.2 car market that is seeing another boom year. 

 GM posted a 12.7 percent gain in first-half 2008 China sales while Ford sold 21 percent more vehicles over the same period. The higher sales in China comes as both automakers are struggling in North America where they are cutting jobs, closing factories and reducing production in response to a steep decline in U.S. vehicle sales. GM and Ford are increasingly relying on emerging markets such as China to offset losses in the United States as they restructure their operations to return to profitability. Auto sales in China, including trucks and buses, are expected to reach 10 million units this year. Most global automakers are adding production capacity to grab a bigger share of the Chinese market, currently dominated by GM and Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ). GM said it sold 590,126 vehicles in the January-to-June period. Its first-half sales increase, however, was at a slower pace than its 18.5 percent growth in 2007. Sales of GM's Chevrolet brand vehicles, made jointly with SAIC Motor Corp ( 600104.SS ), jumped 34.6 percent to 109,131 units while sales of its Buick brand vehicles totaled 146,321 units. GM sold 3,285 Cadillac vehicles during the first six months and its commercial vehicle venture in south China sold 349,871 vehicles, including 329,842 Wuling-brand vehicles. The U.S. automaker's main rival in China, Volkswagen AG ( VOWG.DE ), has yet to release its China sales figures. Smaller rival Ford, a relative newcomer to the Chinese market, said it sold 172,411 vehicles in the first half of this year. Sales of Ford brand passenger cars and commercial vehicles reached 103,698 units during the first six months, a 15-percent year-over-year increase, the company said in a statement. Jiangling Motors Corp, Ford Motor's commercial vehicle investment in China, sold 52,000 vehicles in the first half, a 14 percent increase over last year. Ford's passenger car joint venture, Changan Ford Mazda Automobile, increased its half yearly sales by 25 percent to 116,903 units, the automaker said. Ford raised car production capacity in China to over 410,000 units by opening a new $510 million manufacturing plant last September in the eastern city of Nanjing, near Shanghai, along with its China partners. In a statement, Robert Graziano, president and chief executive of Ford Motor China, said the automaker plans to launch its new global small car Fiesta in the country in the second half of this year. Ford currently sells European designed Mondeo sedan and its small Focus sedan in China.
