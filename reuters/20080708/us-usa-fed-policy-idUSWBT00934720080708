 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke is due to deliver the U.S. central bank's semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress on July 15, a Senate panel said on Tuesday. 

 Bernanke will testify before the Senate Banking committee at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT), the panel said on its website. The Fed chairman is expected to testify before the House of Representatives Financial Services committee the next day. His testimony comes as the U.S. economy is battered by declining home values, high oil prices, and tight credit. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
