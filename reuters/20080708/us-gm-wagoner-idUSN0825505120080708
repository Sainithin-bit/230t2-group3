 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) is working quickly to develop plans to cut costs and improve its cash position in the face of a slumping U.S. market, Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said in an e-mail to the automaker's managers. 

 The letter marked the first confirmation that GM was working toward the kind of program of additional restructuring and capital-raising that Wall Street analysts have said the embattled automaker urgently needs. "The rapid rise in fuel prices and change in auto industry sales mix have made market and economic conditions very challenging," Wagoner said in the e-mail. "We're responding quickly and aggressively." GM shares touched a 54-year low last week, and analysts have said the automaker needs to raise between $5 billion and $15 billion in order ride out a sharp downturn in U.S. sales. Wagoner said GM's North American management team was working out new plans to cut costs and shore up its liquidity. "Our ... team continues to develop further action plans to optimize our operating structure under these new market conditions, improve our cash and funding position, and keep our key product and technology investments on track," he said. GM shares traded up 16 cents or 1.6 percent to $10.40 in morning dealings. The stock has fallen 55 percent since early May, when evidence began to build of a further slowdown in U.S. auto sales that has hit pickup trucks and SUVs hardest. GM's U.S. sales have dropped almost 16 percent this year, compared with a drop of nearly 10 percent in industrywide U.S. auto sales. Wagoner's message was sent to managers on June 27 but did not widely circulate until this week because of the automaker's traditional break in operations around early July. Last week, Merrill Lynch analyst John Murphy warned that GM could need to raise as much as $15 billion in cash because of ongoing losses and cautioned that bankruptcy was "not impossible" for the top U.S. automaker. Other analysts have said they expect GM to raise between $5 billion and $10 billion through a combination of moves that could include new borrowing and steps to defer contributions to a United Auto Workers-run health care trust. In the e-mail, Wagoner encouraged GM employees to focus on ways to conserve cash. "As simple as it sounds, what helps most is for each of us to stay focused on our jobs, and especially on what each of us can do to conserve and generate cash," Wagoner said. "And just as important, I encourage you to be positive about the future of our enterprise." GM, like its Detroit-based rivals Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler LLC, relies on sales of light trucks, including pickups and SUVs, for the majority of its sales. The sharp decline in demand for those large vehicles caused by skyrocketing fuel prices and the corresponding surge in popularity of smaller passenger cars this year has hit Detroit's traditional Big Three automakers harder than Japanese rivals led by Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ). In his letter, Wagoner detailed steps GM has taken in recent weeks to shift away from the collapsing truck market. He said GM was moving forward with a new compact car for the Chevrolet brand that would be sold globally, as well as a replacement for the Chevy Aveo hatchback and a new, fuel-efficient engine system for the U.S. market. GM has also added shifts to plants in Ohio and Michigan building better-selling Chevy and Pontiac cars and has announced plans to stop production at four plants that build pickups and SUVs. In addition, Wagoner noted that GM's board has given a green light to production of the Chevy Volt series hybrid, designed to be powered by a lithium-ion battery pack for the first 40 miles of driving. GM designers are rushing to complete a production-version of the highly anticipated Volt by next month and the automaker is expected to show off the final version of the electric car in September at an event that corresponds with the 100th anniversary of GM's founding, people briefed on the plans told Reuters on Monday.
