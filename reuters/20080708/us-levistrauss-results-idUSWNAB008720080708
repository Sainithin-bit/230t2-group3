 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Jeans maker Levi Strauss & Co on Tuesday reported a huge drop in quarterly net profit, hurt by costs from the roll-out of its enterprise resource planning system and lower sales in the Americas region. 

 The private company, which discloses financial results due its publicly traded debt, said second-quarter net profit was $1 million compared with $46 million a year earlier. (Reporting by  Alexandria Sage , editing by Richard Chang)
