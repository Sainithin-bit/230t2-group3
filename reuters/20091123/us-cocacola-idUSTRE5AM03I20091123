 LONDON  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola ( KO.N ), the world's largest soft-drink maker, is planning to more than double its number of bottling plants in China within a decade, the Financial Times said. 

 Doug Jackson, president of Coca-Cola's China unit, said the company also planned to distribute more than six times as many Coke-branded coolers to retailers, bars and restaurants in China over the same period. "We are going to grow ahead of the rate of the industry," he told investors in Atlanta last week, the paper added. Last week, Coke unveiled goals that called for the revenue generated by the company and its bottlers to double to roughly $200 billion by 2020, with profit margins increasing.
