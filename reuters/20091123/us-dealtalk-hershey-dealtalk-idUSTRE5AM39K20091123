 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - British confectioner Cadbury Plc may feel more comfortable in the embrace of Hershey Co, but a slew of potential obstacles could make Hershey the lesser choice in the eyes Cadbury investors. 

 A serious effort by Hershey to surpass Kraft Food Inc's $16.8 billion hostile offer for Cadbury would require careful orchestration of financing, meeting the legal requirements of Hershey's controlling trust, and navigation of local Pennsylvania politics. Hershey is still weighing its options but has lined up funding commitments from Bank of America Corp and JP Morgan Chase & Co to make a solo offer for Cadbury, whose market capitalization is nearly twice that of Hershey. A bid would increase Hershey's debt load and change the risk profile of the 100-year-old company. Hershey had $1.5 billion in long-term debt and $3.1 billion in liabilities as of October 4. "They are not free to do whatever they want," said Edward Jones analyst Jack Russo. "They have a fairly levered balance sheet and they would be somewhat constrained by how much debt they can take on." The credit markets have eased somewhat and banks are more willing to lend, investment bankers said. Banks are willing to lend up to five times EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), versus more cautious lending in past months of only up to three times EBITDA. That gives Hershey some wiggle room since its debt was 2.15 times EBITDA the end of 2008, according to Morningstar analyst Erin Swanson. Analysts said Hershey could absorb $3 billion to $4 billion of deal-related debt before losing its investment-grade status with credit rating agencies. But it still will have a long way to go to fund a transaction. One factor in Hershey's favor is the affinity it shares with Cadbury. Both are family-built companies that have deep roots in their communities and a history of charitable involvement. Cadbury Chairman Roger Carr was quoted over the weekend as saying Hershey might be a better fit than Kraft, though offer value would trump all. "Culturally, Cadbury would get along better with the Hershey Trust than with anybody else," said John Briggs, a attorney with Axinn Veltrop and Harkrider LLP. Hershey and Hershey Trust officials did not respond to calls for comment. GOING IT ALONE? Hershey is weighing a solo bid of at least $17 billion for Cadbury, but is also in discussions with Italy's Ferrero about a joint effort that would ultimately break up the British confectionery group, sources familiar with the situation have told Reuters. "Acquiring Cadbury would be an impossible task for Hershey alone but might be more manageable in the context of other interested parties," said analyst Jeremy Batstone-Carr at brokers Charles Stanley. He said Nestle might be motivated to make a joint offer for Cadbury in part because Hershey holds the lucrative license to distribute Nestle's KitKat product in the United States. Nestle could reclaim that license in a deal with Hershey.

"This has turned into a kind of circus," said Edward Jones's Russo. "Patience is going to be required because this could stretch out for a long time. At the end of the day, though, the winners will be Cadbury shareholders." HERSHEY'S INTERNAL HURDLES The Hershey Trust, which owns about 80 percent of the voting shares at Hershey, is pushing Hershey Chief Executive David West to compete with Kraft's offer and structure a deal so that the trust remains in charge of Hershey, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. But it is not clear that the entire trust supports the move, nor is it guaranteed that they would succeed in mounting a bid even if all members were on board. In 2002, the trust pushed then Hershey CEO Richard Lenny to put Hershey up for sale, though it canceled the auction at the last minute amid pressure from the community of Hershey, Pennsylvania, including alumni of the boarding school Milton Hershey created in 1909. After terminating the sale process, an overhaul of the trust's board followed, and the trust has since said repeatedly that it cannot give up control of Hershey. The trust advised the Pennsylvania attorney general that it would not agree to a sale of its controlling interest in Hershey without court approval. The AG must be provided advance notice of any transaction that would result in the trust no longer having voting control of the company. The AG has broad authority "to intercede and petition the court ... to stop such a transaction if the attorney general can prove that the transaction is unnecessary for the future economic viability of the company and is inconsistent with investment and management considerations," according to Hershey's regulatory filings. Hershey Trust Chairman LeRoy Zimmerman, who also sits on the board of Hershey Co, was Pennsylvania's first elected attorney general and may be able to head off any conflict at the level of state politics if the trust decides to pursue a deal.
