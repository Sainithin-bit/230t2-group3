 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - Leading Indian outsourcers such as Tata Consultancy ( TCS.BO ), Infosys ( INFY.BO ) and Wipro ( WIPR.BO ) stand to gain contracts worth about $1 billion in the next one or two years as U.S. banks emerge from the troubled asset relief program, the Economic Times reported on Monday. 

 The newspaper said JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) that received approval to buy back government stake worth $68 billion earlier this year are among the firms seeking operational efficiencies by outsourcing non-core IT and back-office projects to India. American Express ( AXP.N ), Bank of New York Mellon ( BK.N ) and Capital One, which have started repaying government debt, were also considering outsourcing, it said.
