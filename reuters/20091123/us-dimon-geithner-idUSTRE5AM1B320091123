 (Reuters) - Several U.S. policy makers consider JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon as a potential successor to U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, the New York Post said, citing sources. 

 Dimon "would love to serve his country," the paper quoted people familiar with his thinking as saying. JPMorgan could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. Geithner endured a grilling last week before the U.S. Congress over his role in the rescue of American International Group Inc in 2008, when he was president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank.
