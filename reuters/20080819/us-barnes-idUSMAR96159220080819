 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ), the largest U.S. specialty bookseller, said on Tuesday the chief executive of its online business resigned. 

 Barnes & Noble said Marie J. Toulantis's duties have been assumed by E-Commerce vice president Tom Burke and Kevin Frain, its chief financial officer. The bookseller said Toulantis will remain with the company as a consultant. Barnes & Noble said earlier this year it was looking into a potential acquisition of Borders, its rival and second-largest U.S. specialty bookseller, but last week published reports said that was unlikely.
