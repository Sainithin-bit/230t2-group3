 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Staples Inc ( SPLS.O ) said on Tuesday it would report quarterly results below Wall Street expectations and cut its full-year outlook, sending shares down as much as 10 percent. 

 The world's largest office products retailer cited weak sales in North America and Europe, stoking investor pessimism about smaller rivals Office Depot Inc ( ODP.N ) and OfficeMax Inc OMX.N, shares of which also fell. Staples also forecast savings from its $2.65 billion purchase of Dutch peer Corporate Express that were lighter than some analysts had expected. Sales of office supplies have suffered as small-business customers cut back spending due to a weakened U.S. economy, the credit crisis, higher commodity costs and the decline in housing values. "Obviously, we are seeing slower results in some of the areas more hard hit by the mortgage crisis," Staples Chief Executive Ron Sargent said on a call. "But there's not a wide, hard difference. When you're reporting minus seven comps (comparable-store sales down 7 percent), I'd argue that it's all bad," he said. Staples said the Corporate Express acquisition in July would yield about $200 million to $300 million in annual cost savings over three years. Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan called the forecast conservative, saying Staples was likely aiming "to drive upside to expectations over time." Excluding results from Corporate Express, which expands Staples' geographic footprint further in Europe and into new markets such as Australia and New Zealand, earnings per share for the second quarter ended August 2 fell about 15 percent, Staples said. Sales rose about 3 percent, while sales at its North American retail stores fell 1 percent. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, fell 7 percent, which the company said was "weaker than anticipated." In Europe, same-store sales fell 7 percent. Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said Staples will now likely report second-quarter earnings of roughly 21 cents per share in its report on September 3. Analysts on average have expected 25 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Staples shares were down $1.04, or 4.2 percent at $23.54 in late trading on the Nasdaq after falling as low as $22.05. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Office Depot were down 5.7 percent at $6.41 while OfficeMax shares were down 4.5 percent at $13.59. LOWER FORECAST For the full year, Staples forecast low-single-digit sales growth and earnings per share flat with last year's adjusted earnings of $1.42 per share, excluding the Corporate Express acquisition and other items. In May, the company had stood by its prior outlook, which called for mid-single-digit sales growth and high-single-digit earnings per share growth for the full year. Staples expects the Corporate Express deal to add to earnings "slightly" this year and "more meaningfully" next year. That should increase in the following year, it said. Sargent would not say how many jobs would be cut in integrating the two organizations, saying Staples would give more details on October 1. Integration efforts will focus first on the U.S., followed by Canada and Europe. Sargent said September is the most important month of the U.S. back-to-school season, so it is too early to say how many students, or their parents, are buying supplies at Staples. Staples also forecast integration and restructuring costs of $30 million to $40 million in the back half of this fiscal year and $50 million to $70 million next year. Even though Staples shares fell on Tuesday, Credit Suisse's Balter said it should do well in the mid-term, as cost savings from the acquisition should insulate growth. "Longer term, we like where Staples is positioned. They are the clear global leader in office supplies," Balter wrote in a research note. The company said the biggest growth in the next five years should come from North America. Growth in the following five years should come from Europe, Sargent said, with Asia being the major growth area for the five years after that. "We've got it teed up for the next 15 years," he said. "After that, we'll let the next guy figure it out." (Additional reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and  Daniel Trotta )
