 (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Chrysler LLC has filed a lawsuit 
in a Michigan court alleging supplier Johnson Controls Inc. 
( JCI.N ) charged inflated prices for batteries, and is seeking 
more than $15 million in damages, the Wall Street Journal 
reported on Tuesday. 

  In a lawsuit filed on Aug 14, Chrysler alleged Johnson 
Controls had charged Chrysler for more lead than it actually 
put into batteries, the report said.  Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S.-based automaker, alleged JCI's 
actions were "systematic and deliberate." JCI, one of the 
largest U.S. auto parts makers, could not immediately be 
reached for comment.  Chrysler, controlled by private equity firm Cerberus 
Capital Management LP CBS.UL, is cutting costs as it and 
other vehicle makers face a sharp decline in big vehicle and 
truck sales in the United States amid higher fuel prices.  Its new purchasing chief, John Campi, has advocated having 
more parts made in India and other countries where costs are 
lower.  At one point, Chrysler looked into buying batteries from 
India instead of JCI, the report said, citing people familiar 
with the matter.  Chrysler was not immediately available for comments.  Earlier this month, auto parts maker Dana had sued Chrysler 
in an attempt to strike a "market-competitive agreement" and 
was prepared to stop supplying the automaker next year.  (Reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore; Editing
