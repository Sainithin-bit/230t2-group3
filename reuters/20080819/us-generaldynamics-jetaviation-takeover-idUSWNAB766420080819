 (Reuters) - General Dynamics ( GD.N ) said it agreed to acquire Zurich-based Jet Aviation, a privately held provider of business aviation services, for about $2.25 billion in cash. 

 The U.S. defense contractor said the deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2008, would immediately add to its earnings. (Reporting by Saumyadeb Chakrabarty in Bangalore; Editing by David Cowell)
