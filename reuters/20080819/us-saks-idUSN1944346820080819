 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Saks Inc SKS.N posted a wider-than-expected quarterly loss and forecast weak sales through the end of the year, as an anemic economy has prompted even its well-heeled shoppers to curb spending, sending shares down 11 percent. 

 The company said on Tuesday it expects same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, which is a key metric of retail health, to be flat or down at a low-single-digit percentage rate in the second half of the fiscal year -- a period that includes the crucial U.S. holiday shopping season. "We know the near term will be difficult, and that we will continue to face challenges," Chief Executive Stephen Sadove said during a call with analysts. Saks' caution is a fresh indicator that spending worries have spilled over into the luxury sector, where shoppers are often less affected by higher costs for necessities like food and fuel or by the current housing downturn. The New York-based company said its net loss widened to $31.7 million or 23 cents per share, in the second quarter ended August 2 from $24.6 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding some asset impairment and severance costs, the loss was 22 cents per share, 3 cents larger than the analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. The operator of Saks Fifth Avenue stores said quarterly sales fell to $669.2 million from $694.1 million. Saks previously reported that same-store sales for July fell a greater-than-expected 5.3 percent, with quarterly sales down 4 percent. Same-store sales would have been slightly higher without the effect of a spring sale that it moved into the first quarter of this year from the second quarter in the previous year, Sadove said. The company said it had experienced softening across nearly all regions and merchandise categories. For the fall, its lineup centers around romantic blouses, tailored dresses, boots, and big bold necklaces for women, as well as boots made to measure for men. Shares of Saks were down $1.21, or 10.8 percent, at $10.01 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade. (Editing by Dave Zimmerman and Gerald E. McCormick)
