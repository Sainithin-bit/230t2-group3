 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Clorox Co ( CLX.N ), the maker of household cleaning products, is close to selling its auto-care business to private equity firm Avista Capital Partners for up to $800 million, Bloomberg reported on Monday. 

 Clorox said in May that it was exploring options for selling the auto-care brands STP and Armor All, and a deal could help it fund acquisitions in other categories, analysts said. Shares in the company rose 1.5 percent Monday morning. Clorox spokeswoman Kathryn Caulfield declined to comment on the report and said Clorox would make an announcement "if and when we reach an agreement" to sell the brands. Spokespeople for Avista and JP Morgan Chase, which is handling Clorox's sale of the brands, declined to comment. The report cited two people with knowledge of the matter and said the sale might be announced in the coming days. The deal is not finalized and may be delayed or fall through in the final stages, the report said. Clorox's auto-care brands do not fit the company's focus on sustainability, health and wellness, where it would likely look next for new acquisitions, Jefferies & Co analyst Douglas Lane said. "They've had a lot of innovation with most of their other brands," Lane said. "STP and Armor All stood out by their lack of innovation." Lane said that while STP and Armor All do not fit Clorox's portfolio, they are market-share leaders and are highly profitable. Shares in Clorox were at $67.61, up 1.4 percent, in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
