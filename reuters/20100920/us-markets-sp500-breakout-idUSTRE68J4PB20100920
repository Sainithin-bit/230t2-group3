 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Monday's rally has pushed the Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  to finish at 1,142.71, above a key resistance level at 1,130, but risks abound, so investors need to be cautious before calling this a breakout. 

 * The biggest obstacle to calling a breakout is the moderate volume that accompanied the move. Combined volume on the NYSE, the Amex and the Nasdaq amounted to 7.28 billion shares, far below last year's daily average of 9.65 billion. Volume will need to pick up to cement the market's gains. * Trading volume on the way up is seen more important than the way down. Volume in the September stocks rally has generally been subdued, apart from two days at the beginning of the rally when it was over 8 billion. Since the start of the month the S&P 500 has rallied nearly 9 percent. * The 20-day moving average of the S&P 500's daily volume shows a slow decline since late May, just above 3.28 billion shares, according to Reuters data. The S&P 500's average daily volume this year is around 4.09 billion shares. * The S&P 500 chart formed an inverse "head and shoulders," a technical pattern that can be a strong indication of a trend reversal. The formation's "neckline" was around 1,130. It has been forming since late May. In technical analysis the longer the formation, the stronger it is, and therefore the more convincing the break-through. * The S&P 500 closed approximately 1.3 percent above the resistance level at 1,130. One factor analysts look at to support the idea of a reversal in the trend is for stocks to move past the resistance level by at least 1 percent. Monday's rally satisfies that condition. * Additional confirmation of the move will come on Tuesday if the S&P 500 can hold above 1,130 for a second day running. If the index fails to hold, then the breakout thesis could start to look weak. * The moving average convergence-divergence (MACD), an indicator of short-term momentum, still points to the market being a buy, and momentum remains on an uptrend. The MACD started to show a buy signal on September 2, and the signal strengthened a week later. * The S&P 500's daily relative momentum index is at 67.4, near the 70 line that would indicate an overbought level. The slow stochastics, another measure of strength, also points to near overbought levels. * The average forecast of analysts in a recent Reuters poll is for S&P 500 to close the year at 1,220. Whether it reaches that target will largely depend on continued signs the economy is not heading for a double-dip. * Investors are uncertain about the outcome of the midterm election in early November, when Republicans are expected to make significant ground in Congress. With lack of clarity about tax cuts and spending programs, some analysts say stocks are unlikely to move dramatically before the vote.
