 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GMAC Mortgage, a unit of Ally Financial Inc, told brokers and agents to stop evicting homeowners in 23 states, Bloomberg reported on Monday. 

 GMAC Mortgage may need to "take corrective action" regarding some of its foreclosures, Bloomberg said, quoting from a two-page GMAC mortgage memo. A spokeswoman for Ally Financial was not immediately available for comment. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
