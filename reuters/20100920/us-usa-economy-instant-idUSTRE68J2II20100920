 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Homebuilder sentiment unexpectedly held steady in September, according to a survey on Monday that pointed to a still-weak housing market. 

 KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Home Builders said their housing market index remained stuck at 13 in September. Its index of prospective home buyers fell to 9, its lowest level since March 2009, pointing to continued weakness in housing. * A reading above 50 indicates that more builders view sales conditions as good than poor. The index has not been above 50 since April 2006. * The NAHB survey showed the current sales conditions gauge for single-family home sales remained unchanged at 13 after August was revised a point lower, which was the lowest level since April 2009. The sales expectations measure for the next six months remained unchanged at 18. COMMENTS: TOM PORCELLI, U.S. ECONOMIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK "If you look at--we basically just did the calculation for the NAHB--and if you look at the index to the second decimal it was 12.59. Previous month it was 12.86. You actually did get a modest pullback in this index. We're at the lower end of the range that's been in place since 2009. Builders are lacking confidence. The internals in the report are mostly unchanged except for prospective buyer traffic. "At the end of the day, we don't get anything new with this report." SEAN SIMKO, FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT COMPANY SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "Sentiment remains negative within the housing sector. You have a weak labor market and increased foreclosures and those factors combined make for a negative tone. The housing market will recover slowly. "Treasuries remain focused on tomorrow's Fed decision and rhetoric within the statement. MICHELLE MEYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BOFA MERRILL LYNCH GLOBAL RESEARCH, NEW YORK: "With the prospective buyer component, home builders are still seeing weak demand. Housing demand has deteriorated even more than the expected payback from the tax incentive program earlier this year. "We are looking for housing starts to fall 3 percent. That is consistent with what we are seeing with home builders who are worried about the state of the economy and the housing market. They are also disappointed over the pace of the foreclosure programs to take distress properties off the market." CLIFF DRAUGHN, PRESIDENT & CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, EXCELSIA INVESTMENT ADVISORS, SAVANNAH, GEORGIA "It was a little less than expected, but that's not surprising. You'd hope to get some recovery in housing, but that's not going to happen soon. The whole bubble began with real estate and it remains the big issue for the economy. You have way too much surplus and not enough people who qualify for loans, meaning housing numbers will remain weak for a while." KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR OF CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT, NEW YORK: "The housing market data basically continues (to be) weak. The market was looking for an uptick but the fact NAHB held stationary at the weakest level since March 2009 tells us that the rest of the data we have this week will probably remain soft. The housing market is one of the most troubling aspects of the U.S. economy and one of the main reasons why the Federal Reserve is considering additional quantitative easing."
