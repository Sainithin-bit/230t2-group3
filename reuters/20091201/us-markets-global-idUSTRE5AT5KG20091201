 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks surged and crude rose on Tuesday on upbeat economic news from around the world and as fears eased that Dubai's debt woes could rekindle a credit crisis and choke improving economies. 

 European stocks posted their biggest single-day gains since July 15, while U.S. stocks jumped as data reassured investors about the health of the battered U.S. housing market, considered a big drag on a long-term recovery. Gold hit record highs above $1,200 an ounce and copper rose to a 14-month high as China's positive data, a weaker U.S. dollar and easing fears of default contagion from Dubai overshadowed a mixed batch of U.S. economic data. Crude oil climbed toward $79 a barrel, lifted by the weaker dollar and news that China is ending the year on a strong note, laying the foundations for solid expansion in 2010. The euro zone's manufacturing sector grew in November for the second straight month, at a faster rate than expected, and car sales data for the month suggested a strong year end in major European markets. While questions remain about the staying power of an incipient recovery, the U.S. manufacturing sector grew for the fourth straight month in November, albeit at a slower pace. Investors' nerves were soothed by Dubai World's plans to restructure about $26 billion in debt, signaling the emirate's debt problems can be contained. "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger in this environment," said David Kelly, chief market strategist at JPMorgan Funds Management Inc in New York. "The probable is the economy recovers and is going to push stocks higher." The economic data and easing worries about Dubai boosted risk appetite and the share price of banks and commodity stocks. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares rose 2.6 percent to close at 1,011.06 points, while the FTSE 100  .FTSE  closed up 2.3 percent at 5,312.17. Banks led the rally, having been hit in recent days by worries over exposure to Dubai. James Hughes, market analyst at CMC Markets, said unease over Dubai "may well be winding down" but added, "Caution will remain as the potential for more surprises still remains." In New York at 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 124.09 points, or 1.20 percent, at 10,468.93. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 13.18 points, or 1.20 percent, at 1,108.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 32.59 points, or 1.52 percent, at 2,177.19. Business surveys in China showed that the world's second-largest energy consumer has largely recovered from the global economic downturn, giving crude oil a boost. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.43 to $78.71 a barrel. The rally in gold was propelled by a weaker dollar, with COMEX February gold rising as high as $1,204 an ounce, a record. Spot gold rose $18.55 to $1197.00 an ounce. The dollar slid after an interest rate hike in Australia and the yen weakened broadly after the Bank of Japan announced more monetary policy easing. The U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.67 percent at 74.378. The euro was up 0.58 percent at $1.5094, and against the yen, the dollar was up 0.30 percent at 86.60. In Europe, shorter-dated euro zone government bond prices pushed higher, gaining support after the Bank of Japan said it would pump more cash into the banking system and from year-end flows. U.S. government bond prices fell, pulling benchmark yields up from recent eight-week lows. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 12/32 in price to yield 3.24 percent. The MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks traded outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.9 percent, and the Nikkei  .N225  rallied 2.4 percent on hopes for more growth boosting measures.
