 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan's decision to push down money market rates in a new operation disappointed many investors and may drive the yen back near a 14-year high. 

 The move is seen as a token one to deflect government criticism and one that will have little economic impact. * The BOJ's emergency meeting had stoked speculation the central bank, under severe pressure from the government, may take more aggressive measures ranging from bigger purchases of government bonds to reimplementing a quantitative easing policy of flooding banks with cash. * The yen was at risk of climbing back toward a 14-year peak against the dollar of 84.82 yen struck on Monday as the move was not seen as one signaling that the BOJ was acting with the government in a stronger way to stem the currency's rise. The yen was trading at 86.94 per dollar after the BOJ news. * The BOJ's statement referred to FX volatility high up in its post-meeting statement, suggesting that the central bank was looking at the yen with this move. * But market players doubted that the operation would have much direct impact on the currency, whose gains have been concentrated against a sliding dollar. * The BOJ has already been less aggressive than the Federal Reserve and European Central Bank in using its balance sheet to help financial markets and the economy even as it has slipped into its worst bout of deflation on record, which is what the government has seized on in its calls for action.
