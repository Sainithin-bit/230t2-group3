 DUBAI  (Reuters) - Dubai's financial problems could affect the balance of power in the seven-member United Arab Emirates, where any aid to the debt-laden emirate from richer neighbor Abu Dhabi may come only at a political price. 

 Abu Dhabi, capital of the seven-emirate UAE, and Dubai have dominated the Gulf Arab state since its independence in 1971. Here are some facts about how the OPEC member is governed: * The UAE is a federation that unites Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al-Quwain, Ras al-Khaimah and Fujairah. * Its highest authority is the Supreme Council, which is made up of the seven emirates' rulers. Under the constitution, each ruler holds one vote, but decisions on "substantive" issues require the support of both Dubai and Abu Dhabi -- effectively giving each of them veto power over council decisions. * The council usually elects the ruler of Abu Dhabi as UAE president, now Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan. He usually appoints the ruler of Dubai as prime minister. Dubai's Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum now holds this post. He is also vice president of the federation. * Dubai and Abu Dhabi each have eight seats on the Federal National Council (FNC), which advises the country's rulers and has limited legislative powers. Sharjah and Ras al-Khaimah both have six. Ajman, Umm al-Quwain and Fujairah each hold four. * Each emirate has its own ruling family and local government. The relationship between federal and local authorities is somewhat murky and, according to the UAE government website, "continues to evolve." Each emirate pays in a specified proportion of its revenue to the federal budget. Abu Dhabi, which holds more than 90 percent of the UAE's oil wealth, is the biggest contributor, followed by Dubai, where trade, property and financial services drive the economy. Dubai also has major trade links with Iran. * The UAE is a strong U.S. ally. It tolerates little political opposition. The government anyway enjoys widespread public support due to its generous welfare policies. (Compiled by Raissa Kasolowsky, editing by Alistair Lyon)
