 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said a new funding operation the central bank announced on Tuesday could be considered quantitative easing in a broad sense. 

 The BOJ said it would pump more cash into the banking system which it called in the face of political pressure to help fight deflation and avert recession before upper house polls next year. ************************************************************* KEY POINTS: -- The BOJ said it would introduce a new operation to provide funds for three months at a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent -- It kept its benchmark interest rate at 0.1 percent. COMMENTARY: TAKAHIDE KIUCHI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, TOKYO "I'm a bit puzzled as to why Shirakawa described today's move as quantitative easing. The BOJ is clearly aiming to push down longer-term rates in the money market, not at flooding markets with liquidity. It's not targeting commercial banks' deposits at the BOJ, so supplying funds with the new operation might mean fund-supply through other means may decrease. "Shirakawa defining this as quantitative easing may be the BOJ's way of appealing to the government and the market that it is doing something significant. But today's step is clearly not what many people would see as quantitative easing. I think markets wanted something much bigger. "Today's step, first of all, is not unconventional. There's nothing special about it. It's in fact an extension of traditional monetary easing." TOMOHIKO KATSU, DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER OF CAPITAL MARKETS, SHINSEI BANK "The term 'broad sense' is key. It is saying that depending on how things turn out from here, it could lead to quantitative easing, or in other words, that the BOJ's debt could grow. But the BOJ's debts won't grow if there is no demands for the operations, so we can't quite tell what will happen until things actually take place. We cannot say that they are actively conducting quantitative easing. "The government and the BOJ are both... searching for the best way to do things based on their own logic. This time, they just happened to share the view that Japanese firms would face a difficult earnings environment toward the end of the year into next year due to the yen surge." KAZUTO UCHIDA, MANAGER OF RESEARCH, BANK OF TOKYO-MITSUBISHI UFJ "I think today's action was meant to curb the yen's strength as well as help corporate finance toward the end of the year. "There has been talk that the yen is strengthening because the three-month yen LIBOR rate has become higher than the three-month dollar LIBOR. The BOJ is aiming to end that. Also as three-month LIBOR is often used as a benchmark for banks' lending, lowering it would help companies. "I think today's measures are helping to bring down long-term interest rates even up to 10-year government bond yields." "Still the effect of this may not be long-lasting. If the yen strengthens further, then the next step Japan will need to take will be currency intervention and more buying by the BOJ of government bills." RICHARD JERRAM, CHIEF JAPAN ECONOMIST, MACQUARIE SECURITIES, TOKYO "The whole thing seems fairly pointless to me and I can't understand why they needed to have a meeting or how the marginal steps they've announced are going to make very much difference to anything. "The country's in deflation with no apparent means of getting out of it, so there is a need to do something. But I don't think providing 10 trillion yen of liquidity when you have underlying deflation of minus 1 percent is really going to help. It might be they are trying to show the markets that Dubai problems aren't going to become disruptive domestically, but I don't think anyone's particularly worried about that. "If you put in a largely meaningless policy change, you can't expect that in itself to have a particularly big impact on the yen. "The idea that the BOJ appears to be reacting to political pressure does have an exchange rate implication because this isn't the end of the story. There are going to be more periods of government pressure and more periods of BOJ response. So I think in the sense of a political shift there is an implied currency effect. But that's different from any effect from potential yen liquidity provision." TETSUYA MIURA, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES "It appears the BOJ has done all it can within its powers at this stage, it was not about to pump money into the markets. The new operation it introduced will continue even after its special corporate support measures end as scheduled. "Expectations within the JGB market for quantitative easing will likely persist, although the BOJ may not meet such expectations as the government will become busy compiling extra stimulus plans. The new operations the BOJ introduced in the meantime will likely help ease funding strains toward the year's end. It may also nudge yen LIBOR down, which may cool the strong yen." NORIHIRO TSURUTA, CHIEF STRATEGIST, SHINKO RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO "I would go along with the BOJ's view that this is a form of quantitative easing. But 10 trillion yen doesn't seem that much. "This will do something to bring yen Libor below dollar Libor. They're trying to slow the yen's rise, but I can't expect investment flows to change due to these changes in short-term rates. Long-term rates may not fall as that part of the curve will price in worries about fiscal discipline."
