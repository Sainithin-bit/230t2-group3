 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) chief executive is concerned that record oil prices are crimping U.S. airlines' growth but thinks the plane maker's fuel-efficient aircraft will still be in demand in the years ahead. 

 Boeing CEO Jim McNerney's comments Wednesday at the company's webcast annual investor conference, came hours after AMR Corp's AMR.N American Airlines announced it would slash domestic capacity up to 12 percent, due to soaring fuel prices. "Obviously it's a point of concern, but not unexpected," said McNerney, when asked about American's move. "This is one of the reasons we have driven our marketing efforts internationally." Boeing, like rival Airbus, keeps a close watch on airlines' capacity plans as they give the clearest indication of air travel demand, and ultimately the need for new planes. American is Boeing's biggest customer historically, ordering 1,022 planes from the company over the past 50 years. But it has not ordered a new Boeing plane this decade, according to Boeing's online order book. The world's largest airline, which had to ground its fleet of MD-80s last month for maintenance reasons, is expected to begin replacing its aging fleet soon. Most U.S. carriers have put off big orders as they shore up their finances from the downturn in air travel after the attacks of September 11, 2001. "Cleary the U.S. carriers are going to constrain capacity, particularly in the context of mergers," said McNerney. "What you need to be able to market in that environment are replacement planes, not only growth planes." NOT BETTING ON BIG U.S. ORDERS McNerney touted Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner, promising 20 percent fuel savings over older models, as a good replacement plane for airlines. He said there was also a market for 1,000 replacement single-aisle planes in the U.S. market, from airlines like American and Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N, giving Boeing an opportunity to sell the latest models of its 737 family. The global explosion in plane orders over the past three years has been led by Asian and Middle Eastern carriers, for the most part. Boeing is not banking on a glut of orders from U.S. carriers any time soon, McNerney said. "We're not anticipating a turnaround in ordering out of U.S. carriers. It represents upside if they can get through this," he said, referring to high oil prices and the economic slowdown. Boeing's commercial plane executives said the 787, which is about 15 months behind schedule, was a little overweight but on target to hit the latest schedule announced last month. It said no customers had canceled orders because of the delays. The company announced the third major delay to the program in April, due to problems with unfinished work from suppliers. It expects the first test flight in the fourth quarter of this year and first delivery in the third quarter of 2009. The original schedule called for the first delivery this month. STANDS BY DEFENSE Despite a string of recent contract losses, McNerney stood behind the company's defense unit, and said having both commercial and military units gave Boeing the "best of both worlds." Boeing's defense unit, led by James Albaugh, has lost four big Pentagon contracts this year, most notably a potential $35 billion U.S. Air Force refueling tanker program, to Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ). "Despite what some of you have read, the demise of the defense business is not imminent," said Albaugh, at the investor presentation. Last week Boeing lost a battle with Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) for a $3.6 billion contract to build a new generation of global positioning satellites known as GPS III. Because of that, Boeing said on Wednesday it plans to lay off about 750 employees, mostly engineers, in southern California in its satellite assembly and integration business. Boeing shares were down 4.7 percent at $81.12 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Jim Wolf  in Washington; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
