 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Maurice "Hank" Greenberg, former chief executive of American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), may face civil charges for his alleged role to improperly boost the insurer's financials, a spokesman for Greenberg said on Wednesday. 

 Greenberg received a "Wells notice" from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday, indicating possible charges over his role in reinsurance transactions between AIG and Berkshire Hathaway's ( BRKa.N ) ( BRKb.N ) General Re Corp unit. A Wells notice indicates that the SEC is considering civil charges, and gives the recipient a chance to mount a defense. "We remain confident of our position on the merits, and we believe that none of the remaining issues are material to AIG's financial statements," Robert Morvillo, Greenberg's lawyer, said in an e-mailed statement. An SEC spokesman also did not immediately return a call seeking comment. On Friday, U.S. District Judge Christopher Droney, who oversaw a trial that led to convictions of former AIG and General Re executives accused of helping AIG inflate reserves, said there was sufficient evidence to show a conspiracy started with a phone call from Greenberg. The fraud accusations stem from a 2000 transaction in which AIG and General Re executives attempted to boost AIG's loss reserves to make the world's largest insurer look better to investors. A former AIG executive and four former General Re executives, including Chief Executive Ronald Ferguson, were accused of conspiring to inflate AIG'S loss reserves by $500 million through fraudulent reinsurance transactions. Greenberg was ousted as AIG's chairman and chief executive in 2005 amid an investigation into alleged financial misconduct. Earlier this month, AIG posted a $7.8 billion quarterly loss, its largest ever, after writing down assets linked to subprime mortgages. AIG shares were down 12 cents at $38 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. (Reporting by Neha Singh in Bangalore and  Lilla Zuill  in New York; Editing by Sue Thomas and Maureen Bavdek)
