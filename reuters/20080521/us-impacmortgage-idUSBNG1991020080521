 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Impac Mortgage Holdings Inc IMH.N said it lost $2.05 billion in 2007 and more losses could threaten the struggling lender's survival, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was inquiring into its operations. 

 The loss totaled $27.10 per share and compared with a loss of $75.3 million, or $1.18 per share, in 2006, Impac said late Tuesday. Impac lost $1.65 billion from continuing operations in 2007, compared with an $8 million profit a year earlier. Impac said its taxable loss available to common shareholders was $136 million, or $1.79 per share. Impac is a real estate investment trust that once specialized in "Alt-A" mortgages, which often go to people who cannot document income or assets. The Irvine, California-based company set aside $1.39 billion for credit losses, up from $34.6 million a year earlier, and said capital markets remain illiquid and effectively closed to it. About one in seven loans on its books were at least 60 days delinquent as of year's end, Impac said. In its delayed annual report filed Wednesday with the SEC, Impac said residential mortgage problems "may cause us to recognize additional losses, which would further adversely affect our operating results, liquidity, financial condition, business prospects and ability to continue as a going concern." Impac said its liabilities exceeded assets as it ended 2007 with negative $1.08 billion of shareholder equity. The company also said it has in 2008 provided information to the SEC in response to the agency's informal requests into its business operations, related accounting policies and methodology. Impac and the SEC did not immediately return calls seeking further comment. The company's troubles increased as housing prices fell, delinquencies mounted even on mortgages once thought to be safe, and many investors stopped buying all but the safest home loans. Last September, Impac quit substantially all mortgage lending. Mortgage originations and acquisitions fell 64 percent last year to $4.5 billion from $12.6 billion, it said. Impac has been slashing costs to account for lower cash flows, and said it was in talks to convert a $318.7 million obligation into a note. It said it ended March with 137 employees, down 83 percent from 827 at year's end. More than 100 U.S. mortgage lenders have been sold, quit lending, or have gone bankrupt since the end of 2006. Impac shares closed Tuesday at $1.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. They traded as high as $9.11 last year and $11.74 in 2006, Reuters data show.
