 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL is among the suitors for a Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) division that provides military training services and is being marketed for around $500 million, people familiar with the matter said. 

 Cerberus, which took defense contractor DynCorp private for $1 billion in April, is interested in Lockheed Martin's Pacific Architects and Engineers division because of the potential synergies between the military services firms, the people said. As prime contractors like Lockheed Martin retool their portfolios to focus more on high-end intelligence and divest less-sensitive service work, engineering and construction firms such as KBR and URS have emerged as leading candidates to bid for assets like PAE, analysts and bankers have said. PAE, which the top U.S. defense contractor put up for sale in June nearly four years after its 2006 purchase, has also drawn interest from U.S. engineering and construction companies, including KBR ( KBR.N ), Jacobs Engineering ( JEC.N ), Fluor Corp ( FLR.N ) and URS Corp ( URS.N ), the sources said. Lockheed is also in the process of selling another of its divisions, Enterprise Integration Group (EIG), for about $1 billion and has attracted interest from several private equity firms, Reuters reported previously. Lockheed Martin, which hired Evercore Partners Inc ( EVR.N ) to run the PAE auction, is planning management meetings with the interested parties this week and wants to reach a deal by the end of this year, the people said. They asked not to be identified because details of the auction are not public. Representatives for Cerberus, Lockheed Martin, Evercore, KBR and URS declined to comment. Fluor and Jacobs Engineering were not available for comment. The PAE division provides services for the military, peacekeeping missions, personnel recruitment and training and disaster relief efforts. It operates facilities and provides base operations support services for the U.S. Defense and U.S. State departments among others. The company also supplies logistics, airfield and air terminal management services for the Air Force, Navy and the United Nations. Falls Church, Virginia-based DynCorp, owned by Cerberus, offers security services in war zones and has held contracts to train civilian police in Iraq and Afghanistan and support U.S. troops there. The PAE unit is going for about seven to eight times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, the sources said. DEFENSE M&A HEATING UP Meanwhile, Lockheed Martin's EIG auction is in the advanced stage and the company could reach a deal by the end of October, people familiar with the matter said. Several defense advisory firms backed by private equity firms have expressed interest in the unit, including TASC, backed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts ( KKR.N ) and General Atlantic LLC; Carlyle's CYL.UL Booz Allen; and Leonard Green & Partners' Scitor, the sources said. All declined to comment. The sale of EIG, which advises government agencies on military platforms, was prompted by a tightening of Pentagon rules aimed at removing potential organizational conflicts of interest. Many contractors have advised the government on the platforms they end up bidding for. Private equity firms are the most likely buyer for EIG because other defense platform providers would run into the same conflict, the sources said. Lockheed Martin does not break down results for EIG, but the $1 billion price tag would represent more than 15 times the unit's EBITDA of $65 million, the sources said. Lockheed has forecast 15 percent to 20 percent annual growth in EIG's EBITDA and has told the potential bidders of a $150 million backlog likely to be awarded in the near future, the sources said. JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) and Stone Key Partners are running the EIG auction, sources told Reuters previously. Private equity firms are also active in selling their portfolio companies or taking them public. New York-based JLL Partners sold McKechnie Aerospace to TransDigm Group Inc ( TDG.N ) for $1.27 billion. The deal price was about 12-to-13 times McKechnie's EBITDA. Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) and UBS ( UBSN.VX ) advised TransDigm, while Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) advised JLL Partners. (Reporting by Soyoung Kim.
