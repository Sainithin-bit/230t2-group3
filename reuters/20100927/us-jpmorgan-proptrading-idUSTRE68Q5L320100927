 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co ( JPM.N ) is starting a new alternatives unit in its asset management business, formed from traders who are no longer allowed to trade for the bank's own account under new U.S. rules, according to a company memo. 

 The fate of the JPMorgan traders and their peers at Wall Street rivals has been up in the air as the banks scramble to come to terms with the so-called Volcker rule restricting banks from betting with their own money, among a swathe of other regulatory changes. A person familiar with JPMorgan's changes said about 45 traders will move from its investment bank to a new unit within its asset management business. "We are confident that clients will benefit from their investment experience and insight," wrote investment bank and asset management heads Jes Staley and Mary Erdoes in the memo to employees. Mike Stewart, co-head of the investment bank's global emerging markets business, will run the new business, according to the memo. Stewart will work with Larry Unrein, head of private equity and hedge funds within asset management, in establishing the business, the memo said. JPMorgan expects to complete the transition over several years, according to the memo. JPMorgan confirmed the contents of the memo, which was obtained by Reuters. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had said earlier this month the bank would remove some traders from its investment bank unit because of regulatory changes. Dimon has complained about the scattershot nature of U.S. financial reform, which he says is making banking businesses more complicated rather than improving the financial system. JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, also expects revenues to be hurt by new rules that limit the charges it can apply to credit card and current account customers. JPMorgan shares are down 6 percent this year, while the KBW Banks Index .BKX is up almost 8 percent since the start of the year. UNCERTAIN PROSPECTS The prospects for similar groups of traders at Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) and other banks are uncertain and there have been reports that traders from these groups might leave for other companies. Some members of Goldman Sachs' New York Principal Strategies team are in talks with several groups including KKR, Perella Weinberg, BlackRock ( BLK.N ) and Carlyle Group CYL.UL, to possibly join one of the firms, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) is considering options for its proprietary trading desk that include a sale of the business, according to a Wall Street Journal report last month. Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America said in July it was trimming staff from its private equity investment business in response to rules that cap that size of banks' investment in private equity. That move affects about 30 employees, the bank said. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; Editing by  Robert MacMillan  and  Richard Chang )
