 LONDON (Reuters) JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) is the frontrunner to buy the remaining infrastructure of RBS Sempra Commodities ( SRE.N ), the Financial Times said on Monday, citing people familiar with the deal. 

 French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) is among those said to be considering acquiring the group's North American gas and power trading book, the paper said. The U.S. bank earlier this year bought RBS Sempra's global oil, metals, coal and European power and gas business for $1.6 billion. (Reporting by Karolina Tagaris; Editing by  Lincoln Feast )
