 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch bancassurer ING Group will split itself in two and launch a 7.5 billion euro ($11.3 billion) rights issue as part of a deal with the European Commission. 

 Following are analysts' reactions to the news: FRED HUIBERS, HET HAAGS EFFEKTENKANTOOR "This is still a difficult environment and ING may be running ahead of themselves with the rights issue but capital markets have shown they can be quite forgiving to ING." PAUL BEIJSENS, THEODOR GILISSEN: "I think the separation of the assets is a good move that brings more simplicity to ING as a financial institution. They could have opted for converting government shares into ordinary shares on a 1:1 ratio and I'm a little doubtful on why they will ask shareholders for new equity."
