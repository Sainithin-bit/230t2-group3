 (Reuters) - Supermarket chain Winn-Dixie Stores Inc WINN.O posted a wider quarterly loss, hurt by consumers shifting toward generic pharmaceuticals and the absence of storm-related sales, and cut its 2010 EBITDA outlook, sending its shares down 13 percent after the bell. 

 The company cut its full-year 2010 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) outlook to between $140 million and $160 million. For the latest first quarter, the company posted a loss of $8.1 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.3 million, or 4 cents a share, a year ago. Sales at Winn-Dixie fell 2 percent to $1.64 billion. Adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 included an estimated benefit of $2.7 million due to storm-related sales net of storm-related inventory losses and other costs, the company said in a statement. Shares of the Jacksonville, Florida-based retailer were down at $11.55 after the bell. They closed at $13.33 Monday on Nasdaq. (Reporting by Vidya Lakshmi in Bangalore; Editing by Unnikrishnan Nair)
