 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) said on Monday that its third-quarter results should be better than its previous forecast, although its October sales are trending below earlier expectations. 

 The operator of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains forecast that, on a per share basis for its third quarter, it would break even or report a loss of as much as 4 cents. It had previously forecast a loss of 7 cents to 12 cents per share. The retailer said it now expects October same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, to be in the negative low-to-mid single digit range. Its previous view called for sales to be roughly flat. Shares of Limited fell 8 percent to $17.95 after hours from a close on the New York Stock Exchange of $19.49.
