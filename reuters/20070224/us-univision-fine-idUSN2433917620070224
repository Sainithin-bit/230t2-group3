 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The FCC is expected to slap U.S. Hispanic network Univision with a record $24 million fine that will allow the broadcaster to proceed with a $12 billion private equity buyout, the New York Times reported on Saturday. 


 The fine involves Univision's airing of a show three years ago about 11-year-old twin girls who swapped identities after learning they were separated at birth. Univision, the largest U.S. Hispanic network, mischaracterize the program as educational, the Times said. Federal Communications Commission Chairman Kevin Martin disclosed the fine, the largest the FCC ever imposed against a company, in an interview, the Times said. Univision claimed to meet its obligations to broadcast educational children's programs by showing the Latino soap opera "Complices al Rescate" (Friends to the Rescue) and other such telenovelas, and characterizing the episodes as educational for children. Along with a plan to show more programming that would comply with FCC rules, the fine is part of a consent decree that Univision has tentatively agreed to that would resolve complaints by viewers. It covers violations at 24 Univision stations over a 116-week period from 2004 to early last year, the Times said. Following the expected approval of the penalty by the full commission, Univision will be able to complete its $12 billion sale to a consortium of private equity firms including Providence Equity Partners, where a senior executive is former FCC chairman Michael Powell, as well as investor Haim Saban. Lawyers representing Univision before the commission declined to comment to the newspaper. Martin said that while he was committed to deregulation to help drive companies' investment and innovation, "I also think the commission has a key role to play in some areas, such as children's television, and I take those obligations seriously." The fine stems from 1996 regulations interpreting the Children's Television Act, which ramped up requirements on the networks to broadcast at least three hours a week of programs that provide educational value for youngsters, the Times said. The previous record fine was $9 million against Qwest Communications in 2004 for violating telephone interconnection rules, according to the Times.
