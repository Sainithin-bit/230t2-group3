 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Media group Tribune Co.'s TRB.N special committee will meet again on Saturday to evaluate alternatives that could split up the company or take it private, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday. 


 The source added that Tribune was leaning toward following a course of its own, rather than accepting one of the takeover offers that have been proposed. Analysts have previously said that they could see Tribune keep its newspaper unit, sell the broadcast group, including 23 TV stations, and give shareholders a dividend. The drawn-out auction for Tribune, whose properties include the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Cubs professional baseball team, was sparked by its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, which urged the company in June to break itself up or consider a sale. Tribune set a second deadline for bids for January 17 after an initial round drew scant interest. Since the January deadline passed, an independent special committee of directors has met for several Saturdays as well as early last week to evaluate offers. The committee will eventually recommend a course of action to Tribune's board. BIDS CONSIDERED The bids Tribune has been considering include an offer to go private, a recapitalization -- when a large amount of debt is taken on to buy a company's stock -- and a sale of its television stations, sources have told Reuters. The Chandler Trusts proposed taking the company private in a deal valuing Tribune at $7.6 billion, or $31.70 a share. Under the deal, the Chandlers would buy Tribune's newspaper business, including 11 daily newspapers, and spin off its broadcasting unit. A rival bid from Los Angeles billionaires Eli Broad and Ron Burkle valued Tribune at $34 a share, including a $27 dividend and equity valued at $7 a share, said a second source at the time of the bid deadline in January. A third bid -- just for the TV station assets -- came from private equity firm Carlyle Group, a source told Reuters in January. A report in Newsday newspaper earlier this week said that Tribune had decided against the Carlyle proposal for tax reasons while the Burkle/Broad team had mostly lost interest. Representatives for Tribune, Carlyle and Broad/Burkle were not immediately available for comment. Tribune has said it will decide on a course of action before the end of March. Tribune's shares closed on Friday up 6 cents at $30.70.
