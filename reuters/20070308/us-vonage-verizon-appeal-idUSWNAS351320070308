 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Vonage Holdings Corp. said on Thursday it would appeal a jury verdict ordering it to pay $58 million for infringing on three patents held by Verizon Communications Inc. and said its customers would not be affected by the court battle. 


 After the eight-member jury made its decision known on Thursday, U.S. Judge Claude Hilton set a March 23 hearing on whether he should issue an injunction barring Vonage's use of the technologies covered by the patents. "We don't believe there is any basis to support Verizon's request for an injunction and we will have the opportunity to present our position to the trial court shortly," Vonage said in a statement. "If the trial court does impose an injunction, we will seek an immediate stay from the Federal Court of Appeals."
