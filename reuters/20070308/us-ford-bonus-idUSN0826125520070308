 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) is paying bonuses to all hourly and salaried workers in the United States and Canada for 2006 to boost morale even though it lost a record $12.7 billion last year. 


 Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on Thursday in an e-mail to U.S. and Canadian employees that the "performance award" has the support of the board, as well as the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers unions. "We want to recognize and reward your accomplishments, because you made vital contributions to our future," Mulally said in the e-mail. Mulally said that while Ford did improve cost savings and quality, it did not meet all its objectives and hence, the awards will be "modest." The move comes as Ford is cutting about 45,000 hourly and salaried jobs in North America and closing 14 plants to return the region to profits. Workers who took buyouts last year as well as executives outside the United States and Canada are also eligible to receive the bonuses, Mulally said in his email. "These awards underscore the importance of working together as a unified team," he said. "That's the only way we'll make more progress down the road."
