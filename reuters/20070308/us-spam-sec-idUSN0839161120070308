 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Securities and Exchange Commission suspended trading on Thursday in the stocks of 35 small companies linked to spam e-mail campaigns urging small investors to buy shares. 


 The SEC said it launched an enforcement effort to protect investors from potentially fraudulent spam e-mail promoting small company stocks with phrases like, "Ready to Explode," "Ride the Bull" and "Fast Money." "Today's action will disrupt the operations of these boiler rooms and make it harder for the spammers and promoters to dump their stock on an unsuspecting public," SEC enforcement director Linda Thomsen said at a press conference on Thursday. The commission said in a statement that an estimated 100 million of these spam messages are sent every week, triggering dramatic spikes in share price and trading volume before the spamming stops and investors lose their money. It said the stocks halted typically sell for less than $1 per share and are quoted on the Pink Sheets quotation service. The trading suspensions began on Thursday and will last for 10 business days, ending at noon on March 21, the agency said. Mark Schonfeld, director of the SEC's northeast regional office, said that investor losses related to the 35 companies are in the tens of millions of dollars. "Now that we have stopped the trading in these stocks, we will focus our attention on the people behind the spam and profiting from it," Schonfeld said. He said the SEC is investigating the companies themselves as well as outsiders, and that the same people are likely behind multiple spam campaigns. In one spam campaign involving Apparel Manufacturing Associates, the SEC said the company's stock closed at 6 cents on trading volume of 3,500 shares on Friday, December 15, 2006. After a weekend spam campaign distributed e-mails proclaiming "Huge news expected out on APPM, get in before the wire, We're taking it all the way to $1.00," trading volume on Monday, December 18, 2006, soared to 484,568 shares with the price spiking to over 19 cents a share. Two days later the APPM price climbed to 45 cents. However, by December 27, 2006, the price had slumped to 10 cents on trading volume of 65,350 shares, the agency said. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said that not even the investor protection agency is immune to the onslaught of stock-related spam. He said the SEC's public affairs director, John Nester, received an e-mail touting the stock of one of the 35 companies. "Not even  the SEC's spam filter can stop all this spam," Cox said.
