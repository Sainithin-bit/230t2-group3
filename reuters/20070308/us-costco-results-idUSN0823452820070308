 CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) reported lower quarterly earnings on Thursday, hurt by expenses for stock options, and forecast profit in the current quarter that could fall short of analysts' expectations. 


 "I think we've taken the viewpoint we want to be a little conservative in our outlook because you never know what's going to happen tomorrow," Chief Financial Officer Richard Galanti said on a conference call with analysts. The No. 1 U.S. warehouse club operator, whose shares were down 3 percent, said net income fell to $249.5 million, or 54 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended February 18, from $296.2 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Last year, Costco said it would take a charge related to stock options after it found "imprecisions" in its options practices. The second-quarter results included a pretax charge of $46.4 million related to the options review. Excluding one-time items, including the stock options expense, Costco earned $302.9 million, or 66 cents per share, matching analysts' average forecast as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Revenue, including membership fees, rose to $15.11 billion from $14.06 billion a year earlier. The company also said February sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, rose 4 percent. Analysts, on average, had been expecting an increase of 5 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Wal-Mart's ( WMT.N ) Sam's Club, the No. 2 U.S. warehouse club operator, said its February same-store sales rose 3.9 percent, while smaller rival BJ's Wholesale BJ.N reported an increase of 3 percent. Costco has been luring customers into its clubs by stocking unexpected "treasure hunt" items like designer clothing, high-end jewelry and wines, in addition to its typical selection of paper products and cleaning supplies. Galanti said sales during the first couple of weeks in the current quarter looked "a little better" than February, but cautioned it was still early in the 12-week quarter. RETURNS POLICY Costco said it set aside money in the second quarter for a new returns policy it is implementing over the next six weeks to cut down on returns of high-tech items like big-screen TVs and computers. Such returns have hurt its margins. Galanti said any positive impact from the new policy was still "several months out" and that gross margins in its hardgoods segment would continue to be challenging over the next few months. The retailer is introducing free tech support over the phone, which it calls "Costco Concierge," along with its new returns policy, to minimize customer returns. "This is something we're paying for. We believe it will solve some of the issue of returns, not just for TVs but for other products as well," he said. EARNINGS FORECAST Galanti said he expects Costco's third-quarter earnings to range between 52 cents and 56 cents a share, excluding payroll-related items. On the conference call, he said a First Call consensus estimate of 57 cents a share likely includes a payroll-related charge of 1 cent. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts' average forecast is 57 cents a share before special items. Galanti said analysts' average estimate for earnings of $2.58 a share for the full fiscal is at the "higher end" of Costco's own forecast range. Costco, which operates 506 warehouses, said it plans to open 13 to 14 more warehouses before the end of its fiscal year on September 2. Costco shares were down $1.60 at $54.52 in afternoon trade on the Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Mark Porter )
