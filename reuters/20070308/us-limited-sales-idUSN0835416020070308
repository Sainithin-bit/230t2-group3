 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year rose just 3 percent in February as cold, stormy weather around Valentine's Day hurt sales of lingerie at Victoria's Secret. 


 Analysts had expected the company to post a same-store sales gain of 4.4 percent over the four weeks ended March 3, according to a Reuters survey. Net sales for the company, whose other chains include Express, Limited and Bath & Body Works, were $730.5 million, up from $635.8 million in the four-week period ended February 25, 2006. The company said that sales at stores open at least a year should rise in the high-single-digit range in March and in the mid-single-digit range for the current first quarter. Limited, which has nearly 3,800 stores, is cutting back on its underperforming apparel brands and expanding its Victoria's Secret chain. The company is also converting its Express stores to a dual-gender format, which it says has spurred improved sales trends for that chain. In February, Express same-store sales rose 8 percent, with gains in both women's and men's merchandise, the company said. Limited is also growing Pink, its casual intimates business found within Victoria's Secret and in free-standing stores, and its lingerie chain Intimissimi. Same-store sales rose 2 percent at both Victoria's Secret stores and the Bath & Body Works chain, results that were below Limited's initial expectations. At the Limited chain, same-store sales rose 1 percent. Limited also said that it is comfortable with its levels of inventory. The company has seen a slew of executive changes since the beginning of this year, most recently the appointment of Lori Greeley as chief executive of Victoria's Secret Stores. Departing executives include the head of the lingerie chain's direct-to-consumer division, the chief executive of Limited Stores and two co-presidents of Express. Those departures fueled some speculation on Wall Street that Limited Brands' apparel divisions could be sold. (Additional reporting by  Alexandria Sage )
