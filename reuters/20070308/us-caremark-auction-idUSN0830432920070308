 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) on Thursday again sweetened its $23.9 billion takeover bid for Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N with an increased dividend, calling the new proposal its "best and final" offer. 


 CVS, seeking to thwart rival suitor Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ), offered to pay $54.74 a share, plus a sweetened, one-time dividend of $7.50 per share. The dividend previously was $6 per share. The higher offer still falls below Caremark's current stock price of $62.87, up 2.6 percent, in afternoon trading in the New York Stock Exchange. Express Scripts has bid $62.11 a share, or $27.1 billion. "The Express Scripts' offer for Caremark remains fraught with risk, challenges and certain loss of shareholder value," said CVS Chairman Tom Ryan. "Our best and final merger proposal provides Caremark shareholders with real and deliverable value and is based on a compelling strategic rationale," Ryan said. CVS said its shareholders would vote on the deal on March 15. Caremark's shareholders are scheduled to vote on March 16. Express Scripts said its deal with Caremark could close in the third quarter of 2007. In lieu of the previous stock repurchase plan, CVS said the merged CVS-Caremark would launch a cash tender offer for 150 million shares, or about 10 percent of its outstanding stock, at $35 a share. CVS said the merger would be "solidly accretive to earnings and cash flow in 2008" and the combined company was expected to retain a "solid investment grade rating."
