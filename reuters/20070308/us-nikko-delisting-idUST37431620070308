 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange is likely to decide next week on delisting brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T instead of Friday as has been widely expected, Kyodo reported, citing a senior exchange official. 


 Nikko, Japan's third-largest securities firm, has been under review by the TSE for a possible delisting since an accounting scandal related to an acquisition by its merchant banking business came to light in December. On Tuesday, U.S. bank Citigroup ( C.N ). announced a $10.8 billion tender offer for Nikko, and the delisting could help persuade shareholders to sell. The Nikkei business daily had reported earlier this week that the TSE would likely decide on the delisting on Friday. Other media followed the Nikkei with similar reports, building up speculation the announcement would come this week. But Kyodo, citing a senior TSE official, said the exchange was now expected to make a decision on Monday or after because it is still conducting hearings with Nikko officials.
