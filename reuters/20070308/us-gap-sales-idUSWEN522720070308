 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year fell 4 percent in February. 


 Analysts had expected, on average, that same-store sales at the San Francisco-based clothing retailer would fall 4.5 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Estimates ranged from a decrease of 7 percent to flat sales. The operator of the Banana Republic, Old Navy and Gap chains, which is in the midst of a turnaround to stem a sales slide of over two years, said total sales for the four weeks ended March 3 increased 5 percent to $910 million.
