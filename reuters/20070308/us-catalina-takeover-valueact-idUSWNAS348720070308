 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Catalina Marketing Corp. POS.N said on Thursday it will be acquired for about $1.6 billion by ValueAct Capital, a buyout firm co-founded by Catalina director Jeffrey Ubben. 


 ValueAct's offer price of $32.10 for each Catalina share represents a 7.5 percent premium over its Wednesday close of $29.85. Shares of Catalina were up 5.8 percent to $31.57 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal also includes the assumption of about $135 million of debt by ValueAct, the largest Catalina shareholder. ValueAct previously offered $32-per-share for Catalina. Catalina, based in St. Petersburg, Florida, said it can solicit or entertain alternative proposals from third parties during the next 45 days. The company, which concentrates on consumer behavior and direct marketing, said the deal is expected to close in the next several months and is subject to approval by stockholders. Catalina hired Goldman Sachs in December as private equity firms prepared bids for the company. A Catalina special committee has also retained Lazard, to assist it in connection with its deliberations. (Additional reporting by Anup Roy in Bangalore)
