 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector will grow at a slower pace over the next two years than it did in 2006, according to a new report, as new clean-air rules for diesel engines, and continued weakness in the housing and auto industries, weigh on key industrial end markets. 


 Also contributing to the slowing, especially in 2007: efforts by manufacturers and their dealers to reduce inventories. The report, by the industry trade group Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, predicts the manufacturing sector will grow 2.5 percent in 2007 -- the slowest pace since 2003's 0.5 percent rate -- and 3.1 percent in 2008, down from 4.7 percent in 2006. The slowdown was already evident in the final quarter of 2006, the group said, with 18 of the 27 industries its tracks reporting inflation-adjusted new orders or production above the year-ago levels, down from 22 industries in the third quarter.
