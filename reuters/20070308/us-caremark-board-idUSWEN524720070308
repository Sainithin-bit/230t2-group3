 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N said on Thursday its board supported a sweetened $23.5 billion takeover bid from CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) and rebuffed a hostile $26.9 billion offer from rival Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ) 


 Caremark said an improved offer received from Express Scripts on Wednesday evening still failed to address concerns about antitrust risks, high debt loads, business disruption and customer attrition. CVS on Thursday improved its bid by paying a sweetened, one-time dividend of $7.50 per share after the deal closes. The dividend previously was $6 per share.
