 TOKYO  (Reuters) - 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) has filed suits against Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ), Lenovo Group Ltd. ( 0992.HK ) and others, claiming infringement of lithium-ion battery-related patents, the diversified U.S. manufacturer said in a statement on its Web site. 


 Defendants named in the release, dated Wednesday, include Hitachi Ltd. ( 6501.T ), CDW Corp. CDWC.O and Panasonic maker Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 6752.T ) as well as Sony and Lenovo. 3M, which filed the suits in a U.S. district court in Minnesota, said the companies import or sell lithium-ion batteries or products equipped with lithium-ion batteries with cathode components that infringe the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company's patent rights. 3M said it had also filed its complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission. Sony, Matsushita and Hitachi said they could not comment as they do not yet have enough knowledge about the suits.
