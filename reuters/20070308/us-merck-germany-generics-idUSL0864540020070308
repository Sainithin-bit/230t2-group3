 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Private equity firm The Carlyle Group is mulling a bid for the generics business of Germany's Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ), a unit worth at least 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion), a source close to the process said. 


 Carlyle CYL.UL is looking at acquiring the unit, but has no formal offer on the table, the source said late on Wednesday, adding that Carlyle is not currently teamed up with another private equity firm. Nonbinding offers for the generics business are due on Monday, another source close to the sale process said. Other private equity firms are expected to be pursuing the unit, which the company is selling to focus on high-margin branded pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Merck is seeking to shed its generics business to help cut debt piled up from its $13.3 billion Serono acquisition. Bain Capital and Apax Partners APAX.UL are preparing a joint bid, as are Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and Warburg Pincus WP.UL, the Financial Times Deutschland said. The German newspaper said Merck Chief Financial Officer Michael Becker expected to make 5 billion euros from the sale, citing an insider. Apax and Carlyle declined to comment on the report and the other firms were not immediately available. Merck's generics business was the world's third-largest in 2006 with sales of some 1.8 billion euros. People familiar with the situation have told Reuters that U.S.-based Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N is among the potential bidders. Iceland's Actavis ACT.IC and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. ( RANB.BO ) of India have both said publicly they aim to buy it. Industry sources have also said Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA.O and India's Dr. Reddy's Laboratories Ltd. ( REDY.BO ) are also eyeing the operation.
