 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) said on Thursday that it will adopt a majority voting standard for the election of directors in uncontested elections. 


 Under the new standard, nominees not elected by a majority of votes will be required to tender their resignations. The medical device maker also said it is recommending that shareholders approve an amendment to the company's bylaws that would declassify the company's board of directors and cause each to be elected annually for a one-year term. Currently, directors are elected to three-year terms. Boston Scientific is recommending shareholders approve its proposals at the company's annual meeting on May 8.
