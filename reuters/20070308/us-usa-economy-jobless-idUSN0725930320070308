 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers claiming first-time jobless benefits fell 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 328,000 last week, slightly lower than Wall Street expectations, a government report showed. 


 But the four-week moving average for initial claims, a better look at the underlying trend, rose to 339,000, which is the highest since the week of October 29, 2005, when it was also 339,000. There were no special factors, such as weather, affecting the data last week, the U.S. Labor Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted initial claims would drop to 330,000 in the week ended March 3, from the prior week's unrevised 338,000. The number of workers filing for continuing claims fell 98,000 in the week ended February 24 to 2.55 million, following a 118,000 jump the prior week. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted this number would decline to 2.59 million. The insured unemployment rate was 1.9 percent in the week ended February 24, down from 2.0 percent the prior week.
