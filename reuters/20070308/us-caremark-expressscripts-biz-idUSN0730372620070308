 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Express Scripts Inc. ( ESRX.O ) sweetened its bid for Caremark Rx Inc. CMX.N on Wednesday after suffering two setbacks in its battle to wrest the rival pharmacy-benefit manager away from a $22.8 billion deal with CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ) 


 Express Scripts, which offered to pay interest on the cash portion of its offer, said it expects to receive a "second request" for information from the Federal Trade Commission on its $26.6 billion offer to buy Caremark. The company had hoped to avoid such a request and have a speedier antitrust review. Express Scripts declined to elaborate on the information sought by the FTC, but said a deal with Caremark could close no later than the third quarter of 2007. Express Scripts also suffered a disappointment when a Delaware court refused its request on Wednesday to delay Caremark shareholders from voting on the offer from CVS, the No. 2 drugstore chain. The court previously had forced Caremark to delay the meeting, which is now scheduled for March 16, but Delaware Chancery Court Judge William Chandler refused to postpone the vote again. "Express Scripts' ability to pursue its ill-advised bid for Caremark will now be delayed for a minimum of several additional months, leaving Caremark shareholders even more exposed to ending up with a transaction on substantially reduced terms or no deal at all," CVS said in a statement. Based on Wednesday's closing stock prices, CVS's agreement to buy Caremark is valued at $52.30 a share, plus a $6 per share dividend. The Express Scripts offer, meanwhile, is valued at $61.10 per share. Both offers are below Caremark's closing stock price of $61.30 on the New York Stock Exchange. The CVS-Caremark deal has already passed regulatory scrutiny and could close in mid-March, pending shareholder approval. The Express Scripts offer now faces a longer antitrust review, as well as shareholder approval. To compensate Caremark's shareholders for any delay in closing the deal, Express Scripts on Wednesday offered to pay 6 percent annual interest on the cash part of its offer. The money would accrue from April 1 through the closing of Express Scripts' acquisition of Caremark, or 45 days after Express Scripts gets FTC approval of the deal. Caremark, which manages pharmacy benefits for corporations, declined to comment. Express Scripts also raised its 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $4.14 to $4.26 per share, up from its previous guidance of $4.08 to $4.20 per share. Express Scripts said the increased guidance was based on its stand alone performance and did not reflect any merger with Caremark.
