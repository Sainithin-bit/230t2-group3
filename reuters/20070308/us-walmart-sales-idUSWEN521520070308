 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), on Thursday reported a lower-than-expected 0.9 percent rise in February sales at U.S. stores open at least a year and provided a tepid forecast for March. 


 Wal-Mart, whose shares fell less than 1 percent, also announced a 31 percent increase in its annual dividend, nearly three times last year's rise of 11.7 percent. The world's largest retailer, which has been struggling to reinvigorate its U.S. sales, said that during February it had continued to see weakness in its home and clothing businesses, a trend it expects to persist through the spring. It also said its February sales suffered because of unfavorable weather. Analysts on average had been expecting a February same-store sales increase of 1.7 percent, according to a Reuters survey. Wal-Mart itself had forecast a rise of 1 percent to 2 percent. The retailer said net sales for the four weeks ended March 2 rose 8.1 percent to $26.79 billion. Same-store sales increased 0.4 percent at Wal-Mart stores and 3.9 percent at Sam's Club. For March, Wal-Mart forecast sales at U.S. stores open at least a year to rise between 1 percent to 2 percent. The company, which has raised its dividend every year since it first declared one in 1974, said investors would receive 88 cents per share in quarterly installments of 22 cents for the fiscal year ending on January 31. Wal-Mart shares were down 18 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $47.75 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade.
