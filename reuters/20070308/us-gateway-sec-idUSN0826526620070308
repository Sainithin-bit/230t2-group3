 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Computer maker Gateway Inc.'s GTW.N former finance chief and controller were found liable on civil charges they manipulated financial results to meet Wall Street expectations in 2000, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said. 


 The verdicts against former Gateway Chief Financial Officer John J. Todd and former Controller Robert D. Manza were announced by a federal jury in San Diego following a three-week trial, the SEC said on Thursday. They were found liable on Wednesday of violating SEC provisions relating to fraud, false statements to accountants and record-keeping. Former Gateway Chief Executive Jeffrey Weitzen in May won dismissal of a similar SEC lawsuit accusing him of inflating revenue to meet analysts' expectations in 2000. A judge will determine sanctions against Todd and Manza later, the SEC said. Attorneys for Todd and Manza could not be immediately reached for comment. The SEC charged that Todd devised a scheme to "close the gap" between analysts' expectations and Gateway's anticipated revenues. Starting in March 2000, Todd inflated revenue by offering pre-approved financing to people whose previous credit applications had been rejected by Gateway, the SEC said. The scheme continued into the third quarter of 2000 with even riskier credit applicants, regulators said. Manza was accused of initiating one of the improper revenue-inflating transactions and preparing financial statements, knowing that the transactions failed to comply with accounting rules.
