 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co.'s ( GE.N ) consumer finance arm plans to close 60 percent of its manned personal loan branches in Japan and shed up to 400 employees amid an industrywide slump prompted by tighter regulation. 


 GE said on Thursday it would shut 73 of its 115 manned lending outlets within the year. It will also pull the plug on around 200 of its 1,342 ATM-like loan terminals and close 48 local collection offices. The company said later on Thursday that if unmanned branches, similar to ATMs, were included in the total it will close 273 out of 1,457 locations or 18.7 percent being closed. A new lending law approved by parliament in December will lower Japan's maximum legal interest rate to between 15 and 20 percent, depending on the size of the loan, from the current ceiling of 29.2 percent. The change threatens revenues in the once-mighty consumer finance industry, already battered by scandals and borrower lawsuits over excessive interest charges. In addition to closing branches, GE said it would introduce an early retirement program to reduce its workforce of 2,600 full-time employees by 300-400 in the second quarter of the year. GE is not the only lender cutting back. Citigroup ( C.N ) is closing most of its Japanese personal loan outlets amid heavy losses, Aiful Corp. ( 8515.T ) is cutting its branch network in half and shedding more than 10 percent of its workforce, and Acom Co. Ltd. ( 8572.T ) is cutting staff numbers by 17 percent. On Tuesday another big consumer lender, Orient Corp. ( 8585.T ), said it expected to post a $4 billion net loss this year, prompting it to ask shareholders for new capital, cut 22 percent of its workforce and shrink its branch network to less than half its current size.
