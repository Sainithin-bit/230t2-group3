 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Navistar International Corp. NAVZ.PK and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) have agreed to try to resolve a contract dispute that led to a brief cutoff in diesel engine shipments for Ford's key F-Series Super Duty pickup trucks, the companies said on Thursday. 


 The companies also agreed to a court order that requires Navistar to continue to ship the engines to Ford and for Ford to continue to pay for the engines without deductions, Navistar said in a statement. Navistar, the exclusive supplier of diesel engines to Ford's Super Duty pickups since 1979, halted diesel engine shipments to the automaker in late February, saying Ford had stopped honoring their agreement. The halt threatened to disrupt production of the Super Duty, one of the automaker's most profitable vehicles, and a key launch this year as Ford tries to rebound from billions of dollars of losses in recent years. Ford, which sued Navistar in January over warranty costs and engine prices, obtained a court order within days from Oakland County Circuit Court Judge John McDonald to force a resumption in the engine shipments. McDonald entered an injunction by consent on Thursday to maintain the shipments and terms, Navistar said. The order also requires officers from both companies to meet in an effort to resolve the dispute, Navistar said. Ford acknowledged the agreement with Navistar and said in a statement it was pleased there would be no further disruptions to the production of the F-Series Super Duty. Warrenville, Illinois-based Navistar's International Truck and Engine Corp. produces a 6.4 liter diesel engine for the Super Duty. Navistar stopped engine production briefly at a plant and foundry in Indianapolis because of the dispute. A shortage of engines disrupted production at a Ford plant in Kentucky. Super Duty trucks are the most popular vehicles in their class, averaging 50 percent market share in the heavy- duty pickup truck segment during the past five years.
