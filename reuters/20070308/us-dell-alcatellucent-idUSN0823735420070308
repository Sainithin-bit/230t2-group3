 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. court has ruled that Dell Inc. DELL.O personal-organizer products did not infringe a patent held by Alcatel-Lucent ALU.PA( ALU.N ), according to a court document filed on Thursday. 


 The court also ruled in a summary judgment that Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) would not be liable for indirect infringement of the patent, according to a filing at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California. Alcatel-Lucent spokeswoman Joan Campion said that, while Dell won on the PDA issue, the Judge still plans go a head with a patent trial related to Dell's tablet computers, which use a stylus to control computer functions. A Dell representative said the company's policy was to decline comment on pending litigation. A representative for Microsoft was not immediately available for comment. The summary judgment related to Dell's Axim line of personal digital assistant products and an Alcatel-Lucent patent for the use of a stylus to control notebook computers. Many hand held organizers and mobile phones let users navigate through menus or dial a number by tapping a stylus onto the device's screen. Lucent shares closed up 26 cents, or about 2 percent, at $12.12 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Microsoft stock was down 27 cents or more than 1 percent at $27.34 on Nasdaq, where Dell fell 21 cents or 1 percent at $22.09.
