 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp. ( COST.O ) on Thursday said its quarterly profit fell, hurt by charges for expensing stock options. 


 The largest U.S. warehouse club operator reported net income of $249.5 million, or 54 cents per share, for its fiscal second quarter ended Feb 18, compared with $296.2 million, or 62 cents per share, a year ago.
