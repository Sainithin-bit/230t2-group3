 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said on Thursday that express delivery firm DHL had ordered six 767-300ER freighters, valued at $894 million at list prices. 


 DHL, owned by German mail and logistics company Deutsche Post ( DPWGn.DE ), said it would use the widebody freighters chiefly in the United States, where it is the No. 3 express delivery firm behind United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ) and FedEx Corp. ( FDX.N ). Boeing said the order had already been accounted for on its online order book. The U.S. planemaker is dominating the market for large freighters this year as European rival Airbus ( EAD.PA ) struggles to get a foothold. Last week UPS canceled its order for 10 Airbus A380 freighters, worth up to $3 billion at list prices, after numerous production delays. That left Airbus with no customers for what would have been the world's largest commercial freighter. FedEx canceled an identical order last year. In early February, UPS ordered 27 of Boeing's 767-300ER freighters, worth about $3.8 billion. In November, after canceling its A380 order, FedEx bought 15 Boeing 777 minijumbo freighters worth about $3.5 billion.
