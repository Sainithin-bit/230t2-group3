 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The price of satellite radio offered by a merged Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ) and XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O would be "significantly" lower than $26 a month, Sirius' chief executive Mel Karmazin said on Wednesday. 


 "There will be a significant discount," Karmazin told a House telecommunications subcommittee hearing. When asked if the discount would be $10 or $2, Karmazin said it "looks closer to 10 than to two." Both XM and Sirius each charge subscribers $12.95 per month.
