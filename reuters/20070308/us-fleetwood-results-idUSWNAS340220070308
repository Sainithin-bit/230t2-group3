 (Reuters) - Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. FLE.N posted a quarterly loss on a 24 percent fall in revenue, as its housing group witnessed its lowest shipments since 1961. 


 The maker of recreational vehicles and manufactured housing reported a loss of $29.9 million, or 47 cents a share, compared with a profit of $1.4 million, or 2 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts on average expected a third-quarter loss of 40 cents a share, before items, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for the quarter fell to $443.2 million, from $583.9 million a year earlier. Two analysts expected $438.9 million. Revenue for the company's travel trailer division fell 52 percent to $81.8 million, while the housing group revenue fell 48 percent to $108.7 million. The company said it expects a significant operating loss in the fourth quarter, but less than that in the third quarter, as it faces a softer travel trailer market.
