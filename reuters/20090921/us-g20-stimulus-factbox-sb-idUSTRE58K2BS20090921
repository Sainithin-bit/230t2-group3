 (Reuters) - G20 governments have pledged discretionary spending worth 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 and 1.6 percent in 2010 to help counter the global crisis, International Monetary Fund staff have estimated. 

 G20 leaders meeting in Pittsburgh, United States, on September 24-25 are expected to commit to maintain stimulus until the economy shows signs of sustainable recovery. Here is a summary of the IMF estimates, which can be read in greater detail on here ROLLOUT: Implementation rates are hard to gauge but a few countries that provide details gives an idea of rollout speed: *UNITED STATES: stimulus outlays speeding up and $64 billion paid out by mid-July, which when combined with $50 billion of tax breaks provided, amounts to about 41 percent of expected annual stimulus of $283 billion *CANADA: 81 percent of planned stimulus for 2009 has been committed in the sense that it is available to spend *FRANCE: 60 percent of planned 2009 stimulus has been paid out: full payout of tax credits and 26 percent payout of other stimulus spending GDP IMPACT: IMF estimates of the potential impact in terms of GDP vary hugely, according to the so-called multiplier or GDP-enhancing potential attributed to the measures announced *G20-wide impact: in 2009, 1.2-4.7 percentage points added to GDP.
