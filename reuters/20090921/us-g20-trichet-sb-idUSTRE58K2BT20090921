 PARIS  (Reuters) - Europe, the United States and China should accept the advice of the International Monetary Fund to modify their economic policies, European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said on Monday. 

 In a short piece in France's Le Monde newspaper, Trichet said the fragility of the international financial system needed to be corrected. He welcomed the consensus among G20 countries on the need for financial reform, saying that this was particularly strong among central bankers. "But the most difficult question is still open: Europe, America, China, are they ready to modify their macroeconomic policies in the future -- by following the advice of the IMF and under pressure from their peers, for the common good, and world economic stability?" he said. The United States is proposing a broad new economic framework to help solve the world's economic imbalances. The IMF would be at the center of a peer review process that would assess member nations' policies and how they affect economic growth. (Writing by Anna Willard; Editing by  Andy Bruce )
