 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States wants the Group of 20 countries to put in place a set of policies that would lead to more sustainable global growth, according to a letter from a senior White House aide. 

 "We should aim to adopt a policy framework to achieve sustainable and balanced growth," Michael Froman, President Barack Obama's top G20 adviser, wrote in a letter addressed to his G20 colleagues and obtained by Reuters. The proposal centers on fixing an imbalance in which some countries such as the United States have growth fueled largely by consumer spending while other countries like China have growth driven primarily by exports.
