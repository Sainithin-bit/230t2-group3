 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's directors on Monday elected DuPont Co Chairman Charles Holliday to the board of the largest U.S. bank and resolved to cap the board's size at 15 directors, down from 18. 

 The board also created two new committees, the credit and enterprise risk committees, that will replace its asset quality committee from October 27, according to a statement. Chief Executive Ken Lewis and other directors at Bank of America, which bought investment bank and brokerage Merrill Lynch & Co, have been under fire for paying billions in bonuses to Merrill employees and the government asked the bank to shake up its board. Since the bank's annual meeting in April, at which shareholders ousted Lewis as chairman of the board, long-time directors, including O. Temple Sloan and Jackie Ward, have left. The board has added more directors with banking experience, including two former regulators: Susan Bies and Donald Powell. All 15 positions on Bank of America's board have been filled with Holliday's appointment, the board said. Last week, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo subpoenaed five current or former Bank of America directors to learn what they knew about Merrill Lynch & Co's problems as the companies prepared to merge. Cuomo has threatened to sue Bank of America officers, perhaps including Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis, and its lawyers over a lack of disclosures about the merger, which shareholders approved last December 5 and which closed on January 1. The board will be briefed on its options if Lewis is charged with civil fraud, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. The bank's directors were not surprised by any of the allegations made by Cuomo's office and back Lewis, the Journal said, citing the person familiar with the matter.
