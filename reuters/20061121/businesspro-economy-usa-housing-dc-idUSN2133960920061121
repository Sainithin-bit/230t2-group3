 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The worst of the United States' 
housing market slowdown is over, economists forecast by nearly 
2-to-1 in a Wall Street Journal online economic survey, the 
paper reported on its Web site on Tuesday. 

  But the economists still predict that the average selling 
price of a house will fall somewhat next year, it said.  The 49 economists expect home prices, measured by the 
government's Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight 
index to fall by 0.5 percent next year, the WSJ reported on its 
Web site. That contrasted with a 13.4 percent increase in 2005.  After several years of double-digit increases, house prices 
stopped climbing this year. Prices still have some way to fall 
before they stabilize but there are signs that the most drastic 
part of the downturn, marked by a sharp pullback in demand and 
new construction, have run their course, the paper said.
