 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ), the world's No. 2 beverage company, said on Tuesday it will buy premium juice maker Naked Juice Co. from private equity firm North Castle Partners for an undisclosed amount. 

 Naked Juice, maker of all-natural juices and smoothies, has sales of more than $150 million, Pepsi said. This is the third North American acquisition this year for the snack and drinks company, which is trying to expand its portfolio of good-for-you items as health-conscious consumers cut down on sugary soft drinks and traditional snack chips. Earlier this year PepsiCo, which also owns Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, purchased Stacy's Pita Chips and IZZE Beverages, which makes sparkling juice drinks. PepsiCo shares were up 5 cents at $62.55 on the New York Stock Exchange.
