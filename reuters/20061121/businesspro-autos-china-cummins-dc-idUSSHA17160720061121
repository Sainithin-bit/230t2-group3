 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - Engine maker Cummins Inc. ( CMI.N ) aims 
to more than double its China sales by 2010 as it expands 
operations in the world's second largest auto market, a senior 
executive said on Tuesday. 

  Columbus, Indiana-based Cummins, which sold its first batch 
of engines to China in 1975, saw its turnover in the country 
top $1 billion in 2005, Wang Hongjie, vice chairman (China), 
said in an interview.  "Our target is to increase our annual sales to more than 
$2.5 billion by 2010," Wang said.  To achieve that goal Cummins, which has invested $195 
million in China since the mid-1990s, plans to spend roughly 
$100 million more to develop its research and manufacturing 
facilities in the country, he said.  The U.S. company, which competes with international and 
local rivals such as Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) and Weichai Power 
Co. Ltd. ( 2338.HK ) in China, operates three engine joint 
ventures in the country with partners including Dongfeng Motor, 
China's third largest vehicle maker.  Earlier this year, Cummins won approval for a $240 million 
engine joint venture with pickup and truck maker Beiqi Foton 
Motor Co. Ltd. ( 600166.SS ).
  BEEFING UP CHINA SOURCING  Like other foreign auto equipment makers, Cummins is also 
counting on China as one of its low-cost purchasing bases.  Local procurement is expected to top $100 million this year 
and could rise further to $300 million by 2008-2009 and $500 
million by 2010, despite appreciation of the Chinese currency, 
Wang said.  China's yuan has appreciated 3 percent against the U.S. 
dollar since it was revalued and freed from a dollar peg in 
July 2005. The appreciation could accelerate as Beijing eases 
its grip on the foreign exchange system, analysts say.  Although the currency issue will play a role in Cummins's 
future buying decisions, Wang expects China to remain a 
low-cost sourcing base given the economies of scale offered by 
the country's fast-growing automotive and component industries.  "We believe China could still provide the cost advantage, 
at least in the next five to 10 years," he said.
