 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N surged almost 27 percent on Monday after competitor Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) agreed to buy the company for $25.9 billion. 

 Freeport's proposed cash and stock deal for its larger rival would create the world's largest publicly traded copper company. It is the latest multibillion dollar takeover deal in the global mining industry, which has been consolidating as companies scramble to add reserves and try to capitalize on record high metal prices. "We had been working on this deal for some time and it has had a good reception from investors," Chief Executive Officer Richard Adkerson told Reuters. Indeed, Phelps Dodge shares jumped 26.8 percent to close up $25.45 at $120.47 on the New York Stock Exchange. Freeport shares fell $1.77, or 3.1 percent, to $55.63. The deal is a long-term bet on copper prices for Freeport. The combined company will reap about 74 percent of its revenue from its copper business, up from about 68 percent for Freeport on a stand-alone basis. But copper prices have dropped nearly 27 percent in recent months after rallying to an all-time record of $4.16 a pound in early May. Still, COMEX copper prices were trading at around $3.06 a pound on Monday -- up almost 42 percent on the year. Adkerson said New Orleans-based Freeport feels "very positive" about the additional exposure, noting that copper inventories are low on a historical basis and that industrialization in China should boost demand for the metal. "We feel this is a good time in our industry situation to give our shareholders that copper exposure," he said, speaking on a conference call with analysts. "We believe this company ... will be able to deal with potentially lower prices if that occurs, but this exposure to this positive marketplace with such strong fundamental supply and demand factors is something we're very excited about." Gold will account for about 10 percent of the combined company's revenue, down from about 32 percent of Freeport's business last year. The remaining revenue will come from Phelps Dodge's molybdenum business. A.G. Edwards futures analyst Dan Vaught said the merger's long-term effect on copper prices is still up in the air. "Forthcoming production looks like it is going to increase rather significantly, but whether or not that translates into enough of an expansion to meet what we assume is going to be strong demand in the future is an open question," Vaught said. GEOGRAPHICAL DIVERSITY The deal would give Freeport some geographic diversity. Aside from a copper smelter and refinery in Spain, Freeport's business is based in Indonesia, mostly at its huge Grasberg mine in Papua. Phelps Dodge owns 14 mines and does business on 5 continents. "Combining the two companies makes sense, especially if Freeport can get a better multiple on its earnings because it no longer is all Indonesia," said analyst Charles Bradford of Bradford Research/Soleil. "Plus, it doesn't look to me like they are paying very much for Phelps Dodge." The Freeport operation has been a frequent source of controversy in Indonesia, with issues ranging from its impact on the environment and the share of revenue going to native Papuans and the Papua government to the legality of payments to Indonesian security forces who help guard the site. In October 2003, eight workers died in a landslide at the Grasberg mine. Some protesters have demanded closure of the lucrative mine, believed to have the world's third-largest copper reserves and one of the biggest gold deposits. Freeport-McMoRan will pay a total of $126.46 per Phelps Dodge share, a premium of 33 percent to Friday's closing price. Phelps Dodge shareholders will receive $88 per share and 0.67 of a common share of Freeport-McMoRan. The combined company will retain the Freeport-McMoRan name. Earlier this year, Phelps failed in a bid to buy two Canadian companies, Inco Ltd. N.TO and Falconbridge Ltd. in a stock and cash deal worth $40 billion. Phelps' lost out to all cash bids for those companies. Freeport has offered mostly cash for Phelps.
