 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) has won a contract worth $1 billion to build 23 more F-22 Raptor fighter aircraft plus one test aircraft, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. 

 The order, for the sixth production batch of the radar-evading fighters, is to be wrapped up by February 2010, the Pentagon said in its daily contract summary. A total of 131 Raptors are now under contract, with 83 already delivered to the Air Force, said Joseph Quimby, Lockheed's spokesman for the F-22 program. The F-22 is built by Lockheed in partnership with Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and Pratt & Whitney, a United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) unit that makes the engines.
