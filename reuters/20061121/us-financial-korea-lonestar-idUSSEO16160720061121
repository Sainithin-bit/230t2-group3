 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund Lone Star is close to terminating its $7.3 billion deal to sell Korea Exchange Bank 004940.KS to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS, as a prosecutor investigation made the sale nearly impossible, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. 

 South Korean prosecutors started looking into allegations in February that financial data on KEB had been understated to help Lone Star buy the bank in 2003 at a bargain price of $1.2 billion. The nine-month legal saga has been a key factor in delaying Lone Star's plan to sell KEB to Kookmin, the country's top lender, and may give South Korea's top lender the upper hand, should Lone Star be required to jettison the stake in a hurry. Lone Star's decision is expected to be finalized in the next few days, FT reported, citing Lone Star Chairman John Grayken. "In light of this investigation being extended again, and the issuance of arrest warrants against Ellis and Mike, we are considering what we should do with Kookmin," Grayken was quoted as saying. "We're talking about terminating." A Lone Star spokeswoman in South Korea declined to comment. Prosecutors are seeking to extradite Lone Star Vice Chairman Ellis Short and general counsel Michael Thomson for questioning in relation to the stock trading in KEB Credit Service, after a South Korean court issued warrants on Thursday to detain the two executives.
