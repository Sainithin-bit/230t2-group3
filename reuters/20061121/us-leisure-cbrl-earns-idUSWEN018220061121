 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CBRL Group Inc. ( CBRL.O ), parent of the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain, posted lower quarterly earnings on Tuesday, held back by disappointing sales at its retail stores and said consumers appeared cautious in their spending. 

 Net income fell to $19.4 million, or 57 cents a share, in the first quarter ended October 27 from $25.7 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast 57 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. CBRL had 36 million weighted average shares outstanding in the latest quarter, compared with 51.8 million a year earlier, which skewed the per-share results. Sales rose 4 percent to $558.3 million. Cracker Barrel has retail stores attached to its restaurants, where it sells merchandise including food, candy and home decor. The company said sales at its restaurants were "solid," but sales at the retail stores were not up to its expectations. Cracker Barrel's restaurants are primarily located near interstate highways, so the chain struggled when gasoline prices soared this summer. The company said the recent decline in gas prices helped improve sales in the latest period. "With retailers reporting mixed results recently, consumers appear cautious in their spending," Michael Woodhouse, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. The company said it expects full-year revenues of about $2.4 billion, with comparable-store sales at its restaurants up 1 percent to 3 percent and at its retail stores up 5 percent to 7 percent. The forecast excludes results from its Logan's Roadhouse chain, which it has agreed to sell. (Additional reporting by  Euan Rocha )
