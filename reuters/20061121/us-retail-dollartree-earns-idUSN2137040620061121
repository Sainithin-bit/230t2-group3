 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Dollar Tree Stores Inc. ( DLTR.O ) reported a 4.5 percent increase in quarterly profit on Tuesday, meeting Wall Street expectations, helped by strong demand for Halloween merchandise. 

 The discount retailer, which sells items priced at $1, said net income rose to $32.5 million, or 32 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter that ended on October 28, from $31.1 million, or 29 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 32 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "We finished (the) third quarter with a strong Halloween sell through, and our stores are well prepared for the Christmas holiday season," Bob Sasser, chief executive officer, said in a statement. Dollar Tree has stuck to its $1 price point even as its competitors have switched to higher priced merchandise. The retailer recently bought a chain called Deal$, where it plans to test higher prices. If that is successful, it is considering bringing more expensive goods to its Dollar Tree stores. Looking ahead, Dollar Tree expects fourth-quarter sales in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.31 billion, with earnings per share of 87 cents to 93 cents. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 91 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
