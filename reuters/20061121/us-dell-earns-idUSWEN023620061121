 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, reported on Tuesday quarterly earnings that comfortably beat analysts' estimates, sending its stock up nearly 10 percent. 

 The company sold more laptop computers, enjoyed strong growth in Asia and Europe, and said efforts to improve profitability were "starting to take hold." Dell provided no year-ago comparisons because of investigations into its accounting that it said may require restatements of prior periods. "They're making progress," said Shaw Wu, an analyst at American Technology Research who has a "neutral" rating on the stock. "It looks like they hit a low" in the second quarter. Net income for its third quarter ended November 3 was $677 million, or 30 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had forecast net income of 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue was $14.38 billion, shy of analysts' average forecast of $14.5 billion as compiled by Reuters Estimates but within an estimate range of $13.97 billion to $14.87 billion. Third-quarter revenue growth, against reported revenue of $13.9 billion a year ago, was the slowest in more than four years as it faced tough competition from Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), which last week reported a quadrupling of quarterly profit as sales and margins improved. But Dell shares have rallied in recent weeks amid optimism that third-quarter earnings would exceed expectations. Shares of Dell gained 9.5 percent, or $2.35, to $27.17 in extended-hours trade following the report, adding to a 17-cent gain in regular trading on Nasdaq to close at $24.82. The company had delayed the earnings report from November 16 amid the accounting investigations. Dell said on Tuesday its third-quarter results were preliminary and it did not expect to file them on time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Dell has been under pressure as the SEC steps up its accounting probe. It is also dealing with a recall of Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) battery cells in its laptops and complaints of poor after-sales service, while losing its status as the world's top PC maker to Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) last quarter. Dell shares, down 18 percent this year as of Monday, had been trading at about 20 times forward earnings per share, a discount to a computer hardware sector average of 37. HP's stock is up 40 percent in 2006. Revenue growth at Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, hit 22 percent in 2002 and hovered between the mid- and high-teens through the middle of 2005 as it sold computers for less than competitors by selling them directly to customers through its Web site or toll-free phone service.
