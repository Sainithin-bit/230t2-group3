 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Payless ShoeSource Inc. PSS.N said on Tuesday it formed a multiyear deal with Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) to create a line of footwear featuring Disney and Disney Pixar characters. 

 Through the direct-to-retail licensing agreement, Payless will source, market and sell the line through its almost 4,600 store chain and on Payless.com. Payless has sold Disney-themed footwear and accessories for several years, but this agreement means the companies will work more closely on shoe design, creative direction and retail marketing. No financial terms were immediately disclosed. Payless shares closed at $28.13 on Monday, while Disney shares closed at $33.12.
