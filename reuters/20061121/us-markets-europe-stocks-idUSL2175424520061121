 PARIS  (Reuters) - European shares chugged higher on Tuesday, lifted by takeover talk in the utility and financial sectors and a bullish broker note on Danone ( DANO.PA ), but a new rise in the euro against the yen weighed on car exporters. 

 A rebound in oil prices also held back sentiment. Crude prices rose back above $59 a barrel following a weather-related halt in loadings at Alaska's key export terminal and forecasts calling for a drawdown in U.S. fuel stocks ahead of the winter. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares was 0.15 percent higher at 1,469.15 points by 0910 GMT, five points away from a new 5-1/2 year peak. Trading was muted by the looming Thanksgiving Day holidays and a dearth of major and economic data. "Even though we are just in the black this morning, the move is mixed and lacks real direction despite a raft of earnings news," said Angus Campbell, head of sales at Finspreads. Growing expectations the Bank of Japan will only slowly raise interest rates pushed the yen to a near record low against the euro, fuelling worries of dented revenues for euro zone car exporters .SXAP in the world's second biggest economy. But mergers and acquisitions lent impetus. Shares in Scottish Power SPW.L added 1 percent after sources close to the matter told Reuters that Spanish utility Iberdrola ( IBE.MC ) was set to make a 12 billion pound ($22.7 billion) bid for its Glasgow-based rival in cash and shares. The heads of the companies met over the weekend and a deal is expected as soon as this week, the sources said. Elsewhere, French insurer CNP ( CNPP.PA ) confirmed late on Monday that it could be interested in bidding for a stake in MPS Vita, the insurance unit of Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ), pushing shares in the Italian bank 2 percent higher. Earnings reports also help feed market gains. UK property firm British Land ( BLND.L ) posted a 9.3-percent rise in net asset value and said its full-year dividend would rise at least 94 percent after it converts into a low-tax investment trust, sending its shares up 1.3 percent. Experian ( EXPN.L ) gained 1.7 percent as the British credit information firm posted a 16-percent rise in first-half profit, while inter-dealer broker ICAP ( IAP.L ) also pleased with a jump in half-year revenue and confirmation that it was on course to meet full-year forecasts. Elsewhere, government data showing Swiss watch exports rose 15.5 percent year-on-year in October to 1.504 billion Swiss francs ($1.21 billion) boosted Swatch Group ( UHR.VX ) UHRN.VX and Richemont ( CFR.VX ), which produces Cartier watches.
