 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - GameStop Corp. ( GME.N ), the largest U.S. video game retailer, reported on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit and strong same-store sales and issued a holiday forecast that some analysts saw as conservative. 

 Its stock hit a new year high. Third-quarter net income was $13.6 million, or 17 cents per share, compared with a loss of $2.5 million, or 4 cents per share, a year before. The company said excluding special items, its profit equaled 22 cents a share, in line with the average forecast of 14 analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Revenue nearly doubled to $1.01 billion from $534 million a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year were up 8.8 percent versus a year before. GameStop predicted a strong holiday season with comparable store sales climbing between 14 percent and 18 percent during the fourth quarter, following the launch of Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T ) ( SNE.N ) PlayStation 3 and Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii video game consoles. It forecast fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.53 to $1.59 and full-year earnings per share of $1.98 to $2.04. "Holiday guidance may prove conservative," Lazard Capital Markets analyst Colin Sebastian said in a client note. He has a "buy" rating on the stock and on Tuesday raised his 12-month price target on GameStop to $60 from $54 per share. U.S. video game companies reap around half of their sales in the holiday season. During the third quarter, GameStop's hardware sales climbed 69 percent from a year earlier, led by Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360 and Nintendo's DS Lite hand-held player. Sales of software rose 14 percent, led by the popular "Madden" football game from Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O, "Saints Row" from THQ Inc. THQI.O and "Dead Rising" from Capcom Co. Ltd. ( 9697.T ) Shares were up $2.71 or 5.3 percent in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange to $53.87 after touching a 52-week high of $54.90 earlier in the session.
