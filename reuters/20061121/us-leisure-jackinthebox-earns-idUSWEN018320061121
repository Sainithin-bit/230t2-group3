 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hamburger chain Jack in the Box Inc. JBX.N posted higher quarterly profit on Tuesday, lifted by the disposal of restaurants in Hawaii and an increase in sales at stores open at least a year. 

 Lower costs for labor and most foods, including beef, also helped lift earnings, the company said. Profit rose to $33.2 million, or 92 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended October 1, from $21.5 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. The sale of the company's Hawaiian restaurants to a franchisee added 25 cents a shares to earnings in the most recent quarter, the company said. Excluding the gain from the sale of the restaurants and a charge to write down assets at six restaurants in the Southeast region, earnings were 73 cents a share. A lower-than-expected state income tax rate added 2 cents a share to earnings. Analysts, on average, looked for 66 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 11.2 percent to $670.7 million. Sales at Jack in the Box company-owned restaurants open at least a year were up 5.9 percent, while systemwide same-restaurant sales at its Qdoba Mexican Grill chain increased 4.5 percent. Looking forward, Jack in the Box forecast earnings of 78 cents to 81 cents a share for the first quarter, and $3.02 to $3.07 a share for the year. Analysts expected 78 cents for the quarter and $2.95 for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also said it will hold a tender offer for up to 5.5 million shares, which could reduce its outstanding stock by 15.5 percent.
