 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Manhattan U.S. Attorney said on Tuesday he won't prosecute five former New York Stock Exchange specialists who faced criminal fraud charges, leaving just one case outstanding from the 15 floor traders originally charged with making fraudulent trades at the Big Board. 

 U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement that after assessing evidence in the five cases awaiting trial, "the government has concluded that the continued prosecutions in these cases are not in the interests of justice." Prosecutors originally charged 15 former NYSE specialists with fraud in April 2005 for violating securities law by trading ahead of or between customer orders. The cases of Gerard Hayes, Robert Johnson, Scott Hunt, Frank Delaney and Thomas Murphy will not go to trial, the U.S. Attorney said. The government had mixed results in prosecuting the cases. Charges have now been dropped against seven of the traders, two have pleaded guilty, two have been acquitted and three have been convicted. One trader, Freddy Deboer, fled and the charges against him are still pending.
