 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drugmaker Cephalon Inc. CEPH.O engaged in questionable practices to expand sales of Actiq, a powerful narcotic lollipop approved only to treat cancer pain, according to a two-year investigation by the Connecticut attorney general, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Tuesday. 

 Cephalon spokesman Robert Grupp declined to comment beyond a statement to the Journal, saying the company does not comment on an ongoing inquiry. Grupp told the paper: "Cephalon has voluntarily cooperated with the Connecticut attorney general since 2004 when he first made a request for information about our marketing practices, and we continue to do so. Grupp continued: "Our company is committed to conducting its business with integrity and to following regulations in our sales and marketing practices." Asked about the Journal's report, Grupp told Reuters the attorney general had not identified any of the specific concerns to Cephalon.
