 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei share average ended flat on Tuesday as investors picked up recent fallers such as Advantest Corp. ( 6857.T ), while Ricoh Co. Ltd. ( 7752.T ) dropped following a media report that the firm was likely to issue 50 billion yen ($424 million) worth of convertible bonds. 

 Ricoh confirmed the issue after the close of trade. Companies sensitive to domestic demand such as NTT Data Corp. ( 9613.T ) dropped amid concerns about the Japanese economy, countering gains in exporters' shares, which were buoyed by the euro's rise to a near record high against the yen. Shares of major banks including Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. ( 8309.T ) extended losses after they reported on Monday that earnings from core operations weakened in the six months ended September 30 as competition squeezed their lending margins. "People had bought up bank shares on expectations that the economy would be out of deflation, but now that their earnings are out, the feeling is that there may be no need to hold so many bank shares after all," said Katsuhiko Mori, a senior portfolio manager in Daiwa SB Investments' equity management department. Mori said investors are cautious as many companies have left their conservative earnings outlooks unchanged and personal spending remains weak. The Nikkei  .N225  added 8.20 points to 15,734.14, after logging its lowest close since late September on Monday. The broader TOPIX  .TOPX  was down 0.99 point at 1,532.95, its lowest close since July 26. Ricoh fell 4.0 percent to 2,170 yen, becoming the second-largest drag on the Nikkei, after the Nihon Keizai newspaper reported that the firm would issue convertible bonds, raising concerns of share dilution for current holders of the copier giant's stock. After the market closed, another Japanese copier maker Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. ( 4902.T ) said it would issue 70 billion yen worth of euroyen convertible bonds for capital expenditure and bond redemption.  Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities, said the continued slide in small-cap stocks spurred stop-loss selling from investors, hurting overall market sentiment. The Mothers index .MTHR fell 1.4 percent to 1,008.69 to a new three-year low, after plunging 6.2 percent on Monday. He also said foreign players, disappointed at the slump in the Tokyo stock market that contrasts with record-breaking rallies in New York and Asia, have been moving away from Japan. "They have been shifting money into markets that show better performance," Murai said. Trade volume fell sharply from the previous session, with 1.65 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section. That was also below last month's daily average of 1.8 billion shares. Decliners beat advancers by a ratio of nearly two to one. CONCERNS ABOUT ECONOMY, PROFIT GROWTH Susumu Abe, a manager in the information and investment department of Mito Securities Co., said the Nikkei's technical bounce after Monday's 2.27 percent fall lacked momentum as investors were not keen to buy on dips due to caution about the economy and the growth of corporate profits. "There are no strong incentives for buying, with little support from macroeconomic indicators," Abe said. "Although companies have been reporting better earnings in the first half of this business year, many of them are cautious about revising up their full-year forecast," he added. Shinko Research Institute said on Tuesday recurring profits of major Japanese companies were expected to fall 2.9 percent in the second half of the business year to next March, a sharp contraction from 12.5 percent growth in the first half. The figures are based on reports from 1,146 companies listed on the Tokyo Exchange's first section. Japanese government sources said on Sunday Tokyo would downgrade its view on the country's economy for the first time in almost two years in its monthly report for November, mainly because of sluggishness in personal consumption. Japan's second-largest bank, Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ), lost 2.2 percent to 805,000 yen, while sixth-ranked Mitsui Trust Holdings Inc. ( 8309.T ) slid 6.0 percent to 1,127 yen. Among the tech stocks that gained on bargain-hunting, Fanuc, a maker of industrial robots, rose 1.4 percent to 10,460 yen, after falling 3.1 percent in the previous session. Exporters were helped by the yen's weakness against the euro. A weaker yen is a positive for companies that make the bulk of their sales abroad, because it boosts profits when earnings from abroad are brought home. The euro was around 151.44 yen EURJPY= at 0745 GMT, in sight of a record high of 151.68 yen hit on electronic trading platform EBS on Monday.
