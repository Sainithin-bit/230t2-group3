 LONDON  (Reuters) - Oil prices climbed near $60 a barrel on Tuesday after bad weather disrupted loadings at Alaska's main export terminal and analysts forecast a drawdown in U.S. fuel stocks ahead of winter. 

 U.S. crude CLc1 climbed $1.03 to $59.83 a barrel by 1619 GMT, reversing Monday's 17-cent loss. London Brent crude LCOc1 rose $1.05 to $60.03. Prices got a lift from news that crude loadings at the port of Valdez, Alaska, were delayed. High winds forced operators to suspend loadings at the port on Monday, slowing the 800,000 barrel per day Trans Alaska Pipeline to 25 percent of capacity. Large Alaskan oil fields such as Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk have been forced to reduce output because of the problems. Analysts still expect government data on Wednesday to show that U.S crude stocks rose for the fourth week in a row by 700,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of industry analysts. But they said distillate stocks, including winter heating oil, are likely to have fallen by 900,000 barrels. <EIA/S> Weather forecaster WSI Corp said on Monday the U.S. Northeast, the world's largest heating oil market, will have a colder than normal winter. "Seasonal market fundamentals may have had more to do with stabilising prices than promise of output cuts from OPEC," said the Centre for Global Energy Studies. Oil prices that tumbled sharply from a mid-July record high of $78.40 a barrel have steadied at around $58-$62 a barrel since early October. OPEC is on alert to make a further round of production cuts at its December 14 meeting if necessary, deepening the 1.2 million barrels per day reduction it pledged to implement from November 1. The head of the International Energy Agency, which advises 26 industrialised countries, said OPEC didn't need to cut its output as prices remained too high. "I think that prices are still much too high and all in all I don't see a rationale for a cut," said Claude Mandil at an energy conference in Brussels. Analysts expect prices this week to remain within the roughly $58-$62 range that has predominated since early October. partly due to the shortened trading week in the United States. "We will continue to be mired in broad trading ranges for now," said Man Financial. "The holiday-shortened week should keep activity restrained." The New York Mercantile Exchange will be closed on Thursday and Friday for Thanksgiving. (Additional reporting by Luke Pachymuthu in Singapore)
