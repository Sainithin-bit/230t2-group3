 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Deere & Co. ( DE.N ) said on Tuesday its quarterly profit rose 19 percent on better-than-expected farm equipment sales, boosting hopes that increasing commodity prices would produce stronger sales in 2007 and sparking a surge in its shares. 

 Profit at the world's largest maker of agricultural equipment increased to $277.3 million, or $1.20 a share, in the fourth quarter ended October 31, from $232.8 million, or 96 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts expected a profit of 94 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. While margins in its construction and forestry business contracted sharply during the quarter, with profits dropping 12 percent even as sales rose, Deere increased profits in its farm equipment business despite softness in sales. The results hinted at a turnaround in the farm sector. Deere as well as rivals Agco Corp. ( AG.N ) and CNH Global NV CNH.N have faced a drop in demand for tractors and combines because of declining farm cash receipts, rising interest rates, high fuel and fertilizer prices, and uncertainty about government subsidies. Looking forward, Deere forecast lower profits and flat sales in 2007 as weakness in the housing market weighs on sales, offsetting any renewed strength in the farming market. But many analysts said Deere was being too cautious in its outlook. Ann Duignan, an analyst at Bear Stearns, said in a note to investors that "worldwide farm-economic conditions remain quite promising." "Prices for farm commodities have surged in recent weeks and worldwide carry-over stocks for wheat and corn are at 30-year lows in relation to consumption," Duignan wrote. David Raso, an analyst at Citigroup, agreed. "Deere is not yet willing to bake in ... recent strength in farmer fundamentals," he wrote in a note to investors. He predicted the company's 2007 forecast, which anticipates a 22 percent drop in net profit, "will prove too conservative." SALES UP 3 PERCENT Quarterly sales rose 3 percent to $5.12 billion, lifted by a 3 percent hike in sales to forestry and construction customers. That offset a 1 percent decline in sales to agricultural customers and the consumer market. Analysts, on average, expected the Moline, Illinois-based company to report sales of $4.63 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. But looking forward, Deere forecast full-year 2007 profit of "about $1.325 billion," down about 22 percent from $1.694 billion in 2006, in part on a slowdown in the construction and forestry business that lifted earnings this year. Deere said it expects equipment market sales to be essentially flat in the coming year, with a 4 percent increase in agricultural equipment sales offsetting a 5 percent drop in construction and forestry sales. Deere shares rose $4.10 to $93.51 after jumping to an all-time high of $94.98 on the New York Stock Exchange earlier in the session. Year to date, Deere stock has risen about 31 percent through Monday's close, outperforming the S&P Machinery Industry Index .GSPMAC, up about 17.1 percent year to date.
