 TALEGAON, India  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. (GM) 
( GM.N ), the world's largest automaker, is considering setting 
up an engine and powertrain plant in India, where it aims to 
expand rapidly, the president of GM Asia-Pacific said on 
Tuesday. 

  "It is an objective ... We will make a decision in the next 
six months," Nick Reilly told reporters at a ground-breaking 
ceremony at Talegaon, 130 km (80 miles) southeast of Mumbai, 
for the firm's second car making factory in India.  Reilly did not say how much the firm would spend on the 
engine unit but said a typical investment was $300-$400 
million.  In August, GM said it would invest more than $300 million 
in the Talegaon plant for an initial capacity of about 140,000 
units, which would help meet its goal of raising market share 
to 10 percent by 2010, from 2.3 percent.  "This facility represents a key part of GM's strategy of 
establishing a presence in a fast-growing market. With the 
exception of China, we don't expect any other market to grow as 
quickly," he said at the ceremony.  The Talegaon plant will begin production in the third 
quarter of 2008 and initially make the Chevrolet Spark for the 
Indian market. Other models may be added and capacity expanded.  GM has also said India could become an export hub for the 
mini car and that it may launch luxury cars later.  "The mini segment is the largest in the country and we 
don't expect this to change with more and more first-time 
buyers entering the market," Rajeev Chaba, president and 
managing director of GM in India, told reporters.  GM has invested about $300 million in India so far, apart 
from its spending at Talegaon.  It makes the Chevrolet Aveo sedan, Chevrolet Tavera 
multi-utility vehicle, the Optra sedan, the Corsa and Corsa 
Sail at its plant in Halol in the western Gujarat state, where 
it plans to boost capacity to 85,000 units from 60,000.
  DIESEL OPTIONS  GM decided to set up a second plant after it gave up a bid 
for Daewoo's India car unit last year. It expects to sell 
45,000 to 50,000 units in India in 2006.  Reilly has been quoted in trade publications as saying GM 
would launch diesel engine options of the Optra and Aveo 
models, and may consider it for the Spark in a few years.  "We know in order to be successful we must have diesel in 
the mid-size and mini segments," he said.  GM may set up a diesel engine plant in India at a later 
stage if the market for it grows quickly, he has hinted.  Diesel's share of the Indian passenger vehicle market is 
forecast to rise to 35 percent by 2010 from 30 percent now, 
according to estimates by J.D. Power.  Industry sources told Reuters last week Ford Motor Co. 
( F.N ) plans to set up a diesel engine plant in India to make 
the 1.4-litre DuraTorq engine.  India's passenger vehicle market is expected to nearly 
double to 2 million units by 2010, with the recent 
Mahindra-Renault ( MAHM.BO ) ( RENA.PA ) joint venture to assemble 
500,000 cars a year expanding the market even further.
