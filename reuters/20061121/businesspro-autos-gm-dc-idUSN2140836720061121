 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) has more 
work to do to complete its turnaround and meet its goal of 
cutting structural costs to 25 percent of net sales, the 
automaker's top North American executive said on Tuesday. 

  In the text of a speech prepared for delivery to the 
Detroit Automotive Press Association, Troy Clarke, GM's 
president for North America, said the automaker's restructuring 
was "not yet finished."  "The GM I grew up in no longer exists," Clarke said. "We're 
a much different company today, and we're not done with our 
transformation."  Clarke, who took his current post about four months ago, 
said GM's negotiations with its bankrupt former parts 
subsidiary, Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, were making progress.  "The talks are definitely moving forward," he told 
reporters. "There are a lot of moving parts ... It's tough to 
forecast when they will come to a conclusion.  Of 34,410 GM factory workers who accepted buyout and early 
retirement offers, all but 6,200 have now left the company, 
Clarke said.  "The balance will leave at the end of the year," he said, 
adding that GM had brought in about 3,400 workers from Delphi 
under a "flowback" provision between the automaker and its 
major parts supplier.  Delphi filed for bankruptcy in October 2005 and has 
outlined plans to drop several business lines, close U.S. 
plants and cut thousands of hourly and salaried workers to 
reorganize.  Earlier on Tuesday, United Auto Workers president Ron 
Gettelfinger told the union rank and file that union leadership 
was not in active talks with Delphi over terms of a final labor 
settlement, which has been seen as key to GM's own recovery.  "The battle with Delphi is far from over," he said. "This 
process will require them to meet with our union."
