 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Continental Airlines Inc. CAL.N, 
concerned about being dwarfed by larger competitors, would 
consider a merger if necessary to maintain its competitiveness, 
its chief executive said. 

  "If the landscape of the U.S. airline industry does indeed 
change, we'll do what we need to do to act in the best 
interests of you (employees), our customers, our shareholders 
and the communities we serve," Chief Executive Larry Kellner 
said in a recorded message to employees on Friday.  Continental sent the transcript to Reuters on Tuesday.  US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) last week made an $8 billion bid 
for larger, bankrupt rival Delta Air Lines DALRQ.PK. Analysts 
expect the offer to spark counterbids or other combinations.  The statement positions Continental, the No. 4 U.S. 
carrier, as another potential player in industry deal-making, 
alongside United Airlines parent UAL Corp. UAUA.O.  Discount carrier Southwest Airlines ( LUV.N ) has expressed 
interest in picking up assets that might have to be unloaded 
following a deal.  But unlike UAL, which has long been a proponent of 
consolidation, Continental would be a reluctant participant, 
concerned about the implications of staying on the sidelines.  "The creation of a competitor even larger than American 
Airlines would not be good for us in the long run," Kellner 
said. "Our preference is to remain independent and continue our 
growth plan."  Continental shares were up 1 percent at $42.96 in midday 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
