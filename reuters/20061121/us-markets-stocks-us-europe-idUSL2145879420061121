 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street looked set to open flat on Tuesday with analysts predicting generally directionless trade in a quiet Thanksgiving week. 

 By 1025 GMT, U.S. stock futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were between 0.07 percent and 0.11 percent higher. Trading is expected to be subdued ahead of Thursday's Thanksgiving Day holiday. U.S. stocks slipped on Monday despite frenzied global merger and acquisition activity. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed 0.21 percent lower at 12,316.54, while the broad S&P Index  .SPX  closed 0.05 percent down at 1,400.50. "We had a little bit of a negative session yesterday, but ... it seems like investors are being rewarded by buying the dips," said Tom Hougaard, chief market strategist at City Index. His firm is expecting the Dow to open about 20 points higher. The Dow has been racking up record closing highs recently. "I would be careful putting on short positions just because we look a bit stretched," Hougaard said. Among earnings expected on Tuesday are Deere & Co ( DE.N ) and Dell Inc DELL.O.
