 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cable operator Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ) is about to land a video on-demand deal with Walt Disney Co. ( DIS.N ) for shows as "Desperate Housewives" and "World News with Charles Gibson," the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 Comcast has been seeking prime-time television programs to offer on its video-on-demand service for more than two years, the WSJ said. The deal is part of an anticipated content transaction that Comcast and Disney may sign as early as Tuesday that covers much of the panorama of the rapidly changing digital landscape, the paper said. The broader deal includes Comcast's purchase of Disney's broadcast and cable programming, including ABC, ESPN, and the Disney Channel, for more than $1 billion a year. It also gives Comcast rights to use Disney promotional content on its high-speed Internet portal. Comcast and Disney were not immediately available for comment.
