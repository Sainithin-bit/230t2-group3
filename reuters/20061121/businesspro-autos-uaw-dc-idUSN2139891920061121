 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Autos Workers union said on 
Tuesday that bankrupt parts maker Delphi Corp.'s DPHIQ.PK 
management will be forced to meet with the union to reach a 
settlement. 

  "The battle with Delphi is far from over," UAW president 
Ron Gettelfinger said in an online question and answer session 
with union members. "This process will require them to meet 
with our union."  Gettelfinger said there has been very little discussion 
between the union and Delphi recently.  "Our union has been available to meet with the corporation 
at any time, day or night," he said.  Delphi filed for bankruptcy in October 2005 and has 
outlined plans to drop several business lines, close U.S. union 
plants and cut thousands of hourly and salaried workers in 
order to reorganize the company.  Delphi, General Motors Corp.( GM.N ), the unions and others 
have been in talks for months to resolve issues ranging from 
its U.S. hourly wages to the ultimate ownership of the company.  Separately, Gettelfinger said negotiations for its labor 
contract with GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, will begin in 
July. The current contract with GM expires on September14, 
2007.  Gettelfinger declined to comment on the UAW's position on a 
jobs bank in coming contract talks.
