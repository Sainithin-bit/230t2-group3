 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Supporters of the free PC operating 
system Linux are preparing to counter a recent Microsoft Corp. 
( MSFT.O ) deal which established for the first time the 
principle of paying the software giant to use Linux. 

  Microsoft signed a deal with Novell Inc. NOVL.O, one of 
the providers of Linux, in which Novell paid a lump sum in 
return for a guarantee that Microsoft would not sue Novell's 
clients for what it calls a violation of its own patents in the 
Linux program.  Eban Moglen, one of the pioneers of free software, said 
Microsoft's deal skirts the requirements of the GNU General 
Public License, used by Linux and other free programs, which 
requires the software to be given away.  He said he and others have started work on updating the 
license to close the loophole by inserting a clause stating 
that a promise not to sue, such as the one given by Microsoft, 
would be automatically applicable to everyone.  That would effectively flip Microsoft's agreement on its 
head and guarantee that no one would face a suit from Microsoft 
if anyone were protected.  "A clause like that would not be difficult to get community 
agreement on these days," Moglen said, adding that a change 
could be ready in weeks or months.  A spokesman for Novell, Bruce Lowry, said: "We don't want 
to speculate on what would happen under the next version of the 
GNU General Public License because things are still in motion." 
Microsoft had no comment.  In the meantime, the prospect of a drawn-out legal battle 
with Microsoft, an experienced litigator, could push users of 
Linux into the hands of Novell and away from dominant Linux 
provider Red Hat Inc. RHAT.O, which does not have such a deal 
with Microsoft.  Although Linux is free, providers of the system offer the 
software with packaging, documentation and -- most important -- 
installation and maintenance, so that any client shift from Red 
Hat would cost it money.  "Either customers desert Red Hat to go to Novell, to get 
safety, or Red Hat will be forced into a similar deal with 
Microsoft," said Moglen, a professor at Columbia Law School and 
founding director of the Software Freedom Law Center in New 
York.
  LIABILITY?  Under the Novell deal, in which both companies agreed not 
to sue each other's clients for patent violation, Microsoft 
agreed to pay Novell $348 million, with Novell paying Microsoft 
$40 million, on the basis that Novell has fewer customers.  Microsoft is paying $108 million for the non-litigation 
agreement and the rest for Linux subscriptions for resale or 
distribution to its customers.  Microsoft says it has patent rights to some of the 
technology in Linux, although it has never said exactly what 
those rights might be or what patents are involved.  Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said if customers 
bought Linux from anyone but Novell, they could face trouble.  "If a customer says: 'Look, do we have liability for the 
use of your patented work?' Essentially, if you're using 
non-SUSE Linux, then I'd say the answer is yes," Ballmer told 
eWeek.com recently, referring to the Linux system sold by 
Novell.  "I suspect that (customers) will take that issue up with 
their distributor," Ballmer said, adding that if customers 
considered doing a direct download of a non-SUSE Linux version, 
"they'll think twice about that."  Microsoft makes the Windows operating system, for which it 
charges billions of dollars a year, but Linux has been a thorn 
in the software giant's side because it is freely available.  Linux was created, maintained and improved by volunteers 
working under a license requiring that it be freely available 
for copying, modification and improvements.
