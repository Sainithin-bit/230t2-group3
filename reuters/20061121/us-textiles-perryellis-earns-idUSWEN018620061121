 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Perry Ellis International Inc. ( PERY.O ) reported slightly higher third-quarter earnings on Tuesday. 

 The owner of brands including Perry Ellis and Jantzen reported net earnings of $8.2 million, or 80 cents per share, compared with $8.1 million, or 80 cents per share, for the comparable quarter last year. The most-recent quarter includes 2 cents of expenses related to stock-option expenses. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had expected the company to report profit of 71 cents per share, on average. Revenue slipped 3.1 percent to $213.2 million, which the clothing maker attributed to retailer consolidation and elimination of some private label sportswear programs. Looking forward, the company said it expects full-year earnings in the range of $2.30 to $2.40 per share, on revenue of $840 million to $850 million. "Third-quarter results reflect the end of the impact of retail consolidation and other factors that have impacted top line growth," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer George Feldenkreis said in a statement. "We are well positioned for record sales and gross margins in our upcoming fourth quarter." Analysts had forecast earnings of $2.35 per share, on revenue of $857 million. The company also declared a 3-for-2 stock split effective in the form of a stock dividend payable on December 29. Shares of Perry Ellis closed at $37.51 on Monday.
