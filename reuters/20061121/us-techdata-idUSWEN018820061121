 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Tech Data Corp. ( TECD.O ), the world's No. 2 computer distributor, reported lower quarterly profit on Tuesday as costs rose more quickly than sales, but forecast sales above expectations. 

 Net income fell to $9.6 million, or 18 cents, for the third quarter ended October 31, from $23 million, or 40 cents, a year earlier. Net sales rose to $5.43 billion from $5.07 billion and beat the $5.18 billion average expectation of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter gross margin was 4.56 percent of net sales, compared to 4.95 percent a year earlier. In a statement, the company blamed "a more challenging market environment and the related competitive margin conditions" for the drop in profitability. For the fourth quarter ending January 31, 2007, the company said it expects to report net sales of $5.75 billion to $5.90 billion. Analysts were expecting $5.40 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The company didn't provide forecasts for net income. Clearwater, Florida-based Tech Data is the second largest distributor of computers and other information technology products after Ingram Micro Inc. ( IM.N ).
