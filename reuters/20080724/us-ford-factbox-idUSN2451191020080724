 (Reuters) - Ford announced a number of product initiatives on Thursday to realign its vehicle line-up as the company posted a record $8.7 billion second-quarter loss. 

 Following are the highlights of the plan. * Add six European small vehicles to North American line-up by 2012. * Retool three large truck and SUV plants to build small cars. Retooling begins in December. * Hybrid vehicle production and lineup to double in 2009 * To double North American capacity for four-cylinder engines by 2011 * Next generation Ford Explorer to be car-based and have 25 percent better fuel economy. * To expand production of its new EcoBoost engines, which provide better fuel economy and reduced emissions through use of direct fuel injection and turbochargers. * Lincoln and Mercury to be integral part of North American brand portfolio. * Ford's truck plant in Wayne, Michigan, to be converted beginning this December to production of small cars in 2010. * Production of Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator -- now built in Wayne -- to move to the truck plant in Louisville, Kentucky, early next year. * Cuautitlan assembly plant in Mexico, which currently produces F-Series pickups, to begin production of the new Fiesta small car in early 2010. * Louisville assembly plant, which builds the Ford Explorer SUV, to produce small cars beginning in 2011. * Ford's assembly plant in Twin Cities, Minnesota -- scheduled to close in 2009 -- to continue production of the Ford Ranger through 2011 to meet demand for compact pickup trucks. * Kansas City assembly plant to add a third shift to build the Ford Escape, Escape Hybrid and Mercury Mariner and Mariner Hybrid.
