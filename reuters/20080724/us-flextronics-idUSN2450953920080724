 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Contract electronics manufacturer Flextronics International Ltd ( FLEX.O ) on Thursday posted a higher quarterly profit, paced by higher sales of consumer electronics devices. 

 Flextronics also issued a forecast for its current quarter that was largely in line with Wall Street estimates and its shares rose almost 2 percent in extended trade after closing 5 percent lower. Fiscal first quarter net income rose to $130.3 million, or 16 cents per share, from $107.0 million, or 17 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue rose to $8.35 billion from $5.16 billion. Flextronics said it expected earnings per share before items in the current quarter of 28 cents to 31 cents and revenue of $8.5 billion to $9.0 billion. Analysts had been expecting a second-quarter profit of 31 cents per share on revenue of $8.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Duncan Martell ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )
