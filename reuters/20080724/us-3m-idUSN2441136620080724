 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified U.S. manufacturer 3M Co ( MMM.N ) reported a 3 percent rise in quarterly earnings, topping the average Wall Street forecast, as strong sales in Latin America and Europe more than offset slowing U.S. business. 

 The main weak spot in the company's broad portfolio -- which ranges from chemicals used in aircraft maintenance to basic consumer goods like Post-it notes -- remained optical films for LCD television sets. Demand for the high-tech films has faded as TV manufacturers have sought to drive down the cost of flat-panel sets. "We fought our way to a good overall result," George Buckley, 3M chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts and investors. "Despite all the headwinds that optical, commodities and the U.S. economy threw at us, the fact is that we still met our numbers and delivered the bacon." 3M, regarded as an economic bellwether due its wide range of businesses and geographic reach, posted second-quarter profit of $945 million, or $1.33 per share, up from $917 million, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. Factoring out one-time items, profit was $1.39 per share. On that basis, analysts had expected $1.35, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue came to $6.74 billion, up nearly 10 percent from a year earlier. The weak dollar was responsible for more than half of that growth; 3M now generates two-thirds of its sales outside in the United States. "This quarter validates CEO George Buckley's strategy, which is to have a very strong international presence and to be very diversified not only by products, but also by geography," said John Koczara, portfolio manager at Ames Investment Council, a Grand Rapids, Michigan-based money manager that counts 3M shares among its holdings. "You are getting that big currency benefit, which is why a lot of investors continue to own the shares," Koczara added. 3M shares rose $1.15, or 1.6 percent, to $71.95 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. BOTTOM IN SIGHT FOR LCD FILM Sales and profit were up across all of the company's segments with the exception of its display and graphics business, where operating profit tumbled 47 percent. The LCD TV market has been shaken by the rise of low-cost brands such as Vizio, owned by Taiwanese company Amtran ( 2489.TW ). Rivals such as South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co ( 005930.KS ) and Japan's Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) have been scrambling to find ways to cut the prices of their own flat-panel TVs. Many of the TV makers have stopped using 3M's high-end films, contributing to an 80 percent profit drop at 3M's optical films unit, Buckley said. "The bottom appears to be in sight. It's not quite here yet," he told shareholders, adding that he expects the decline to continue through the rest of the year, with a chance for "some bleed-over into 2009." The company said it was cutting the work force of the unit that makes film for TVs by 20 percent, or 300 jobs. CONSUMER SEGMENT REBOUND Operating profit was up 8.4 percent at 3M's consumer and office segment, which makes products ranging from air filters for furnaces to pet-care items and has felt the brunt of softening U.S. consumer spending. "Just a quarter ago the consumer business went negative, and I don't think I've seen anything out there to suggest to me that things are better in that part of the market," said Daniel Ortwerth, materials analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "They managed to turn that number positive. That tells me this company has some ability to be flexible, even in bad circumstances." 3M held its full-year earnings forecast steady, calling for an increase of at least 10 percent over last year's $4.98 per share before one-time items. Analysts' average forecast is $5.46 per share. The company has stopped providing quarterly profit guidance due to high volatility in demand for many of its products. Its shares are down 15 percent this year, compared with a 13 percent decline in the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , of which it is a component. (Editing by John Wallace)
