 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Raytheon, L-3 Communications and Goodrich posted bigger-than-expected profit gains and raised their full-year earnings forecasts on Thursday, as the long boom in defense and commercial aircraft spending shows no immediate signs of bursting. 

 The U.S. defense budget has doubled since 2001 and commercial airplane orders have surged to record levels over the past three years, as the United States has increased investment in big weapons projects and airlines have responded to a resurgence in air travel after 9/11. The prospect of Pentagon spending cuts under the next U.S. administration and the risk that cash-strapped airlines will cancel airplane orders has not yet shown up on the balance sheets of companies feeding off the twin boom. "We feel very positive about the long-term outlook for the company," said Raytheon Chief Financial Officer David Wajsgras, in an interview, adding that it was too early to predict what the next U.S. administration would do with defense spending. CIVIL PLANE BOOM Goodrich, which makes wheels, brakes and landing systems for Boeing Co ( BA.N ) and Airbus, said struggling airlines grounding old planes had yet to make an impact on its replacement part business. "Even though many airlines have announced that they will remove some of their older airplanes from their fleets, we do not expect these removals to have a significant impact on Goodrich results in 2008," said Goodrich Chief Executive Marshall Larsen. Boeing and EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus -- along with their suppliers -- are hoping the civil aerospace market will survive relatively unscathed as high oil prices increase the attractiveness of their new, more fuel-efficient models. Thursday's positive results emulate those of Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) and General Dynamics Corp ( GD.N ), which both beat profit estimates and raised forecasts earlier this week. Among the major defense contractors, only Boeing bucked the trend with weaker-than-expected results on Wednesday, due to delays on some key programs. Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) reports earnings next week. Goodrich shares rose sharply in early trading, then sank back near the unchanged level in a broadly lower market. Raytheon and L-3 shares fell. PATRIOT SYSTEMS GOING STRONG Raytheon Co's ( RTN.N ) profit from continuing operations rose a bigger-than-expected 20 percent, helped by higher sales of its missiles and lower pension expenses. The U.S. No. 5 defense contractor, which makes Patriot missile systems and a range of military electronics, reported an 11 percent increase in sales to $5.9 billion, helped by sales of Patriot systems to Kuwait and South Korea and more work on Britain's e-Borders security program. Net income fell, but only because the company booked a one-time gain of $980 million in the year-ago quarter from the sale of its Raytheon Aircraft Co business jet unit. Raytheon is now expecting earnings of $3.80 per share to $3.95 per share, in line with analysts' average forecast of $3.93. L-3 Communications Holdings Inc ( LLL.N ), the U.S. No. 7 Pentagon supplier, said profit rose a better-than-expected 48 percent, helped by strong sales of its military electronics and a one-time gain. New York-based L-3, which also supplies intelligence services to federal U.S. agencies, raised its full-year forecast, based on strength across its operations. It is now expecting earnings per share in the range of $6.71 to $6.75, in line with analysts' average forecast of $6.72. Goodrich Corp GR.N reported a bigger-than-expected 50 percent jump in profit, on strong sales of its landing gear and other aerospace components. It also raised its 2008 earnings per share forecast to a range of $4.80 to $4.95 per share. Analysts were expecting $4.51, on average. (Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
