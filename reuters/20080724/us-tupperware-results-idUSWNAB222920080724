 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Tupperware Brands Corp ( TUP.N ), whose food storage containers are sold at in-home parties, posted slightly higher quarterly net income on Wednesday, boosted by strong sales in all five of its business segments. 

 Second-quarter net income was $36 million, or 56 cents per share, compared with net income of $35.5 million, or 56 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a noncash impairment charge related to purchase accounting intangibles and other items, earnings per share rose to 75 cents per share from 58 cents per share a year earlier. Sales rose 18.4 percent, to $583.6 million, from $492.9 million in last year's second quarter. Analysts, on average, expected earnings, excluding items, of 67 cents per share and net earnings of 59 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter sales were projected by the company to rise by 13 to 15 percent, and net earnings were expected to be 39 cents to 44 cents per share. The company raised its full-year sales forecast range by 1 percentage point to call for an increase of 14 percent to 16 percent. The company also raised its full-year net earnings estimate to a range of $2.54 to $2.59 per share, from a previous range of $2.44 to $2.54 per share. Tupperware also expects full-year adjusted earnings of between $2.77 and $2.82 per share, a 5 cents per share improvement.
