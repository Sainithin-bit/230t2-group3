 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) said on Thursday the European Commission should continue to investigate U.S. chipset maker Qualcomm ( QCOM.O ) over complaints of overcharging customers, despite a patent agreement struck between Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) and Qualcomm. 

 "We're still in the same position, absolutely," said Ericsson spokeswoman Ilyana Guzman. Nokia and Qualcomm said late on Wednesday they had settled a long-running dispute, a move which boosted shares in both companies. Ericsson and several other companies, including Nokia, had called on the European Commission to investigate and stop what they called anti-competitive conduct in the licensing of patents for 3G mobile technology. Guzman said Ericsson had a licensing agreement with Qualcomm from 1999, but she declined to discuss details of the agreement. In May, the director general of the Commission's competition directorate said its probe into Qualcomm was "ongoing and active". (Reporting by  Adam Cox ; Editing by Paul Bolding)
