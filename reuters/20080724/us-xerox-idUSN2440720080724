 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ) on Thursday posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings as revenue improved on strong sales of printing supplies and color equipment. 

 The company, the world's No. 1 supplier of digital printer and document management services, also said it would buy back another $1 billion of its own stock and maintained its full-year profit outlook. Net income fell to $215 million, or 24 cents a share, from $266 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs, the profit was 29 cents a share, beating analysts' forecasts of 24 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 8 percent to $4.53 billion, outpacing analysts' estimates of $4.46 billion. Total revenue from color printers, supplies and services -- which are far more profitable than black and white products, were up 11 percent. Xerox said the weak economy created "challenges for our business with large enterprises," but results from its small and mid-size business markets were positive. In addition, demand for document services has risen. "Our annuity-based global business led to steady revenue growth this quarter along with earnings and cash in line with our expectations," Chief Executive Anne Mulcahy said in a statement. Xerox expects third-quarter 2008 earnings per share in the range of 28 cents to 30 cents per share, and stood by its full-year earnings expectations of $1.26 to $1.30 per share. Both forecasts were in line with analysts estimates. Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said there may be reason for optimism about sales of new equipment. "We believe management is approaching guidance conservatively at this point, given weakness in the U.S., and believe upside may be possible given high demand for Xerox' new production color devices ... and restructuring benefit that should ramp through the fourth quarter," she said. Xerox stock closed on Wednesday at $14.03 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has declined 15 percent so far this year, while shares of Japan's Canon ( 7751.T ) trading on the New York Stock Exchange are up 6 percent year to date. Earlier, Canon posted a 12 percent decline in quarterly profit due to sluggish copier demand and a stronger yen. The company said demand was slow in North America for its office equipment, particularly copiers, and weakness was spreading to Europe. Shares were down 17 cents to $13.86 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Franklin Paul ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
