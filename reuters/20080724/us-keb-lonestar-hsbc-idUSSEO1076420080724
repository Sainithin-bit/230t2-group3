 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea will soon launch a review to decide whether to approve the $6.3 billion sale of 51 percent stake in Korea Exchange Bank 004940.KS to HSBC Holdings plc ( HSBA.L ), a local paper reported on Thursday. 

 The Chosun Ilbo daily, citing an unidentified government source, said officials planned to launch the long-delayed process before the July 31 deadline for HSBC's offer to buy control of KEB 004940.KS from U.S. private equity firm Lone Star LS.UL. U.K.-based HSBC agreed last September to buy the stake in KEB, South Korea's No. 6 bank, in a deal that could propel it into the top ranks of Asia's third-largest banking market. But the sale has been mired legal wranglings and controversy due to questions about Lone Star purchase of KEB in 2003. In a statement responding to the report, South Korea's top financial regulator, the Financial Services Commission, said only that it was in discussions with relevant ministries on the best resolution to the situation. A regulatory review could be seen as a turnaround from the government's previous insistence that it would make a decision on the KEB sale only when all legal disputes surrounding Lone Star's South Korean investments were resolved. Former government officials and executives of KEB still face allegations that Lone Star's purchase of KEB was illegal. A verdict on that case is expected by the end of the year. Despite the deadlock, HSBC is poised to extend the deadline on its bid before the deal falters, Britain's Times newspaper reported on Wednesday, quoting unnamed sources close to HSBC. The paper added that HSBC could also seize the opportunity to renegotiate the price it is paying for its entry into the South Korean banking market. Richard Wacker, KEB's chief executive officer, also said on Thursday the deal could go on. "I'm hopeful and confident that we can continue to keep people committed to the deal," a KEB spokeswoman quoted him as saying. KEB shares ended down 0.4 percent to 13,750 won, lagging the wider market's  .KS11  2.2 percent rise.
