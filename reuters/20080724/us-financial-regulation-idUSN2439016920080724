 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of the Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday that his agency should oversee investment banks under a new regulatory regime aimed at averting another credit crisis. 

 But at a congressional hearing on how to modernize a regulatory structure that has not kept pace with dramatic shifts in the financial system, a top Federal Reserve official stressed that the central bank must directly supervise all firms that borrow from the Fed. Both SEC Chairman Christopher Cox and Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Timothy Geithner said that the current patchwork of regulatory agencies, much of which dates back to the Great Depression of the 1930s, deserved part of the blame for the year-long financial market turmoil. "The regulatory framework in the United States was designed in a different time for a very different type of financial system than the one we have today," Geithner told the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. The rise of investment banks and lightly regulated hedge funds has blurred the regulatory lines, and reform must establish clear responsibility and authority for overseeing the various types of financial firms, he said. Where that power will rest is still unclear. The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed a framework that would merge the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and also broaden the Fed's supervisory scope. However, Cox urged Congress to give the SEC authority over investment banks, noting that the agency already has responsibility over the securities business and financial markets in which they operate. "We don't need to start from scratch," he told the committee. "Instead we can build on what has worked, take lessons from what hasn't worked, and modernize the current system to reflect developments in the markets." The Fed currently supervises commercial banks but because the central bank serves as lender of last resort when banks run into trouble, it has the authority to examine bank records and set capital standards to ensure that they are sound. However, during the current crisis, the Fed extended its lending operations to investment banks as well in an effort to keep the financial system from crumbling, and has sought Congressional authority to supervise those firms more closely. Cox said Congress needed to recognize that the two types of banks operate differently and therefore need different regulatory oversight and structure, a point that the Fed has also stressed. "The SEC, as the supervisory authority focused on the securities business and markets, should be vested with the responsibility for implementing this modified framework, as well for closely coordinating with other relevant supervisory agencies," he said. Separately, Cox said in the Wall Street Journal that the SEC was looking at more ways to prevent speculators from distorting financial markets by selling shares in companies that they don't actually own. Last week, the SEC issued an emergency order restricting the practice, known as "naked short-selling." (Additional reporting by  David Lawder ; Writing by  Emily Kaiser )
