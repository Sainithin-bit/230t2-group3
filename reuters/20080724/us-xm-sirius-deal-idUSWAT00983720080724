 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A majority of members of the Federal Communications Commission have reached an agreement to conditionally approve Sirius Satellite Radio Inc's ( SIRI.O ) purchase of XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc XMSR.O, a source familiar with the agency review said on Thursday. 

 The three Republicans on the five-member commission have agreed in principle to vote in favor of a proposal that would let the deal proceed as long as the companies meet a series of conditions to protect consumers and preserve competition, the source said. (Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
