 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Three U.S. newspaper publishers, faced with vanishing advertising, issued gloomy forecasts for the rest of the year on Thursday and urged investors to wait for the economy to recover. 

 McClatchy Co ( MNI.N ), EW Scripps Co ( SSP.N ) and Lee Enterprises Inc ( LEE.N ) all reported lower profits in the most recent quarter -- at least partly because of lower newspaper ad revenue. The three publishers said it was unlikely results would improve in the second half and urged investors and employees to focus on the long term. McClatchy shares fell 5 percent to $4.74, Lee dropped 13.6 percent to $3.56, and Scripps shed 7.5 percent to $8.51, all on the New York Stock Exchange. McClatchy, which publishes 30 daily newspapers including the Miami Herald and Sacramento Bee, said net income fell to $19.7 million, or 24 cents a share, from $34.5 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, profit met analysts' expectations. Ad revenue fell 16.8 percent to $406.3 million. McClatchy Chief Executive Gary Pruitt sought to soothe investor worries about company prospects, but did not say when he thought the economy would improve. "We know that economic slowdowns do not last forever and our 151-year-old company has been successful by taking a long-term view and staying true to our strategic plan," he said in a statement. While analysts said an economic recovery would help newspaper publishers, classified advertising -- a crucial profit generator in years past -- was probably gone for good. "The classified economic model is broken," said Outsell Inc media analyst Ken Doctor. "It was getting strained before the recession, and now it is broken." SCRIPPS At EW Scripps, which owns the Rocky Mountain News and more than a dozen other newspapers as well as 10 television stations, newspaper revenue fell 13 percent on a 20 percent drop in classified ad sales, a typical if gut-wrenching decline. Scripps forecast a drop of 13 percent to 15 percent in newspaper revenue in the third quarter because of continued weakness in classified and local advertising. Net income fell to $51.2 million, or 94 cents a share, on charges related to a spinoff. Lee, which publishes more than 50 daily newspapers including the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, said third-quarter net income slumped to $3.5 million, or 6 cents per share, from $22.5 million, or 49 cents per share, a year earlier. "We believe the advertising slump will reverse when the economy improves, and we continue to position our company to weather the downturn and remain strong," said Lee CEO Mary Junck on a conference call. The results Thursday are similar to those of New York Times Co ( NYT.N ), Gannett Co Inc ( GCI.N ) and Media General Inc ( MEG.N ), which all just reported declining earnings. While the companies are pinning their hopes on a recovery, much of the problem has nothing to do with macroeconomic issues and began years ago, when Craiglist.org and other Internet sites began gutting the newspapers of classified ads. The publishers have been unable to come up with other ways to replace the lost advertising revenues . Few of the alternatives advanced by the futurists and seers -- such as forsaking paper all together and going online-only -- are seen as doable without harming the company. Publishers said they will continue to rely on traditional remedies like cutting costs, reexamining dividends and tiptoeing through small Internet acquisitions and investments. "We are committed to doing more if revenues decline further in the second half," McClatchy's Pruitt said. "Our board will meet during the third quarter to consider dividend policies and we will look at additional cost-saving measures as necessary." He declined to elaborate on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. McClatchy said it expects to continue meeting its debt obligations. The company has been trying to cut expenses, and earlier this year trimmed its work force by about 1,400 positions, or 10 percent. (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
