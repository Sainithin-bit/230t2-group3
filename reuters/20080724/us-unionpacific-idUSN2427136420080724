 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - No. 1 U.S. railroad Union Pacific Corp ( UNP.N ) reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as strong freight rates offset rising fuel costs, flooding in the U.S. Midwest and lower freight volumes. 

 "Although high fuel prices and a soft economy present challenges, we remain committed to ongoing productivity and customer service initiatives as we look forward to achieving a record year," Chief Executive Jim Young said in a statement. Union Pacific executives told analysts during a conference call that freight volumes would remain weak through the rest of the year, but rates would stay strong. The Omaha, Nebraska-based company reported second-quarter net income of $531 million, or $1.02 per share, up from $446 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts' average earnings forecast was 92 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Union Pacific estimated that the widespread flooding in the Midwest in June reduced earnings by 5 cents per share. "The railroad is putting in an impressive performance and continuing to deliver," said Shawn Campbell, principal of Campbell Asset Management, which manages assets of $100 million. Campbell Asset sold off its Union Pacific shares last year but continues to follow the stock. "We may have sold this one too early," Campbell said. Union Pacific said second-quarter revenue rose 13 percent to $4.57 billion. Analysts had expected $4.49 billion. Rail carloads fell 3 percent to 2.37 million. Agricultural product carloads were up 11 percent, but automotive shipments fell 20 percent, reflecting the problems of the U.S. auto industry, which is experiencing its worst sales in a decade. Like other major U.S. railroads, Union Pacific has reported rising profits in recent quarters as firm rates have more than compensated for a weak economy and lower freight volumes. Union Pacific said it expects freight volumes to be down 1 percent to 2 percent in the third quarter and down around 1 percent for the year. It said it expects to increase its core freight rates by 5 percent to 6 percent this year. U.S. railroads have also benefited from the commodities boom, with shipments of agricultural products, coal and metals staying strong despite the weakening economy. "The question is what happens if the commodities boom starts to fray," Campbell said. "If the boom turns to bust, then there is no place that they (Union Pacific) will be able to hide." Union Pacific shares were up 77 cents, or 1 percent, to $78.10 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Nick Carey , editing by Lisa Von Ahn and John Wallace)
