 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Monday it would not hear an appeal by drug maker Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ) that centers on how much leeway appeals courts should have in overruling the findings of lower courts in patent cases. 

 In the latest in a series of major patent cases, the high court declined to review whether a specialized patent appeals court in Washington, D.C. can scrap key patent interpretations made by district court judges during an appeal.
