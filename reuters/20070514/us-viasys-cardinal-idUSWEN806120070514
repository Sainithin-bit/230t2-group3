 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cardinal Health Inc. ( CAH.N ) said on Monday that it would acquire Viasys Healthcare Inc. VAS.N, which makes medical products for respiratory care and other uses, for about $1.42 billion. 

 Cardinal Health, one of the top three U.S. drug distributors, plans to make a cash tender offer for Viasys for $42.75 per share. That is a roughly 35 percent premium over Viasys' closing stock price on Friday, but the shares rose slightly above the offering price in morning trading. The deal would expand Cardinal's reach in the acute-care and surgical arenas and strengthen the company's presence overseas. "We think that this is a logical acquisition for the company as it continues to broaden its product offering in an effort to own the entire ICU setting," said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan in a note to clients. She rates the stock at "buy." The deal is worth $1.42 billion, based on 33,279,330 Viasys shares outstanding listed in the company's most recent quarterly filing. Including the assumption of debt, Cardinal would pay $1.5 billion. Viasys, which had revenue of $610 million last year, focuses on respiratory, neurology, medical disposable and orthopedic products. The deal also gives Cardinal, which generates the vast majority of its sales and profits in the United States, a presence in overseas markets that it has sought, analysts said. "This transaction fits nicely with some of their other offerings," said A.G. Edwards analyst Andrew Speller, who rates the stock "buy." "The thing that probably drew Cardinal to this transaction is the international exposure." Viasys has more than 7,000 hospital customers in 100 countries, with about 40 percent of its revenue coming from outside the United States. Cardinal said the deal, which it expects to complete this summer, would make it a leader in the more than $4 billion respiratory care market and complement its medical disposables business. Cardinal, whose products include drug infusion pumps and pharmacy automation systems, affirmed its earnings forecast of $3.32 to $3.40 per share from continuing operations, excluding special items, for the fiscal year ending in June. It expects the Viasys acquisition to hurt profit by up to 10 cents per share in fiscal 2008. But Cardinal repeated the 2008 forecast it previously provided of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, which also includes using proceeds from the sale of its Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment to buy back stock. Cardinal said in January it would sell its PTS unit for about $3.3 billion to Blackstone Group. Morgan Stanley analyst David Veal said buying Viasys would help Cardinal sustain earnings growth of 15 percent to 20 percent without sacrificing returns on capital. "The proposed acquisition of Viasys marks the company's return to disciplined acquisitions to augment its already healthy organic growth over the long term," said Veal, who rates the stock at "overweight." Cardinal shares were up 6 cents at $69.13 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade, while Viasys rose $11.61, or 36.8 percent, to $43.16. (Additional reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  in New York)
