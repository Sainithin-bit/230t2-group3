 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - LendingTree LLC, a unit of Barry Diller's Internet conglomerate IAC/InterActiveCorp ( IACI.O ), said it laid off 440 workers, or 20 percent of its work force, amid the U.S. housing downturn. 

 The cuts were announced Friday, and made in Charlotte, North Carolina; Irvine, California and Jacksonville, Florida, spokeswoman Rebecca Anderson said. LendingTree is based in Charlotte. "Problems in the subprime market are causing spillover effects, and our margins are being squeezed across loan types and products," Anderson said. LendingTree collects fees by matching prospective borrowers with offers from lenders. Many lenders have tightened their loan standards in recent months, especially for subprime borrowers, who have weaker credit histories. Earlier this month, IAC said operating profit at LendingTree fell 99 percent to $127,000, as revenue declined 12 percent to $100 million. IAC bought LendingTree in 2003 for what it has said was more than $700 million. Separately, LendingTree on Monday named C.D. Davies chief executive to replace Thomas Reddin, who recently stepped down, and named Bob Harris chief operating officer. Davies was previously chief executive of Wachovia Corp.'s WB.N home loan unit, and Harris was LendingTree's chief marketing officer. Further job cuts aren't planned, Anderson said. "We believe we've taken the necessary steps to get us through the current environment," she said. IAC shares fell 60 cents to $34.25 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq.
