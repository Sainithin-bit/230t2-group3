 STUTTGART, Germany  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE is less of a takeover target now than the group was before it decided in February to review all options including a sale for its loss-making U.S. unit Chrysler Group, it said on Monday. 

 "At that time the risk that others would take decisions for us certainly was dramatically higher than it is today," Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told a news conference. He also said that management had been too optimistic on the development of earnings when the merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler was first struck in 1998. "We overestimated the potential of synergies," Zetsche said.
