 LONDON  (Reuters) - The world's richest countries have failed to keep their promises to increase aid to poor countries, the head of the International Monetary Fund said on Monday, before a weekend meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Eight industrial nations in Germany. 

 "So far, we have not seen much of this promised higher aid especially in sub-Saharan Africa," IMF chief Rodrigo Rato said in text prepared for a speech to members of the UK Parliament. "Moreover, this higher aid needs to be disbursed in a more predictable way and harmonized across different donors," he added. G8 finance ministers from the United States, Japan, Italy, France, Canada, Germany, Britain and Russia pledged in 2005 at a summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, to more than double aid to poor countries by 2010, push for a global trade deal under the Doha Round, cancel debts of highly indebted poor countries, and improve assistance for health and education. The G8 has so far kept its promise on delivering debt relief, last year writing off the debts of 19 of the world's most impoverished countries. It also has increased funding for the global fight against HIV/AIDS and better education, but has lagged on promises of increased aid and trade, with countries haggling over details of a trade agreement. Figures by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in April said aid to poor nations totaled$103.9 billion in 2006, down from $106 billion the year before. The United States was the single biggest donor in 2006 with $22.7 billion of aid, but that was down 20 percent from 2005 and represented 0.17 percent of its gross national income. Rato will attend the G8 meeting on May in the German resort of Schwielowsee near Berlin.
