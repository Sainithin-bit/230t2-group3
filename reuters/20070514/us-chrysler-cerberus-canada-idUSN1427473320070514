 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The Canadian Auto Workers (CAW) union said on Monday it will seek a written guarantee from Cerberus Capital Management that no jobs would be cut at Chrysler Group factories in Canada through the term of the current contract. 

 Cerberus agreed to take a majority stake in Chrysler Group for $7.4 billion. "The intent is to get a guarantee," CAW President Buzz Hargrove told a group of reporters, adding that the union's message to Chrysler's new majority owners would be "not one job (lost) as a result of this new ownership structure." The CAW's current contract with Chrysler expires in September 2008. The union represents about 10,000 Chrysler workers at the No. 3 automaker's factories in Canada. Hargrove said he would meet on Tuesday with Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda and representatives of Cerberus in Detroit.
