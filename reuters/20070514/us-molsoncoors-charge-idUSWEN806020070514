 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Molson Coors Brewing Co. ( TAP.N ) said on Monday it would record a non-cash charge in the second quarter after a court upheld a notice of intention by Foster's Group Ltd. FGL.AX to end a deal it had with Molson Canada to brew Fosters for the U.S. market. 

 Molson Coors, formed by the 2005 merger of the Canadian brewer with U.S. rival Adolph Coors Co., said the charge is related to the Foster's intangible, which had a carrying value of $24.6 million as of April 1. The maker of Molson Canadian and Coors Light said it was still evaluating whether to take additional impairment charges associated with the fixed assets it used to make Foster's for the United States. But the company, whose shares fell $1.13, or 1.2 percent, to $91.43 on the New York Stock Exchange, said it did not expect a material adverse impact on its operating results.
