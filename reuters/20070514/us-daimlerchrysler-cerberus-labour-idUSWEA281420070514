 STUTTGART, Germany  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE said a deal to sell its loss-making U.S. unit Chrysler Group to Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL was not dependent on reaching a collective bargaining agreement with the UAW that would cut labor costs to a competitive level. 

 The sale is "not conditional on any aspects of a collective bargaining agreement", DaimlerChrysler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche told a conference call, adding that it was conditional on its supervisory board agreeing to the deal but this was a just a technicality. Chief Financial Officer Bodo Uebber said the company would tender for legacy Chrysler bonds by the third quarter.
