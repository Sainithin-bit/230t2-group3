 DARMSTADT, Germany  (Reuters) - Two former Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) managers face possible jail sentences on Monday and Siemens could have to pay back 98 million euros ($133 million) it made as a result of bribes paid to Italy's Enel ( ENEI.MI ). 

 A German judge will deliver his verdict on the former employees, who admit paying 6 million euros to managers at the Italian utility between 1999 and 2002 in order to win turbine contracts but deny illegal bribery on a point of law. The case has played out against the background of an ever-widening series of criminal investigations into suspected bribery and corruption at Siemens, one of the world's biggest electrical and engineering conglomerates. The corruption scandals forced the resignations of the company's chief executive and its chairman in the past few weeks, creating a power vacuum at the industrial giant. In his summing up last week, Chief Prosecutor Ulrich Busch demanded a jail sentence of three-and-a-half years for 63-year-old Andreas Kley, who was finance chief of Siemens's turbines unit at the time. Both Kley and his co-defendant Horst Vigener deny illegal bribery on the grounds that it was not illegal under German law in force at the time to pay bribes outside Germany unless the bribes were paid to public officials. Much of the case has centered on whether the managers to whom the bribes were paid at Enel, then controlled by the Italian state, were in fact public officials. The law in Germany has since been changed. Kley also denies breach of trust, saying that his actions -- which he says he carried out on his own authority -- benefited Siemens to the tune of business worth 450 million euros. Busch rejected this argument in his summing up, saying that the maze of routes the money took from Siemens accounts through funds in Lichtenstein, Dubai and Monte Carlo was reminiscent of the methods of organized crime gangs. He also said that Kley, who quit in 2004 with a 1.8 million-euro payoff after irregularities emerged, had been in a sufficiently senior position to understand that his actions clearly contravened the company's corporate governance policy. Busch has also demanded that Siemens, though not itself on trial, should pay 98 million euros in gains made as a result of the bribery to the state of Hesse. Siemens argues that no illegal bribery occurred, that it has already been punished in an Italian court and that in any case it did not profit in the long run after it agreed a settlement with Enel. Busch has demanded a lesser sentence of 18 months for Horst Vigener, 73, who says he carried out the orders of others to pay the bribes and had recently returned to work after a period of illness at the time.
