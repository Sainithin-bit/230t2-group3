 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Media conglomerate News Corp. 

 NWSa.N said on Monday it will offer members of Dow Jones & Co. Inc.'s DJ.N controlling family, the Bancrofts, a seat on News Corp.'s board if they approve a $5 billion buyout offer. In a letter sent to members of the family on Friday, News Corp. Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch promised to preserve the journalistic integrity of Dow Jones' flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, and said he would establish an editorial board to oversee the news pages. Murdoch also said he would retain current management. Murdoch's News Corp. offered to buy Dow Jones for about $5 billion, or $60 a share, earlier this month, but a representative of the publisher's controlling shareholders said at the time they would vote against the bid. The takeover would make Murdoch a major player in global financial news. In the letter, obtained by Reuters, Murdoch wrote: "I would appoint a member of the Family to the Board of News Corporation. The family has been an excellent steward of Dow Jones for many generations. I would hope that including a family member on the Board would help alleviate any concerns about maintaining journalistic integrity and ensure good communication between the family and News Corporation going forward." Murdoch also wrote he would make investments that would grow the business, particularly at the Wall Street Journal's Washington, DC, bureau, and would make digital media investments. Murdoch added he would welcome an opportunity to meet members of the family, board, management and the newsroom for them to review his proposal in further detail. A Dow Jones spokeswoman said the company was aware of the letter, but declined further comment. A representative for the Bancroft family was not immediately available for comment. Dow Jones' shares closed 1.3 percent higher at $53.77.
