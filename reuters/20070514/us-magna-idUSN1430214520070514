 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Shares of Magna International MGa.TO were a touch lower on Monday as investors assessed the potential impact of the Canadian auto parts maker's failed bid for Chrysler Group. 

 Magna had been viewed as the front runner to win the battle for the Chrysler Group, but DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE said it would sell 80.1 percent of the struggling U.S. unit to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL for $7.4 billion. Shares of Magna shed C$2.79, or 3 percent, to C$90.71 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. In New York, the stock fell $1.93, or 2.3 percent, to C$81.99. Magna, which had a partnership with Canadian buyout firm Onex Corp. ( OCX.TO ) in its bid for Chrysler, has a lot riding on what happens at Chrysler, its biggest customer. Indeed, some analysts believe that possible plant closures by Cerberus could be positive for Magna, despite the potential loss of a big chunk of business. That's because Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) could well increase production to make up for the lost output from Chrysler, which would entail beefing up their part orders from Magna. "Maybe Cerberus comes in, starts shutting down facilities and cutting capacity to try and lower costs, so Chrysler could shrink as a customer," said an analyst who requested anonymity. "But you could argue that GM and Ford could just simply benefit from that anyway and Magna would sell more to GM and Ford." Magna currently gets about 25 percent of its $24 billion in annual sales from DaimlerChrysler, and about half of that comes from the Chrysler unit. Magna Chairman Frank Stronach said last week that a $1.5 billion investment the company had secured from Russian businessman could make its play for Chrysler more attractive to DaimlerChrysler. The Canadian Auto Workers union, which represents about 10,000 employees at Chrysler factories in Canada described the deal between Chrysler and Cerberus as "worrisome" as the point of private equity is "not to grow the business." Magna said the company is "looking forward" to working with the automaker's management and Cerberus to ensure a healthy Chrysler. "Magna respects the decision reached by Daimler and is confident our long-standing and mutually beneficial relationships with Daimler and Chrysler will continue," the company said in a short, e-mailed statement. DaimlerChrysler was created in 1998 through the merger of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and U.S.-based Chrysler Corp. Its divisions include the Mercedes Car Group, Chrysler Group and the Truck Group.
