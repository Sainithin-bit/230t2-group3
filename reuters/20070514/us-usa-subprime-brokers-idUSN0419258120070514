 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Money may not grow on trees but for a while it seemed to grow on houses, and Colleen Moorhead knew exactly where to turn when she needed to harvest some cash. 

 With a few phone calls, broker Joyce DeAngelo could put Moorhead and her husband into a new mortgage and cut them a check. They used more than $100,000 in cash they netted from the refinancing for living expenses and renovations. Between 2001 and 2006, the Moorheads refinanced their three-bedroom San Diego home at least nine times, county records show. But mortgage broker DeAngelo didn't work for free. Each new loan carried up to $13,000 in fees, along with prepayment penalties, and the Moorheads fell deeper in debt. A marginal presence in the industry 20 years ago, mortgage brokers have become the face of the $10 trillion home-loan industry, the single point of contact between a sophisticated financial world and borrowers committing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy a home. Brokers often present themselves as disinterested parties, but the industry feeds on fees from lenders and bonuses when they complete a deal. Moorhead and her husband now owe $603,000, up from $196,000 when they started, and more than $10,000 over what their house is worth, according to one online estimate. They're likely to lose it soon if they can't somehow make payments greater than their monthly income. Their broker, DeAngelo, said she tried to save them from financial disaster, but her client kept wanting to refinance. "I told her every time that she can't keep doing this, she's going to lose her house," DeAngelo said, adding that she gave Moorhead tips on straightening up her finances that were mostly ignored. "She has no one else to blame." As the real estate boom of the last half-decade turns to bust, homeowners like Moorhead say they feel betrayed by brokers who profited from bad advice and saddled them with loans they couldn't afford. "It seemed like she was a gift from God or something," Moorhead said. "But she's a wolf in sheep's clothing." FOOT SOLDIERS Brokers like DeAngelo helped dramatically expand the U.S. housing market in the first half of this decade, extending loans to risky borrowers like Moorhead who because of bad credit, lack of cash, or lack of a steady job were considered "subprime" borrowers. Some 403,000 brokers handled 68 percent of all loans in 2004, according to the research firm Wholesale Access. Commission-based pay varied widely, although an experienced subprime loan officer at a brokerage or bank could earn $150,000 with a reasonable amount of effort in 2003, estimated researcher Christine Clifford. Some newspaper reports talked of brokers who made well into six figures. Brokers' ranks swelled in the 1990s when lenders began to offer them incentive payments for doing loans. In return, lenders gained a flexible, aggressive sales force to deal with booming demand and a proliferation of new loan variations. Consumers looked to brokers to guide them through mountains of paperwork and a maze of loan offers to the promised land of home ownership. Many assumed that brokers were required to offer them the best possible deal. But generally they are not required by law to act in a consumer's best interest, and their own profits rise when they sell higher-interest loans that cost consumers more. Brokers as a whole have encouraged the notion that they are on consumers' side. The Web site of the National Mortgage Brokers Association called a mortgage broker an "expert mentor" for home buyers until congressional criticism in February prompted the trade group to change it. It now says that the broker is "a knowledgeable professional." Brokers were ready to do business as greed or fear drove borrowers into a housing market already strong and starting to get top heavy. After the collapse of the stock market in 2001, condos and McMansions became the get-rich-quick scheme of choice for speculators, who would buy new properties before they were built and "flip" them when they were finished. "You saw your brother-in-law make an easy $60,000 or $80,000 and you thought, 'I should get into this because I'm obviously smarter than my brother-in-law,'" said Steve Johnson, director of MetroStudy, a real-estate consulting firm in Riverside, California. Others worried that the booming market would leave them behind. "It caused people to believe that if they didn't buy now, they were never going to be able to have a home of their own, and therefore extended themselves beyond any historic standards," said Angelo Mozilo, chief executive and chairman of the largest U.S. mortgage lender, Countrywide Financial, at a recent presentation. Many consumers showed little interest in the details of their loans. "I could put something in front of them that says they're going to give me their first-born child and a million dollars a year for the next 20 years - they'll sign it," said San Angelo, Texas, broker Martin Farris. Harry Dinham, president of the broker trade group, said consumers need to get quotes from several brokers to avoid getting ripped off. "You have to believe in the marketplace," he said. BEWILDERING OPTIONS The marketplace could be bewildering for subprime borrowers, as people with little financial savvy were sold sophisticated financial instruments. A recent Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies report concluded that "the lack of understanding of market conditions leaves many consumers prone to simply paying too much for mortgage credit." Once they settled on a broker, consumers were often not shown the right options. "We have never even met a borrower who was given a choice between fixed (conventional loans) and ARM (adjustable rate mortgage) on subprime," said Jordan Ash, head of the Financial Justice Center at the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now. The complexity could be overwhelming. The fixed-rate, 30-year mortgage that had long been the industry standard was eclipsed by adjustable-rate loans that promised low monthly payments for an initial period before increasing by as much as six percentage points. Some of these loans put borrowers deeper in debt every month, as the payments were not enough to cover interest costs. Those who didn't have a down payment were able to borrow the entire cost of the house by splitting it between two mortgages. In addition to those who gave poor advice, some unscrupulous brokers encouraged and abetted fraud, as consumers struggled to understand their loans and lenders scrapped for their business. Particularly problematic was the "stated income" loan, which didn't require borrowers to prove income or other assets in exchange for a slightly higher interest rate. They were nicknamed "liar loans" within the industry. One lender checking a small sample of applications against federal tax forms found that almost 60 percent of loans had income exaggerated by more than 50 percent, according to an April 2006 Mortgage Asset Research Institute study. One borrower who has multiple sclerosis and is confined to a wheelchair, Monica Wray, 41, of Temecula, California, said she was surprised when she checked her loan application later that she owned a cleaning business. "I laughed, because I can't even clean my own house," Wray said. Brokerage Fidelity Capital Funding said the broker did not lie on the application. "He talked to her and she said she owned a cleaning service and made a certain amount of money, and that's what he used to qualify her on," said sales manager Tom Calise, the supervisor of broker Nick Minielli, who declined to comment. WILD WEST Incentives offered by lenders made matters worse. Known as "yield spread premiums," these cash payments, often 1 percent or 2 percent of the price of the loan, encouraged brokers to steer consumers into loans with higher interest rates than they may otherwise have qualified for. Averaging nearly $1,900 per transaction, yield spread premiums can be found in 85 to 90 percent of all loans originated by brokers, according to a study by Harvard University Professor Howell Jackson. Older borrowers who found their mortgage through a broker paid more in fees than those who borrowed directly from lenders, according to a 2003 survey by seniors lobbying group AARP. They also ended up with prepayment penalties more often. Some were steered into subprime loans even if their credit was good. BasePoint Analytics, a company that monitors fraud in the real estate industry, estimates that 14 percent of subprime borrowers could have qualified for a regular loan with more favorable terms. Demand for subprime mortgages peaked in 2003 and lenders found themselves in the unusual position of fighting for brokers' business to keep their business growing. Jesse Hamby worked for three different lenders over a few years around Nashville, making sure applications kept rolling in from brokers. Sometimes he would walk into a broker office and find up to 10 other lenders looking at exactly the same loan applications. "I could not believe what a Wild West business it was," he said. "You did everything you could to get them to give you those loans." Lenders' profit margins dropped faster than their costs after 2003, resulting in fewer loans for account executives -- 56 per month in 2004, down from 120 in 2003, according to Stratmor Group. Brokers also were able to grease the loan process by colluding with home appraisers, who could value the home at more than it was worth to get a bigger loan. "They will go from appraiser to appraiser until they get what they want," said veteran Alabama appraiser Judith Haney, who is enraged about lax enforcement of standards in her profession. STATE LAWS While 19 states currently require brokers to obtain a license, a process that can include education and a criminal background check, 12 states require brokers only to register with the state. Existing standards are ignored in some states, say brokers such as San Antonio, Texas' Farris, who want laws on the books enforced before new ones are made. Calls by the Harvard Housing group and others for Congress to create federal broker legislation or national broker groups to tighten standards for themselves have gone unheeded so far. The industry's trade group is pushing for stronger licensing requirements and enforcement at the state level. Some states are overhauling their laws. A new Minnesota law requires brokers to act in the best interest of borrowers, and prevents refinancings that don't benefit the borrower. But consumer need to take responsibility for their actions as well, said association president Dinham. "The ultimate decision maker needs to be the consumer. All you can do is lay out the options for them," he said. Any changes will come too late for borrowers like Monica Wray. In the house she's owned since 1992, Wray steers her wheelchair around boxes filled with her family's possessions, ready for the moving van. For company, she's got the television and a steady stream of phone calls from brokers. "They call up and say, 'I think I have a product for you,' and I say, 'You can't help me,'" Wray said. "I know they can't -- I need a miracle here." Wray and her husband are 10 months behind on their mortgage payments, but they won't lose their house as long as her husband remains in Okinawa with the Marine Corps, thanks to a law that shields active-duty military members from foreclosure. When he returns, they'll have three months to come up with more than $38,000. "It's really sad when you're going, 'I love you but I don't want you to come back,'" she said.
