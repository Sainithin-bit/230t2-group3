 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler has clinched a deal to sell a majority in its struggling Chrysler Group division to buyout firm Cerberus Capital Management, a person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday. 

 DaimlerChrysler, now the world's fifth-biggest carmaker, will hold a news conference at 1200 GMT to announce the transaction, two sources said. "The deal is done," one of the sources said. DaimlerChrysler declined comment on the sale process that will unwind the spectacular 1998 merger between Daimler-Benz AG and U.S. No. 3 carmaker Chrysler that never lived up to its billing as an automotive marriage made in heaven. DaimlerChrysler stock rose as much as 6.4 percent on the news and was up 6.1 percent at 64.30 euros by 0816 GMT in heavy volume. More than a full day's normal volume had traded in the first hour. A source familiar with the matter had said on Sunday that Cerberus was close to striking a deal to buy Chrysler, putting it in the hands of a private equity owner. Dismayed by its volatile earnings, DaimlerChrysler put Chrysler up for sale in February after the unit posted a loss of nearly $1.5 billion for 2006. The sale would break up a product lineup that yokes American mass-market brands Jeep, Dodge and Chrysler with Germany's luxury Mercedes-Benz line at a time of wrenching restructuring for the U.S. auto industry. "We believe it is time for the showdown and a solution of the issue," said Georg Stuerzer, an analyst at HVB Equity Research. HVB's target price for DaimlerChrysler excluding Chrysler is 67 euros, Stuerzer said, adding: "We believe it is a good opportunity to buy in at current price levels." Private equity firms have been active in recapitalizing the troubled U.S. auto parts sector but a deal for Chrysler would mark the first time a financial buyer has taken control of one of the major automakers. Chrysler Chief Executive Tom LaSorda would continue to run the company while Chrysler's former chief operating officer and Cerberus adviser, Wolfgang Bernhard, would not have an executive role but could have a board seat, two newspapers reported. Cerberus and Chrysler declined to comment. Details on the price or other terms of the offer were not immediately clear. A previous offer by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian of $4.5 billion in cash for Chrysler was rejected. The purchase price is expected to be well below the $36 billion the former Daimler-Benz AG paid for Chrysler Corp. in 1998. Key to the offer is the company's $18 billion in pension and health-care liabilities related to Chrysler's contracts with its United Auto Workers-represented factory workers. Bidders that publicly said they were vying for Chrysler are Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. and Canadian autoparts maker Magna International. Private equity firm Blackstone Group also pursued Chrysler, and was said to be linked up with smaller buyout firm Centerbridge Partners. New York-based Cerberus is a private investment fund that has built a huge private equity and hedge fund practice. Key to its pursuit of Chrysler is the Cerberus's experience with the auto industry and its stake in GM's financing arm. General Motors Corp. sold a 51-percent stake in its financing arm, GMAC, to a consortium led by Cerberus in a deal worth about $14 billion last year. Among the prized assets within Chrysler is its own auto-financing arm. Chrysler, which is in the process of cutting 13,000 jobs, is targeting a return to profitability in 2008. A key hurdle, analysts have said, is the company's ability to clinch a new contract with the UAW that reduces costs, particularly for health care. Chrysler's current four-year contract with the UAW expires in September. DaimlerChrysler has fallen to No. 4 in the U.S. light vehicle market behind Toyota with a 15.4 percent market share this year. The company's sales for all brands are down 2.1 percent in 2007 through April.
