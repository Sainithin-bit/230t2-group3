 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch plans to offer Dow Jones & Co.'s DJ.N controlling Bancroft family a seat on the board of his News Corp. NWSa.N if News Corp's planned purchase of the publisher of The Wall Street Journal goes through, the newspaper said Monday on its Web site. 

 Murdoch also plans to establish an "autonomous editorial board" if the transaction is approved, the newspaper said. News Corp. has offered $5 billion for Dow Jones, valuing the latter at $60 per share.
