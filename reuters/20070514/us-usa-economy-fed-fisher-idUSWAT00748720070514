 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is likely to go through a continued slow period in the beginning of 2007, Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said on Monday. 

 "I do think that we're going to have a slow period here," Fisher told reporters after a speech to the U.S.-China Business Council, the American Council of Life Insurers and the Coalition of Service Industries. "The inventory correction of the auto sector has worked its way through, but the impact of the housing market has yet to work its way through," he said. Fisher's comments come after the U.S. economy posted a sluggish 1.3 percent growth rate in the first three months of the year. Many analysts now believe that number will be revised lower. The U.S. central bank, while noting signs of slow growth, nevertheless says its predominant concern is that rises in nonenergy, nonfood prices, or core inflation, may not ease as hoped. Fisher said that while there are signs that core inflation is receding, he would like more conclusive evidence. "There are some encouraging signs as you sort through the entrails of the components of inflation," he said. However, he added, "One month does not a trend make, and I would like to think that we are going to see a moderation of inflation from the current levels that are being reported, but I'd like to see that verified." He noted higher energy prices, the struggling housing market, and rising food costs have dampened consumer spending appetites, saying: "I'm not surprised to see some pull back on the part of the consumer." Fisher, who is not a voting member on the Federal Reserve's interest-rate setting Federal Open Market Committee this year, warned inflation must be a key focus at the central bank. "I do think it's important that we are especially attentive about inflation because that's one thing that we can impact by virtue of our action and our words," Fisher said in answering questions after speaking. "Once you plant the seed of inflation it's very hard to exorcise that influence on the economy," he cautioned, also saying the United States is running "a very fully employed economy." In his speech, Fisher also said the government needs better growth measures of the service sector. Noting the U.S. economy has shifted from a manufacturing-driven to a services economy, he warned that government measures do not adequately measure growth in this area. "In our efforts to assess the speed limit and engine temperature of the economy, we have plenty of gauges on our dashboard that we can use for evaluating the manufacturing sector," he said. "Yet we are deprived of similarly reliable gauges for measuring capacity utilization and other dynamics of the service sector," he added. The U.S. economy's shift from the manufacturing sector to the service sector has made it difficult to set monetary policy, he said. In particular, he noted, the inability to distinguish between quality improvements and inflation in services means that it is unclear how much growth in nominal GDP is actually reflecting gains in real output or inflation. Fisher noted that as the Chinese economy grows, demand for services there will also grow. "This is good news for U.S. services businesses, because we are king of the global services providers, with an impressive array of sophisticated and high-quality products and services available for sale," he said.
