 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. blue-chip stocks rose on Monday as news that DaimlerChrysler had found a buyer for its beleaguered Chrysler unit boosted automotive shares, but the broader market fell on renewed concerns about the economy's health. 

 Germany's DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE announced that private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management had agreed to buy 80 percent of Chrysler Group in a $7.4 billion deal. Bear Stearns said the Chrysler sale was favorable for both General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and raised its rating on GM stock, which gained about 4 percent. But the boost in the auto sector was offset by selling in shares of major financial companies and manufacturers after a quarterly survey issued by the Philadelphia Federal Reserve showed that forecasters have cut estimates for U.S. economic growth in the second quarter while core inflation and unemployment are likely to hold steady this year. "It's a rest, really. People are waiting to see CPI and some data on the housing market," said Todd Clark, director of stock trading at Nollenberger Capital Partners in San Francisco. "The Dow is getting boosted by industrial components like General Motors, but the broader market is definitely lower." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 20.56 points, or 0.15 percent, to end at 13,346.78. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 2.70 points, or 0.18 percent, at 1,503.15. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 15.78 points, or 0.62 percent, at 2,546.44. During the session, the Dow hit an all-time high of 13,383.76. A string of new records on the Dow and six straight weeks of gains by the S&P 500 index also gave investors a reason to take profits, traders said. The S&P's run higher was its longest in more than two and a half years, matching a six-week advance from early August to mid-September 2004. Market breadth was negative, with decliners beating advancing stocks by about 2 to 1 on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. The Labor Department's Consumer Price Index (CPI), expected on Tuesday, is one of the Federal Reserve's key measures of inflation. Other data due this week includes housing starts and building permits on Wednesday. Among interest-rate sensitive financial stocks that traded down were shares of Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ), which slipped 0.5 percent to $52.86. Among major manufacturers that fell, 3M Co. ( MMM.N ) was down 0.8 percent at $84.83 and General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) declined 1 percent to $36.60. GM shares gained 3.9 percent to $30.62, and Ford shares gained 4.1 percent to $8.71. Ford's founding family said on it was not discussing the sale of its controlling stake in the No. 2 U.S. automaker, even though they met last month with a Wall Street advisory firm. On the Nasdaq, shares of Amgen Inc. ( AMGN.O ) declined 0.4 percent to $56.07 after the U.S. Supreme Court said it would not hear an appeal by the drug maker in a long-standing patent battle with other drug makers over the sale of an anemia treatment. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.39 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.02 billion shares traded, about even with last year's daily average.
