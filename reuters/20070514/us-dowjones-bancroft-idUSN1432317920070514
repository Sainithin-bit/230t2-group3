 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N, is currently meeting regarding an offer from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. NWSa.N for the company, financial television station CNBC reported on Monday. 

 CNBC reported the news after the Wall Street Journal reported that Murdoch sent a letter to the family saying he would offer the Bancrofts a seat on the board of directors if his purchase of the Wall Street Journal publisher went through.
