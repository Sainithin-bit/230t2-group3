 PARIS  (Reuters) - The LU biscuits division of French food 
group Danone ( DANO.PA ) is due to meet trade union 
representatives on Tuesday to discuss possible changes at LU, a 
trade union source said, amid rumors the unit might be sold. 

  "I have been called to a meeting on Tuesday morning at 0930 
(0730 GMT)," the source, who declined to be named, said on 
Sunday.  The source added that LU management had informed trade 
unions that the meeting would be to discuss "changes within the 
biscuit division."  The meeting comes amid market speculation and press reports 
that Danone might sell LU, with U.S. company Kraft Foods 
KFT.N seen as a likely buyer.  Monday's edition of French newspaper Les Echos said there 
was speculation that Danone had already begun talks with Kraft 
over the sale of LU.  Last week, French magazine Challenges said LU could be sold 
for 3.5 billion euros ($4.71 billion). Along with Kraft Foods, 
Challenges said U.S. food group Kellogg ( K.N ) might also be 
interested in the biscuit company.  Officials at Danone and Kraft could not be immediately 
reached to comment on the matter on Sunday.  Danone shares closed up 2.2 percent at 60.02 euros on 
Friday while Kraft shares closed down 0.3 percent at $35.25.  ($1=.7437 Euro)
