 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Shares in Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX and conglomerate Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX were placed on trading halts on Monday pending discussions over Wesfarmers' bid for Coles. 

 The Australian Financial Review said on Monday Wesfarmers was believed to have offered between A$17 and A$17.25 a share for Coles, raising the scrip component of its offer after one of its bidding partners, private equity firm Permira, pulled out. At the top end of the reported range, the bid would be worth about A$20.7 billion ($17.7 billion). The paper, which did not cite sources, also said that because of the sweeter bid, Coles was unlikely to consider a second bid for parts of its operations from rival supermarket chain Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ). Coles had put itself up for sale in February after poor performance in its core food and liquor business.
