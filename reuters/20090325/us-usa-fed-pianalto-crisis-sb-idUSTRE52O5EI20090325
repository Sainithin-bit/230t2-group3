 MAUMEE, Ohio  (Reuters) - A top Federal Reserve official on Wednesday decried the current blame game in Washington around the financial crisis and specifically the bailout of insurance giant American International Group. 

 "I really do think in a time of crisis, it's important that we use our energy to fix the problems that we face, not to affix blame," Sandra Pianalto, President of the Cleveland Fed, said while answering questions after a speech to business leaders in Maumee, Ohio. Hearings should focus on "positive things that can move us forward rather than on mistakes of the past," she said. Pianalto said the Fed has responded appropriately to the sharp rise in demand for liquidity at U.S. banks. "The money we've been generating in this environment is obviously at unprecedented levels," she said.
