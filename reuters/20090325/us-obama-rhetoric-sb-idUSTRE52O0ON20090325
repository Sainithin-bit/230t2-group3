 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama delivered some tough lines at a news conference on Tuesday that focused almost entirely on the economy and barely touched on foreign policy. 

 * Ahead of one of the toughest fights of his young presidency -- a forthcoming battle with Congress over his spending plans -- Obama said he expected changes would be made, but added sharply: "We never expected, when we printed out our budget, that they would simply Xerox it and vote on it. We assume that it has to go through the legislative process." He then assailed those who would criticize the budget for spending too much, adding: "We haven't seen an alternative budget." * Obama got a bit testy when pressed on why he had waited to express outrage about bonus payments given to bailed-out insurance giant AIG, telling a reporter: "It took us a couple of days because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak." * Obama's response to the government being formed in Israel was guarded. Asked how realistic it was to conceive of Palestinians making peace with an Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and a foreign minister accused of insulting Arabs, he said: "It's not easier than it was, but I think it's just as necessary." Netanyahu has shied away from declaring support for the two-state solution that is at the heart of U.S.-led Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts. He has promised the job of foreign minister to ultranationalist Avigdor Lieberman, leader of the Yisrael Beitenu party. * During the hour-long news conference Obama did not discuss the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan. On relations with Iran, he sounded an optimistic if patient tone. "We expect that we're going to make steady progress on this front," he said. * When asked how his race had affected his first two months in office, Obama circled back to the economy, saying Americans were happy to see a black president take the oath of office on January 20, but now all they cared about was whether he could improve the country's economic ills. * The president reinforced his message that the economy was going to improve by highlighting the strong U.S. dollar. He said investors still saw the United States as a good place to put their money because of its political and economic stability. He said there was no need for a single global currency -- a suggestion put forward by China and Russia. (Compiled by Jeff Mason, edited by Howard Goller)
