 BOCA RATON  (Reuters) - A new International Coffee Agreement placing an emphasis on industry sustainability should become official in September as the world's top grower Brazil is expected to join, an International Coffee Organization (ICO) spokesman told Reuters. 

 "On the importing side, we already have enough members who have completed all the procedures for it to come into operation. But on the exporting side it's much more divided," London-based ICO head of operations Jose Sette said in an interview Sunday. Sette was in Boca Raton, Fla., to attend an Issues Management Forum March 23-24. The agreement places an emphasis on sustainability and has a separate advisory body on finance, something that will bring more ideas from the private sector, Sette said. The ICO is confident the agreement, which already has enough votes from importing countries, will be enforced by September, Sette said. The industry needs to develop instruments for the coffee sector, as a whole, to become more sustainable, as there's a lot of concern among producing countries about economic sustainability, Sette said. "They rightly say that if you're not getting the prices that are remunerative and help you keep in business, then you don't have the margin to worry about the environment and social issues," Sette said. Consumers are increasingly interested in buying products that promote social and environmental sustainability. The pending International Coffee Agreement will be the seventh agreement since 1962, according to the ICO website. Currently, exporting countries account for 40 percent of the votes, keeping the agreement's fate largely in the hands of Brazil as it counts for just under 25 percent of the votes, Sette said. "Without Brazil, we need a lot of small countries so it's very difficult for it to happen. There's no problem and they (Brazil) are looking at the possibility of a provisional application," Sette said, adding Brazil is just caught up in its bureaucratic procedure. The world's second biggest coffee grower Vietnam has signed on to the agreement and No. 3 producer Colombia has done a provisional application, Sette said. Major importers, the United States and European Community, have entered the agreement. (Reporting by Marcy Nicholson; Editing by  David Gregorio )
