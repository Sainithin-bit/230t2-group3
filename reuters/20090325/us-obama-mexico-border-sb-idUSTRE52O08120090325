 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that the United States is prepared to "do more" if the additional agents and tools he plans to deploy to the Mexican border to curb smuggling-related violence do not prove effective. 

 "We are going to continue to monitor the situation, and if the steps do not get the job done, then we will do more," Obama said in a nationally televised news conference.
