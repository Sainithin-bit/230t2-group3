 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that the status quo is unsustainable in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and that it is critical for the United States to advance a two-state solution. 

 "It's not easier than it was, but I think it's just as necessary," Obama said in a nationally televised news conference when asked whether the new Israeli government expected to be formed by Likud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu would make peacemaking more difficult. "What we do know is this: that the status quo is unsustainable, that it is critical for us to advance a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own states with peace and security," he said.
