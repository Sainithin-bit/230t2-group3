 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A group of five pension funds, including state funds in Ohio and Texas, is seeking to lead investor lawsuits against Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) over its January 1 acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co. 

 Investors in the class-action case are accusing Bank of America of making "untrue statements" and misleading investors about Merrill's health, even as it was becoming clear that losses were mounting. Investors voted to approve the merger on December 5. Merrill ultimately suffered a $15.84 billion fourth-quarter loss, and Bank of America in January got a government bailout, including $20 billion of new capital, to help it absorb Merrill. "We believe that Bank of America executives had material information that raised serious reservations about the deal, but they did not disclose this information to shareholders," Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray said in a statement. Ohio said the five pension funds are the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio; the Ohio Public Employees Retirement System; the Teacher Retirement System of Texas; Holland's Stichting Pensioenfonds Zorg en Welzijn, Europe's second-largest pension fund; and Sweden's Fjarde AP-Fonden. The funds said they lost $274 million from Bank of America investments in the six months ended January 20, 2009. Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton declined to comment. The bank's shares have lost more than three-quarters of their value since the merger was announced last September 15, and some shareholders have called for Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis to step down or give up his chairman's role. Moody's Investors Service downgraded the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's debt on Wednesday, along with the debt of Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ). On Monday, two of the three largest U.S. pension funds filed a joint motion to become lead plaintiff in the same case: the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers Retirement System, better known as CalPERS and CalSTRS, respectively. Bank of America shares closed 55 cents higher, or 7.7 percent, at $7.70. They had traded at $33.74 before the merger was announced. The case is Sklar v. Bank of America Corp, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Manhattan), No. 09-00580. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Gary Hill )
