 MAUMEE, Ohio  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy should start to recover from "severe recession" in 2010, but is subject to strong downside risks, Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Sandra Pianalto said on Wednesday. 

 "I expect the economy to begin to recover next year as the fiscal stimulus boosts spending and as we work off excess inventories," Pianalto told a meeting of business leaders in Maumee, Ohio. The most worrying risk is that the vicious cycle between damaged financial markets and the weak real economy "feed off one another and become mutually reinforcing," she said. Pianalto is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting body, in 2009. Recent reports on employment, housing, and business investment have been weaker than expected, she said. "We are still in the midst of a severe recession. At 16 months old, the current recession has lasted beyond the 10-month average of the nation's post-World War II recessions. Unfortunately, it will continue for a while longer." Pianalto said the eventual economic rebound would be driven by "expansionary monetary and fiscal policies," especially the federal stimulus that will boost consumer spending. "I expect these initiatives to contribute significantly to an increase in overall economic activity, and our recovery depends on their success. For its part, the Fed has not "run out of ammunition" to counter the economic turmoil, she said. Pumping liquidity into key credit markets via steps such as the Term Asset-Backed Lending Facility and direct purchases of longer-term securities "represent our efforts to lower interest rates and ease credit conditions in a range of markets even when the federal funds rate is near zero."
