 (Reuters) - A fiscal 2010 budget plan is moving through the Democratic-controlled U.S. Congress. While the bill would spend less than President Barack Obama sought, it would largely embrace the president's major initiatives: investing more in education, seeking expanded access to healthcare for those who can't afford it and using federal funds to develop alternative, renewable sources of energy. 

 In February, Obama asked for $3.55 trillion in spending for the fiscal year starting October 1. His plan was estimated to produce a $1.4 trillion deficit. The budget that Congress will to write in the coming weeks in response to Obama's requests will be a complex bill. The rules governing how the budget is approved by Congress and what the document accomplishes also are complicated. Here are some key things to keep in mind: THE RULES OF THE GAME: * While the budget sets broad spending and tax parameters, it doesn't actually make those spending and tax policies happen. Subsequent legislation does that. * The budget cannot be "filibustered" in the Senate. It only needs a simple majority to pass instead of the 60 supporters that regular bills must win to avoid roadblocks. As a result, Democrats ought to be able to push a budget through Congress with little or no Republican support. * Congress can embrace or reject any of the ideas contained in the president's budget proposal. Congress can even disagree with some of the economic assumptions the White House budget is built upon and opt for its own -- meaning the final budget could look quite different from that proposed by Obama. * The document that Congress will try to pass in coming weeks is called the "budget resolution." * The budget resolution does not have the force of law and the president does not sign it. Instead, it is a blueprint that will guide subsequent legislation - tax and appropriations bills that actually spend money on programs contained in the budget or authorization bills that likely would be needed to allow new Obama programs to start, like expanded healthcare. * Congress sometimes fails to pass a budget, but the government typically keeps operating through appropriations measures. The last time that happened was in 2006, when the Republican majorities in the House and Senate could not agree on an election-year budget. Budget experts say it's important to have a budget resolution in place each year so that spending is not done haphazardly. * In years it does pass a budget, Congress is sketching out its priorities and intentions for the coming year as well as looking ahead four years or so. THE PLAYERS: * Liberal Democrats: Led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the budget will be an opportunity to set the stage for more spending on social programs like education that they think were short-changed by the Bush administration. They also applaud Obama for using the budget to call for ending Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy. * Blue Dog Democrats: This group of fiscally conservative Democrats has been frustrated by the huge budget deficits that have made the government's debt burden explode over the past eight years. They have demanded a budget with strict rules outlawing deficit-spending, unless a new emergency arises. Without their votes a budget would be hard to pass. * Moderate Republicans: There aren't many of them left. While they want the federal government's role in citizens' lives to be kept to a minimum, they also support some of the tax policy and social spending Democrats pursue. Last year, Maine Senators Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins voted for the Democrats' budget. * Conservative Republicans. Don't count on them to vote for a Democratic budget. They hate its tax increases on those making more than $250,000 and continued growth in government spending. Ironically, it was the large spending increases they enacted when they controlled Congress and the White House that contributed significantly to the current deficit problem.
