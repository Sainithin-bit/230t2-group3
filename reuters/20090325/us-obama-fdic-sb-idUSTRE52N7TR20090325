 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that the government should look to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp's model for resolving banks when deciding how to structure a federal authority to shut down troubled non-banks. 

 "It actually does these kind of resolutions effectively when it has the tools to do it," Obama said in his second prime-time White House news conference since taking office on January 20. Obama stopped short of saying the FDIC should be given the authority to wind down troubled institutions like insurer AIG, but said the FDIC has an effective model for resolving financial firms.
