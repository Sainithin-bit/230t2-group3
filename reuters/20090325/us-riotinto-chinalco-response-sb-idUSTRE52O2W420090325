 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - China's state-owned aluminum group Chinalco on Wednesday welcomed a decision by Australian competition regulators not to oppose its proposed $19.5 billion tie-up with Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ). 

 The ruling by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission marks an important step in gaining full regulatory clearance, Chinalco said. (Reporting by  James Regan )
