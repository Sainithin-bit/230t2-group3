 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said Wednesday he expects the Democratic-led Congress to pass a massive budget with all of President Barack Obama's major goals. 

 Biden made the comments as he prepared to join Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi for lunch on Capitol Hill. Obama was to meet with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other Senate Democrats later Wednesday. "I'm confident that with the leadership of the speaker and Harry Reid we are going to get our budget with all the major elements intact," Biden, flanked by Pelosi, told reporters.
