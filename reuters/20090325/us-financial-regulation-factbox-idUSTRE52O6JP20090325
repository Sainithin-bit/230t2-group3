 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama and senior congressional Democrats are moving to tighten the financial regulation system to prevent another banking crisis like the one presently shaking economies worldwide. 

 Coming changes likely will affect profits and operations at banks, insurers, credit rating agencies, hedge funds, private equity firms, brokerages, exchanges and other financial institutions, while potentially greatly extending the government's reach into the U.S. financial sector. Here is a look at the major issues: UNWINDING FAILING FIRMS The Obama administration said on Wednesday it will send Congress draft legislation this week seeking power to seize and unwind large, failing financial firms that are not banks. No clear procedure for doing this now exists, as shown recently by the erratic, case-by-case bailouts of firms such as insurer American International Group Inc. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, which already takes over and unwinds failing banks, will be a model. The agency may also be tapped to carry out this new responsibility. SYSTEMIC RISK REGULATOR The Obama administration and lawmakers from both parties in Congress are looking at ways to create a government body that would monitor and manage broad financial risks in the economy. No single agency now has this job. Legislation has been introduced to establish an inter-agency council on financial stability, which would have an independent chairman appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Some lawmakers want to give the systemic risk role to the Federal Reserve. EXECUTIVE PAY Proposals to rein in pay are being driven by a furor over bonuses awarded to AIG executives and by a political backlash from years of soaring compensation for corporate executives. The House Financial Services Committee was slated to vote on Wednesday on a bill to tighten pay limits on banks and other institutions that are getting U.S. government bailout aid. HEDGE FUND REGULATION Geithner and SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro have said they support requiring hedge funds to register with the government. Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the U.S. Senate to require hedge funds to maintain certain records and to file information and cooperate with the SEC. SECURITIZATION House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank wants to bar 100-percent securitization of debt, whether it's mortgages, student loans, auto loans or credit cards. He and some other lawmakers see securitization as a major cause of the financial crisis. Frank is looking at forcing securitizers to retain some portion of loans they make and process. Another possible change would make securitized debt instruments more transparent, while some complex and impenetrable instruments may be banned outright. CREDIT CARDS Legislation to ban credit card practices seen by many lawmakers and regulators as abusive, such as double-cycle billing, has been filed in the Senate and in the House. The House Financial Services Committee may vote on a bill as soon as April 1. MORTGAGE LENDING/SUBPRIME LOANS Cracking down on subprime loans and predatory lending practices is high on Frank's priority list. He has said he hopes the House passes such legislation in April. It would focus on preventing incentives for brokers to steer borrowers into higher interest rate loans; tougher rules for mortgage servicers and securitizers; and more protections for renters who live in foreclosed properties, he said. STUDENT LOANS President Barack Obama's 2010 federal budget proposed ending the giant federally guaranteed student loan program and moving most of the nation's $90 billion in student lending into the direct-loan program run by the U.S. Education Department. The proposal is subject to review by Congress and possible changes. If adopted, the White House said it would save taxpayers more than $4 billion a year and end "entitlements for financial institutions that lend to students." BANK CAPITAL STANDARDS U.S. regulators are expected to craft stricter capital standards that improve upon Basel II standards, which give financial firms flexibility to judge their own risk profiles. Financial institutions will also face new liquidity requirements, which bank regulators expect to issue guidance on during the first half of this year. DERIVATIVES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT Exchange operators have scrambled to build credit default swap clearinghouses since U.S. and European regulators decided in last year they wanted a central counterparty for the products, blamed for exacerbating the credit crisis. IntercontinentalExchange began clearing U.S. index-based CDS on March 9, while rival CME Group has all regulatory approvals. U.S. regulators originally wanted CDS funneled through a central counterparty by the end of 2008. They have agreed in principle to share policing of CDS clearing. But questions remain on whether the Fed, backed by ICE, or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, backed by CME, will take the lead. MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING U.S. lawmakers have pressured the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the rulemaker for U.S. accounting, to relax the mark-to-market rule and give banks a reprieve so they don't mark their toxic assets down to fire sale prices. FASB is set to discuss proposals on April 2 that would let companies exercise more judgment in determining if a market for an asset is inactive and if a transaction is distressed. CREDIT RATING AGENCIES SEC Chairman Schapiro has said more needs to be done to address conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies, which are mostly paid by banks whose products they rate. The SEC is hosting a roundtable on April 15 to get comments on how to improve the credit rating industry. Schapiro has said she would seek more authority from Congress if that's what is needed to properly supervise credit rating agencies. REGULATOR REORGANIZATION Congress is considering merging the SEC and the CFTC, or shutting down or merging bank regulators such as the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Comptroller of the Currency. But movement in this direction, seen as a top priority just a few months ago, is slowing as lawmakers and the Obama administration tackle higher priorities. FANNIE, FREDDIE Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were nationalized in September as mounting foreclosures pushed the mortgage-finance companies toward insolvency. Now that the largest sources of housing finance are in government hands, Washington is using Fannie and Freddie to increase finance in a housing market crisis. When the market stabilizes, U.S. officials will have to determine whether to return the two companies to shareholders or to maintain their strong government ties.
