 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. mortgage loan modification program has "a pretty good chance" of success, though it will take a couple of months to gauge its effect, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday. 

 Geithner told a gathering at the Council on Foreign Relations that plans to modify terms of mortgages in or in danger of default "has a pretty good chance of gaining traction." However, he said it could take up to a couple of months before policymakers can judge the success of the plan. (Reporting by  Pedro Nicolaci da Costa ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
