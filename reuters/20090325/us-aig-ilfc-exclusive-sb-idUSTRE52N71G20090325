 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc's ( AIG.N ) aircraft leasing unit is likely to get bids from at least three private equity groups in the auction's second round set for early April, two sources familiar with the matter said. 

 The three groups seen bidding for International Lease Finance Corp (ILFC) include Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL, Carlyle Group CYL.UL, and Greenbriar Equity Group LLC and Onex Corp ( OCX.TO ), the sources said. AIG, which agreed to help the buyer with financing as part of a revised U.S. aid package, has given more details to potential bidders about the plan, which would involve support of several billion dollars over multiple years, one source said. ILFC, which had a book value of $7.5 billion as of Sept 30, may draw bids of around $5 billion now, the source said. The sources did not want to be named because the auction is private. AIG, Carlyle, Greenbriar and THL declined to comment. Onex was not available for comment. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal )
