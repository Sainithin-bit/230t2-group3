 (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday his administration was attacking the economic crisis on all fronts but cautioned that recovery will take time and patience. He spoke in a nationally televised news conference at the White House. 

 Here are excerpts from Obama's comments on the economy and foreign policy issues. "WE'LL RECOVER" "We'll recover from this recession. But it will take time, it will take patience, and it will take an understanding that when we all work together; when each of us looks beyond our own short-term interests to the wider set of obligations we have to each other "that's when we succeed." "A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY" "We've put in place a comprehensive strategy designed to attack this crisis on all fronts. It's a strategy to create jobs, to help responsible homeowners, to restart lending, and to grow our economy over the long term. And we're beginning to see signs of progress." "This budget is inseparable from this recovery: because it is what lays the foundation for a secure and lasting prosperity. The road to that prosperity is still long, and we will hit our share of bumps and setbacks before it ends." "CAP-AND-TRADE" "We've got to move to a new energy era, and that means moving away from polluting energy sources toward cleaner energy sources. That is a potential engine for economic growth. I think cap-and-trade is the best way, from my perspective, to achieve some of those gains." "DOLLAR IS STRONG" "I would just point out that the dollar is extraordinarily strong right now. And the reason the dollar is strong right now is because investors consider the United States the strongest economy in the world with the most stable political system in the world." "GLOBAL CURRENCY" "I don't believe that there's a need for a global currency." "BORDER COMMUNITIES" "The steps that we've taken are designed to make sure that the border communities in the United States are protected and you're not seeing a spillover of violence and that we are helping the Mexican government deal with a very challenging situation. Now, we are going to continue to monitor the situation. And if the steps that we've taken do not get the job done, then we will do more." "TWO-STATE SOLUTION" "What we do know is this: that the status quo is unsustainable, that it is critical for us to advance a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in their own states with peace and security," he said."
