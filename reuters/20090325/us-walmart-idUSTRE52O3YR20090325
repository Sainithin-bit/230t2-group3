 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), said on Wednesday that it is launching "Your Zone", a new line of home furnishings aimed at teenagers. 

 The collection, which includes bedding, rugs, curtains, pillows and bulletin boards, is arriving in its U.S. Walmart discount stores and is now being sold on its website, Walmart.com. Walmart said the bedding includes comforter sets that are priced from $28 to $40, and sheet sets that are priced from $12 to $24. Furniture and lounge seating will arrive in stores in late spring, it said. To try to boost sales in its home business, Walmart has been adding new home furnishings brands, like Better Homes and Gardens, and remodeling the home section in its stores.
