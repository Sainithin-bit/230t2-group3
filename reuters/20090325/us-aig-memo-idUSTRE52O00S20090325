 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc appeared to advise staffers in its troubled Financial Products division that, if enough returned bonuses than it was unlikely their names would be publicly released, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

 A WSJ.com report cited an internal AIG memo, dated on Friday, that said in reference to the controversial bonuses, "To the extent that we meet certain participation targets, it is not expected that the names would be released, at all." The article, citing a person familiar with the matter, reported the statement was based on the belief within the company that outrage over the payments would likely subside if enough staffers returned their bonuses, as Chief Executive Edward Libby had requested.
