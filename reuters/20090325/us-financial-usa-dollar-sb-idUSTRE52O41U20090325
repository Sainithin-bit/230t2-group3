 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Wednesday said that the dollar is still the world's reserve currency and is likely to remain so for a long time. 

 Asked after a speech whether he foresaw a change to the dollar's role as global reserve currency, he said "No, I do not." "The dollar remains the world's dominant reserve currency and I think that's likely to continue for a long period of time." He also said, "as a country, we will do what's necessary to make sure we're sustaining confidence in our financial markets and in this economy's long-term fundamentals." In response to an earlier question, Geithner said he was "quite open" to a Chinese suggestion to move toward greater use of a global currency basket comprising dollars, euros, yen and sterling.
