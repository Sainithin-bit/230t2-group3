 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that he waited to express outrage over the bonuses paid out to AIG employees because he wanted to get more details first. 

 "It took us a couple days because I like to know what I'm talking about before I speak," Obama said during a televised news conference. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski )
