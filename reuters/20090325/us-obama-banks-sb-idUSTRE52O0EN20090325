 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday that U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had defied critics who did not believe he could deliver a plan to stabilize the banking system. 

 Obama said the administration will face more criticism but is moving in the right direction to set the struggling sector on sound footing. "I'm sure there will be more criticism and we'll have to make more adjustments, but we're moving in the right direction," Obama said during a televised news conference.
