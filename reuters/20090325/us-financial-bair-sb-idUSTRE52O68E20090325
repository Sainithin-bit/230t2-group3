 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sheila Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, said on Wednesday "it would make sense on many levels" for her agency to be given the authority to wind down troubled non-bank financial firms. 

 Bair said in a statement that she supports the U.S. Treasury Department's legislative proposal that would give Treasury the power to seize large distressed financial firms. The proposal -- released on Wednesday -- said the FDIC could be given funds to help wind down those firms. "Due to the FDIC's extensive experience with resolving failed institutions and the cyclical nature of resolution work, it would make sense on many levels for the FDIC to be given this authority working in close cooperation with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board of Governors," Bair said. The FDIC currently has the authority to wind down failed banks, but does not have powers over other types of financial firms such as bank holding companies or insurers.
