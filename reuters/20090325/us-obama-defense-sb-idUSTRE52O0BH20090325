 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Tuesday there is consensus that the procurement system for U.S. defense contracts does not work and needs to be reformed to save money. 

 Obama said during his second prime-time White House news conference since taking office on January 20 that he must try to ensure that taxpayer dollars are not wasted while keeping the country safe. "There is uniform acknowledgment that the procurement system right now doesn't work," Obama said, adding that this was also the opinion of the former Republican presidential candidate, Senator John McCain, and Democratic Senator Carl Levin, who is the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Still, he said that changing the system was difficult due to the action of lobbyists and because defense contractors are very good at dispersing jobs and plants around the country. "What we have to do is to go through this process very carefully, be more disciplined than we've been in the last several years," said Obama who is facing rapidly increasing budget deficits because of the impact of the economic crisis and government measures to tackle it. Obama reiterated that his administration had already identified $40 billion of procurement savings. Earlier this month he ordered a crackdown on spending he said was plagued by massive cost overruns and outright fraud. He has singled out the ballooning costs of a Lockheed Martin Corp project to build a new presidential helicopter fleet as an example of the procurement process "gone amok."
