 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - China's state-owned firm Chinalco ALUMI.UL would continue to monitor developments at Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) as its single largest shareholder, Chinalco said in a statement on Thursday. 

 "This was an economically rational decision as it prevented the dilution of our ownership in Rio. Chinalco believes in the long-term prospects of the industry and will continue to explore opportunities to advance its strategic objectives," Chinalco said. ($1=A$1.25) (Reporting by  Denny Thomas )
