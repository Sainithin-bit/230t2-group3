 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - The head of Russia's Sberbank SBER03.MM said on Thursday he sees no serious competition in its takeover of German carmaker Opel, which it has agreed to buy in partnership with Canadian auto parts group Magna MGa.TO. 

 "I do not see any serious competition. The choice has been made and the question now is of how to structure the deal," German Gref, Sberbank's chief executive, told reporters. His comments follow news that Opel's parent company, bankrupt U.S. automotive giant General Motors GMGMQ.PK, could still sell Opel to other potential buyers, including Belgium-based RHJ International ( RHJI.BR ) and Chinese carmaker Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Co.
