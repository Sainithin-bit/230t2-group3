 BEIJING  (Reuters) - The Ministry of Commerce is working with other ministries to encourage foreign-funded firms to make public share offerings in China, a senior official said on Thursday. 

 "We will continue to work with other departments on policies regarding domestic IPOs of foreign firms to actively guide high-quality foreign firms to make IPOs in China," Chen Jian, a vice-commerce minister, said. He also said China was studying steps to encourage inflows of foreign direct investment. "In order to boost investor confidence and expand the inflow of foreign investment, the Ministry of Commerce is working with other departments to develop measures to stabilize FDI inflows," Chen told a news conference.
