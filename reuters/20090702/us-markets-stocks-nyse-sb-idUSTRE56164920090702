 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange said late on Thursday it will extend trading past its regular closing time due to connectivity glitches. 

 The NYSE said in a systems alert that trading will be extended to 4:15 p.m. The NYSE's regular close is 4 p.m. Earlier on Thursday, floor brokers were hit by an isolated system issue that affected orders originating from the trading floor since the market open at 9:30 a.m., according to NYSE spokesman Rich Adamonis. By 10:50 a.m., all floor broker order processing had resumed normally, he said. (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
