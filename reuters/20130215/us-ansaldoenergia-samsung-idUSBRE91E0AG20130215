 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Two affiliates of South Korean conglomerates Samsung and Doosan said on Friday that they may make bids for AnsaldoEnergia, the power engineering unit of Italy's indebted defense firm, Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ). 
 The two firms are precision engineering firm Samsung Techwin Co Ltd ( 012450.KS ) and shipbuilder Doosan Heavy Industries and Construction Co Ltd ( 034020.KS ). Finmeccanica is selling its 55 percent AnsaldoEnergia stake and other assets for a total of 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) as part of a turnaround of Italy's No.2 industrial group. "We are considering acquiring AnsaldoEnergia as a part of our plan to grow the energy equipment business, but a final decision has yet to be made," Samsung Techwin said in a filing to the stock exchange. Finmeccanica on Wednesday appointed a new chief executive after its former CEO was arrested earlier this week for allegedly paying bribes to win a $750 million Indian contract.
