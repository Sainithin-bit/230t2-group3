 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said on Tuesday he was not worried about disappointing financial markets if the Fed should choose not to lower interest rates in December. 

 "Financial markets process a tremendous amount of information about the economy, and we want to compare our assessments that that assessment," Evans told reporters after a speech on the economy at the Futures Industry Association conference. "But at the end of the day, it's our independent assessment," he said. (Reporting by  Ros Krasny )
