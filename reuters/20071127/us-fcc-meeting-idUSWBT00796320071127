 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Communications regulators are weighing a possible compromise in a contentious debate over whether to open the door to tougher regulation of cable TV operators, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission said on Tuesday. 

 The FCC's five commissioners are discussing a proposal to seek more data from cable TV operators to help settle the question about whether the cable subscriber numbers have surpassed a key threshold, giving the agency greater authority over the industry, FCC Chairman Kevin Martin told reporters. The comments came hours after the FCC postponed a closely watched meeting at which the commissioners were scheduled to vote on the issue. (Reporting by  Peter Kaplan ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
