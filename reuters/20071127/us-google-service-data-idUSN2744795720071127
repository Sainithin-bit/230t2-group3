 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc is preparing a service that would enable users to store data from their personal hard drives on its computers, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday in its online edition. 

 Users would be able to house files they would normally store on personal computers -- such as word-processing documents, digital music, video clips and images -- on Google's computers, the Journal said, citing sources familiar with the matter. According to the Journal, the service could let users access their files through the Internet from different computers and mobile devices when they sign on using a password. The service could be released as soon as a few months from now, the Journal said, citing a source. The newspaper also said Google plans to provide some free storage, with additional storage allotments available for a fee. Planned pricing isn't known, the Journal added. Representatives of Google could not immediately be reached for comment. According to the Journal, a Google spokeswoman declined to comment on any specific online storage plans beyond what it already offers as part of its email and other services.
