 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Tuesday downgraded the U.S. automobile sector to "cautious," in part due to growing concerns about the U.S. macro outlook and its implication for auto sales. 

 The brokerage downgraded TRW Automotive ( TRW.N ) to "neutral" from "buy," reflecting less compelling valuation compared to other buy-rated peers and lack of near-term catalysts. Goldman also cut Magna International MGa.TO ( MGA.N ) to "sell" from "neutral." (Reporting by Neetha Mahadevan in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)
