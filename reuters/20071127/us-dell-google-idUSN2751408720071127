 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc said on Tuesday it will sell Google search devices to help companies find information on their networks. 

 Dell said it would sell Google Search Appliance starting at $30,000 and the Google Mini starting at $1,995 to U.S. corporate customers and small businesses. Dell already offers personal computers with Google's desktop search software. The Google-made machines, which scour corporate networks and Web sites for documents and other data, will help Dell, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, expand its main business of selling computers to businesses, which account for about 85 percent of the Round Rock, Texas-based company's revenue. Dell said it has been working with Google Inc since 2006 to make some Dell server computers compatible with Google Search Appliance, a high-end box-like device that uses Google technology to search corporate intranets, applications, databases and files. The Google Mini is targeted at small and medium-sized businesses while the Google Search Appliance is aimed at larger corporations. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
