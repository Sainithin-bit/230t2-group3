 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell more than 3 percent on Tuesday on expectations OPEC will boost supply and concerns U.S. economic problems will grind down demand growth. 

 Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said the kingdom had already increased production beyond targets set under an OPEC deal to boost output from November 1. But Naimi refused to say whether Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, would support another output increase when the cartel meets on December 5 in Abu Dhabi. Indonesia's oil minister said he would back a hike of 500,000 barrels per day (bpd). U.S. oil tumbled $3.28 to settle at $94.42 a barrel, off earlier lows of $94.21. London Brent crude fell $2.80 to $92.52 a barrel. "Expectations of a possible increase in (OPEC) output pulled crude prices sharply lower today," said Andy Lebow of MF Global. "In addition, concerns about the economy are beginning to come into play here. With consumer confidence down, the question arises on where the (energy) consumption numbers are going to be." U.S. consumer confidence fell for a fourth straight month in November to a two-year low on concerns about rising gasoline prices and financial market volatility.  Prices have surged more than 40 percent since mid-August in a rally to above $99 a barrel on the slumping U.S. dollar, supply concerns ahead of the Northern Hemisphere winter and rising investor interest. But worries of an economic slowdown in the United States crimping oil demand in the top consumer have weighed on crude's record rally, as have prospects OPEC could agree to ramp up output at next week's meeting. "I will support OPEC on a new production increase," Indonesian Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said on Tuesday. But Saudi Arabia's Naimi declined to comment on what action OPEC would take. "We will look at all information available, and decide accordingly, on whatever the information tells us about supply, demand, inventories," Naimi said in Singapore, adding Saudi Arabia had already raised production to 9 million bpd, slightly more than its target November 1. Some OPEC ministers have said supplies are sufficient to meet demand, but consumers worry dwindling stockpiles might not be sufficient to keep up with winter demand. U.S. government inventory to be released on Wednesday is expected to show U.S. distillates inventories, which include heating oil, down 1.4 million barrels, according to a Reuters survey of analysts. Crude stocks are expected to fall by 800,000 barrels while gasoline was forecast to rise by 1.0 million barrels, a preliminary Reuters survey found.
