 RIYADH  (Reuters) - There is no need for OPEC to boost oil output when the producer group next meets on December 5, Qatar's Oil Minister Abdullah al-Attiyah said on Tuesday. 

 "My personal belief is that for the moment there is no need to increase production," he said. Shifting oil pricing away from the dollar to a basket of currencies was "unrealistic", Attiyah added. (Reporting by  Souhail Karam )
