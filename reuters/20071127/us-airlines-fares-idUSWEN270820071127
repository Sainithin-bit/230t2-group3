 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ), the third-largest U.S. carrier, said on Tuesday that it increased fares by $10 one way in most domestic U.S. markets to offset rising fuel costs. 

 U.S. airlines have raised fares numerous times in recent months as oil prices soar. Jet fuel vies with labor as an airline's biggest expense. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
