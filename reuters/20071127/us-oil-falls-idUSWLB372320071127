 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil fell more than $2 a barrel on Tuesday to below $96, pressured by expectations that the OPEC exporter group may decide to raise oil output at a December 5 meeting. 

 U.S. crude was down $2 a barrel at $95.70 as of 7:56 a.m. EST and later extended the decline. Brent crude also fell, dropping by $2 to $93.32 as of 7:58 a.m. EST. (Reporting by  Alex Lawler , editing by James Jukwey)
