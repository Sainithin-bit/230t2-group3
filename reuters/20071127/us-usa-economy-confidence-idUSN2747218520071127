 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence fell unexpectedly sharply in November to its lowest since after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 on worries about rising gas prices and financial market volatility. 

 The Conference Board said on Tuesday its index of consumer sentiment fell, for a fourth straight month, to 87.3 from a revised 95.2 in October. The median forecast of economists polled by Reuters was for a reading of 91.6. It was the lowest level since October 2005, when it was at 85.2, the Conference Board said. "The reading is approaching the high end of where we would be during a recession," said Michael Schenk, senior economist of the Credit Union National Association, Madison, Wisconsin. Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board's consumer research center, said the drop was primarily due to a sharp slide in the expectations index, which fell to its lowest since March 2003 at the outbreak of war in Iraq. The expectations index slumped to 68.7 in November from a revised 80.0 in October. "Consumers' apprehension about the short-term outlook is being fueled by volatility in the financial markets, rising prices at the pump and the likelihood of larger home heating bills this winter," Franco said. Schenk said this apprehension was consistent with what "roughly 90 million credit union members are telling us, which is that they are nervous. "We know that because at this point they are saving about as much as they are spending," Schenk said. "That behavior is consistent with an economic slowdown, if not recession." Franco said consumers' inflation expectations had surpassed the spike experienced this spring and that a larger percentage than last month expected stock prices to decline. The present situation index decreased to 115.4 in November from a revised 118.0 in October. Franco said the present situation index, despite losing ground, suggested "the economy is expanding, albeit slowly." And despite their relatively bleak outlook, consumers "anticipate spending more on gifts this season than they did last Christmas," she said. Schenk concurred. "Holiday spending is fueled by emotions and plans that have already been made so we expect it to be pretty good," he said. "But what concerns us is that a lot of this spending is going to be put on credit cards so consumers will come out of this season with a financial hangover." At that point, "paying off the high credit card debt will be job number one and confidence numbers will probably sink even lower," Schenk said. Consumer spending is responsible for driving about two-thirds of the U.S. economy's growth. (Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
