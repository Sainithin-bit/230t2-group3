 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK has received three bids for its investment management unit, including Neuberger Berman, Shai Waisman, a bankruptcy lawyer for the company, said on Wednesday. 

 The auction for Lehman's prized asset management unit begins at noon on Wednesday, Waisman said. In comments to reporters after a court hearing, Waisman said there were two bidders in addition to Bain Capital LLC and Hellman & Friedman LLC, which agreed on September 29 to buy the unit for $2.15 billion. The Bain and Hellman group was previously approved by the court to be the lead bidder at the auction. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
