 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Treasury secretary Henry Paulson is debating whether to ask Congress for the next $350 billion in the $700 billion U.S. bailout, the Wall Street Journal reported on its website on Tuesday. 

 If he requests the funds he is expected to request them next week, the Journal reported. The newspaper said Paulson is concerned about a potentially hostile reaction from lawmakers and competing demands for funds. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan ; Editing by Kazunori Takada)
