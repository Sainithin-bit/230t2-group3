 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York City's Mayor Michael Bloomberg on Wednesday estimated that tax revenues had fallen enough to add as much as another $300 million to the deficit, pushing it to $1.6 billion. 

 Tax collections that rise and fall with the economy likely will drop by 15 percent, the independent mayor said at a news conference. That is a few percentage points more than his latest estimates. Wall Street, the city's hometown industry that pays about one-fifth of every dollar earned here, has seen its profits crater because it over-borrowed to over-invest in risky assets. Bloomberg, an independent who hopes his financial expertise wins him a third term, added he still was negotiating with the Democratic City Council, which wants to send homeowners $400 rebate checks he canceled because of the budget crunch. "It's a negotiating process," Bloomberg said, explaining that more cuts would have to be made if the checks were sent. (Reporting by  Joan Gralla ; Editing by  Jan Paschal )
