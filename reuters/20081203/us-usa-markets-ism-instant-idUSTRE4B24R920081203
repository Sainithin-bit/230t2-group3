 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A measure of the service sector slumped further than expected to a record low in November, according to a report released on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index came in at 37.3 versus 44.4 in October. * The level of 50 separates expansion from contraction. * Economists expected a reading of 42.0, according to the median of 71 forecasts in a Reuters poll which ranged from 37.0 to 46.5. COMMENTS: RICHARD DEKASER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIONAL CITY CORP, CLEVELAND: "There has been a sequence of extremely high profile failures and consolidations in the financial sector. There's a sharp collapse in confidence which has resulted in change in company behavior in the form of payroll reductions. "I expect a 418,000 decline in the November payroll given the most recent batch of employment data. But I would be surprised to see this level of losses again even if the economy muddles along. Still we will still suffer job losses into late 2009. "The fourth quarter of 2008 is experiencing an economic freefall. We haven't this kind of a collapse in a very long time." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "It's an extraordinarily steep decline for a measure of service sector activity. It's unusual for the service industry to be as volatile as the manufacturing industry or as volatile as the economy as a whole. The severe damage to the service industry is another indication of the extraordinary force of this recession." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes extend losses after worse-than-expected ISM. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices turn positive. DOLLAR: Dollar at session lows versus yen. RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures indicate 48 percent chance Fed will cut rates to 0.25 percent at Dec meeting.
