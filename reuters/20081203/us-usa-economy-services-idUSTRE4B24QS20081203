 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A measure of the service sector slumped further than expected to a record low in November, according to a report released on Wednesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index came in at 37.3 versus 44.4 in October. The level of 50 separates expansion from contraction. Economists expected a reading of 42.0, according to the median of 71 forecasts in a Reuters poll which ranged from 37.0 to 46.5. The service sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants.
