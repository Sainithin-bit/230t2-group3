 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Monday that she expects the White House will use money from the $700-billion financial stabilization plan to help major U.S. automakers. 

 "That would be my expectation," the California Democrat said in answer to questions on whether the Bush administration will use the Troubled Asset Relief Program to help General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh )
