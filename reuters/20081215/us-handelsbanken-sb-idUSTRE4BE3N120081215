 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Sweden's Handelsbanken said on Monday the bank had no exposure to the alleged $50 billion fraud by Wall Street trader Bernard Madoff. 

 "No, we don't," Handelsbanken spokesman Johan Lagerstrom said. Swedish rival Nordea said earlier on Monday its pension clients had an indirect exposure of 48 million euros ($64.6 million) to Madoff, while SEB said it had no exposure.
