 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The Nordic region's biggest bank, Nordea, said on Monday its pension clients had an indirect exposure of 48 million euros ($65 million) to the alleged $50 billion fraud by Wall Street trader Bernard Madoff. 

 "This does not affect Nordea but rather the pension clients," Nordea spokeswoman Helena Ostman said. "It is the Nordea Life and Pension organization that has made these investments." She added that the exposure was through the Fairfield Sentry fund and that it was not yet clear if the entire amount might be lost. Swedish rival SEB said separately that it had no exposure to Madoff. ($1=.7426 Euro) (Reporting by  Niklas Pollard  and Johannes Hellstrom; Editing by Hans Peters)
