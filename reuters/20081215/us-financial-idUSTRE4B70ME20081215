 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The global economic downturn sparked a warning of sharply lower growth in the giant Chinese economy, a large drop in oil prices and setbacks for the auto industry worldwide as Washington grapples with a rescue for crippled automakers. 

 The International Monetary Fund said on Monday Chinese growth could be cut almost in half next year, while Japan reported its sharpest crash in business sentiment in three decades. Japanese automaker Toyota Motor Corp said it is suspending completion of its newest plant in Mississippi indefinitely in response to a "steep decline" in U.S. auto sales. It was a sour start to what promises to be a big news week for investors around the world. On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to close to zero, Goldman Sachs could report its first quarterly loss as a publicly traded company and the CEO of corporate bellwether General Electric, Jeff Immelt, briefs Wall Street on the company's 2009 outlook. The energy market awaits news that OPEC will make its deepest cut ever in production at a meeting this week in Algeria. But benchmark U.S. crude fell 4 percent as the deepening economic worries more than offset the prospect of an OPEC cutback lifting prices. Meanwhile, there was more bad news for banks around the world as several acknowledged exposure to the alleged $50 billion Wall Street fraud by Bernard Madoff, including Britain's HSBC Holdings Plc, Royal Bank of Scotland and Man Group, Japan's Nomura Holdings and France's Natixis SA. No major U.S. banks have said they were exposed, but the Madoff scandal did take a toll on U.S. stocks along with worries about bank profits. The grim economic news had investors scrambling out of stocks into safe-haven Treasury debt, sending the long bond's yield down to an all-time low below 3 percent. BLEAK CONSUMER CHRISTMAS Less than two weeks before Christmas, bad news on U.S. consumers continued to trickle in. While sales for the key holiday might not drop as much as retailers feared, experts say households are likely to cut back even more after Christmas. Bucking the dour trend was U.S. industrial production in November, which slipped by a less-than-expected 0.6 percent, and revised figures for October that were stronger than previously thought. On the housing front, U.S. home builder sentiment held steady in December, but remained at a record low, reflecting the economic turmoil and heavy job losses. U.S. government-controlled mortgage finance company Fannie Mae gave some relief on Monday by allowing tenants whose landlords go into foreclosure to remain in their homes and avoid eviction. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said congressional Democrats will demand more aggressive steps by the White House to reduce home foreclosures before Congress agrees to release more money for a $700-billion bank bailout. Pelosi also said a pending economic stimulus package could cost around $600 billion and include large infrastructure investments and tax cuts. Automakers will have to wait days to see how their stalled rescue shapes up. President George W. Bush told reporters aboard Air Force One on Monday that while some funds earmarked to shore up the U.S. finance industry could be diverted to automakers, no announcement was imminent. U.S. Senate Banking Committee chairman Chris Dodd said later in the day he was confident the government would help the hardest-hit car companies -- GM and Chrysler LLC -- with bridge loans to get through the next months. "These companies are burning through cash at an incredible rate," Dodd said at a conference in Dublin. CAR WOES SPREAD Investors fear that a failure of any of the three Detroit automakers would exacerbate a U.S. recession and drag other companies under. Over the weekend, carmakers and workers elsewhere issued dire warnings about the state of their sector, from Germany's Volkswagen to the British Unite trade union, which warned that 40,000 car industry jobs could be lost in coming weeks unless the government intervenes. While Toyota puts its new Mississippi plant on hold, Japanese media said the world's largest carmaker was set to report a loss of 100 billion yen ($1.11 billion) for October-March. China, the world's fourth-biggest economy and accustomed to double-digit growth rates, will likely feel deep pain next year. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a conference that growth could fall to 5 percent next year from 9.7 percent this year. "We started with China at 11 percent growth, then 8, then 7, then China will probably grow at 5 or 6 percent," he told a conference in Madrid. Strauss-Kahn said a large and diversified stimulus of about 2 percent of world GDP -- $1.2 trillion -- was needed to reduce the risk of a damaging global recession. "If we are not able to do that, then social unrest may happen in many places, including advanced economies," he said.
