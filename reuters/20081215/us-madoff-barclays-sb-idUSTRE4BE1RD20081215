 LONDON  (Reuters) - Any exposure for British bank Barclays Plc to an alleged $50 billion fraud surrounding Wall Street trader Bernard Madoff would be "minimal," a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 Barclays declined to comment. Several European rivals, including Santander and Royal Bank of Scotland, have said they face potential losses from their exposure to the alleged fraud at Madoff's New York-based investment firm. (Reporting by  Steve Slater )
