 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The Belgian government said on Monday it would launch a twin-pronged appeal against a court ruling that threatens to derail a state-led break-up of stricken financial group Fortis FOR.BR. 

 The Fortis carve-up, which also entails a part-sale of assets to France's BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ), was frozen by a surprise appeal court judgment last Friday in favor of some 2,200 shareholders who demanded more say in the bank's future. Prime Minister Yves Leterme said after a late-night cabinet meeting the government would appeal as an affected third party, while public holding agency SFPI would seek to take the case to the Supreme Court, with both steps due in coming days. "The government confirms that in its view the continuation of the industrial project launched with BNP Paribas is the best guarantee for the continuity of Fortis Bank Belgium," Leterme told a news conference. Finance Minister Didier Reynders added that BNP chief executive Baudouin Prot, who also was present at the meeting, had indicated that he wanted to continue with his bank's plan to buy parts of Fortis. The appeal court decision threatens to hobble the deal to carve up the financial group by the Dutch and Belgian governments, and the latter's deal with BNP Paribas. BNP shares were the weakest in the FTSE Eurotop 300 list of percentage gainers and losers .PGL.FTEU3 , closing down 10.05 percent at 39.40 euros. Fortis FOR.AS announced on Monday its shares would be suspended for two days pending a statement on the financial impact of the ruling. It would not have a significant negative impact on its current cash position, it added. PENALTY A planned December 19 shareholder meeting in Brussels is to go ahead, but it will now vote on whether to postpone the main agenda point -- on continuing Fortis's activities. The Brussels appeal court froze for 65 days decisions taken in the wake of the credit crunch by the Fortis board at the start of October on the company's carve-up, and ordered that Fortis shareholders be allowed a say by February 12. The deals came within a week of an 11.2 billion euro ($14.86 billion) cash injection by the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments which had failed to calm investors. Under the court decision, the Belgian state would be forbidden to sell Fortis assets to BNP Paribas before February 16, 2009, and would face a 5 billion euro penalty if it did. BNP was expected to have closed its deal to buy Fortis assets this week, but Fortis said that would be postponed. The Dutch state has argued that its purchase of the Dutch businesses of Fortis for 16.8 billion euros on October 3 should not be affected because the sale was done according to Dutch law. The court also ruled that a panel of five experts should determine whether the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments were right to get stakes just short of 50 percent for their capital injections at the end of September. Fortis shares, which rose to close to 30 euros in April 2007 before it launched its ill-fated joint bid for Dutch rival ABN AMRO, fell from around 5.40 euros ahead of the carve-up to less than 1 euro after. Petercam analyst Marc Debrouwer questioned whether the shareholders would get much money back even if the deals were adjusted. The transfer of banking activities was the only viable option and there were no other obvious candidates than BNP. "In theory BNP got it on the cheap, but at the time Fortis had a major liquidity issue," Debrouwer said. "The task for shareholders will be tough. They might get a slightly better deal, but it will not be a huge difference." Luxembourg Budget Minister Luc Frieden told a local newspaper he did not believe the court ruling would affect his state's sale of a stake in Fortis Bank Luxembourg to BNP.
