 LONDON  (Reuters) - Geneva-based wealth manager Lombard, Odier, Darier, Hentsch & Cie (LODH) said on Monday it had no exposure to the alleged $50 billion fraud by Wall Street trader Bernard Madoff. 

 "LODH is not exposed to Madoff," a spokesman for the group said. Royal Bank of Scotland, Man Group and Nomura on Monday joined a growing list of financial groups acknowledging exposure to the scandal. (Reporting by  Douwe Miedema ; Editing by Erica Billingham)
