 LONDON  (Reuters) - Madoff Securities International Limited stopped trading on Friday after its main shareholder, Bernard Madoff, was arrested in connection with an alleged $50 billion fraud, the London-based proprietary trading unit said. 

 The unit, which is 88 percent-owned by Bernard Madoff, traded through its broker Barclays Capital, part of British bank Barclays Plc, a spokesman said on Monday. He added he did not know whether the firm would resume trading on Monday. (Reporting by  Olesya Dmitracova , editing by Quentin Webb)
