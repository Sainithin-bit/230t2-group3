 LONDON  (Reuters) - British listed hedge fund manager RAB Capital Plc said on Monday it had exposure of about $10 million to Madoff Securities, the New York-based hedge fund at the center of fraud allegations. 

 A spokesman for RAB Capital said the exposure was "tiny," and represented less than 0.5 percent of total assets. He would not comment on whether the exposure was held in one fund or across several funds at the firm. (Reporting by  Joel Dimmock ; Editing by Erica Billingham)
