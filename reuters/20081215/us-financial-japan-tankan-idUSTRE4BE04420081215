 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese business sentiment fell sharply to its most pessimistic in nearly seven years, the Bank of Japan's tankan survey showed, on mounting concerns that Japan faces a deep and long recession as the global economy suffers its sharpest downturn in decades. 

 The slide in sentiment -- the biggest in more than 30 years -- fueled speculation that the Bank of Japan may cut its already low key interest rate of 0.3 percent as soon as this week. ************************************************************ KEY POINTS: -- The headline index for big manufacturers' sentiment fell to a nearly seven-year low of minus 24, down from minus 3 in the previous survey in September and just below economists' median forecast of minus 23. -- The fall of 21 points was the second-largest on record, and the largest since the oil shock in the early 1970s. The biggest fall was in 1974 and the last fall of 21 points was in early 1975. -- The index for March was seen at minus 36, showing firms expect conditions to worsen over the next three months. -- Big firms expect their capital spending to fall 0.2 percent in the financial year to next March, less than economists' median forecast for a 0.5 percent fall. -- The big manufacturers index worsened for a fifth straight quarter, while that for non-manufacturers worsened for a sixth straight quarter, a BOJ official told reporters in a briefing. -- The all firms' employment index turned positive, meaning more firms felt they had a surplus of employees rather than too few, for the first time since September 2004. -- The fall of 0.2 percent in big firms' expected capital spending for the year to next March was the worst for a December survey since 2002. The financial conditions indexes for both big firms and small firms hit the lowest levels since March 2003. COMMENTARY: YASUO YAMAMOTO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH INSTITUTE "The Tankan results reflected the global economic deterioration and the rapid appreciation of the yen, especially in export-oriented industries. And sentiment for small and medium-sized companies was further damaged. "There's a possibility that Japanese corporations' profit forecasts will to be further downgraded due to the yen's appreciation. "The Bank of Japan is expected to lower interest rates this week. In addition, the central bank is expected to take other measures to increase liquidity." - - - - JUNKO NISHIOKA, CHIEF ECONOMIST JAPAN, RBS SECURITIES "The most important point in the latest data is how sharply the headline index fell. It is comparable to what was seen at the time of the oil shock in 1974. It underscores how badly companies' business mood is deteriorating as they are surrounded by so many negative factors. "This data alone won't change the market's expectations for policy moves by the BOJ, as the deterioration in the data was largely expected. But there are many uncertainties for the market until next year. We currently expect the BOJ to cut its key rate to 0.1 percent in March." - - - - TAKEO OKUHARA, MARKET ECONOMIST, DAIWA SB ASSET MANAGEMENT "Severe inventory adjustments are taking place among automobile and electronics makers. At the worst, they may have to reduce production capacity as U.S. consumption looks set to fall given rising problems with U.S. consumer loans. "That's likely to weigh on financial markets in the coming months, although in the near term the markets are likely to be range-bound, in part helped by hopes for positive effects from policy steps." - - - - HIDEKI MATSUMURA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, JAPAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE "The data was as bad as expected, and there was little surprise. "The results clearly show overseas demand is deteriorating and that slowing economies abroad are starting to truly have an impact. "The outlook for industries that rely on exports such as electronics, autos and steel reflects worsening conditions in overseas markets. The severe situation for export-driven companies will likely continue." - - - - MARKET REACTION: -- For yen updates click; for prices click -- For JGB updates, click, for prices click -- For stocks click, for the Nikkei share average click LINK: -- For details on the tankan, go to here BACKGROUND: -- The index is calculated by subtracting the percentage of companies that consider conditions to be unfavorable from those that see them as favorable. A negative number means pessimists outnumber optimists. -- The Japanese economy contracted in the second and third quarters of this year, meeting a widely used definition of recession. -- The Bank of Japan cut its key interest rate to 0.30 percent from 0.50 percent in October as economic conditions have deteriorated sharply since mid-September due to the global financial crisis. -- Some analysts speculate the central bank could act by March to cut rates or introduce other measures to deal with the recent rise in credit spreads in Japanese financial markets.
