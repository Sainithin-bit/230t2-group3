 BEIJING  (Reuters) - French food group Danone ( DANO.PA ) offered to drop all legal actions against Hangzhou Wahaha Group if its estranged Chinese joint venture partner agrees to enter into talks to settle their long-running dispute. 

 But Emmanuel Faber, president of the French firm's Asia-Pacific operations, told a news conference on Friday the already strained relations between the partners were likely to get worse before getting better. "I would not be surprised if more proceedings of the same nature could develop in the short term, given the current attitude of other parties in this case," he said. Faber said Danone had offered in late November to suspend six legal proceedings in China against Wahaha as a sign of good faith, only to have a mainland arbitration commission rule that the best-selling Wahaha brand of beverages and bottled water should revert back to the Chinese partner. Danone was taking the case to the Chinese Supreme Court, and other courts might have to get involved to bring the highly public battle to an end, Faber added. "This case is coming to a turning point. It has gone beyond a commercial dispute," he said. A Wahaha spokesman declined to comment. Danone and Wahaha have been exchanging accusations and lawsuits for months. The French company has accused Wahaha of setting up parallel operations outside their ventures that sell Wahaha-branded products such as soft drinks and bottled water. Danone said this week it would appeal against the arbitration commission's decision, calling the decision illegal. Faber called the commission's ruling unhelpful to the search for an amicable solution to one of the most high-profile disputes between a foreign company and a Chinese partner. The case has raised concerns among foreign investors about potential risks in investing in joint ventures in China. Danone has asserted that it paid Wahaha 50 million yuan ($6.6 million) as part of a deal that gave the joint venture exclusive rights to use the trademark, one of China's best known brands. After Wahaha filed an arbitration claim on June 14 seeking termination of the trademark transfer agreement, Danone filed a counter claim, urging Wahaha to make applications to the State Trademark Office. Danone is seeking arbitrations in Stockholm, accusing Wahaha of breach of contract by selling competing products outside their ventures. It is also filing a lawsuit in California against Zong's wife and daughter, as well as a company controlled by Zong's family. Last month, Danone won overseas court orders to freeze assets of 10 companies it accuses of using the Wahaha trademark illegally.
