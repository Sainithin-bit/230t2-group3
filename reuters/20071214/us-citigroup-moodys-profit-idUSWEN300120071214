 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) could post net losses in some quarters in 2008, depending on the timing of its writedowns, said Moody's Investors Service analyst Sean Jones. 

 Speaking on a conference call on Friday, Jones said Moody's expects Citi to earn $3.8 billion to low $4 billion per quarter next year, before charges and writedowns. Moody's late Thursday cut Citi's debt ratings to "Aa3," the fourth highest level, from "Aa2." (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
