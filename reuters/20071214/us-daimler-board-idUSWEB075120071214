 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) has named former Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) executive Sari Baldauf and BASF BASF.DE Chief Executive Juergen Hambrecht as members of its supervisory board, the carmaker said on Friday. 

 They will replace as of next month Earl Graves and Peter Magowan, both Americans who have agreed to step down at the end of the year given Daimler's sale of a majority stake in U.S. arm Chrysler, a statement said. The court-appointed terms of Baldauf and Hambrecht will last until the next shareholders meeting in April 2008, at which the two will be proposed for election to the board.
