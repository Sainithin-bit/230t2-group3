 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A weekly gauge of future U.S. economic growth slipped due to higher interest rates, and its annualized growth rate hit a five-year low, a research group said on Friday. 

 The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group, said its Weekly Leading Index edged down to 138.0 in the week ended December 7 from a downwardly revised 138.2 in the prior week, initially reported as 138.7. The negative effect of higher interest rates on the index was partially offset by lower jobless claims and higher stock prices, said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at ECRI. WLI growth rate fell to minus 3.8 percent from minus 3.2 percent, to its lowest since November 15, 2002 when it was minus 4.3 percent. "With WLI growth falling to a new five-year low, U.S. economic growth prospects continue to worsen," Achuthan said. (Reporting by  Rodrigo Campos ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
