 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's ( GS.N ) bet that securities backed by risky home loans would fall in value brought nearly $4 billion of profits in the year ended November 30, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Thursday, citing people familiar with its finances. 

 The gains erased $1.5 billion to $2 billion of mortgage-related losses elsewhere at the firm, according to the Wall Street Journal. The company is expected to report a "record" net annual income of more than $11 billion, the Journal said. Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment.
