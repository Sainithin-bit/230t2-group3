 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Nout Wellink said on Friday that the global credit crisis had now reached a "second wave", worse than the first. 

 The timing was right for this week's actions by the U.S. Federal Reserve and its counterparts in launching a new temporary short-term lending facility to ease money market strains ahead of normal year-end demand for cash, Wellink said in the interview with Dutch daily De Volkskrant. "It is too early to tell whether the action will work. Movements on the stock exchanges don't tell us too much," he was quoted as saying by the newspaper. Wellink, also the Governor of the Dutch Central Bank, added there was enough liquidity in the world but that "banks were sitting on it." (Reporting by  Alexandra Hudson )
