 MILAN  (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank will not advise a group including Evergreen LLC and THL Transportation in their interest for Italian airline Alitalia AZPIa.MI and nor will legal studio Orrick, the bank said on Friday. 

 "The ... conditions do not exist for Deutsche Bank and Orrick to agree to the request to be advisers," it said in a statement. Italian newspapers had said on Friday that the German bank and Orrick could advise the group, which Alitalia said on Thursday had expressed interest in buying the airline as the government tries to decide between bids from Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ) and domestic carrier Air One.
