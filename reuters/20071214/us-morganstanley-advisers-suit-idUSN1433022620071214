 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Securities regulators sued two former financial advisers at Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) on Friday for defrauding at least 50 mutual fund companies and their shareholders. 

 Darryl Goldstein, 36, and Christopher O'Donnell, 45, engaged in deceptive acts between January 2002 and August 2003 that were designed to circumvent mutual funds' restrictions on market timing and generate fees for themselves, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. In less than two years, for only two hedge fund customers, they "continuously engaged in more than 4,000 market-timing trades with total trading volume exceeding $4.8 billion," the SEC alleged in the complaint. Goldstein worked at Morgan Stanley DW Inc from October 2000 to November 2003, while O'Donnell was there from August 1998 to March 2004. Goldstein is now a registered representative at Gilford Securities Inc, while O'Donnell is a registered representative for Bear Stearns BSC.N, according to the complaint.
