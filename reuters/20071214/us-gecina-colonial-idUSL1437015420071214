 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spanish property company Inmobiliaria Colonial has held preliminary merger talks with French real estate firm Gecina but no formal deal is on the table, it said on Friday. 

 Earlier, Cinco Dias newspaper reported a deal could be announced as early as next Monday, creating one of Europe's largest real estate groups with about 24 billion euros ($35.3 billion) of assets. In a statement to Spanish stock market regulator CNMV, Colonial said it had not made any decision about a possible merger with Gecina, nor had it started a formal study or evaluation of a deal. "(That) is not to say there have not been preliminary talks between representatives of the two companies," it added. Sector sources said Colonial Chairman and leading shareholder Luis Portillo had held talks with Joaquin Rivero, Gecina's top manager and investor. Colonial's shares were suspended on Friday morning and climbed when they reopened. At 0503 GMT, the stock was 1.85 percent higher at 3.31 euros. Gecina was down 0.2 percent. A merger with Gecina would the third for Colonial in little more than a year as Portillo leads a consolidation drive in Spanish real estate, a highly fragmented market which is rapidly cooling after a nine-year boom. It would also be yet another upheaval for Gecina, which was bought by Metrovacesa in 2005 and is now in the process being hived off as part of a complex peace deal between rival shareholders in the Spanish property company. A merger would come months after France's Unibail merged with Rodamco Europe to create Europe's largest property company with around 25 billion euros of assets. Cinco Dias said the Colonial-Gecina talks were triggered by an inquiry into Gecina by French financial regulator AMF, which ruled on Thursday that Gecina's two major Spanish shareholders should make a full bid for the property company. The paper said the deal would also help Colonial cut its debt-to-assets ratio to about 50-55 percent from 70 percent now. It did not say how the possible deal would be structured but pointed out that both Colonial and Gecina had asset values of around 12 billion euros. In terms of market value, Gecina is worth 7.3 billion euros while Colonial is at 5.9 billion. (Reporting by Jane Barrett, Editing by Louise Ireland, Paul Bolding)
