 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tool maker Black & Decker Corp BDK.N slashed its fourth-quarter profit outlook on Friday, citing worse-than-expected conditions in North America and a one-time charge, and its shares fell as much as 10 percent. 

 Black & Decker has been  suffering from a sharp slowdown in U.S. construction activity, the result of the two-year slump in the housing market. The company also said it will recall some DeWalt XRP cordless drills it made during the past 18 months, and take a pretax charge of about $25 million in the current quarter. It said no injuries had been reported. The recall and the tough environment will cause fourth-quarter sales to decline at a low-single-digit percentage rate, Black & Decker said. It had earlier forecast modest sales growth. "The change in the operating environment is expected to have a significant negative impact on operating income, compared to previous guidance," the company added. Black & Decker, which also makes Kwikset locks, said it expected to report net earnings of $3.39 per share for the fourth quarter. Excluding a large one-time gain from a tax settlement and the recall-related charge, the Towson, Maryland-based company said it expected to earn $1.03 a share for the quarter. Analysts, on average, were looking for $1.60 per share, according to Reuters Estimates, after the company forecast $1.55 to $1.65 in October. Nicholas Heymann, an analyst with Sterne Agee, said the magnitude of the lowered outlook signaled that retailers did not order many tools after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday weekend, which marks the start of the holiday shopping season. Heymann said it also indicated that a second reorder will not occur because of weakened consumer spending on remodeling and a softening of holiday sales of consumer durables. Black & Decker shares were down $3.63, or 4.4 percent, at $76.50 on the New York Stock Exchange after falling to $71.96, their lowest level since August 2006.
