 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch financial services group ING Groep NV ( ING.AS )( ING.N ) said on Friday that it has received regulatory approval for its acquisition of Turkey's Oyak Bank. 

 ING announced in June its deal to buy Oyak Bank for $2.67 billion, joining a rush of overseas financial groups buying into the fast-growing Turkish market. Approval to buy Oyak was granted by BDDK, Turkey's banking regulator, ING said in a statement. Oyak, a mid-sized Turkish bank owned by Oyak Group, is viewed as one of the last opportunities to get into Turkey's fast-growing banking sector after a series of foreign acquisitions.
