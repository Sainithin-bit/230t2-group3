 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Industrial production rose by a stronger-than-expected 0.3 percent in November, reversing an October decline as mining and manufacturing output rebounded, a Federal Reserve report showed on Friday. 

 Economists polled by Reuters ahead of the report had forecast total output to increase 0.1 percent in November. The October decline, originally reported as a 0.5 percent drop, was revised downward to a 0.7 percent decrease, making that the largest monthly drop since a 1.6 percent drop in October 2005. Manufacturing output, indicating some resilience to a U.S. economy hobbled by a housing downturn, rose 0.4 percent in November after a 0.6 percent drop in October. The manufacturing figure was helped by a 1.7 percent rise in motor vehicle and parts production and a 2.1 percent increase in computer and electronics products output. Excluding motor vehicle production, industrial output rose 0.2 percent in November. But production of consumer goods fell 0.2 percent, while output of construction supplies fell 0.1 percent in November. Wood products production fell 0.4 percent in November after steep falls of 3.2 percent in October and 2.2 percent in September Mining output increased 1.1 percent in November after a 0.7 percent fall in October, while utilities output fell 1.3 percent, matching their October fall due to mild weather. The November capacity utilization rate was 81.5 percent, slightly above the 81.4 percent figure for October. Economists, however, were predicting an 81.7 percent usage rate. Manufacturing capacity use was 79.9 percent in November, compared with 79.7 percent in October (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
