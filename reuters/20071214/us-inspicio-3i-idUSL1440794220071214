 LONDON  (Reuters) - UK private equity firm 3i Group Plc ( III.L ) said on Friday it had agreed to take over British testing specialist Inspicio INP.L for 228.6 million pounds ($467 million), through its bidding vehicle Angus Newco. 

 Shares in AIM-listed Inspicio rose 10.7 percent to 219.2p by 1048 GMT following the 225 pence-per-share bid. 3i faced competition from DLJ Merchant Banking, the private equity arm of Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), and private equity firm Clayton Dubilier & Rice to get the backing of Inspicio's board, sources close to the matter told Reuters. Up to six parties expressed interest in making an offer earlier in the bidding process, the sources said. It is still possible one of them could launch a counter-bid, but 3i has undertakings to accept the offer from holders of 20 percent of the shares. Inspicio, which has more than 5,000 staff, inspects the contents and safety of food and verifies the quality of commodities such as oil. The offer represents a 17.8 percent premium to its share price on October 11, the last day before Inspicio said it was in offer talks with a number of parties. The deal continues 3i's consolidation of the testing sector. Earlier this year it bought Finnish testing company Inspecta, which monitors the quality of welding work at nuclear power plants and the safety of elevators. 3i will not combine the businesses, but is keen on the sector, its head of business services told Reuters. "It's an incredibly fragmented market place with lots of opportunities to hoover up strategic acquisitions," Global Head of Business Services Alan Giddins said by telephone. "We are committed to supporting Inspicio's acquisitive strategy to continue to build its international presence in its core markets," he said. Inspicio is particularly keen on expanding its testing of metal and mineral quality in Asia and Australasia, driven by the huge boom in manufacturing demand from China and India. It might also expand its UK-focused food and environmental inspection and testing business across continental Europe. Inspicio Chief Executive Mark Silver and Finance Director Richard McBride will stay in place. DLJ Merchant Banking and Clayton Dubilier & Rice were not immediately available for comment.
