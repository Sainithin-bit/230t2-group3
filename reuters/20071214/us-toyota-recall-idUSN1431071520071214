 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Friday that it is recalling 15,600 Tundra pickup trucks in the United States because a rear propeller shaft may separate at the joint. 

 The recall involves 2007 model-year Tundra four-wheel-drive pickup trucks. "There is a possibility that a joint in the rear propeller shaft may have been improperly heat treated, resulting in insufficient hardness," Toyota said in a statement. This may cause a section of the rear propeller shaft to separate at the joint, it added. No injuries or accidents have been connected to the recall.
