 VIENNA  (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Klaus Liebscher said on Friday he was concerned that money market rates remained at 4.8 to 4.9 percent despite a liquidity injection by the world's major central banks. 

 "We have to take care that there is not too much liquidity coming into the market," Liebscher told journalists in Vienna. "In that regard, there is a certain concern that the money market is not coming down from 4.8 to 4.9 percent." Liebscher said the recent spike in euro zone consumer prices was "worrying" and showed that inflation would remain high well into 2008 and approach the ECB's target of 2 percent only towards the end of the year.
