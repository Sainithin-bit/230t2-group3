 MILAN  (Reuters) - Fire broke out at a ThyssenKrupp plant in Italy on Friday, just over a week after a blaze killed four workers at another company site, but the fire was put out with no injuries or damage, firefighters said. 

 A exterior dust filter caught fire at a service centre at the German steelmaker's plant in Terni, about 45 miles north of Rome, about 5:30 a.m. local time and was quickly controlled, a source with the fire brigade said. A company spokesman was not immediately available to comment. On December 6, a fire at a ThyssenKrupp plant in Turin, in northwest Italy, killed four workers and injured three. The deaths have sparked a debate on worker safety in Italy. (Reporting by Silvia Monteni, writing by Ian Simpson)
