 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Friday aircraft leasing company AWAS has placed an order for 31 single-aisle 737 planes worth about $2.3 billion at list prices. 

 Dublin-based AWAS, one of the world's largest second-tier plane leasing companies, has a fleet of about 315 aircraft, which it leases to airlines around the globe. The order caps a busy week for sales of Boeing's single- aisle planes, with orders worth more than $8 billion announced. On Monday, leasing company Babcock & Brown was named as the customer behind an order for 20 737s worth about $1.5 billion, and on Thursday, Boeing identified General Electric Co ( GE.N ) leasing unit GECAS as the buyer of 55 737s worth about $4.5 billion. The narrow body 737, which competes with Airbus' A320 family, is Boeing's biggest selling airplane, with 651 firm orders so far this year. Boeing has 1,146 firm orders for all its commercial aircraft so far this year, a record for the company, but still trailing European rival Airbus, a unit of EADS ( EAD.PA ) for the year. Boeing also on Friday named Kevin Schemm as head of commercial plane sales for North America, effective January 1. He succeeds Ray Conner, who is taking up the role of head of sales for the whole of Boeing's commercial plane unit after the retirement of former sales head Larry Dickenson.
