 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China's money market rates fell on Friday as an IPO-related funding squeeze ended, causing the seven-day repo rate to plunge, while most bond yields dropped after a good 10-year bond auction. 

 The finance ministry sold 26.35 billion yuan ($3.6 billion) of 10-year special bonds at a yield of 4.41 percent, below market expectations of between 4.45 and 4.50 percent. The bid-to-cover ratio was 2.22 times, stronger than most recent auctions. In response, the indicative 10-year government bond yield  in the secondary market fell to a five-week low of 4.5662 percent bid on Friday from 4.5771 percent on Thursday, according to Reuters Reference Rates. It was the biggest daily fall in two weeks. The most liquid five-year government bond yield edged up to 4.2631 percent bid from 4.2595 percent, but yields dropped across the rest of the curve. Banks were willing to buy bonds partly because they have more money available to do so, as authorities use "window guidance" to pressure them into restraining loan growth. Demand at Friday's auction was also boosted by the fact that it was the last auction on the finance ministry's calendar. It has not yet announced an issue schedule for the new year. But traders believe yields do not have much more room to fall since the market is awaiting further monetary tightening, after the large reserve ratio hike announced last weekend and Tuesday's news that November inflation hit an 11-year high. "Banks are still concerned about inflation, and we are also preparing money to resume lending out when we get next year's loan quotas," said a trader at a major Chinese bank in Shanghai. Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan said this week that China was concerned loose U.S. monetary policy could flood the economy with cash, and that the repercussions for monetary policy would not be negligible. Many traders think he was hinting that the central bank might be forced to tighten policy again in January -- though the market still expects tightening to focus mainly on draining liquidity with steps such as reserve ratio hikes, rather than on official interest rate hikes which would further shrink the gap between Chinese and foreign rates. BILL CURVE STEEPENS In the money market, the bill curve steepened because banks had finished fund-raising on the last day of subscriptions to a big initial public equity offer by China Pacific Insurance. Money frozen by the subscriptions, which analysts think will total well over 2 trillion yuan, will return to investors on Tuesday and Wednesday. The weighted average seven-day repo rate tumbled to 3.3421 percent by midday from 4.8415 percent on Thursday. Traders think it will continue falling to about 2.5 percent early next week, though the central bank appears likely to increase drains through money market operations as it tries to establish a new unofficial floor for the repo -- perhaps 3.0 percent -- early next year, traders said. "The central bank will increase bill sales and raise the reserve ratio again in January," said a trader at a securities company in Shanghai. The 90-day central bank bill yield in the secondary market fell to 3.7205 percent bid from 3.7290 percent.
