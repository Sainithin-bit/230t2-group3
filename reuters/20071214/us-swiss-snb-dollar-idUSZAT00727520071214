 ZURICH  (Reuters) - The Swiss National Bank on Friday released terms of its temporary term auction facility: 

 *The SNB said an auction for a 28-day dollar repo would take place on December 17 starting at 0930 CET (0330 EST), with a purchase date of December 20 and a repurchase date of Jan 17. *Minimum bids and detailed auction information will be published by Reuters on page SNBAUCT1. *All domestic and foreign banks who have a Swiss-franc auction facility at the SNB may participate in the dollar auction. *The minimum bid size is $1 million and the maximum $100 million. *The maximum size of the American-style auction is $4 billion. *The SNB will accept forms of collateral that are usually accepted by SNB repo auctions. Background: On Wednesday, the SNB, the Fed, the European Central Bank, Bank of England, the Bank of Canada and others announced a new short-term lending facility and other measures designed to ease pressures on the dollar interbank funding market. <ID:nN12621509> It was the first such joint action by major central banks since they took steps to help financial markets recover after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States.
