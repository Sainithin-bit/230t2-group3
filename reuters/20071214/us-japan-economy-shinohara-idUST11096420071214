 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's top financial diplomat said on Friday there may be more "waves" of confusion in financial markets, which have been unstable due to the global credit squeeze, adding that he was watching the U.S. economic outlook carefully. 

 "The first wave was a shocking one in August and the second wave hit after earnings of financial institutions were released" around October," Naoyuki Shinohara, vice finance minister for international affairs, told reporters. "There may be more waves to come, although I hope they will become smaller," he added. Shinohara said Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors will certainly continue discussing recent financial market movements when they meet in Tokyo next year. "In this kind of environment, we should not decide topics of (G7) discussions too early. We will discuss more after taking some rest over the New Year," Shinohara said. Japan takes over the presidency of the G7 group -- which comprises the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- from Germany in 2008 and will host the meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors, which is expected to be held in February.
