 PARIS  (Reuters) - French carmaker PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) said on Friday some 5,090 workers had applied for voluntary leave under the group's restructuring plan. 

 The group announced in September a plan to cut its workforce by between 7,000 and 8,000 in Western Europe this year. In a statement, it said that since the start of the year the workforce of its French automobile division had declined by 5,515. (Reporting by Dominique Vidalon)
