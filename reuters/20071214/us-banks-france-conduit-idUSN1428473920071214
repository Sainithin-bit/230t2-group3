 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A group of French banks are setting up an investment fund to bail out small and midsize asset managers if there is a liquidity shortage, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The banks, which include BNP Paribas SA ( BNPP.PA ), Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ), Natixis ( CNAT.PA ), Credit Agricole SA's ( CAGR.PA ) Calyon and the French unit of HSBC Holdings PLC ( HSBA.L ), have been working since this summer to create the conduit so that if liquidity dried up and investors wanted to withdraw their assets, the fund could prevent a fire sale by offering to buy those assets, the Journal said. While the value of the conduit is not yet known, the banks would put about $1.47 billion of their own asset-backed securities into it, the Journal reported. (Reporting by  Emily Chasan )
