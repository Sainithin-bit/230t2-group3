 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission expressed 
concern on Friday about higher-than-expected November inflation 
in the euro zone, calling on governments, unions and companies 
to cooperate in curbing price growth. 

  "The increase in inflation was higher than what we 
forecast, we were particularly worried in November," Commission 
spokeswoman Amelia Torres told a regular briefing.  Inflation in the 13 countries using the euro jumped to 3.1 
percent year-on-year last month from 2.6 percent in October, 
data showed on Friday. That was higher than the initial 
estimate for November inflation of 3.0 percent and well above 
the European Central Bank's target of just below 2 percent.  "This calls for renewed attention and moderation from 
governments, social partners and companies to avoid 
second-round effects," Torres said, referring to a phenomenon 
when the cost of oil triggers price rises in other sectors and 
in wages.  She also said it was up to the government of Slovenia to 
combat the causes of particularly high inflation in that 
country.  (Reporting by  Jan Strupczewski , editing by Dale Hudson)
