 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence was holding up well this month before the latest bout of financial turmoil but house prices suffered another record annual drop during July, according to data released on Tuesday. 

 Prices of U.S. single-family homes were down a record 16.3 percent in July from a year earlier, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Indexes, though a slowing monthly rate of decline has encouraged some hopes that the worst falls may be over. The Conference Board said its index measuring consumers' mood rose to 59.8 in September from 58.5 in August. That was above Wall Street's expectations but the timing of the survey may not fully reflect the latest chapter in the financial crisis. "They took the survey before the latest fallout, so I don't know what people would be saying today," said Al Kugel, chief investment strategist, Atlantic Trust in Chicago. "I think consumers are feeling better more because of the gasoline prices are going down. That was the thing that spooked them earlier this year, every time they had to fill their tank it was $40 or $50." U.S. stocks held onto gains after the stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data, as did the dollar. U.S. government bond prices, which usually benefit more from weak economic data, extended their losses. Another report showed business activity in the U.S. Midwest expanded in September at a faster rate than expected, with production picking up rapidly and hiring on the rise. The Institute for Supply Management-Chicago business barometer slipped to 56.7 from 57.9 in August, but economists had forecast the index at 53.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. LESS PESSIMISM, NOT OPTIMISM Markets remain vulnerable to swings in sentiment over a bid to bail out the beleaguered financial sector. A plan to remove up to $700 billion in bad mortgages from financial institutions failed to pass the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday, sending markets reeling. Tuesday's data was a timely reminder that the economy's woes are a result of the worst housing slump since the Great Depression. Since the peak of the housing boom in July 2006, house prices have dropped by about 20 percent. Still, there was a case to be made for less pessimism than in recent months, though few would expect a rapid recovery given current economic and financial conditions. The monthly pace of home price declines since May has slowed to about a third of the rate of the two previous three-month periods, S&P said. "There are signs of a slowdown in the rate of decline across the metro areas but no evidence of a bottom," David Blitzer, chairman of S&P's index committee, said in the statement. The Conference Board data showed the gauge of consumers' inflation expectations fell to 6.2 percent from August's downwardly revised 6.6 percent. That was the lowest since 6.1 in March and may help the Federal Reserve feel more comfortable keeping rates low to ride out the economic turbulence. There were conflicting signals throughout that report. Consumers' evaluation of their present situation fell to 58.8 -- the lowest since October 1993 -- from 65.0 in August. The gauge of expectations improved to 60.5 -- the highest in eight months -- from 54.1. However, consumers' estimation of the labor market deteriorated. The "jobs hard to get" index rose to 32.8 -- its worst reading since October 2003 -- from 31.7. Similarly, the "jobs plentiful" gauge fell to its lowest also since October 2003, dropping to 12.2 from 13.5. If the current financial crisis continues to worsen, consumer confidence could take another hit after spending much of the year undermined by high oil prices, which have only recently retreated from record highs. "September's increase in the Consumer Confidence Index was due solely to an improvement in the short-term outlook," the survey quoted Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, as saying. "However, these results did not capture all of the tumultuous events in the financial sector this month and until the dust settles a bit more, we will not know the full impact on consumers' expectations." The overall consumer confidence index dates back to 1967. Its lowest reading ever was 43.2, reached in December 1974.
