 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The top two Democrats in the Congress wrote President George W. Bush on Tuesday that they expect to soon approve a bipartisan financial rescue plan. 

 "Working together, we are confident we will pass a responsible bill in the very near future," Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi wrote Bush. The two Democrats vowed to work with the White House and their Republican colleagues in Congress. (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
