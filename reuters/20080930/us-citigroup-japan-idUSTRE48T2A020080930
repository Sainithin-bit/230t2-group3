 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) plans to sell Bellsystem24 Inc, a Japanese call center, and has hired Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Niko Citigroup as financial advisers for the deal, according to people with direct knowledge of the plan. 

 The company, which is owned by a Citigroup unit, Nikko Principal Investments, is valued at $2 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier, citing people familiar with the deal. Nikko Principal earlier this year sold StylingLife Holdings, a holding company of six retail units spun out of Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) in 2006, to Japanese TV and media group Tokyo Broadcasting System ( 9401.T ).
