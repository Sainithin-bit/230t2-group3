 NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - Stressed financial markets risk doing severe damage to the broader economy, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart said on Tuesday. 

 "Problems in our financial system add significant risk to the downside for the economy," Lockhart told a business group in prepared remarks. Lockhart said things had become worse rather than better in the past month, noting a considerable deterioration of market conditions and ever-increasing reluctance on the part of banks to lend. He said labor market conditions had also become more dire, with layoffs becoming more widespread and hiring intentions fading fast. In this context, Lockhart said inflation would likely be less of a problem. "I feel better about inflation," he said. Lockhart added that one recent bright spot in the economy, export growth, was threatened by signs of slowing growth in the economies of major U.S. trading partners.
