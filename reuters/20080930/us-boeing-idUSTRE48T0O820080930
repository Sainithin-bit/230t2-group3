 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Tuesday it would reassess the delivery schedule for its new 787 Dreamliner aircraft to the Japanese market when a strike ends. 

 Japan's two biggest airlines -- Japan Airlines Corp (JAL) 9205.T and All Nippon Airways (ANA) ( 9202.T ) -- have already announced expected delays in receiving the 787 jets in the face of a machinists' strike that came on top of an 18-month delay in shipment of the planes. A prolonged strike by 27,000 machinists who walked off the job on September 6 would seriously hurt 787 development and ripple through a global aerospace industry already strained by project costs, currency volatility and a faltering global economy. JAL said earlier this month that it expected to receive its first 787 Dreamliner aircraft in October 2009, instead of the initial plan for this August, while ANA expects to have its first 787 in August 2009, 15 months later than originally planned.
