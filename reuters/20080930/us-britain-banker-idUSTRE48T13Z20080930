 LONDON  (Reuters) - British police opened a murder investigation on Monday after a senior executive of Barclays Bank ( BARC.L ) died from injuries inflicted on him when he intervened to stop an assault. 

 Frank McGarahan, 45, chief operating officer of Barclays Wealth, the private banking division of Britain's third biggest bank, was injured early on Sunday in the eastern city of Norwich, police said. He died on Monday at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. "Mr. McGarahan was spending a quiet evening out with family and friends ahead of a family christening in Norwich on Sunday when he witnessed an assault while queueing for a taxi ... after which he sustained a fatal injury," a police statement said. News reports said McGarahan suffered head injuries when he intervened to try to stop the attack. "We are shocked and saddened at the loss of a valued colleague and friend," said a spokesman for Barclays, where McGarahan had worked for the last 10 years.
