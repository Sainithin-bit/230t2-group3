 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reliant Energy RRI.N shares plunged as much as 51 percent on Tuesday, a day after the company cut its profit forecast and said it had obtained $1 billion of new financing to replace a credit facility. 

 Reliant, which operates power plants with a capacity of more than 15,000 megawatts and owns a Texas retail electricity business, blamed the drop in forecast earnings on Hurricane Ike and hedging losses. Earlier this month, Reliant peer Constellation Energy Group CEG.N was forced into a quick sale to MidAmerican Energy Holdings because of fears that it would face liquidity problems. Reliant said it had secured a $650 million senior secured loan with Goldman Sachs at Libor +4.5 percent and another $350 million of convertible preferred debt with First Reserve at an interest rate of 14 percent. But analysts said they did not think Reliant's situation was as dire as Constellation's had been and that there was little risk of insolvency. "They've taken on this expensive debt and the preferred for a reason, and that's to prevent that," Gordon Howald, an analyst with Calyon Securities said. Howald cut his recommendation on Reliant shares to "neutral" from "add" and price target to $10 per share from $22. The new capital replaces a $300 million credit facility that Reliant had with Merrill Lynch that enabled the power producer to avoid posting millions of dollars in collateral. DEBT COSTS RISING "I would certainly acknowledge that it was not an ideal time to raise money in the capital markets and it was expensive to do that," Reliant Chief Executive Mark Jacobs told an analyst conference call. Reliant's bonds plunged, with the energy company's 6.75 percent bond due 2014 dropping 9.5 cents to 85.5 cents on the dollar, according to MarketAxess. The cost to insure $10 million of its debt with credit default swaps rose to $850,000 per year for five years, from $620,000 on Monday, according to CMA DataVision. Calyon's Howald estimated that cost of the new debt and associated dividends would be about $100 million annually. Jacobs said that while the decision to unwind the Merrill facility was mutual, Reliant was likely to fail to meet requirements mandated under that pact because of the poor performance of its Texas retail business. "When we look at it, we removed what we saw as a significant risk here that the (credit facility) would become unavailable to us for a number of reasons," he said, adding that the outlook for Merrill had contributed to the decision. Merrill Lynch, one of several financial institutions to be hit by the credit crisis, agreed earlier this month to be purchased by Bank of America ( BAC.N ). Shares of Reliant, which sank to a low at $4.94 in the opening minutes of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, later traded at $7.02, still down more than 30 percent from Monday's close. The shares have lost more than three-quarters of their value since reaching $28.74 in December 2007. (Additional reporting by  Karen Brettell ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
