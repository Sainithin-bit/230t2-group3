 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer confidence improved in September as inflation expectations fell to a six-month low, the Conference Board said on Tuesday, though it noted its survey did not capture all the latest events in the financial crisis. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Conference Board said its index measuring consumers' mood rose to 59.8 in September from an upwardly revised 58.5. August was originally reported at 56.9. * The result for September was above economists' expectations for a reading of 55.5, according to a Reuters poll. Their 71 forecasts ranged from 50.0 to 65.3. * However, the cut-off date for this survey was September 23, which may mean that it did not fully reflect the effects of the latest turmoil in financial markets. * The gauge of consumers' inflation expectations fell to 6.2 percent from August's downwardly revised 6.6 percent. That was the lowest since 6.1 in March. * Consumers' evaluation of their present situation fell to 58.8 -- the lowest since October 1993 -- from 65.0 in August. * The gauge of expectations rose to 60.5 -- the highest in eight months -- from 54.1. Consumers' estimation of the labor market also deteriorated. COMMENTS: BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "The survey for the consumer confidence usually ends up on the 20th of the month, so that covers the period when the TARP, the rescue plan, was announced and conceivably, at that point, stocks were still doing pretty good so people might have had a  little healthier mindset. The key is that it's all based on the rise in expectations in six month outlook. The labor market differential fell further, so the job market remains soft and that's going to have some implications for Friday's nonfarm payroll." HUGH JOHNSON, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, JOHNSON ILLINGTON ADVISORS, ALBANY, NEW YORK: "Any one month measure of consumer confidence shouldn't be taken too seriously... You can make anything out of anything, you have to look at it over a longer period of time... "I don't see too much of a trend there, except to say I see the trend being down... I think that this says that consumers clearly see that economic conditions are deteriorating, although overall confidence has been volatile within a declining trend... "It's pretty clear from this that consumers do not like the trend in the economy and that's driven in great part by employment conditions. We've lost jobs in every month since January." AL KUGEL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ATLANTIC TRUST, CHICAGO: "They took the survey before the latest fallout, so I don't know what people would be saying today. I think consumers are feeling better more because of the gasoline prices are going down. That was the thing that spooked them earlier this year, every time they had to fill their tank it was $40 or $50." KURT KARL, HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH AND CONSULTING, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "They are a little bit more optimistic, but it is still at very low levels. It looks like the present dropped way down and the expectations was way up and the balance came out to slightly up for the two, so that is not necessarily great news. It means that they are hopeful, at least we're through the month, but feel that the current situation is deteriorating. So that is not great news, it is okay news that it didn't go down further. We are looking at a dispirited present situation, but it is good they are hopeful. The basic underlying message, even with this uptick, is that consumer confidence is quite low. Given what we have seen on income and concerns about the economy it looks like we will have a negative couple of quarters of consumer spending. We are not in a good space here." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "The market is quite frankly focused on politics and not so much on the consumer or housing data right now. The consumer data is likely to remain lackluster for some time, but I don't put a lot of weight on that number. In a sense, the bailout plan is misnamed because it's not a giveaway of money for free but a fund to buy bad assets from banks so they can resume lending. So there may be a disconnect in the minds of individuals, but it partly has to do with the semantics used." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock hold gains after stronger-than-expected consumer confidence data. BONDS: Treasury prices extend losses after data. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains after data.
