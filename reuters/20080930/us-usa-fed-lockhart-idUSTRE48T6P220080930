 NEW ORLEANS  (Reuters) - Stressed financial markets risk doing severe damage to the broader economy, Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart said on Tuesday. 

 The United States is experiencing its worst credit crisis since the Great Depression, a downturn that began with troubles in the housing sector, particularly rising foreclosures and falling home values. The economy as a whole has managed to eke out some modest growth thus far, but many economists believe a recession may already be under way. "Problems in our financial system add significant risk to the downside for the economy," Lockhart told a business group in prepared remarks. On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected a $700 billion bailout plan, driving the Dow Jones industrial average down 778 points -- its worst-ever drop in terms of points. The market rebounded on Tuesday, with the Dow up 400 points, or almost 4 percent in afternoon trading, on hopes for a second attempt, but Lockhart said he did not see a comprehensive package making it through Congress. Lockhart said things had become worse rather than better over the last month, noting a considerable deterioration of market conditions and ever rising reluctance on the part of banks to lend. "There has been a widespread withdrawal of confidence in counterparties that has resulted in efforts to reduce exposure," Lockhart said. Against that backdrop, demand for liquidity from the Fed, already high, has picked up significantly, the Atlanta Fed president said. LAYOFFS SPREAD, HIRING PLANS EBB He added labor market conditions had also become more dire, with layoffs becoming more widespread and hiring intentions fading fast. In this context, Lockhart said inflation would likely be less of a problem. "I feel better about inflation," he said. Still, he did not offer any hints that the Fed will cut interest rates again, as futures markets now appear to be expecting. "I expect the Fed will push the funds rate down by 50 basis points by early in 2009," said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank. The Fed cut the benchmark fed funds rate sharply between September 2007 and April of this year, down from 5.25 percent to the current 2 percent. The central bank has also taken a string of extraordinary measures, thus far with only limited success, to keep credit markets from imploding. It has set up an array of lending facilities, and accepted riskier collateral for short-term loans. It has also orchestrated bailouts for large financial firms like Bear Stearns and AIG. Lockhart added that one recent bright spot in the economy, export growth, was threatened by signs of slowing growth in major U.S. trading partners. Anecdotal evidence indicated things would not get better any time soon. Moody's Investor Service said on Tuesday the U.S. housing market bust may not bottom until 2010, later than previously thought, adding that more home builders may fail before an eventual recovery. Still, he said the Fed continued to believe the economy would skirt outright contraction, and said the prospect of an actual depression was not realistic.
