 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators will provide initial guidance on fair value accounting and will remind financial services firms that they don't need to use fire sale prices when evaluating their hard to price assets, according to a document obtained by Reuters. 

 The Securities and Exchange Commission will issue the guidance as early as on Tuesday, the document indicated. U.S. accounting rule maker, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, will propose additional guidance later this week, the document said. U.S. accounting rule makers assume that fair value inputs are based on an orderly transaction between willing market participants. The document indicated that the SEC does not believe distressed, or forced liquidation sales are orderly transactions.
