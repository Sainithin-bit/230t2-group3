 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch's ( BAC.N ) top dealmaker Andrea Orcel is leaving the bank to join rival UBS ( UBSN.VX ), two sources with knowledge of the matter said. 
 Orcel was appointed executive chairman of global banking and markets at BAML in September 2009, a year after Merrill Lynch was taken over by Bank of America following the credit crunch. "It's a great hire. He is a relationship man, not a manager and (UBS's chief executive Sergio) Ermotti knows him well", said a top UBS banker in London. "This would be well-received internally, he is a big name". Orcel specializes in financial services and has advised on some of Europe's largest deals including the break-up of Dutch lender ABN Amro. More recently, he helped Italian bank Unicredit raise 7.5 billion euro ($9.89 billion) in fresh equity. BAML and UBS declined to comment. Orcel was not available for immediate comment.
