 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ), Airbus ( EAD.PA ) and Embraer ( EMBR3.SA ) have come together to work with governments and biofuel producers to promote and speed up the availability of jet fuels that reduce carbon emissions. 
 The three aircraft makers signed a memorandum of understanding at the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG) Aviation and Environment Summit in Geneva, Boeing said in a statement. "Two of the biggest threats to our industry are the price of oil and the impact of commercial air travel on our environment," Boeing CEO Jim Albaugh said. A new EU law that took effect from January 1 makes it obligatory for airlines flying in and out of the region to buy carbon permits to offset their emissions. However, a trade war is brewing with the United States, China and India -- the top three carbon emitters -- questioning the EU's legal jurisdiction to charge for an entire flight.
