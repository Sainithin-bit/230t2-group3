 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will spell out a "comprehensive plan" on Monday to stabilize the financial system, the Treasury Department said on Friday. 

 "In the address, Secretary Geithner will discuss the Obama administration's strategy to strengthen our economy by getting credit flowing again to families and businesses, while imposing new measures and conditions to strengthen accountability, oversight and transparency in how taxpayer dollars are spent," the Treasury said in a statement. The speech is scheduled for noon Eastern time. Geithner is widely expected to present a menu of options for cleaning up the bad assets that are weighing down banks' balance sheets and constraining lending, which has contributed to a deep recession. High on the list will probably be a guarantee or insurance plan that would essentially ring-fence the troubled loans and set a floor under the banks' potential losses. Taxpayers would be on the hook if losses exceeded a set amount. Geithner may also propose a so-called "bad bank" that would buy those assets from the banks and either hold them until market conditions improve or resell them. Government officials have been wrangling over how best to solve the problem of mounting bank losses while at the same time keeping the cost to taxpayers at a minimum. Voters are still seething over a $700 billion bailout program approved last fall, so the administration is reluctant to ask Congress for another large spending authorization -- particularly when lawmakers are still working on a stimulus package worth more than $800 billion.
