 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aon Corp AOC.N, the largest global insurance brokerage by assets, said fourth-quarter net income fell sharply on restructuring and acquisition costs, but margins improved and earnings before special items beat Wall Street expectations, sending Aon shares up 12 percent. 

 Atlantic Equities analyst Alan Devlin credited Aon for being able to stay a step ahead of rising costs despite tough economic conditions. "The earnings surprise came on margins" in its brokerage and consulting units, he said. Net earnings fell 95 percent to $10 million, or 3 cents a share, from $207 million, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations, excluding certain items, rose 19 percent to 81 cents a share. Revenue slipped 4 percent to $1.9 billion, largely because of foreign currency translation. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings from continuing operations of 79 cents a share on revenue of $2.06 billion. Risk and insurance brokerage revenue, which accounts for roughly 80 percent of total income, was 3 percent lower, and consulting revenue fell 8 percent. Aon's expenses were 1 percent higher at $1.8 billion. The company had higher restructuring costs from efforts over the last several years to cut costs. Aon is tightening its belt as it grapples with higher pension costs and lower interest rates eating into investment income. "We are making tough decisions around expenses as we further streamline our costs," Chief Financial Officer Christa Davies said on a call with investors. The broker closed its acquisition of reinsurance broker Benfield last November. Benfield added $38 million to AON's revenue in the fourth quarter but also added $42 million in expenses, shaving about a penny off per-share profit. Shares of Chicago-based Aon were up $4.38 to $40.83 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares fell 2.5 percent on Thursday. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
