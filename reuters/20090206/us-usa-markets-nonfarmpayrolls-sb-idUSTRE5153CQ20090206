 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. employers slashed 598,000 jobs in January, the deepest cut in payrolls in 34 years as the national unemployment rate shot up to 7.6 percent, according to a Labor Department report on Friday that underlined a deepening recession. 

 KEY POINTS: * January's job losses were worse than the 525,000 that had been forecast by Wall Street economists, who also had expected the unemployment rate to come in lower at 7.5 percent. * Last month's job reductions were the largest since 602,000 in December 1974, while the jobless rate reached its highest level in more than 16 years. * January's losses followed upwardly revised cuts of 577,000 in December and 597,000 in November. * The manufacturing sector bled jobs at the sharpest rate during January in more than 26 years, shedding 207,000 workers after cutting 162,000 in December. COMMENTS: GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS,  MISSOURI: "January job losses were worse than expected and occurred across the board. The only place we saw any improvement was in education and government. The private sector clearly is pulling back. Companies are cutting costs to bring expenses into line with weak sales and workers are on the front line of that cost cutting. In nearly every sector there's bad news. The only bright spot is that businesses are able to increase productivity which is a forerunner for restoring profitability. But for now, employees are paying the cost." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR &  ASSOCIATES IN TORONTO: "The numbers seem to be roughly in line with consensus. I think the things to watch are 3 million jobs lost in 2008, and an unemployment rate well above 7 percent right now. With that kind of unemployment rate, clearly customers are in an area of being frugal. If this continues, the consumer will stop spending, not just be frugal anymore. "I think these numbers put added urgency to the package in Washington. Some of the discussion seems to be that we can take our time with the package, I think the unemployment rate will create urgency to get something through now rather than a more balanced package later. I think the markets will be watching what happens with the package very closely now." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT, TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: "It gets worse and worse and worse. The economy is just falling into oblivion, and it will get worse. What this does is puts the focus on the Senate debate. Everyone across markets is watching Washington. If Obama has difficulty getting this bill passed, then how will be he get Geithner's plans approved, which are supposed to roll out next week? The quagmire that could develop has people worried. What this number does is sharpen Obama's attack, letting him say we have to act now." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures fall, then reverse course to move higher after data. BONDS: U.S. short-dated Treasury debt prices pare gains, long-dated Treasuries extend losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends losses versus euro.
