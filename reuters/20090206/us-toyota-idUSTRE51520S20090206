 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) ( TM.N ) forecast a far bigger full-year loss than it had flagged just six weeks ago as the world's biggest automaker struggles to cut production fast enough to match a sharp drop in global sales. 

 A sudden dive in demand since late last year has caught automakers around the world flat-footed, but the pain is especially pronounced at Toyota, which is saddled with too much capacity after years of building new plants to keep up with demand. Toyota started the current financial year with a bullish forecast to make 8.87 million vehicles in the 12 months to end-March. On Friday, it saw that number at 7.08 million, down by a fifth, as it put a third of its global assembly lines on a single shift. "The sales environment has worsened dramatically in the past month and a half in the main markets of Japan, North America and Europe," Executive Vice President Mitsuo Kinoshita told a news conference. For the year to the end of March, Toyota now expects an operating loss of 450 billion yen ($4.95 billion), three times what it forecast in late December and a similar consensus forecast in a Reuters Estimates survey of 18 brokerages. Toyota changed its annual net forecast to a 350 billion yen loss from a 50 billion yen profit. It would be its first net loss since 1950. Citing the likelihood of persistent pressure on Toyota's earnings through next year, Moody's Investors Service earlier cut its credit rating on Toyota for the first time in a decade, to Aa1 from Aaa. For its October-December third quarter, Toyota reported an operating loss of 360.5 billion yen against a year-earlier profit of 601.6 billion yen. It posted a third-quarter net loss of 164.6 billion yen against a year-earlier profit of 458.7 billion yen. Revenue fell 28 percent to 4.80 trillion yen. "This is absolutely awful," said Yoshinori Nagano, chief strategist at Daiwa Asset Management. "But hopes for U.S. economic steps and their effectiveness have supported the company's stock, and that will likely continue even after the earnings. Still, if something goes wrong on that front, that could batter the stock price once again." Kinoshita said he expect the U.S. market to stay at the current low levels for the time being and begin to turn up around the year-end, supported by President Barack Obama's stimulus package.

On its way to posting a first consolidated operating loss in its 70-year history, Toyota has announced a slew of measures to control spending, including putting off all projects to expand production capacity and cancelling directors' bonuses. Kinoshita said Toyota aimed to cut fixed costs by 10 percent, or roughly 500 billion yen, partly through work-sharing and other arrangements. Having let most temporary workers go, Toyota could also cut regular jobs in Britain and North America, a source said, in a rare move for the automaker, which prides itself on its job security. "We will look into various measures, taking into consideration labor laws in each country," Kinoshita said. "But we will not make any involuntary job cuts." In a sign that production levels could stay low for months, Toyota's sales in the United States, its biggest market, fell 34 percent in January and 23 percent in Japan. Both were better than the average falls in those markets. Toyota on Friday forecast annual global vehicle sales of 7.32 million units, against an earlier forecast for 7.54 million, and sales a year earlier of more than 8.9 million. Kinoshita said that while the sales environment was "extremely unpredictable," he did not expect production and sales to be lower in the new business year. "Toyota's fixed costs haven't been reduced," said Koji Endo, an auto analyst at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. "I'm more worried about next financial year, which will probably be even more difficult than this year." Shares in Toyota are up around 5 percent so far in 2009 as investors favor stocks with competitive long-term prospects, beating Tokyo's blue-chip Topix index  .TOPX , which is down 8 percent. Ahead of the results on Friday, the stock ended up 1.6 percent at 3,090 yen, while the Topix closed up 0.6 percent.
