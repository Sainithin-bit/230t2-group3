 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Monday will lay out the Obama administration's ideas for tackling the financial crisis and its plans for disbursing what remains in a $700 billion financial bailout fund. 

 Some of the options Geithner could unveil might entail asking Congress for more cash to prop up banks. Following are some of the ideas under discussion: ASSET GUARANTEES The government is likely to offer banks a sort of insurance policy by guaranteeing against losses on distressed assets that would remain on a bank's books. Under this plan, assets would be "ring-fenced" from other loans on the bank's balance sheet, which could bolster investor confidence and help the bank raise private capital. With asset guarantees, the government could leverage taxpayer funds by getting the Federal Reserve or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp to cover a larger amount of assets than the Treasury could buy on its own. Because of the potential expense of setting up a separate entity to hold bad assets -- another widely discussed possibility -- asset guarantees have been gaining favor among some policy-makers. The Treasury, the Fed and the FDIC have tailored two major guarantee programs for Citigroup and Bank of America in this manner. BAD BANK The government could acquire toxic assets from banks and warehouse them in a taxpayer-backed "bad bank" that would hold them for several years until economic conditions improve. The hope would be to turn struggling institutions into "good banks" by shielding them from debilitating losses, which should put make it easier for them to attract private capital and increase lending. The Bush administration initially pitched the $700 billion rescue fund as a mechanism to buy up illiquid assets from banks, but quickly abandoned the idea as too slow and complicated to stem massive market turmoil last fall. A key problem still exists: how much should the government pay for the assets? Price them too high and taxpayers bear too much risk; price them too low and all banks with similar assets must recognize losses, further impairing capital. Some analysts estimate the government may have to pay up to $4 trillion to soak up all of the bad assets on banks' books. However, a smaller disbursement could provide the seed money that could be leveraged into a wider program. FUNDING FED PROGRAMS The Treasury is expected to use some of the remaining bailout funds to help the Fed expand a program that has been set up to support consumer and small business lending. Currently under the program -- the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility -- the Fed will lend up to $200 billion to holders of AAA-rated asset-backed securities collateralized by auto, student, credit car and small business loans, to try to free up credit. The Treasury pledged $20 billion to cover potential losses the Fed might face. The Treasury and Fed have said that program could be expanded to cover an array of mortgage-backed securities or other assets, and could play a role similar to a "bad bank." An expansion would require the Treasury to pledge more money. MORTGAGE FORECLOSURE RELIEF Last month, the White House promised to dedicate between $50 billion and $100 billion of remaining bailout funds to prevent foreclosures. Democrats in Congress would like to fund a mortgage guarantee program hatched by the FDIC under which the government would insure home loans against default. Policy-makers might choose to blend the mortgage aid with other market-stabilizing programs. The FDIC might guarantee troubled mortgages, helping banks, but then rewrite those loan terms in favor of the borrower. CAPITAL INJECTIONS Whatever approach it takes on dealing with toxic assets, the Treasury is likely to continue tapping bailout funds to make investments in banks to shore up their capital. Bank regulators are still sifting through thousands of applications for government capital injections under a program set up with the first half of the bailout funds. In addition, non-bank and industrial firms are also trying to line up for cash. The investment programs under TARP have been limited to preferred shares and warrants for future common shares at deep discounts. Some Democrats have suggested the government purchase common equity in banks or nationalize the weakest ones. MARK-TO-MARKET ACCOUNTING Speculation that the plan would include some form of suspension or modification of "mark-to-market" accounting rules, which require banks to recognize losses if their assets fall in value, gave a lift to bank stocks on Thursday. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd said on Wednesday it might be possible to modify the rules without "walking away" from the underlying standard. A source told Reuters on Thursday the Treasury and Securities and Exchange Commission were not discussing suspending the rule. The rules are at the heart of the conundrum facing banks, because many of the problem assets are illiquid, so a benchmark price is nearly impossible to establish.
