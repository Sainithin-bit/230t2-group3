 KOHALA COAST, Hawaii  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy could start to grow again by late 2009, but policy-makers must take urgent, aggressive action to boost demand and create jobs, the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, Janet Yellen, said on Friday. 

 "The economy is in the midst of a downward spiral, and that calls for strong policy responses," Yellen said in an address to the 128th Assembly for Bank Directors meeting on the Kohala Coast of Hawaii. "Government policies to restore confidence, create jobs by boosting the demand for goods and services, and improve the functioning of our financial system represent our main hope of avoiding a very severe economic contraction." As it stands, "2009 is shaping up to be, by many measures, the most challenging economic environment of the postwar period," said Yellen, who is a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2009. On a day when the government announced the biggest job losses in 34 years, bringing losses for the past 13 months to about 3.6 million jobs, Yellen said now was not the time to dither or debate endlessly. "It is critical that decisions on these matters be made on a timely basis so that the economy's downward spiral is not allowed to deepen," she said. "NO END IN SIGHT" Yellen said consumer spending had been stopped in its tracks as American households have hunkered down and acted to boost their savings rates in response to spiraling unemployment and a "staggering" $10 trillion loss of household wealth. Housing was a key trigger for the current recession, and "unfortunately, there is no end in sight" to housing woes as inventories of unsold homes remain high and private mortgage credit remains scarce, said Yellen. Meanwhile, a yawning output gap in the U.S. economy suggests "inflation will remain, for some time, below levels that are consistent with price stability." Yellen said the FOMC's recent comments that it intends to keep short-term interest rates low for a considerable period are one way it can bolster the economy, even though its key monetary policy tool, the fed funds rate, was essentially slashed to zero percent in December. "By offering guidance about the likely course of future short-term interest rates ... the committee hopes to influence longer-term interest rates and asset prices, which in turn affect the spending decisions of households and firms," she said. Yellen said past banking crises had shown the importance of removing bad assets from banks' balance sheets, and looked for a proposal on that score from the Obama administration soon, as a prerequisite to restoring stability to the financial system and, ultimately, the economy. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is due on Monday to outline a "comprehensive plan" to stabilize the financial system. "As long as hard-to-value, troubled assets clog their balance sheets, banks find it difficult to attract private capital and to focus on new lending," Yellen said. "Our financial system has, in many important ways, broken down," she said, adding that banks' response of tightening lending terms has only intensified the recession. "Diminished access to credit for households and businesses is intensifying the economic contraction and, in turn, exacerbating financial distress." Yellen said the Fed, in response, has "crossed traditional boundaries" in providing liquidity to various corners of the credit markets, and can continue to find new ways to help. The Fed could potentially expand the size of its Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, designed to backstop the issuance of securities collateralized by auto, student and credit card loans, or extend the program to additional asset classes, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, she said.
