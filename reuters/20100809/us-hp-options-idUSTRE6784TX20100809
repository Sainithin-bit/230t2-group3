 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co option volume surged on Monday, but the activity suggested divided sentiment over what the resignation of chief executive Mark Hurd will mean for the company. 

 Hurd resigned on Friday after an investigation into charges of sexual harassment found he had falsified expense reports to conceal a "close personal relationship" with a contractor. The shares were under pressure on their first day of trading after the Friday announcement, but option traders appeared indecisive as the company searches for a new CEO. "Investors and traders have not been able to decide whether or not this resignation is going to be a very big negative for the company going forward or just a small event," said William Lefkowitz, chief options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. HP volume was explosive. The turnover was 20.2 times greater than average daily levels with about 193,000 calls and 157,000 puts traded, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert. But the heavy volume was not accompanied by a dramatic change in the stock's option implied volatility -- a key component of an options price, according to Jud Pyle, chief investment strategist at Options News Network, a division of market making firm PEAK6 Investments in Chicago. "Despite the move in the stock today, traders are not anticipating a dramatically different volatility forecast than what they had late last week," Pyle said. ONN data show August at-the-money implied volatility levels stood at around 30 percent on Monday, about in line with Friday's data. "This indicates an ambivalence among traders on the Hurd news and instead the focus is on the earnings report due on August 19, Pyle said. Monday's activity showed investors were of differing minds. Many were looking at Monday's drop in the cash market as a buying opportunity and were buying calls or selling puts to establish a long stock position, said TD Ameritrade chief derivatives strategist Joe Kinahan. HP shares closed at $42.60, down nearly 8 percent. But others were buying put options or selling calls "on the view that the resignation could have a long term negative effect on the company," he said. The stock's implied volatility trended higher preceding the news, which Trade Alert President Henry Schwartz called "unusual" because "there was no official catalyst and the general market was quiet." August HP implied volatility for the $46 strike stood at 30 percent at last Friday's close, up from 27.7 percent on July 30, according to Trade Alert. HP shares closed at $46.30. The rise in implied volatility -- which measures expectations of greater price movement -- was pricing in greater stock movement while the CBOE Volatility Index fell from 23.50 on July 30 to 21.74 on Friday. "As the news continues to come out over the next weeks, traders expect more price movement in HP shares until there is an effective resolution of this event, Kinahan said.
