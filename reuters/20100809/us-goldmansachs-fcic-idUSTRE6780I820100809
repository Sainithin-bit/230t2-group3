 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) has informed the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC) that 25 percent to 35 percent of its revenue was derived from the derivatives businesses, the Wall Street Journal said, citing a person familiar with the situation. 

 The figures were part of a Goldman response to a request by the FCIC to disclose information about its derivatives holdings and operations, the Journal said. The FCIC was set up by the U.S. government to examine the causes of the financial and economic crisis. The panel is also examining the role of derivatives in flaring up the financial crisis. Goldman was already scrutinized by the panel for its derivative deals with the bailed out insurer AIG ( AIG.N ) during the financial crisis. A memo sent to the panel Thursday night by Goldman included an analysis of derivatives-based revenue from 2006 through 2009, a person told the Journal. Based on the percentages provided by Goldman, derivatives businesses generated $11.3 billion to $15.9 billion of the company's $45.17 billion in net revenue for 2009, the paper said. An FCIC spokesperson did not immediately confirm that the commission has received the information from Goldman or any other firm, according to the Journal. "We have asked for the same information from several banks," the FCIC spokesman told the Journal. "They have all indicated they are working hard to provide that information to us. If we need additional information, we will ask for it," the spokesman told the paper. The commission is required to issue a report on the causes of the financial crisis by December 15. FCIC and Goldman could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by Hans Peters)
