 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - The female contractor whose sexual harassment accusation against Mark Hurd led to his ouster as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard came forward on Sunday, saying she never intended for Hurd to lose his job. 

 The woman, Jodie Fisher, revealed her identity for the first time through a statement released by her attorney, Gloria Allred. "I was surprised and saddened that Mark Hurd lost his job over this," she said. "That was never my intention." Fisher is former salesperson and has appeared in movies and TV shows, most recently the show "Age of Love" on NBC. HP stunned the business world on Friday by announcing Hurd's resignation, accusing him of falsifying expense reports to conceal a "close personal relationship" with a female contractor. Fisher told HP's board in June that Hurd had sexually harassed her, but an investigation found no violation of the company's sexual harassment policy. Fisher said Sunday she has resolved her claim against Hurd privately, but did not provide any further details. "At HP, I was under contract to work at high-level customer and executive summit events held around the country and abroad," Fisher said. "I prepared for those events, worked very hard and enjoyed working for HP." Fisher worked as a contractor for HP from late 2007 through 2009. (Reporting by  Gabriel Madway ; Editing by  Diane Craft )
