 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP ( BP.L ) said the cost of dealing with its ruptured oil well in the Gulf of Mexico has risen to $6.1 billion, including $319 million in compensation payments to businesses and individuals affected by the spill. 

 About 145,000 claims had been submitted as of August 7, and 103,900 payments have been made, the company said on Monday. BP also confirmed that no oil is leaking into the Gulf following a successful effort to plug the well on July 15. (Reporting by  Myles Neligan , editing by Sarah Young)
