 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - U.S. and British regulators are investigating the timing of Goldman Sachs Group Inc's disclosure to them that the bank was the subject of a federal civil fraud probe, Goldman said on Monday. 

 The U.S.-based Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the UK-based Financial Services Authority are continuing their own probes of the bank's marketing of 2007 collateralized debt obligations tied to subprime mortgages. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman with civil fraud over the CDOs. The bank paid $550 million last month to settle the charges. Goldman said on Monday that the FINRA and FSA investigations include the matter of when those regulators were notified of the SEC probe. A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
