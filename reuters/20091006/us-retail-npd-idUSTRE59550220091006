 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While most retailers saw bleak sales this back-to-school season, consumer electronics chains saw renewed demand for notebook personal computers, according to a report from market research firm NPD Group. 

 That could be good news for PC makers this holiday shopping season, with few stand-out gadgets to woo shoppers. Overall consumer technology revenue for the U.S. back-to-school season fell 12.5 percent this year to $7.6 billion, NPD said on Tuesday. NPD measured sales for the seven-week period from late July through mid-September. But notebook PCs performed better, as revenue for the category was flat versus a year ago, largely influenced by a drop in the average selling price per unit to $624 from $804. Within that category, thin and light netbooks were a big draw, accounting for 14 percent of all notebook units sold for back-to-school. That was up from just less than 2 percent of sales last year, NPD said. NPD called notebook PCs "the only true must-have" category for back-to-school in the consumer technology sector. They made up 21 percent of all revenue, it added. "Notebooks seem to be recession-proof and this back-to-school season was no exception," said Stephen Baker, vice president of industry analysis at NPD. More consumers opted for netbooks and low-cost notebooks under $500 as viable options despite the weak economy, Baker said. Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ), the world's No. 1 maker of personal computers, expects very aggressive pricing for PCs during the coming holiday season, as consumers remain focused on buying lower-priced products. Electronics retailer Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) said last week it was beefing up holiday hiring, expecting a better holiday sales performance fueled in part by purchases of netbooks, flat-screen televisions and digital book readers.
