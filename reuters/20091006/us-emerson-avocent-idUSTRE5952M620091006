 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Industrial conglomerate Emerson Electric Co ( EMR.N ) said it would buy network equipment technology provider Avocent Corp AVCT.O for about $1.2 billion in cash to expand its business that ensures the stability of large computer systems. 

 Emerson said it would pay $25 for each share of Avocent, a premium of 22 percent to the stock's Monday closing price of $20.52. Avocent shares jumped $4.29, or 21 percent, to $24.80 in early Nasdaq trading, while Emerson rose $1.19, or 3 percent, to $39.94 on the New York Stock Exchange. Emerson had $1.8 billion in cash in late June, according to its most recent regulatory filing. The St. Louis-based company has said it expects to spend up to $1.5 billion on acquisitions this fiscal year, which began this month, and up to $400 million on share repurchases. Huntsville, Alabama-based Avocent's board unanimously endorsed the terms of the deal, which the companies expect to close early in calendar 2010. TARGETING DATA CENTERS The deal will increase Emerson's $2.6 billion data center business, which makes systems to manage the temperature and energy use of large computer networks used by telecommunications, healthcare and industrial companies. Avocent, whose customers include Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) and Brocade Communications Systems ( BRCD.O ), provides hardware and software for managing data centers. About half of its 2008 sales of $657 million were from outside the United States. The agreement is also another sign of a revival of dealmaking in the industrial and technology sectors after a prolonged slump. Last month, private equity firm American Securities said it would pay $411 million for engine component maker GenTek GETI.O, and industrial conglomerate Danaher ( DHR.N ) said it would buy two makers of scientific instruments for a total of $1.1 billion. SPX Corp ( SPW.N ), Carlisle Cos ( CSL.N ), FMC Technologies Inc ( FMC.N ) and other companies have announced smaller deals. Credit Suisse analysts, in a recent research note, said industrial companies were likely to do smaller, bolt-on acquisitions, but would probably steer clear of large deals to conserve cash until clearer signs of an economic recovery emerged. The analysts named Illinois Tool Works ( ITW.N ), Parker Hannifin Corp ( PH.N ) and Eaton Corp ( ETN.N ) among likely acquirers.
