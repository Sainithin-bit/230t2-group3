 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gold soared to a record high and global shares jumped on Tuesday after Australia became the first G20 member to raise interest rates in more than a year, boosting confidence the global economic recovery is on track. 

 The dollar slumped as the optimism diminished safe-haven demand for the U.S. currency. The Australian dollar hit a 14-month high against the U.S. currency after the country's central bank raised interest rates by a quarter point to 3.25 percent and heralded more rate rises. That and other signals of global economic progress, including recent economic data, are supporting asset prices broadly but may soon create disparities for investors. "The big story is Australia, as other countries will now seek to raise rates, in contrast to the United States where the Fed is expected to raise rates last," said Lee Hardman, currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. In the short term, the dollar may remain under pressure as risk sentiment is improving and capital flows were turning toward higher growth and emerging assets, he said. The dollar move fueled a rally in gold, which is also seen as a hedge against chances of stronger economic growth sending inflation higher around the globe, said Tom Bentz, an analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures. "Whether inflation becomes a serious threat or not is being challenged here," Tom Sowanick, co-chief investment officer at OmniVest Group LLC in Princeton, New Jersey. Spot gold prices rose $25, or 2.46 percent, to $1,041.70 an ounce, after earlier touching a record $1,043.45. The dollar lost 0.42 percent against a basket of major currencies .DXY. The Australian dollar rose as high as $0.8919, and was last quoted at $0.8888. The euro gained 0.44 percent to $1.4713 and the dollar fell 0.82 percent to 88.77 yen. RATE HIKE, COMMODITIES SPUR STOCKS The optimism fueled by Australia's rate hike and the rise in commodity prices spurred gains in stocks. The three major U.S. stock indexes all rose more than 1 percent, also boosted by the quarterly earnings season, which kicks off on Wednesday when aluminum producer Alcoa Inc ( AA.N ) is to announce results after the closing bell. Alcoa shares gained 3.5 percent to $13.89, while Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), the world's largest maker of heavy machinery and earth-moving equipment, added 1.87 percent to $51.70 and was a top boost to the Dow industrials. Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc ( FCX.N ) shot up 3.42 percent to $69.61. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  rose 1.37 percent to 9,731.25 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  climbed 1.37 percent to 1,054.72. In Europe, financial and commodity-related shares helped drive the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  up 2.22 percent. Miners' shares also surged on the back of the rally in gold, with BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) and Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ) gaining 4.6 percent and 6.9 percent, respectively. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS rose 1.93 percent. "I'm encouraged a commodity-exporting country is sensing enough economic activity to raise rates," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago, referring to Australia. MORE RATE HIKES SEEN Australia's move is expected to be followed by South Korea, whose won currency also hit a one-year high against the U.S. dollar before retreating on suspected intervention by the authorities. The Reserve Bank of Australia, in announcing its rate hike, said it was safe to row back on stimulus now that the worst danger for the economy had passed. Investors are now pricing in at least one more rate rise by Christmas and rates above 4 percent in a year. "The real news is the upbeat outlook that accompanied the move, with a bullish growth forecast suggesting further hikes are more than likely. Now that the cycle of global loosening is broken, Norway will almost certainly be next at the end of the month and attention will turn to Canada and New Zealand," analysts at Royal Bank of Canada said in a client note. "We see scope for the NZ dollar and Canadian dollar rallies as those hikes start to be priced in." The U.S. dollar fell earlier also after Britain's Independent newspaper cited unidentified sources in Gulf Arab states and Chinese banking sources in Hong Kong in a report on a possible move to replace the dollar in oil trading. France's economy minister, Christine Lagarde, later dismissed the report as "speculation," saying that a move to replace the dollar "is not on the agenda." U.S. light sweet crude oil rose 63 cents, or 0.89 percent, to $71.04 per barrel. U.S. Treasury debt prices dropped amid increased supply of the securities reduced safe-haven demand as the stock market rallied. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes dropped 9/32, sending their yields higher by 0.03 percentage point, to 3.26 percent.
