 LONDON  (Reuters) - Spot gold surged to a record high on Tuesday at $1,036.40 per ounce on Tuesday as the dollar weakened, fuelling buying of the precious metal as an alternative investment. 

 Both spot gold and U.S. gold futures have benefited from a confluence of factors including the dollar's decline, technical buying momentum and worries about potential inflation as central banks struggle to emerge from unprecedented fiscal stimulus measures.
