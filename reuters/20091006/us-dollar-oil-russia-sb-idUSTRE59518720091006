 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - Russia has not discussed changing the dollar's role in the global trade of oil, deputy Russian finance minister Dmitry Pankin said on Tuesday. 

 "We did not discuss this at all," he told reporters. Pankin was asked by reporters about a story in Britain's The Independent newspaper, which quoted unidentified sources as saying Gulf Arab states were in secret talks with Russia, China, Japan and France to replace the U.S. dollar with a basket of currencies in the trading of oil.
