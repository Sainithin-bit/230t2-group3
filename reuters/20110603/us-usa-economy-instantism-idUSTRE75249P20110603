 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The service sector saw an acceleration in growth in May, according to a private survey, giving some hope that earlier data on payroll growth will improve in coming months. 

 COMMENTS: JOE MANIMBO, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, TRAVELEX GLOBAL BUSINESS PAYMENTS, WASHINGTON: "It was a number that can help remove some of the sting out of the weaker-than-expected nonfarm payrolls report. If investors are focused on the positives on that number, hopefully that can bolster hopes that the downturn that the U.S. economy seems to be in will be short-lived. If we can see Wall Street pare some of its earlier losses, that would tend to be dollar-negative as investors flee safer assets and look for higher yields. The next level for the euro/dollar would be the $1.46 figure. For dollar/yen, we'll see if we can break 80, the key threshold." RUDY NARVAS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK: "It was better than expected, given that it came on the back of weak payrolls. It is a little ray of hope in an area of grey data. Employment was up even though you had services down in the payrolls report, and overall it does not look so bad if you look at the breakdown of the non-manufacturing data. In light of what happened to the manufacturing data and to other data, this could be the outlier of what is going on. "We still view this soft patch of data as temporary. In some sense this may affirm that it is only really impacting the manufacturing sector, given the fact this all seems to be related to the Japanese parts shortage." GIRI CHERUKURI, HEAD TRADER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: "I think the (stock) market was coming back a little bit already before the (ISM) number and that helped. After how the market has been, I think people are trying to find value and looking for some optimistic news. "I think, overall, people have come to the conclusion that the economy is in a slow patch right now, and people are trying to figure out how temporary this slower growth is -- whether it's actually a change or a bump in the road for the recovery, and right now it's a bump in the road." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK "It's sort of OK, it's the second weakest in a year but an improvement from April, so that's a good sign. And then new orders was up quite a bit so that's great -- employment was also better. Yeah. It's an indication that maybe we've seen the worst of this slowdown already. "I think (QE3) is highly, highly unlikely. Partly because QE2 contributed to the slowdown. The whole reason the economy slowed down is because gas is $4 a gallon and half the reason oil prices rose was because the dollar weakened and the dollar weakened because of QE2. "The ISM number is a small improvement from April but still quite a bit worse than the first three months of the year. On top of that, the weight of data on the other side is so, so strong. Consumer spending has been losing steam since February, so one number going the other way is -- obviously, it's nice to see something that got better in May but it doesn't refute the case for a slowdown. Now we wait and see what the retail sales and consumption data show. If we got decent consumption outside of spending for gasoline, that's the best hope for the economy." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON, NEW YORK: "It's an unexpected positive in a long line of negative reports. Nonetheless, the jobs growth in the services sector was very weak in May, according to the nonfarm payrolls report. But the employment index of ISM services was stronger, so I see something of a disconnect. We would tend to look at this report as 'glass-half-empty,' and I think the market will be a bit skeptical of this number. Going into the weekend, I think a lot of people are favoring the yen and Swiss franc. There's an elevated sense of risk on both sides of the Atlantic right now, with the data and the debt ceiling issue in the U.S. and the Greek debt crisis that has not been alleviated in any significant way in Europe." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes pared losses. BONDS: U.S. bond prices trimmed gains slightly. FOREX: The dollar cut losses against the yen
