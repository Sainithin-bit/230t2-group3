 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The concentration of Greek debt ownership among large euro zone banks improves the chances that any restructuring of the bonds would be orderly, analysts said Friday, as negotiations to resolve the crisis intensify. 

 Senior euro zone officials agreed in principle on a new international bailout of Greece to give it time to resolve its deficit crisis, but negotiations with private sector bond holders remain delicate. While some form of debt restructuring is looking increasingly inevitable, European banks are eager to avoid a disorderly process that could trigger a Lehman-style meltdown of inter-bank lending markets and undermine other euro zone debt. With Greek debt concentrated in the hands of a handful of players, it may prove possible to limit the fallout from any restructuring, although uncertainty remains over what would constitute "voluntary" restructuring. Greek sovereign debt "is largely at European Union financial institutions. Ownership is highly concentrated: by our estimates, the largest 30 accounts hold 65-75 percent of the debt," Barclays Capital said in a note on Friday. "This should make it easier to negotiate and achieve a decent success rate on any restructuring," Barclays said. A key issue is to avoid triggering the payout of default insurance through Credit Default Swaps (CDS) on Greek sovereign debt, a move that could start a negative feedback loop and suck in other susceptible sovereign debt, analysts say. The prices of CDS move depending on perceptions about a borrower's creditworthiness, and the prospect of a forced or voluntary restructuring. Many of the foreign Greek bond holders are public sector bodies such as central banks and public institutions. Among the private creditors, German and French banks dominate, Barclays Capital said. The biggest private sector holders are Portugal's Millennium BCP, Dexia, Societe Generale, and Commerzbank, Barclays Capital said. Fitch Ratings said German banks could absorb a hypothetical 50 percent haircut of Greek sovereign exposure. Such a move "would not result in such a depletion of banks' capitalization that a rating action would be automatically triggered." Substantial amounts of sovereign Greek exposure lie with public sector lender KFW in its agency role, servicing its owner the German government, and run-off institutions backed by loss-absorption mechanisms from the German government. The most exposed large commercial bank is Commerzbank with around 2.9 billion euros of sovereign total exposure, most of which is attributable to the public sector portfolio accumulated by its subsidiary, Eurohypo. BANK FUNDING CRISIS A disorderly or forced restructuring may lead to panic in the bank refinancing market amid uncertainty about exposure. Banks use medium and long-term markets to fill the funding gap created by mismatch between loans and deposits. European banks source 40 percent of their funding from the wholesale markets, analysts at Citi estimate. Two-thirds of this comes from the short-term markets. Sovereign fears have caused the cost of accessing unsecured funding to rise and the European Central Bank has propped up the inter-bank lending market with liquidity through its refinancing operations.
