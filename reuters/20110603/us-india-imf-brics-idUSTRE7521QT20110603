 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - There has been no sign yet of a joint candidate from the developing countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa to head the International Monetary Fund, an Indian government source told Reuters on Friday. 

 The official, who declined to be named, said French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde will visit India on June 7, as part of a trip to China and Brazil also to drum support for her candidacy to head the IMF. India is talking with other emerging countries to build support behind a common candidate from the developing world, with Mexico's central bank chief a possibility, two Indian government sources said last week.
