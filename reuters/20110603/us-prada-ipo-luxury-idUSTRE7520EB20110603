 (Reuters) - Fashion power house Prada is the first Italian company to seek an initial public offering in Hong Kong. 

 Analysts say an increasing exposure to Asia, a focus on leather goods and a strong retail network can be key drivers for growth at Prada and other luxury goods makers. Here are some facts about Prada and its peers. GROWTH POTENTIAL Milan-based Prada, known for its leather handbags and Miu Miu dresses, is among the world's best known luxury goods makers, along with names such as LVMH's ( LVMH.PA ) Louis Vuitton, PPR's ( PRTP.PA ) luxury unit Gucci, Hermes ( HRMS.PA ), Burberry ( BRBY.L ) and Tod's ( TOD.MI ). With net sales of over 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) in 2010, it grew twice as much as the luxury sector average, according to research from one of the listing bookrunners seen by Reuters and which was not distributed to the media. ASIA FOOTHOLD Greater China and the rest of Asia-Pacific together account for 40 percent of Prada group's sales, more than that of peers. However, Prada's sales of 646 million euros in Asia (excluding Japan) were less than that reported in the region by Louis Vuitton and Gucci. Europe remains Prada's biggest market, accounting for 42 percent of sales. RETAIL BOOST Prada generates 71 percent of its sales from its own retail network, compared with 54 percent in 2009. That is close to Gucci and Hermes (73 percent and 77 percent, respectively) and ahead of brands such as Tod's (51 percent), Burberry (63 percent), Richemont (50 percent) and Swatch (17 percent). Analysts say Prada and Miu Miu are under-represented in terms of number of stores in Asia relative to peers, especially in second and third-tier cities. LEATHER GOODS Leather goods, which offer higher margins, are expected to be the fastest-growing category for Prada, whose roots are in the leather business. The division accounts for 50 percent of revenue, close to Gucci (55 percent) and Hermes (50 percent). An equity research note by Goldman Sachs seen by Reuters expects leather goods to account for 53 percent of sales by 2014. Other luxury goods makers such as Ferragamo, Burberry and Tod's are boosting production of leather bags and accessories. (Compiled by Antonella Ciancio; Editing by Will Waterman)
