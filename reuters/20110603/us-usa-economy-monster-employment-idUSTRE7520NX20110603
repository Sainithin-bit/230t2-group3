 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A monthly gauge of online labor demand in the United States dipped modestly in May from April, but rose compared with a year earlier, suggesting strong springtime recruitment, a private research group said on Friday. 

 Monster Worldwide Inc, an online careers and recruiting firm, said its employment index dipped 1.4 percent to 143 in May from 145 in April. The index was up 6.7 percent from 134 a year ago. "There has been considerable escalation in recruitment activity during 2011 with online job demand reaching the highest reading for the month of May in the index since 2008," Jesse Harriott, a senior vice president at Monster, said in a statement. While the private sector is seeing growth, with demand for healthcare, personal-care and service jobs rising, government-related opportunities continued to lag, Monster said. The index saw annual growth in 14 of the 20 industries and 19 of the 23 occupations monitored last month. Of the 28 metro markets, only Washington declined on a yearly basis. The report was another look at the jobs market ahead of Friday's key non-farm payrolls report. The economy likely added 150,000 jobs in May, according to a Reuters poll -- less than the 180,000 forecast before data on Wednesday showed a sharp slowdown in private job growth last month. The index is a monthly analysis based on a selection of corporate career sites and job boards. The margin of error is approximately plus or minus 1 percent.
