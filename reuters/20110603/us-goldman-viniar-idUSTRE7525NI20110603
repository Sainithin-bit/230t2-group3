 PALO ALTO, California  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc is keenly aware of the risks to its reputation caused by investigations into its behavior and is doing all it can to address them, its finance chief said on Friday. 

 "We take all of the criticisms quite seriously ... We're doing everything we can," Chief Financial Officer David Viniar told an investor conference at Stanford University. Viniar was speaking just a day after the Wall Street bank was hit with a subpoena from New York prosecutors to explain some of its actions in the run-up to the financial crisis. Goldman is also the target of probes by the Justice Department, the New York Attorney General and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations come in the wake of a report by a U.S. Senate subcommittee that criticized Goldman's mortgage-linked derivatives trades in 2006 and 2007. "We never at least intentionally take reputational risk," Viniar said. (Reporting by  Jim Christie  in Palo Alto and  Lauren Tara LaCapra  in New York. Editing by Knut Engelmann)
