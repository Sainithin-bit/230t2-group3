 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese cabinet ministers played down worries about Moody's warning that it could downgrade the United States if there is no progress in raising its debt ceiling, with the outlook for U.S. public finances raising uncomfortable questions about Japan's debt burden and its Treasury holdings. 

 Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said on Friday he was sure the U.S. government would maintain trust in the dollar and had no concerns about U.S. public finances. Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda was equally confident, as well as an official from another major Asian country who declined to be identified. Japanese officials tend to avoid expressing concern about the U.S. budget deficit because Japan's public finances are weak and it holds a lot of U.S. Treasuries. Still, the warning from Moody's could cause concern among investors as public finances in many countries, including those of the United States, are under scrutiny due to Europe's sovereign debt crisis. "I am sure the U.S. government will make it a priority to maintain trust in the dollar as a global reserve currency," Yosano said. "I'm not worried about the United States in the slightest." Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday it would consider cutting the United States' coveted top-notch credit rating if the White House and Congress fail to make progress by mid-July in talks to raise the U.S. debt limit. Moody's warning increases pressure on Democratic President Barack Obama and House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican in the U.S. Congress, to strike a deal soon or risk upsetting global financial markets. Asian policymakers, who have held much of their reserves in dollars, often insist in public that there is no real alternative to the U.S. currency. One senior official managing reserves in another major Asian country also expressed optimism on Friday that the Republicans and Democrats will eventually agree to raise the debt ceiling. Data on investment flows tell a different story, suggesting that a number of countries, particularly China, have become more active in diversifying their reserves. Foreigners bought a net 4.696 trillion yen of Japanese bonds in the five weeks to May 20, a record amount of purchases for any five consecutive weeks since data began to be compiled in its current form in 2005. One source said China appears to be buying the four- to five-year sector after having sold a large amount of short-term bills earlier in the month. Japan is also grappling with fiscal deficits and bulging public debt, which may be a reason Japanese officials avoid criticizing other countries' debt problems. "Basically, I think there is trust in the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries," Noda said, declining to comment any further about Moody's. Japan's public debt is already about twice the size of its $5 trillion economy and ratings agencies are threatening to downgrade it due to the cost of reconstruction after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and a concerns that a policy logjam will thwart fiscal reforms. Japan held $907.9 billion in U.S. Treasuries as of March, the most recent month for which U.S. Treasury data on foreign holdings is available, ranking only behind China on the list of the largest foreign creditors.
