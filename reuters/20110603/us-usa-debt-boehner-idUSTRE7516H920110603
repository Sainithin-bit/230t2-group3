 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ratings agency Moody's warning that it could consider downgrading the United States' credit rating underlines the need for the White House to "step up" in debt talks, the top Republican in Congress, John Boehner, said on Thursday. 

 "The White House needs to get serious right now about dealing with our deficit and debt," Boehner said in a statement. (Washington newsroom)
