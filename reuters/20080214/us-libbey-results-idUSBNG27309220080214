 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Glassware maker Libbey Inc LBY.N posted a surprise fourth-quarter profit, driven by higher sales, lower expenses and a litigation settlement, and forecast first-quarter sales above Wall Street's view, sending its shares up as much as 21 percent. 

 "Sales growth was strong in U.S. and Europe, aided by favorable foreign exchange," CL King & Associates analyst Jim Barrett said by phone. Selling, General and Administrative spending was also below expectations primarily due to lower management bonuses, compared with the year-ago quarter, Barrett added. The company posted quarterly profit of $10.3 million or 71 cents a share, excluding a non-cash charge of $15.3 million. Analysts were expecting a loss of 4 cents a share, before items, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 5.5 percent to $225.1 million, beating analysts' view of $221.4 million, boosted by growth in sales of its Crisa product, increase in shipments to the United States and Canadian retail glassware customers. International segment sales were up 32 percent, helped by a 10.8 percent favorable currency impact. SG&A expenses fell to $22.3 million from $28.1 million, a year ago. For the first quarter, Toledo, Ohio-based Libbey forecast sales of $185 million to $190 million. It sees 2008 sales of $850 million to $870 million. "Assuming the U.S. dollar remains weak we would expect continued sales strength in Europe," Barrett said. Sales in China is also starting to ramp up, said Barrett, who has an "accumulate" rating on the stock. Two analysts on average were expecting revenue of $179.5 million for the first quarter and one analyst was expecting revenue of $852.2 million for 2008. Shares of the company rose $1.41 to $15.89 in afternoon trade, making them one of the top percentage gainers on the New York Stock Exchange. It touched an intra-day high of $17.60 earlier in the session. (Reporting by Swagata Gupta in Bangalore; Editing by Amitha Rajan)
