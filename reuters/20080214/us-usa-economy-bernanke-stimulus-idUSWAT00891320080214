 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that the $152 billion 2008 stimulus package would boost the U.S. economy by the third quarter, if not sooner. 

 "It will have an impact as early as the third quarter, maybe even a little bit in the second quarter," Bernanke told the Senate Banking Committee. Bernanke also said that the stimulus plan, along with the Fed's interest rate cuts, should make the second half of the year stronger than would otherwise have been the case, making the economy more resilient to additional external shocks.
