 LONDON  (Reuters) - Buying past winners in the stock markets sounds like a no-brainer, but this simple momentum strategy gives long-term returns at least twice as great as short-selling past losers, a study showed on Thursday. 

 Momentum trading, which involves investors following the trend of a particular stock, is often used by hedge funds and those focusing on quantitative strategies. The study by the London Business School, sponsored by Dutch bank ABN AMRO AAH.AS ABN.N, has found that buying stocks which gave the top 20 percent past returns in Britain gave a nominal annual return of 18.3 percent in the past 52 years. This compares with a return of 6.8 percent for a strategy of short-selling stocks that gave the worst 20 percent returns. Researchers' momentum strategies involved ranking stocks into winners and losers based on past returns over a 12-month period, buying the winners and short-selling the losers, holding them for one month until rebalancing. Winners beat losers by 10.8 percent per year across the entire UK equity market from 1956 to 2007. In the longer period, covering top 100 stocks over 108 years, the winners beat losers by 10.3 percent per year. This means one pound invested at the beginning of 1900 in the winner portfolio would have grown to more than 4-1/4 million pounds, compared with 111 pounds in the loser portfolio, in nominal terms. "Momentum gives large potential profits but it's not for the faint hearted. Anyone who has contra-momentum strategies faces a serious headwind, but pro-momentum strategies have big risk and big costs," said Paul Marsh, a professor at London Business School, one of the authors of the study. Typical winning UK stocks included Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ), BG Group ( BG.L ), Xtrata XTA.L or BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ), while losers included Taylor Wimpey ( TW.L ), Wolseley ( WOS.L ) and Yell Group YELL.L. The study also found that since 1900, equities are the best-performing asset class in nearly every country. An investment in UK equities of 100 pounds at the start of 1900 would have grown to over 2.2 million by the end of 2007 when dividends were reinvested, giving a return of 9.7 percent per annum. This compares with long bonds and Treasury bills, which gave annualized returns of 5.3 percent and 5.0 percent respectively, which still beat inflation of 4 percent. (Editing by Sue Thomas)
