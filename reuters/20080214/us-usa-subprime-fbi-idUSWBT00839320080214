 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The FBI recently opened two more investigations, bringing to 16 the number of corporations now being probed as part of its crackdown on subprime mortgage industry fraud, a bureau spokesman said on Thursday. 

 FBI spokesman Bill Carter said the two other investigations started after January 29, when FBI officials told a news briefing that 14 corporations involved in subprime lending were under scrutiny as part of an initiative launched last year. He declined to identify any of the corporations. But FBI officials have said the companies range across the financial services industry, from mortgage lenders to investment banks that bundle loans into securities sold to investors. The FBI also is investigating possible insider trading by some executives, the officials have said. Carter said the FBI was working closely with the Securities and Exchange Commission in some of the investigations. FBI and U.S. Justice Department officials said criminal charges were not imminent in any of the cases under investigation. At a House Judiciary Committee hearing last week, Attorney General Michael Mukasey said he could not comment on the FBI's investigations, but said the subprime issue would be a priority. Mukasey said there first needs to be a gathering of the facts and then decisions would be made on whether prosecutions need to be brought. (Reporting by  James Vicini , Editing by Brian Moss)
