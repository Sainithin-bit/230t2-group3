 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ) said that Bill 
Ackman's estimate that the bond insurer faces more than $11 
billion of potential losses is based on faulty assumptions, and 
is clearly intended to help Ackman's bet that the company's 
shares will drop. 

  MBIA said in a letter to regulators dated February 11 and 
made public on Thursday that the model and data Ackman used to 
determine MBIA's losses appear to "have some major 
deficiencies," including its use of 1,267 randomly selected 
securities to estimate losses. MBIA instead uses a loan-by-loan 
analysis.  Bill Ackman, founder of hedge fund Pershing Square Capital 
Management, has been vocal about his short position in MBIA for 
years.  In a letter sent at the end of January, Ackman suggested to 
regulators that MBIA and other bond insurers should not be 
allowed to shift funds from their regulated insurance units to 
their holding companies.  Ackman said that those dividends from the operating unit to 
the parent company would unfairly shift funds to investors that 
could pay off policyholders.  MBIA said in its letter that if the bond insurers' holding 
companies were deprived of cash flow, their ratings would fall, 
and their operating units' ratings would fall as well.  "Mr. Ackman purports an interest in 'Saving the Bond 
Insurers,' but his cynically self-serving proposals offer no 
such salvation," MBIA said.  MBIA said in written testimony obtained by Reuters on 
Wednesday that lawmakers and regulators should curtail 
short-sellers beating down its stock, which has fallen more 
than 80 percent since the start of 2007.  (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Brian Moss )
