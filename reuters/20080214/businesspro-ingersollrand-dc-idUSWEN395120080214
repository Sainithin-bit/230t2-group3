 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 
Ingersoll-Rand Co. Ltd. ( IR.N ) reported a sharply higher 
quarterly profit on Thursday that reflected a large gain on the 
sale of its Bobcat machinery division. 

  Fourth-quarter net earnings were $2.5 billion, or $9.06 per 
share, compared with $222 million, or 72 cents per share, a 
year earlier.  Earnings from continuing operations were 61 cents per 
share, and were negatively affected by 18 cents per share 
because of a higher tax rate, the company said.  It was not immediately clear how that compared with the 99 
cents per share expected by Wall Street, according to Reuters 
Estimates.  Revenue rose 8 percent to $2.32 billion, compared with Wall 
Street forecasts for sales of $2.28 billion.  (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
