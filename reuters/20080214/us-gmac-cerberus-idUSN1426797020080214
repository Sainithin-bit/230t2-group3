 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - GMAC LLC, the auto and mortgage lender controlled by Cerberus Capital, may face "substantial difficulty" if credit markets do not improve, Cerberus founder Stephen Feinberg wrote in a January letter to investors, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday. 

 "We have detailed contingency plans in a continuing worsening environment," Feinberg wrote, according to Bloomberg. "However, if the credit markets continue to decline and we find ourselves in a prolonged environment of capital market shutdown, GMAC could run into substantial difficulty." Cerberus declined to comment. GMAC posted a $724 million fourth-quarter loss earlier this month and was downgraded by Moody's Investors Service after more customers fell behind on payments for their houses, cars and trucks. The loss compared with a year-earlier $1.02 billion profit, but improved from a $1.6 billion loss in the third quarter. Cerberus led a group that bought 51 percent of GMAC in 2006 from General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), which owns 49 percent of GMAC.
