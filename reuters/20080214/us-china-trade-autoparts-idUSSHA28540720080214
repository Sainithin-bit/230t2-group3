 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - China faces its first defeat at the World Trade Organisation over a dispute on its import tariffs for car parts, but industry officials say the impact on domestic parts suppliers will be minimal even if Beijing is forced to slash tariffs. 

 The United States and the European Union filed the case to the WTO in March 2006, complaining that China's taxes on imports of foreign auto parts discouraged Chinese car makers from using them. A U.S. trade official said on Wednesday they had won a preliminary ruling on the case, even though the final ruling is not expected to be made public until the second or third quarter of this year. The case would be China's first loss at the WTO. "I can't see any major impact on us even if we lose the case, as our products are not inferior to foreign-made ones," said an executive at the planning division of Weichai Power 000338.SZ ( 2338.HK ), a major home-grown diesel engine maker that counts Chinese heavy truck manufacturers among its clients. Weichai's A shares, traded in Shenzhen, rose 2.1 percent to 81.20 yuan ($11.29) in late afternoon trade, outperforming a 1.28 percent gain in the benchmark index  .SSEC . Shanghai-traded FAW Sihuan ( 600742.SS ), which supplies parts to leading Chinese auto maker FAW Group, was up 3.24 percent at 11.18 yuan. Industry executives also ruled out the chance of a massive influx of imports, as auto parts makers such as Delphi DPHIQ.PK and Visteon ( VC.N ) had been making products locally for years, which in effect kept smaller rivals out of the  world's second-largest auto market. Delphi, which had earlier filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. automotive history, is thriving in China, operating more than 10 manufacturing facilities with total investment amounting to more than $500 million so far. "The big guys are already here and doing pretty well, " said Chen Qiaoning, an industry analyst with ABN AMRO TEDA Fund Management. "Nearly all the major parts are produced locally and that makes new entrants very difficult if not impossible," Chen added. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat, called the preliminary decision a "victory for open markets and American workers". But industry analysts said the case against China was more to do with politics than economics at a time when the Detroit giants are swamped in losses amid a weakening economy. "It's convenient to blame others while the big three are deep in losses in North America," said Liu Yuandong, an analyst with CSM Worldwide, an international industry consultant. "I don't think it would be a big help for them financially even China slashes its tariffs on parts as requested." China's WTO commitments require it to set a much lower tariff on imported auto parts than it does on finished vehicles, the U.S. trade official said at the time it filed the case. However, China taxes imported auto parts at the same rate as completed automobiles if the finished vehicles made from the parts fail to meet certain local content requirements. Ultimately, the U.S. and EU, joined by Canada, could be given the right to impose sanctions on China if the WTO were to issue a final ruling in their favor and Beijing refused to change its auto parts tariff policy. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao told a news conference said on Thursday that China respected the dispute resolving mechanism and would not comment on the issue before the experts' panel reached its final ruling.
