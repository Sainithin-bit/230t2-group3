 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said on Wednesday that his office is keeping a close eye on plans by Microsoft Corp. to acquire Yahoo Inc. 

 "We are monitoring the situation and will continue to follow it closely," Blumenthal said in a telephone interview. "Monitoring in my view includes watching and following it." Microsoft made an uninvited bid of $31 a share for Yahoo, valuing the Web pioneer at $41.6 billion, on February 1. Yahoo formally rejected the offer on Monday, but left the door open for higher bids and other suitors. For law enforcement officers across the country, the potential tie up is sounding some alarm bells. "We are monitoring it because there may be issues of concern under our antitrust authority," Blumenthal said. Microsoft has a previous history of butting heads with antitrust officials both in the United States and in Europe. In Brussels, the European Union brought an antitrust case against Microsoft in 1993. The legal wrangle lasted until the autumn of 2007 when Microsoft said it would comply with the European Commission ruling, paid an almost 500 million euro fine and promised to unbundle some of its software and provide interoperability information. The U.S. antitrust case with Microsoft reached a settlement in 2002 over how the software giant sold its Windows operating system. A federal judge recently extended for two years until 2009. New York, California, Connecticut and several other states were behind that extension. Blumenthal declined to say what how the state might proceed. "I can't talk about what we might do in advance of something happening. That will depend on what happens." (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss)
