 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - James Murdoch, son of media mogul 
Rupert Murdoch, will receive a base salary of $3.4 million and 
could earn another estimated $16 million in annual bonuses as 
part of his promotion to News Corp's NWSa.N head of Asian and 
European operations, the company said on Thursday. 

  Murdoch late last year was picked to become chairman and 
chief executive of Europe and Asia at News Corp, taking charge 
of its broadcasting, print and Internet divisions, including 
Hong Kong-based Star TV, Britain's Sun newspaper and Sky 
Italia.  Murdoch is viewed as the likely heir to his father's vast 
global media empire some day.  In a U.S. regulatory filing, News Corp said Murdoch's pay 
in his new job would amount to the $3.4 million base salary; a 
cash bonus of up to $3.4 million based on the performance of 
his operating divisions; and a cash and stock bonus of up to 
$12.5 million based on News Corp's earnings.  In addition, Murdoch will be eligible to participate in a 
long-term incentive plan under which he could be granted 
performance-based or discretionary equity awards.  (Reporting by  Paul Thomasch ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
