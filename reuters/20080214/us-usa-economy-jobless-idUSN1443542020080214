 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell by 9,000 last week, the government said on Thursday, though a more reliable gauge of labor trends rose to its highest in more than two years. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance aid fell for the second straight week, slipping to 348,000 in the week ended February 9, down from a slightly upwardly revised 357,000 for the prior week, the Labor Department said. The rise in the number of new claims was slightly more than the 347,000 Wall Street forecast. The four-week moving average of new claims, considered a more accurate barometer of employment trends because it irons out weekly volatility, rose to its highest since October 22, 2005, which was in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
