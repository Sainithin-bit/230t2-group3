 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Europe perhaps underestimated how much it needed to reduce Greece's debt burden at its July summit, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble was cited as saying by Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. 
 "It is possible that we assumed in July a level of debt reduction that was too low," Schaeuble was cited as saying. Euro zone finance ministers are reviewing the size of the private sector's involvement in a second international bailout package for Greece, the chairman of the Eurogroup ministers Jean-Claude Juncker said earlier this week. The reassessment could undermine Greece's aid program and hasten the threat of a Greek default. "There is a high risk that this crisis further escalates and broadens," Schaeuble said.
