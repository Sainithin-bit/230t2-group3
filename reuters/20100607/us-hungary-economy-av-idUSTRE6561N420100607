 BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - Following are latest analyst comments on Hungary on Monday. 

 ZSOLT KONDRAT, MKB BANK "Keeping to the budget deficit path is very positive news, in itself this can support the exchange rate, if markets believe this. However, actual market moves are also influenced by international developments which can in the short term offset the impact of Hungarian news. "For the markets' confidence to return in earnest we need to see the deficit cutting measures as well, and we need to know whether there will be tax cuts and if yes, how will those be offset (in the budget). It would (also) be important for the IMF and EU to approve the plans. "The news of a potential nationalization of private pension funds can upset markets so there should be a clear situation on this as soon as possible." UBS LONDON "While the retraction of last week's comments may alleviate concerns of default, investors are likely to scrutinize the new government's plans for their efficiency (mixture of tax and spending measures) and plausibility. In addition, we expect investors to remain highly sensitive to any kind of additional communication errors, something that we cannot exclude in the near future as the government is taking its first steps in formulating its strategy. "Hungary has a much lower public debt stock than Greece and has been consolidating its fiscal position under an IMF program for over a year already. Nevertheless, Hungary's medium term debt dynamics don't look all that healthy. Hungary's growth potential has likely fallen. In the near-term the country's main growth engine is net exports, hence any slowdown in the global economy could compromise its ability to reduce the government debt." "We don't see value in being short HUF here but think CDS can stay wide: After the rise in EURHUF and, even more so, in CHFHUF we think the risk reward putting on shorts in the forint is not great given that NBH could intervene before long." LARS CHRISTENSEN, DANSKE BANK "One can not helped being puzzled when Hungarian officials talk about a much larger than planned budget deficit and at the same time rules out austerity measures and instead promises tax cuts. Tax cuts surely could be positive structurally, but it will hardly calm down markets that have just been told that Hungary looks like Greece....They need to get the budget numbers correct. "If the budget deficit is larger than agreed with the IMF/EU then they need to implement measures to get the deficit down - that is austerity measures. Tax cuts should be fully funded. Furthermore, they need to restabilize credibility by having somebody with an understanding of financial markets to communicate. No more talk of defaults and Greece." MORGAN STANLEY "Overall, the IMF program has been a success and Hungary's compliance has been widely praised. The risks around the budget exist, but we think that the likelihood of a suspension is very low. Any indication that the Fund is thinking of suspending or withdrawing assistance would trigger speculation that weaker programs (Romania) may suffer the same fate. Therefore, there is a limit to how tough the IMF can be on Hungary." "Unless borrowing needs increase sharply, Hungary should be funded for the year on the external front. In terms of local debt, the (debt agency) AKK has so far issued HUF 570 billion of bonds compared to a full-year plan of HUF 1,356 billion, leaving HUF 786 billion of issuance over the remaining seven months, or HUF 112 billion per month. So far, this is broadly in line with what it has issued so seems doable to us. (Reporting by Marton Dunai and Krisztina Than; editing by  Patrick Graham )
