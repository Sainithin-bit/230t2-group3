 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Doors that could catch fire, brakes that could fail and accelerators that could stick have caused Chrysler Group LLC to recall nearly 600,000 vehicles involving five models in the United States, U.S. safety regulators said on Monday. 

 Chrysler informed the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the potential safety issues last week, the NHTSA reports show. As many as 284,831 Chrysler Town and Country minivans and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans for model years 2008 and 2009 could develop a problem in the electrical system that could cause a short circuit in the latch for the sliding door, which could cause a fire, Chrysler told regulators. As many as 288,968 Chrysler Jeep Wranglers from model year 2007 to 2010 could experience leaking brake fluid which could cause brake failure. These two recalls are in addition to one first reported last Friday for as many as 25,336 Dodge Caliber and Jeep Compass vehicles for the 2007 model year involving possible sticky accelerator pedals. Owners of the models involved in each of the recalls are to be notified by Chrysler this month and Chrysler said it will fix the vehicles without charge.
