 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Users have downloaded more than 35 million applications for Apple Inc's iPad tablet computer, over 2 million of which have sold in the past two months. 

 Chief Executive Steve Jobs said on Monday the iPad holds a 22 percent share of the burgeoning digital books market, with more than 5 million electronic books downloaded so far for the iPad. But Wall Street is focused on the possibility of a new iPhone, details of which are expected later on Monday. Apple is likely moments away from unveiling the newest version of its blockbuster device, hoping to stave off a growing cast of rivals like Google Inc in a red-hot smartphone market. Shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple held steady in afternoon trade. (Reporting by  Gabriel Madway  and  Alexei Oreskovic ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
