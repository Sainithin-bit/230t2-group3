 AUSTIN, Texas  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday there was no comparison between the U.S. economy's current ills and those suffered during the Great Depression. 

 "You hear a lot of loose talk," Bernanke said in answer to a question after delivering a speech on Fed policy. "Let's put that out of our minds. There's no comparison in terms of severity." (Reporting by  Ros Krasny ; Writing by  Tim Ahmann )
