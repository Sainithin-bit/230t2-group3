 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's manufacturing industry slumped in November as new orders, especially from abroad, tumbled in the face of deepening economic gloom and financial uncertainty. 

 Indexes released on Monday based on two surveys of hundreds of business executives across China plumbed record lows, showing how the world's fourth-largest economy is being sucked deeper into the global maelstrom even though it has a relatively insular banking system. The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) produced by the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing fell to 38.8 in November from 44.6 in October; the PMI produced for CLSA, an Asia-focused broker, fell to 40.9 from 45.2. The PMIs are designed to give a timely snapshot of manufacturing. A figure above 50 shows business is expanding; a result below 50 shows deterioration. "Another grim month for China manufacturing and the first in which the weakness in overseas demand overtook what, until now, has been mainly a domestic slowdown," said Eric Fishwick, head of economic research at CLSA. Monday's readings were the weakest since the surveys were launched in 2004 and 2005. The weakness was broad-based, with production, new orders and employment all falling sharply. "November's PMI shows that the Chinese economy is slowing down at an accelerating rate. The signs of economic contraction are more evident," said Zhang Liqun, a government economist who comments on the survey for the logistics federation. COMPETITIVENESS UNDER THREAT The surveys came out two days after President Hu Jintao said on Saturday that the sustained global economic downturn was threatening China's competitiveness and testing the grip of the Communist Party. Hu issued the warning at a meeting of the Politburo, the Party's 25-member elite council, which dwelt on the challenges China faces as export demand slows, forcing companies to shed workers, Xinhua news agency reported. The slowdown was "clearly reducing external demand and exerting pressure to steadily weaken our country's traditional competitive advantages," Hu said. China was not alone in reporting growing economic woes. Hong Kong's PMI for November fell to the lowest level since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, in 2003; South Korean exports last month posted the biggest drop in seven years, falling 18.3 percent from a year earlier. India's PMI fell through the boom-bust line of 50 for the first time since the inception of the survey in 2005; and Russia's PMI fell to the lowest level in its 11-year history, showing manufacturing to be in even worse shape than during the country's 1998 financial crisis. China has acted aggressively to counter the crisis. The government unveiled a 4 trillion yuan ($586 billion) stimulus package on November 9 and last week the central bank slashed interest rates by 1.08 percentage points, the deepest cut in 11 years. "China's economy will bounce back to a comparatively high growth rate in the spring of 2009 as the effects of the various measures show through," Zhang, the government economist, said. YUAN SET TO WEAKEN? But CLSA's Fishwick was more pessimistic. His firm's survey showed that demand is being depressed by fears of a protracted economic downturn and uncertainty in financial markets. "Export orders will weaken further and we expect further cuts in production and employment. Costs are plummeting but the benefit to margins is being offset by output price cuts as businesses try to protect market share," Fishwick said. Hu's warning about the competitive threat facing China sparked speculation on Monday that Beijing might provide fresh help for exporters by letting the yuan depreciate against the dollar, making Chinese goods more competitive in world markets. The People's Bank of China has pinned the yuan in remarkably tight ranges since mid-summer even as currencies including the euro, sterling and the South Korean won slid against the dollar. But on Monday the central bank set a sharply lower reference rate for the yuan. The drop, to 6.8505 per dollar from 6.8349 on Friday, was the biggest daily fall since May. "There is strong speculation that China may have started to consider adjusting its currency policy to let the yuan fall in line with global dollar strength," said a dealer at a European bank in Shanghai. Pushing the yuan lower might provide welcome relief for beleaguered exporters, but it would not go down well in Washington, which argues that China should let the currency rise faster to help reduce its huge trade surplus. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, on what is likely to be his last official visit to Beijing, will put his case in person to Chinese officials at a meeting of the Sino-American Strategic Economic Dialogue starting on Thursday.
