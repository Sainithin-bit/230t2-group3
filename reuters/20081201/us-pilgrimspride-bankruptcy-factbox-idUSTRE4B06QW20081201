 (Reuters) - Pilgrim's Pride Corp PPC.N, the largest U.S. chicken producer with about 24 percent of the market, filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday. 

 The following are key details about the company: * Founded in 1946 as a feed and seed store in Pittsburg, Texas, owned by Aubry Pilgrim and Pat Johns. Store sold baby chicks with the feed, and that evolved into the vertically integrated chicken company of today. * In fiscal 2007 the Pittsburg, Texas-based company had $7.6 billion in sales, about 50,000 employees, 32 processing plants in the United States and three in Mexico. * Much of the company's growth has come via acquisitions, including the purchase of WLR Foods in 2001, the chicken unit of ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ) in 2003, and Gold Kist Inc in 2006. * Key markets: Food service/restaurants account for 65 percent of sales, retail 23 percent, exports/other 12 percent. * For fiscal year 2008, ended September 27, the company expects to report a net loss of $998.6 million, or $14.40 per share. * Long-term debt is about $1.5 billion, much of which is related to the purchase of Gold Kist, which was bought for $1.1 billion and the assumption of $144 million in debt. * In 2008, the company closed or idled plants, laid off workers, and cut chicken production due to high feed costs and low meat prices. It sold its turkey business in March. * In April 2008, immigration agents took into custody about 400 employees in a five-state area for immigration-related crimes, including identity theft. * In May 2008, the company offered 7.5 million shares of common stock at $24 per share to raise about $180 million. * Largest shareholder is Pilgrim Interests Ltd, a limited partnership of family of senior chairman Lonnie "Bo" Pilgrim, with 25.35 million shares, or 34.2 percent of outstanding shares.
