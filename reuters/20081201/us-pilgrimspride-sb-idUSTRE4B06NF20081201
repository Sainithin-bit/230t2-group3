 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chicken producer Pilgrim's Pride Corp, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday, is not going out of business, and expects to conduct business as usual, company spokesman Ray Atkinson told Reuters. 

 He added that the company does not intend to close any more plants or layoff any more employees, Earlier this year, the company closed plants and laid off workers as it coped with losses on meat sales. Pilgrim's Pride, the largest U.S. chicken producer, sought bankruptcy protection after being hurt by high feed costs, low meat prices, and debt obligations.
