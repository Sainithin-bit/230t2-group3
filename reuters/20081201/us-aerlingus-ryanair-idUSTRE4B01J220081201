 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ryanair revived its courtship of Irish rival Aer Lingus on Monday, bidding 750 million euros ($970 million), just half of what it offered two years ago in an approach thwarted by European regulators. 

 The European Commission rejected Ryanair's 2006 offer on the grounds it would create a near monopoly in European flights out of Dublin. Aer Lingus strongly opposed the last approach from its neighbor at Dublin Airport and its board on Monday rejected the fresh offer, saying it "significantly" undervalued the airline. "Aer Lingus shareholders are strongly advised to take no action in relation to the offer," the company said. Ryanair, which has already bought 29.82 percent of Aer Lingus shares at an average 2.49 euros, said the all-cash offer at 1.40 euros represented a 28 percent premium over the average closing price for Aer Lingus shares in the 30 days to November 28, 2008. Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said it was "no surprise" Aer Lingus's board turned down the offer. "The problem for the board is they don't have any other plan for Aer Lingus," O'Leary told public broadcaster RTE. Aer Lingus said it remained "a strong business with significant cash reserves and a robust long term future." In London, shares in Aer Lingus ended the day 13.6 percent higher at 1.27 euros, below a session high of 1.36 euros. Ryanair's shares traded 4.8 percent lower at 2.79 euros. Analysts believe a recent spate of airline mergers means the chances of success are greater, even if a takeover would still prove highly contentious in Ireland. The European Commission declined to comment. O'Leary said the economic and regulatory environment had changed since the last bid. "The European competition authorities are going to be reviewing so many airline mergers over the next three, six, 12 months, it makes sense to us to revisit this thing now," he told a news conference. The takeover would create a fourth major European airline group after the creation of Air France-KLM, Lufthansa's buy of Swiss, and British Airways' planned tie-up with Iberia, O'Leary said. "FIFTY PERCENT CHANCE" For its latest bid to succeed, Ryanair would also have to overcome opposition from the Irish government and Aer Lingus employees, who respectively own more than 25 and 14 percent in the airline and also rejected Ryanair's previous offer. Transport Minister Noel Dempsey said earlier on Monday he would evaluate the offer once Aer Lingus's board had received a formal bid, adding that the government had been holding a "strategic" stake in Aer Lingus partly to prevent hostile bids. O'Leary said he believed Aer Lingus staff would be more receptive this time, given recent job losses at the airline. But the IMPACT union representing Aer Lingus cabin crew and pilots said it had major concerns over jobs prospects and competition. "It is unlikely on this occasion that the response from Aer Lingus staff would be any different," IMPACT said. Ryanair said it would double the size of Aer Lingus's short-haul fleet to 66 over the next five years, creating 1,000 new jobs at the former state airline, which it would keep as a separate brand. Trade union SIPTU described the offer as "mischief-making" by an airline intent on creating a monopoly, but analysts at Numis Securities said they believed recent mergers in the sector may have changed the regulatory environment in Ryanair's favor. "The timing of the bid is interesting, given the risk to profitability as recession risks strengthen and the consumer environment deteriorated rapidly in both Ireland and the UK," Numis said in a note. Analysts at RBS said the Ryanair bid had a "notably higher chance of success." "At this stage we would give the bid 50 percent chance of succeeding -- well up on last time," RBS said. Ryanair, which expects at least breakeven this year and a strong rebound in profits next year, has used its lower costs and bigger cash reserves to cut fares and grow capacity as rivals struggle to cope with recession and volatile fuel prices. Aer Lingus has already unveiled plans to cut costs, which are up to twice Ryanair's per seat, to stem losses and safeguard its independence. Ryanair's plans to start a new long-haul service would be delayed for up to two years due to the lack of cheap aircraft, but these plans were separate from the bid for Aer Lingus, which flies to the United States, O'Leary said.
