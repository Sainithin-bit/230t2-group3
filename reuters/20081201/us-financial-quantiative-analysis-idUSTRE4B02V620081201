 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - As the United States and other major economies prepare to combat deflation and recession with interest rates fast approaching zero, a five-year policy experiment in Japan shows how important it is to act quickly and boldly. 

 Japan fought its way out of deflation after a property and stock bubble burst in the 1990s with a policy measure known as quantitative easing, which involves flooding banks with far more cash than is needed to keep short-term rates at zero. It was a groundbreaking experiment and took a long time to work because the Bank of Japan was slow to employ the entire gamut of policy options and spell out its goals in credible fashion. These lessons are now acquiring a special relevance to the U.S. Federal Reserve, facing the risk of a Japan-style deflationary spiral after a mortgage market meltdown wrecked the banking system and pummeled stocks into the worst bear market since the Great Depression. What the Fed needs to do most of all is give investors a clear picture of what it is trying to accomplish with its version of quantitative easing and under what conditions it will declare victory, analysts said. That kind of clear communication has so far been missing during the Fed's seat-of-the-pants efforts to keep financial markets from breaking down. Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland, said quantitative easing was unlikely to be adopted in a more measured fashion. "It inevitably involves a heightened degree of desperation, which suggests that like most decisions of real gravity we have seen in recent weeks, this one will not be made without staring over the abyss to witness financial hells fury," he said. Ruskin calls U.S. efforts to stabilize the financial system and revive bank lending "quant-lite" because they bear only some resemblance to the Bank of Japan's emergency policy moves during the decade of deflation. UNCONVENTIONAL Deflation gives households and companies the incentive to delay purchases in anticipation that prices will fall, hobbling economic growth, while making it more expensive for debtors to pay off their loans. The Fed's $800 billion plan to buy mortgage- and consumer-related debt is one of the unconventional policy tools it is using to revive bank lending after the collapse of Wall Street banks paralyzed credit markets, which have largely shrugged off interest rate cuts. The Fed has slashed its benchmark to 1 percent and analysts polled by Reuters expect it to fall to just 0.5 percent -- the lowest since the 1950s. "They are doing quantitative easing de facto at the moment," said Glenn Maguire, chief Asia economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong. Quantitative easing alone may not be enough to extricate the United States from a vicious deflationary cycle in which falling asset prices hurt banks and households, leading to tighter borrowing and spending -- the lifeblood of economic growth. If Japan's experience is any guide, the central bank needs to communicate its objective clearly and establish the credibility needed to win over banks and investors scarred by huge losses and defaults. The Bank of Japan only went beyond zero rates to quantitative easing in March 2001, just seven months after it raised rates in a major blow to its credibility. By that time deflation had already established its grip on the economy battered by the property market crash that began in the mid-1990s. Maguire said it was only when the BOJ laid out its commitment of defeating deflation credibly that the quantitative easing policy become effective and brought down interest rates. When it became clear to investors and banks that the Bank of Japan would keep the policy in place until deflation was eradicated, they knew the spigots of cash would be open for a while. Thus assured, long-term interest rates dropped sharply. Ten-year government bond yields fell as low as 0.43 percent. Slowly, bank lending began to grow again and prices stopped falling, allowing the BOJ to end quantitative easing in March 2006. DOUBTS The Fed's moves so far have pushed the balance sheet, or total lending to financial markets, to as much $2.2 trillion -- more than double the level it was when Lehman Brothers collapsed in September. The cash infusions across the financial system have driven the weighted daily average for the benchmark fed funds rate well below its target for the better part of the past two months and as low as 0.22 percent. But those measures have only slowly spurred banks to lend to each other for three months or more, the kind of loans needed to ease the severe credit market strains, let alone kick start mortgage lending. So with U.S. consumer price inflation falling at the fastest pace on record, the country may be headed for deflation and full-blown quantitative easing. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has dropped to a 50-year low. Richard Koo, chief economist at Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo, argues that quantitative easing will not be enough and will require massive government spending. In Japan's case, the huge increase in liquidity stabilized the financial system but did not lead to a burst of bank lending. Until the very end of the BOJ's use of quantitative easing, bank lending fell. Koo says that Japan's huge fiscal stimulus, which has left the country saddled with debt 150 percent the size of its economy, is what prevented the "lost decade" from being even worse. "The Fed is free to try quantitative easing, but I don't think it will produce results. It will help banks ... but that's the extent of it. It will not help the economy," said Koo. ($1=95.10 Yen)
