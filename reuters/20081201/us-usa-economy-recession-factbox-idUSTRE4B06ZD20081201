 (Reuters) - The National Bureau of Economic Research's Business Cycle Dating Committee, the accepted arbiter of U.S. recessions, said on Monday that the U.S. economy tipped into a recession a year ago. 

 At 12 months and counting, the current recession is already the third longest since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The NBER does not define a recession as two consecutive quarters of decline in real gross domestic product, as is the rule of thumb in many countries. Rather, a recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production and wholesale-retail sales. As a result, the NBER waits until there is conclusive evidence of a broad, lasting downturn before declaring the start of a recession. Since 1945, there have been 10 business cycles. The average recession has lasted 10 months, while the average expansion has spanned 57 months. Below are the dates of recessions stretching back to 1923. 2001 RECESSION (eight months) Began March 2001 Ended November 2001 1990 RECESSION (eight months) Began July 1990 Ended March 1991 1981 RECESSION (16 months) Began July 1981 Ended November 1980 RECESSION (six months) Began January 1980 Ended July 1980 1973 RECESSION (16 months) Began November 1973 Ended March 1975 1969 RECESSION (11 months) Began December 1969 Ended November 1970 1960 RECESSION (10 months) Began April 1960 Ended February 1961 1957 RECESSION (eight months) Began August 1957 Ended April 1958 1953 RECESSION (10 months) Began July 1953 Ended May 1954 1948 RECESSION (11 months) Began November 1948 Ended October 1949 1945 RECESSION (eight months) Began February 1945 Ended October 1945 1937 RECESSION (13 months) Began May 1937 Ended June 1938 1929 RECESSION (43 months) Began August 1929 Ended March 1933 1926 RECESSION (13 months) Began October 1926 Ended November 1927 1923 RECESSION (14 months) Began May 1923 Ended July 1924 SOURCE: NBER (Compiled by Washington Newsroom; Editing by Kenneth Barry)
