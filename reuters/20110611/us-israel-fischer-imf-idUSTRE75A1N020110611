 JERUSALEM  (Reuters) - Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer has decided to become a candidate for head of the International Monetary Fund, Israel's Channel Two News reported on Saturday. 

 The Channel Two report said Fischer's name was in the final list of candidates for the job vacated by Frenchman Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who resigned after his arrest on May 14 on charges of attempting to rape a New York hotel maid. (Writing by  Maayan Lubell ; Editing by  Andrew Heavens )
