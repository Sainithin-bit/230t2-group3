 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL is in the lead in bidding for a controlling stake in Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEH.N asset management business, while Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) has backed away, CNBC reported on Monday. 

 Lehman is looking at selling at least part of its asset management business, sources told Reuters last week. CNBC said private equity firms are betting on a 70 percent stake that could be worth $7 billion. The sale is still in flux and the terms of the deal could change, CNBC said. KKR and Blackstone were not immediately available for comment. Lehman spokeswoman Kerrie Cohen declined to comment.
