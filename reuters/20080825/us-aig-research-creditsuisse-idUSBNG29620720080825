 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ) shares fell to a 13-year low on Monday after Credit Suisse lowered its price target and forecast a huge loss for the insurer, mainly due to higher losses from its derivatives business. 

 AIG shares dropped $1.08, or 5.4 percent, to $18.79 on the New York Stock Exchange. The last time they were so low was August 1995. "We are lowering our price target from $30 to $22 to reflect what we view to be a heightened risk profile owed to uncertainty regarding ratings, the size of a potential capital raise and the ultimate cost of a de-risking strategy especially for its credit default swap (CDS) business," Credit Suisse said. AIG's CDS portfolio inherently makes it one of the most exposed names to recent credit deterioration, the brokerage said. Credit Suisse now expects AIG to post a loss of 86 cents a share for the third quarter, compared with its prior estimate of a profit of 13 cents. Based on "current marks," Credit Suisse estimates that AIG's financial products are sitting on a $6.5 billion loss, against the brokerage's previous estimate of a loss of $2.6 billion. The brokerage said the risks of a near-term rating action have clearly risen, and a one-notch ratings downgrade from both Moody's and S&P could result in AIG needing up to $13.3 billion of additional collateral. "While our 86-cent loss is by far the lowest estimate on the Street for the third quarter, we would not be surprised to see a larger loss if AIG factors in some of the recent large collateralized debt obligation transactions that have occurred in the market," the brokerage said. AIG's shares were among the biggest percentage drags on the  Dow Jones Industrial Average.
