 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of existing home sales in the United States rose in July to a 5.00 million-unit annual rate, the National Association of Realtors said in a report on Monday that showed prices dipped and the inventory of homes hit a record high. 

 The inventory of homes for sale rose to a record 4.67 million homes or a 11.2 months' supply at the current sales pace, matching a record set in April. The median national home price declined 7.1 percent from a year ago to $212,400.  COMMENT: AL KUGEL, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ATLANTIC TRUST,  CHICAGO: "The data is not too significant, and the market hasn't reacted dramatically to it. It is interesting that home sales have pretty much leveled off in 2008. We were going down at a very rapid rate in 2006 and 2007. But that's really about it." "Financial stocks are pretty much in the red across the board. They're the main determinant of the direction of the overall market, and it's hard to make progress when they are down. Fannie and Freddie are on everyone's mind, but nothing has happened. It's lots of speculation but no developments."  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: The benchmark S&P500 US stock index slipped and was down 0.87 pct at 1281;  BONDS: Benchmark US 10-year Treasury yields were lower around 3.78 pct;  DOLLAR: US dollar was little changed with the euro around $1.4790;
