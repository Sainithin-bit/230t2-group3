 (Reuters) - German central bank chief Axel Weber's withdrawal from the contest to replace European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet has blown the race wide open. 

 Trichet's eight-year term expires at the end of October 2011 and speculation is mounting about who will take his place at the head of the Frankfurt-based central bank, which has played a central role in responding to the euro zone debt crisis. European Union leaders must select a new ECB president "from among persons of recognized standing and professional experience in monetary and banking matters". They are expected to do so around the middle of year. Following is a list of possible candidates for the job. FRONTRUNNERS: MARIO DRAGHI, Italy, 63 - The Bank of Italy chief has taught at Harvard and worked at the World Bank, and with investment bank Goldman Sachs. In addition to his central bank role, he is chairman of the Financial Stability Board -- in charge of coordinating global financial regulation since the beginning of the financial crisis. He would be the first Italian to head the ECB. Draghi rarely speaks on interest rate policy but is regarded as a centrist on the ECB's governing council. His chances may be reduced by the fact that another southern European considered a monetary dove, Vitor Constancio of Portugal, was appointed ECB vice-president last year. Draghi may also be tainted in some eyes by having worked in 2002-5 for investment bank Goldman Sachs, criticized for its role in the financial crisis. Draghi has pressed his candidacy since Weber dropped out, using a German newspaper interview to praise Germany's economic discipline and cast himself as a devoted European. The race favorite in a Reuters poll of economists, Draghi has also stressed the importance of protecting central bank credibility. ERKKI LIIKANEN, Finland, 60 - The Finnish central bank chief is a former European Commissioner and a monetary policy moderate. His social democratic affiliation and the fact that Finland already has a key position with European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn may count against him. In his favor is the fact he comes from a northern European country, meaning Chancellor Angela Merkel can probably sell him more easily than Draghi to German voters skeptical of southern European countries they associate with weak economic management. Despite euro zone inflation jumping above the ECB's target level in December, Liikanen said in late January there were "not imminent price pressures" in the currency area. OTHER GOVERNING COUNCIL MEMBERS: YVES MERSCH, Luxembourg, 61 - The longest-serving member of the ECB's governing council, Mersch has headed tiny Luxembourg's central bank since its creation in 1998. Seen as an inflation hawk close to German thinking, he might be a compromise candidate. However, Luxembourg already has one big EU job, with Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker chairing the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, and Finance Minister Luc Frieden has said he cannot see his country taking the ECB helm too. JUERGEN STARK, 62 - A former finance ministry official and Bundesbank Vice-President and a current ECB Executive Board member. Like Weber, Stark is regarded as one of the most 'hawkish' ECB members who takes a strict line on inflation. The chances of him taking over from Trichet appear remote. ECB rules prevent anyone seeking back-to-back terms on the bank's board, but switching from a regular board seat to president remains a grey area that would be open to a legal challenge. JENS WEIDMANN, 42 - Although he will not join the Governing Council until Weber steps down on April 30, the new Bundesbank chief will immediately become a powerful voice as head of the German central bank. But his lack of frontline central banking experience, young age and the fact he will only have been Bundesbank president for six months when Trichet goes count against him. OUTSIDE THE ECB: KLAUS REGLING, Germany, 60 - Head of the European Financial Stability Facility, the former senior European Commission official could emerge as an alternative German candidate. Regling holds orthodox German views on monetary policy and fiscal discipline. He has no central banking experience but served at the IMF and in the German Finance Ministry before rising to be director-general for Economic and Financial Affairs in the EU executive in Brussels. However, Regling told reporters after news broke of Weber's withdrawal that he already had "a great job". Merkel's decision to pick her aide Jens Weidmann as Weber's successor as Bundesbank chief makes it less likely she will insist on another German, like Regling, running the ECB. That option would have gained in likelihood had Stark taken the Bundesbank job, creating space on the ECB Executive Board for Germany to take the presidency. DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, France, 61 - The International Monetary Fund head has experience in spades, even though he has never been at a central bank helm. The former French finance minister could be put forward by President Nicolas Sarkozy, but his chances are small due to his nationality -- Trichet being his compatriot, it is unlikely other countries would agree to having the French lead the central bank for 16 years in a row.
