 (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials, who unanimously backed the central bank's decision in January to continue its current bond-buying program, have raised their forecasts for economic growth but remain unhappy with the job market's recovery. 

 But that unity masks divisions over the policy implications of the latest economic data, including a bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. core consumer prices in January that suggested a long period of slowing inflation had run its course. The following are recent comments from Fed policymakers (* denotes 2011 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy). DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, February 17 "I cannot foresee any circumstance at present that would lead me to support any further expansion of our initiative on that front," he said, referring to the Fed's current round of bond purchases. "As far as price stability ... we do have some pressures that are building." CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS, February 17 "I'm open-minded about the size of the current program ... It's quite likely we will continue with the 600 (billion dollars' worth). It will not surprise me if at the time we get to June and we are looking at the economy, that things are sufficiently better that that might be enough." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, February 17 "We always tend to want to make sure everything is going very strongly before we begin to withdraw and I think that has its own consequences that we need to avoid." MINUTES OF JAN. 25-26 FOMC meeting released February 16 "Participants generally expressed greater confidence that the economic recovery would be sustained." CLEVELAND FED PRESIDENT SANDRA PIANALTO, February 15 "Unemployment rates have declined a bit recently, but job creation remains anemic, as businesses have been cautious in expanding their payrolls ... This recession was much deeper and lasted longer than previous recessions, and we have a long way to climb back." * NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM DUDLEY, February 14 "The economy is healthier, but it is not yet well ... In order to reduce joblessness significantly over the coming quarters, the economy needs to grow at a considerably faster rate than we have seen so far in this recovery." * PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER, February 11 Defending his decision in January to back the Fed's bond-buying program, of which he has been a critic: "Why do you want to signal something and then yank it out from under the market? That's just not a good way to conduct policy." * FED BOARD GOVERNOR SARAH RASKIN, February 11 "The pace of recovery is agonizingly slow ... The critically important drag on the economy is the absence of any substantial recovery in the housing sector." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, February 10 "There is scope for reducing ... unemployment through sensible monetary policy but that will leave probably a higher level of 'natural' unemployment ... then maybe we enjoyed before the recession." * FED CHAIRMAN BERNANKE, February 9 The one million jobs gained since the end of the recession is "not enough to significantly erode the wide margin of slack that remains in our labor market ... Until we see a sustained period of stronger job creation, we cannot consider the recovery to be truly established." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, February 9 "It (further easing beyond current bond-buying program) depends entirely on the state of the economy, and if I take my base-case forecast, which continues the moderate rate of growth through 2011 and for 2012, I'm not sure it will be necessary." NEW YORK FED MARKETS GROUP HEAD BRIAN SACK, February 9 "The issue for the prospect of an additional round of asset purchases would need to be calibrated with whether it is appropriate, given the shift in the economic outlook." * DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, February 8 "Given current economic circumstances and financial conditions, it is hard for me to envision a scenario where I would not use my voting position this year to formally dissent should the Open Market Committee recommend another tranche of monetary accommodation." RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, February 8 "The distinct improvement in the economic outlook since the program was initiated suggests taking that reevaluation (of the Fed's current bond-buying program) quite seriously ... I'm not ready to stop (bond buying) right now." SAN FRANCISCO FED HEAD OF RESEARCH JOHN WILLIAMS, February 4 "The economy still has enormous slack. Millions of people could be put back to work and many more goods and services could be produced without igniting unwelcome inflation."
