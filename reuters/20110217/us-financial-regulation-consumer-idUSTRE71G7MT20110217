 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Thursday that it hired former Wall Street veterans from Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley to help establish its new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 

 Raj Date, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank, will oversee a number of the bureau's offices including research, regulations, mortgage and home equity markets as well as credit information markets, the Treasury Department said. Elizabeth Vale, a former managing director at Morgan Stanley with 22 years of investment experience, will act as the bureau's liaison to community banks, credit unions and small businesses, it added. The Treasury Department has less than six months to launch the bureau as required under the Dodd-Frank bill that revamped U.S. financial regulation. Reviled by Republican lawmakers, the bureau was crafted to help protect consumers from risky financial products such as subprime mortgage loans. Zixta Martinez, a former senior director at the now government-controlled mortgage firm Freddie Mac, will handle outreach to consumer groups, the department said. A former community banker and a former law firm partner were also hired for senior posts. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai )
