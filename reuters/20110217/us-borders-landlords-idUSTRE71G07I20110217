 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Borders Group Inc's bankruptcy has many landlords scrambling to plan for vacant stores that may be coming their way after the biggest failure by a national retailer since Circuit City. 

 Although Border's stores are located in malls and street-levels shops in city office towers across the country, many of them are in shopping centers known as power centers, home to big boxy stores such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and Costco Wholesale Corp. Those shopping centers took a big hit early in the recession and are just climbing out. Vacancy has started to fall, but rent is still soft. Borders' troubles could stall the ascent. "This certainly could impact any sort of recovery that we're hoping for power centers," said Abigail Rosenbaum, an economist with CBRE Econometric Advisors, a research wing of real estate services company CB Richard Ellis Group. "They were able to reuse the space that was lost by Linens 'n Things and Circuit City," she said. "That seems to be filtered though here. An additional hit could be significant." Borders Group, the country's second-largest book chain, filed for bankruptcy on Wednesday and said it will begin closing 200 of its namesake superstores, which average 24,000 square feet, this weekend. The retailer is the biggest national retailer to file for bankruptcy since Circuit City Inc and Linens 'n Things Inc in late 2008. Those chains both liquidated. Borders has roughly 500 superstores, which stock more than 100,000 book titles. It does not plan to close any of its more than 100 smaller Waldenbooks shops. Borders, which has been listing for more than a year, has been closely monitored by landlords. Agree Realty Corp Chief Financial Officer Alan Maximiuk said Borders has been on his company's watch list for years. The bookseller leases 14 Agree properties and accounts for 20 percent of the landlord's rental revenue. One is Borders's Ann Arbor headquarters. Two stores already have been sublet. Of the 11 left, five are slated to close, accounting for a loss of $2.6 million, or 7 percent, of rental revenue. Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Agree has kept tabs tenants in the area and tenants who may want to fill the Borders' locations it owns. "We're as prepared as we can be until we actually know what Borders is going to do," Maximiuk said. "You don't control the real estate until they go through the bankruptcy process." Borders has a long list of landlords. They include mall owners Simon Property Group, Westfield Group and General Growth Properties Inc, which recently emerged from bankruptcy. Power center owners such as Developers Diversified Realty Corp and shopping center owner Federal Realty Investment Trust Trust also are landlords, as is Australia's Centro, which is on the block. Borders accounts for less than 1 percent of the revenue of any of those companies. The problem is bigger than a bankruptcy or a reorganization of a retailer, Green Street Advisors Inc analyst Cedrik Lachance said. It comes down to the demand for the overall product: physical books versus electronic reading. Physical books aren't winning. "I think there's some appetite for physical books, but the amount of square footage dedicated to that nationally is bound to decrease dramatically in the coming years," he said. "The question is how do you reorganize that business and should there be just one major player?" (Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
