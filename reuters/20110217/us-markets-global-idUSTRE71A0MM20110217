 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The safe-haven Swiss franc and U.S. government bonds rallied on Thursday, while crude oil prices rose as unrest in the Middle East and tensions between Israel and Iran escalated. 

 U.S. stocks, however, shrugged off concerns about the Middle East as investors bought on early dips. World equities measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS, hit more than 2-1/2 year highs. Bahrain police stormed a square in Manama, killing at least three people as protests in the Middle East and North Africa gathered pace. Clashes were also reported in Libya, while at least 40 were wounded in Yemen in demonstrations against the president's 32-year rule. Iranian state TV said on Thursday two Iranian warships are due to pass through the strategic Suez Canal. "All in all, the pace of change sweeping the region is truly mind-boggling," said Edward Meir, senior commodity analyst at brokers MF Global. The U.S. dollar fell 0.9 percent to 0.9506 Swiss franc, while the euro dropped 0.7 percent to 1.2931 franc. "If events in the Middle East do escalate we will see safe haven flows which will help the Swiss franc," said Kenneth Broux, market economist at Lloyds. Benchmark ten-year U.S. Treasury notes were last up 12/32 in price to yield 3.58 percent. Unrest spreading across the oil-rich Middle East and North Africa stoked fears of a disruption of oil flows. U.S. crude futures ended higher for a second straight day, after trading as high as $86.50. Brent crude for April delivery earlier climbed above $104 a barrel, before retreating. Gold, also a safe-haven, rose for a fourth day, its longest winning streak since September. Spot gold hit a five-week high at $1,384.30 an ounce. STOCKS STILL IN DEMAND Wall Street stocks earlier came under pressure after the United States reported the fastest rise in core consumer prices in more than a year in January. But bargain hunters quickly rushed in and pushed the index back near multi-year highs. The core Consumer Price Index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, increased 0.2 percent last month after a 0.1 percent rise in December, the Labor Department said. It was the largest increase since October 2009. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was last up 27.10 points, or 0.22 percent, at 12,315.23. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 3.51 points, or 0.26 percent, to 1,339.81. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 5.26 points, or 0.19 percent, to 2,830.82. "We've run up incredibly over the last six months, and many many onlookers are looking for a pullback, and it just refuses to come," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. European shares  .FTEU3  closed at a new 29-month high for the fourth straight day. The MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS hit its highest level since the end of July 2008 and last traded up 0.51 percent at 346.72. The euro edged higher versus the dollar as solid demand at a Spanish debt auction offset broader euro zone banking and sovereign debt concerns. It last traded up 0.3 percent at $1.3601.
