 VEVEY, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Swiss food giant Nestle ( NESN.VX ) said on Thursday it was well placed to cope with volatile raw material prices after beating forecasts with a 6 percent rise in 2010 underlying sales. 

 "We are starting 2011 with continued momentum, well placed to face uncertainties ahead, including volatile raw material prices," Nestle said in a statement. "We are therefore confident of achieving the Nestle Model in 2011: organic growth between 5 percent and 6 percent and an EBIT margin improvement in constant currencies," Nestle said.
