 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Duke Energy Corp ( DUK.N ) reported a 23 percent jump in quarterly earnings as electricity demand from its industrial customers rose and forecast 2011 profit above Wall Street expectations, boosting it shares. 

 Net income rose to $427 million, or 32 cents per share, from $346 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings per share were 21 cents, lagging the 23 cents that analysts had on average forecast, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The shortfall was largely due to the company's $40 million contribution to its charity Duke Energy Foundation, which reduced earnings per share by about 2 cents, Chief Financial Officer Lynn Good told Reuters. Revenue rose 11 percent to $3.45 billion, topping the $3.16 billion analysts had expected. The company, which announced last month that it planned to buy Progress Energy Inc PGN.N in a $13.7 billion deal that would create the largest U.S. power company, said it expected 2011 earnings of $1.35 to $1.40 per share, above the $1.34 forecast by analysts. Shares of Duke rose 3.2 percent in premarket trading to $18.28. (Reporting by  Matt Daily ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Dave Zimmerman)
