 TRAVERSE CITY, Michigan  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) sees "no reason" that recent progress in cutting costs cannot be sustained in ongoing contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union, a senior executive said on Monday. 

 Joseph Hinrichs, vice president for manufacturing in North America and a member of the No. 2 U.S. automaker's negotiating team, said Ford had made more progress in cutting costs in the past "18 to 20 months" than many observers had expected. "There's no reason that process can't sustain itself," said Hinrichs, who was answering a question about the UAW talks in a conference sponsored by the Center for Automotive Research.
