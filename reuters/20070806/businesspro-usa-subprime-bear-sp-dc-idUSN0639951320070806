 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The market's response to a recent 
change in Bear Stearns' BSC.N credit rating outlook has been 
a "vast overreaction," an analyst at Standard & Poor's said on 
Monday. 

  S&P lowered its outlook on Bear to negative from stable on 
Friday, indicating a rating downgrade is possible over the next 
few years. The move prompted Bear's stock price to plunge.  "Not that much has changed at the company to warrant such a 
severe change in the pricing of their securities in our view," 
S&P analyst Scott Sprinzen said.  Shares of Bear Stearns, known on Wall Street as a leader in 
the $7 trillion U.S. mortgage bond market, dropped 5.9 percent 
to $108.85 around midday on Friday, and the cost of protecting 
its debt with credit derivatives jumped nearly 40 percent.  Bear's stock price was up more than 5 percent on Monday at  $113.81.  "We still expect the company to be profitable in the 
current quarter and thereafter," S&P's Sprinzen said. "Its 
liquidity is strong."
