 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and India's Bharti Enterprises said on Monday they had signed an equal joint venture for Indian cash-and-carry and retail back-end operations. 

 The joint venture, to be called Bharti Wal-Mart Private Ltd., would open 10 to 15 cash-and-carry, or wholesale, facilities in India over seven years, which would sell groceries, consumer appliances and fruits and vegetables, they said in a statement. The first cash-and carry store is targeted to open by the end of 2008. The venture would employ about 5,000 people in 7 years. Foreign multiple brand retailers in India, one of the world's fastest-growing consumer markets, are limited to cash-and-carry and franchise or license operations. India's retail industry, valued at nearly $350 billion, is forecast to double in size by 2015, with modern retail's share of that also quickly increasing from about 3 percent now.
