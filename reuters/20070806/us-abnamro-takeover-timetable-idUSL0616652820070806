It needs support from over 50 percent of the shares represented at the meetings for the ABN deal and 75 percent for the rights issue. Aug 10 -- RBS shareholders vote on deal at an EGM in Edinburgh. Sept 14 -- Barclays shareholders to vote at EGM. Sept 20 -- ABN holds an "informative EGM" of shareholders to discuss the two offers. It will included background and "the reasoned opinions" of ABN's managing and supervisory boards. Oct 4 -- Closing date for Barclays offer. Oct 5 -- Closing date for consortium's offer.
