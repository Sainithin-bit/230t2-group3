 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ) said on Monday it filed a U.S. lawsuit accusing Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) of infringing five Sharp patents based on liquid crystal display technology, which is often used in television and computer screens. 

 Sharp said it filed the suit in the Court for the Eastern District of Texas and was seeking compensation and the prohibition of sales of products infringing its patents which related to methods for improving LCD display quality. The infringing products include Samsung televisions and monitors and mobile phones that include Samsung LCD modules, according to Sharp, which is asking for a jury trial. It said it filed the suit after "good faith" negotiations with Samsung for an LCD patent license since 2006 had failed to resolve the matter. A representative for Samsung was not immediately available for comment. Sharp said in a statement it began research and development into LCD technology in 1970 and produced the world's first application of LCD in calculators in 1973.
