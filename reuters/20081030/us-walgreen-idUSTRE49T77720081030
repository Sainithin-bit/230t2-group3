 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year are up just 2.2 percent so far this month, as cost-conscious consumers bought cheaper private label products and did not buy many decorative Halloween items. 

 The growth paled in comparison to sales at its two main competitors, CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) and Rite Aid Corp ( RAD.N ), who reported sales for slightly different periods. President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Wasson, speaking at the drugstore chain's first-ever analyst meeting, said Walgreen is seeing consumers making purchases closer to when they get their paychecks and using credit cards less often. Through October 28, Walgreen's same-store, front-end sales, or sales of general merchandise, were flat. Besides the poor showing of Halloween-themed items, Walgreen said its photo services sales were weak. Food and beauty items sold well. Same-store pharmacy sales rose 3.4 percent. Total prescriptions filled at stores open at least a year rose just 0.4 percent. CVS, which no longer reports monthly same-store sales, said third-quarter same-store sales rose 3.7 percent -- up 3.8 percent for the pharmacy section and up 3.3 percent for general merchandise. CVS said it expects both pharmacy and general merchandise same-store sales to be better in the fourth quarter than the third quarter, with an overall increase of 3.5 percent to 5 percent. Rite Aid said its same-store sales for the four weeks ended October 25 rose 2.9 percent -- up 1.9 percent for the pharmacy section and up 4.9 percent for general merchandise. Walgreen plans to report full October sales on November 4. Shares of Walgreen were up 4.3 percent at $24.76 in midday trading, while CVS rose nearly 10.6 percent to $29.11. Rite Aid shares were up 6.2 percent at 50 cents. (Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz )
