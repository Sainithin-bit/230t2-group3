 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Mazda Motor Corp ( 7261.T ) reported a 20 percent drop in quarterly operating profit on Thursday, hit by a stronger yen and expensive raw materials, and slashed its annual forecast by a similar margin blaming softer vehicle demand. 

 Mazda, owned one-third by Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), said July-September operating profit was 32.4 billion yen ($328.9 million), while net profit fell 45 percent to 14.5 billion yen. Revenue declined 5 percent to 841.9 billion yen, although vehicle sales rose 2 percent to 343,000 units. The maker of the popular Mazda6 and other sporty cars now expects an operating profit for the full year to next March 31 of 90 billion yen instead of 115 billion yen, and net profit of 50 billion yen instead of 70 billion yen. That was despite a change in its currency assumptions to a more favorable 103 yen to the dollar and 152 yen to the euro, from 100 yen and 150 yen seen previously for the year. A poll of 14 brokerages surveyed gave an operating profit forecast of 126 billion yen. Shares in Mazda have been the worst performer of any Japanese automaker in the past month, punished for the company's vulnerability to a stronger yen since it ships most of its cars sold abroad from Japan. The share price has fallen more than 50 percent in the past month, compared with a 28 percent drop in Tokyo's transport sector subindex. .ITEQP.T ($1=98.52 Yen) (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Michael Watson )
