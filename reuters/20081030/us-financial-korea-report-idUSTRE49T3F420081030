 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea plans to announce measures on Friday aimed at boosting the economy and will include 9 trillion won ($6.97 billion) of fiscal spending, the Maeil Business Newspaper said. 

 The measures are also likely to include offering additional tax cuts and easing construction regulations, the paper quoted an unidentified government official as saying in its early Friday edition. The government has already announced more than $130 billion worth of measures to ease problems for banks that face rising corporate defaults because of the economic downturn. It has also announced help for the construction industry and small business. President Lee Myung-bak, a former construction company chief executive, said this week that the government was ready to take more steps to calm financial markets in Asia's fourth-largest economy. "The government will have public (construction) projects executed early and sharply increase social infrastructure spending by revising up the government budget spending plans already submitted to the parliament," he said in a speech.
