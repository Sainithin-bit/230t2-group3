 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp ( CI.N ) posted a 53 percent decline in third-quarter profit on Thursday, hurt by increased liabilities because of the market swoon that will also lead to a fourth-quarter loss. 

 The company again cut the full-year outlook for its main health insurance business, saying it now expects a decline in membership, excluding acquisitions. Net income fell to $171 million, or 62 cents per share, from $365 million, or $1.28 per share, a year earlier. Cigna was hurt by two businesses it no longer actively markets: a minimum income benefits business and a death benefits business, which involve annuities. In both businesses, the company said its liabilities increase in periods of declining equity markets and interest rates. The company reported operating earnings of 89 cents per share, including 25 cents of losses from its death benefits business. Analysts on average expected $1.06, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 10 percent to $4.9 billion. The Philadelphia-based company said it expected to report a fourth-quarter loss of 45 cents per share, as the death benefits business weighs on results. The estimate is based on market conditions at the end of October, Cigna said, and the result could ultimately differ. Cigna projected 2008 adjusted income from operations in its healthcare segment at $690 million to $710 million. In August, it had cut the outlook to a range of $700 million to $730 million, citing weaker enrollment and cost trends. The company sees medical membership at year end down about 1 percent, excluding its Great-West acquisition, after previously expecting it to be flat. Cigna projected full-year adjusted income from operations at $3.40 to $3.50 per share. Health-insurer stocks, already down this year due to a series of profit warnings, have been pressured during the credit crisis as investors worry about potential sizable write-downs and the companies' balance sheets. Cigna has seen its stock fall some 63 percent this year, slightly worse than a 61 percent drop for the S&P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
