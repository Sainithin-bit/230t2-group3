 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany's government plans to introduce a range of steps worth up to 25 billion euros ($31.87 billion) to boost Europe's biggest economy, a leading member of the ruling Social Democrats (SPD) told a newspaper on Thursday. 

 "All together we are talking about a volume of perhaps 20 billion euros to 25 billion euros," Peter Struck, parliamentary floor leader of the SPD, which shares power with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, was quoted as saying by the Berliner Zeitung. The package will include support for the auto sector and building renovation as well as tax breaks enabling companies to write off a share of their investments, several German newspapers reported. Environment minister Sigmar Gabriel said the government would suspend tax on cars with low emissions for up to two years to help the auto industry which is suffering from a drop in demand. "That will be the suggestion that the Finance Minister will make," Gabriel told Germany's ARD public television. That step alone would cost about 8 billion euros, he said. The Handelsblatt daily cited coalition sources as saying the government would increase support made available for building renovation projects to about 2.5 billion euros from 1.4 billion euros. The idea is to boost investment in energy-saving measures. The government has said it is working on the steps as fears grow that a recession is looming in Germany and that the global financial crisis will take a toll on firms. Earlier this month, the government announced a 500 billion euro bank rescue package to help restore confidence in the financial system. The German cabinet will agree the widely trailed package next Wednesday, Struck told the Berliner Zeitung. (Writing by  Madeline Chambers , editing by Mike Peacock)
