 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S. automaker General Motors Corp has not asked Toyota Motor Corp for help in turning around its business, a Toyota spokesman said on Thursday, denying a Kyodo news agency report. 

 Kyodo news, citing sources familiar with the matter, said overnight that the struggling U.S. carmaker had asked Toyota for help and explored the possibility of CEO Rick Wagoner's meeting with Toyota's leadership in Japan soon. "There is absolutely no truth to the report," the spokesman said. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
