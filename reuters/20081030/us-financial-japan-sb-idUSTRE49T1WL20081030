 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso on Thursday unveiled a $51 billion package of steps to fight fallout from the global financial crisis on Thursday, saying the public wanted him to focus on policies despite pressure for an election. 

 Aso's announcement of Japan's second economic package in two months coincides with growing expectations that the central bank will cut its already rock-bottom interest rates for the first time in seven years when its policy board meets on Friday. "A harsh storm seen only once in 100 years is raging," Aso told a news conference where he unveiled the package. "Under such circumstances, I am certain that what is most important is to remove uncertainties from the lives of people." Economists questioned whether the package -- which includes 5 trillion yen ($51 billion) in new government spending -- would do much to rescue an economy slipping into recession as a strong yen batters exports and sliding share prices weaken banks. "If the government wants to shore up the economy, it should have focused on easing the pain of exporters, which were the primary victims of the current financial crisis and a global slowdown," said Akio Yoshino, chief economist at Societe Generale Asset Management. The Nikkei share average hit a 26-year low earlier this week. It surged nearly 10 percent on Thursday to end at 9,029.76 in reaction to the yen's retreat after interest rate cuts by the United States and China, but investors were still cautious. The package includes 2 trillion yen in payouts to families -- about $600 for a family of four -- tax breaks on mortgages, a bank rescue scheme to allow more than 2 trillion yen in public fund injections and relief for small firms suffering from a credit crunch. The measures will be funded by tapping special government reserves and, while Aso ruled out issuing fresh deficit-financing bonds in a nod to the nation's massive public debt, he left the door open for bonds to finance specific projects. ELECTION DELAY Aso also said he would implement temporary tax cuts for three years while the economy recovered. But as part of a midterm plan to address the huge public debt and anxiety about funding the growing social welfare costs of a fast-aging society, the premier said he would seek a rise in the 5 percent consumption tax after three years, while watching the economy. Some analysts said trying to boost domestic demand was the right way to go, but the scale of the problem risked dwarfing the steps. "Yes, every little bit helps, but if Aso is saying this is a crisis that happens once in 100 years ... and the potential damage to the economy is enormous, then it's still a minor fix, not a major commitment," said Jesper Koll, CEO of investment consultancy Tantallon Research Japan, noting that the package was equivalent to about 1 percent of Japan's gross domestic product. But he added: "It's important timing-wise that Japan puts something together when everyone else is doing something." Aso, who took office in September after his predecessor quit, had initially been expected to call an election in October or November to seek a mandate to break a political deadlock caused by a divided parliament, where opposition parties control the upper house and can delay important legislation. But with the prime minister's public support sagging, the ruling bloc risks losing an election if held soon, analysts said. The prime minister refused to be drawn on the timing of an election, which must be held by September 2009. But he said: "At any rate, it is necessary for us to implement these policies and as a result respond to the concerns of the livelihoods of the people. I think that is the priority." Recent media surveys have shown most voters are in no hurry for a vote, and some market analysts agreed now was not the time. "Prior to this, the government didn't seem to have much of a sense of danger and appeared to be thinking more about the election than dealing with the economy," said Nagayuki Yamagishi, a strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Securities. "Under these circumstances, they wouldn't have won anyway, so they're putting it off," Yamagishi said.
