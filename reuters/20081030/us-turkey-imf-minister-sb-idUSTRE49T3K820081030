 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - Turkey is continuing talks with the International Monetary Fund to negotiate a precautionary stand-by agreement, Economy Minister Mehmet said on Thursday, easing market uncertainty about prospects for an accord. 

 Turkey's previous $10 billion stand-by deal -- which details conditions related to the loan -- with the IMF expired in May and IMF officials are currently in Ankara for post-program monitoring and talks on a possible new deal. Simsek said at a conference in Istanbul that Turkey was positive about a possible deal to anchor the economy and a program may be agreed if Turkey and the IMF can overcome their differences. Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan hinted on Tuesday the government may not sign a new loan accord if the global lender exerts excessive constraints on budget spending, tax rates, economic growth and investments. Business leaders have called on the government to secure another loan deal to help limit the fallout from the global financial crisis that has already forced Ukraine, Iceland and Hungary to seek IMF help. "If the differences between us (and the IMF) can be overcome a program could come onto the agenda," Simsek said. Turkish markets have tumbled this year, with the main share index losing more than half its value while the lira has weakened as much as a third against the dollar, heightening market calls for action to support the sharply slowing economy.
