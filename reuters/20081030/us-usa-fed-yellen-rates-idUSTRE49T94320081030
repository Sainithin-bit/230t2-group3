 BERKELEY, California  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's benchmark lending rate could "potentially ... go a little lower" than the current 1 percent rate, Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, said on Thursday. 

 Taking questions from the audience after a speech in Berkeley, California, Yellen said the need for further rate cuts would depend on the extent of weakness in the U.S. economy. Yellen said the Fed "doesn't need to go to zero" on rates because it has dramatically expanded its balance sheet. That process has pushed the effective fed funds rate in money markets below the central bank's target rate. (Reporting by  Jim Christie  in Berkeley, writing by Ros Krasny; Editing by Leslie Adler)
