 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said they had met a Friday deadline for submitting their rival bids to develop a new, $1 billion-plus element of the U.S. Joint Tactical Radio System. 

 A contract is due to be awarded in June involving the system's airborne and maritime/fixed station component, said Steven Davis, a spokesman for the Navy program office overseeing the competition. The goal is a family of advanced radios with secure, Internet-like capabilities. They would be used by each of the armed services for text, voice, audio and video communications.
