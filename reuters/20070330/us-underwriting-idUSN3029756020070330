 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A hectic pace of mergers, low interest rates and healthy markets fueled a near-record quarter for Wall Street underwriters of stocks and bonds. 

 The volume of securities offerings in the first quarter totaled $2.14 trillion, up 8 percent from a year earlier and just shy of the record $2.16 trillion in the fourth quarter, data released Friday by Thomson Financial show. Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N dethroned Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) as the top fee generator, vaulting from ninth place a year ago. Merrill posted $436 million of fees, topping JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s ( JPM.N ) $383.7 million and Citigroup's $244.1 million. Reported fees industrywide fell 20 percent to $3.21 billion. By volume, Citigroup held its usual top spot, handling $202.3 billion of transactions, for a 9.5 percent share. JPMorgan followed with $175.5 billion of transactions, and Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) was third with $156.9 billion. Merrill declined to comment. Rising defaults among homeowners with poor credit caused some market volatility but failed to create any "contagion" to dampen demand for securities. Signs of slowing growth in the economy and capital spending have also not yet hurt underwriters. "The business of Wall Street remains on firm footing," said Richard Peterson, director of capital markets at Thomson, in an interview. "Concerns about subprime lending haven't impacted firms' ability to access capital markets." Investment bankers hotly compete for high rankings from Thomson for pride and marketing reasons, though rankings can be volatile from quarter to quarter. Global merger and acquisition volume totaled $1.08 trillion through Wednesday. That's down from the fourth quarter but marked only the second time M&A volume has topped $1 trillion in back-to-back quarters, Thomson said. Big leveraged buyouts in the quarter included Blackstone Group LP's BG.UL $23 billion takeover of Equity Office Properties Trust, and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.'s KKR.UL and Texas Pacific Group's TPG.UL planned $31.8 billion takeover of Texas power company TXU Corp. TXU.N. "Equity valuations appear very attractive" to private equity firms, said John Chirico, co-head of U.S. equity capital markets at Citigroup. BUYOUTS Many mergers were financed through syndicated loans, while others required debt. U.S. corporate bond offerings rose 15 percent to $311 billion. That included a $6 billion junk bond sale, the largest since 1989, by Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) to fund its $25.9 billion purchase of Phelps Dodge Corp. "Spreads have improved, deal sizes have gotten bigger, and there are more investors," said Jim Merli, global head of fixed-income syndicate at Lehman Brothers Inc. "Demand has outstripped supply." Despite a mid-quarter slowdown, the volume of initial public offerings rose 14 percent to $40.8 billion. The 68 percent first-day gain for Fortress Investment Group LLC( FIG.N ), the first U.S.-listed diversified private equity and hedge fund, may bode well for Blackstone's planned $4 billion  IPO. Freeport also sold $2.88 billion of convertible preferred stock, one of the biggest sales of the stock-bond hybrids. Yields on regular debt also stayed low -- now about 5.6 percent on typical investment-grade corporate bonds and 7.6 percent on junk bonds, Merrill data show. "The market won't fundamentally change on the corporate side until you get into a different default environment," said Andy O'Brien, co-head of leveraged finance at JPMorgan. "It's still a very issuer-friendly market. Bankers don't expect that to change soon, though investors remain cautious. "There is no trend in the marketplace that is particularly scary to investors," Chirico said. "It's not a market where all boats will rise."
