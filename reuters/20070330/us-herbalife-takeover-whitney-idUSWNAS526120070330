 (Reuters) - Whitney V L.P withdrew its offer to buy Herbalife Ltd. ( HLF.N ) after Herbalife's board rejected its buyout offer of $38 a share, sending the stock lower in early electronic trade. 

 In a letter to Herbalife, disclosed in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Whitney said it was disappointed at Herbalife's unwillingness to discuss the proposal. Whitney said it would continue to monitor developments in the company and may engage in sale or purchase of the company's common shares. Whitney owned about 27 percent of the Herbalife shares as of February 2, when it made its offer. Herbalife, which sells weight-loss and nutritional supplements, had on Thursday said Whitney's offer was too low, but added it remained open to a higher bid from Whitney. In a research note, Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said Whitney's refusal to improve the offer came as a surprise, adding Herbalife's fundamentals are stronger than when Whitney made its offer. The analyst expects a negative reaction to the news, but viewed it as an attractive opportunity for fundamental investors, and reiterated his "overweight" rating on the stock. Herbalife shares fell 5 percent to $38.26 in early electronic trade after closing at $40.27 Thursday on the Nasdaq. (Reporting by Amitha Rajan and Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore)
