 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two Los Angeles billionaires have offered $34 per share for Tribune Co. TRB.N, according to a source familiar with the matter, two days before the newspaper publisher and TV broadcaster plans to choose among bids that could take all or part of it private. 

 The bid by businessman and philanthropist Eli Broad and supermarket investor Ron Burkle would be worth about $8.21 billion based on 241.4 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2006, and would top a bid from Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell, pegged by media reports at $33 per share. The deal would be structured as an employee stock ownership plan and include $500 million from the two, the source said. Further details were unavailable. A Tribune spokesman, a spokeswoman for Broad and a spokeswoman for Zell all declined to comment. Tribune operates some of the leading U.S. newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Newsday and The Baltimore Sun. It is also a major TV broadcaster and owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team. Tribune has said it wants to decide on offers for the company by Saturday, March 31. The Zell bid is also structured as an employee stock ownership plan, according to media reports. Both plans would have to deal with the approximately $5 billion in debt that Tribune has on its balance sheet, according to its annual report filed on February 26. An earlier proposal by Broad and Burkle offered $34 a share -- a $27 dividend and equity valued at $7 per share. The bid also included $500 million in cash from the two. Tribune also is considering a plan that could involve spinning off its television operations as well as the Cubs, leaving it as a newspaper publisher, according to reports. The Chicago-based company has been fielding several offers for a buyout or the spinoff of various divisions after its largest shareholder, the Chandler Trusts, publicly aired their anger with the decline in the company's stock price last year. The company is expected to reach a decision by this weekend as a special board committee meets to decide which option it prefers. One source familiar with the matter said earlier this week that the company could postpone its decision beyond its announced date of March 31. Tribune started soliciting offers last fall, but was unimpressed with what it received, and said in January that it would consider options that it could achieve on its own. At the time, Tribune said it would buy back stock and shed some of its properties as it focuses more on building its presence online. Like most U.S. newspaper publishers, Tribune has seen advertising revenue and circulation fall at its papers as more people use the Internet to get news and entertainment. The company has stakes in online ventures, including online jobs site Careerbuilder.com and local news search service Topix.net. It co-owns those companies with fellow publishers Gannett Co. Inc. ( GCI.N ) and McClatchy Co ( MNI.N ).
