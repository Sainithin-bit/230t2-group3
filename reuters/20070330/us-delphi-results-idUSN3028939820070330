 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt U.S. auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK posted a $132 million net loss for February, the company said in a limited operating report filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on Friday. 

 Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, remains in talks with its unions and former parent General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on agreements necessary to complete a proposed $3.4 billion private equity investment to exit court protection. Troy, Michigan-based Delphi also reported $19 million in professional fees directly related to the bankruptcy in February in the report to the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
