 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Friedman Billings Ramsey Group Inc. ( FBR.N ) said on Friday it will close a number of centers and cut jobs at its subprime mortgage operation. 

 First NLC Financial Services, which makes loans to people with poor credit histories, will close wholesale operation centers and cut jobs as origination volumes of subprime loans fall sharply throughout the industry.
