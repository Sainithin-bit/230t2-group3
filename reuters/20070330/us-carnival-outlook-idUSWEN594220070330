 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Carnival Corp. ( CCL.N ), the world's largest cruise operator, said earnings this year may be lower than expected because of higher fuel costs and unfavorable exchange rates. 

 In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Carnival said earnings in the second quarter could be 1 cent-per-share lower than its forecast of between 45 cents and 47 cents per share. The company said 2007 earnings could be 5 cents lower than its forecast of $2.90 to $3.10 per share if current fuel prices and foreign exchange rates persist. Wall Street analysts were expecting Carnival to earn 47 cents per share in the second quarter and $3.02 for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Since releasing forecasts on March 16, Carnival said its forward fuel price curve for the last nine months of 2007 had climbed to $339 per metric ton from $318 per metric ton. It also said that euro and sterling exchange rates to the dollar had worsened. Carnival also said it expects passenger capacity to increase 9.4 percent in the second quarter, 9.6 percent in third quarter, and 5.9 percent in the fourth, as new ships enter service. Miami-based Carnival operates the Holland America, Cunard, and Princess cruise lines. Its shares were up 15 cents at $47.04 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.
