 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's biggest pharmacy chain, Alliance Boots, opened its books to its deputy chairman and a private equity firm after they raised their proposed bid by 4 percent to 10 billion pounds ($19.7 billion), the company said on Friday. 

 Private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Alliance Boots deputy chairman Stefano Pessina -- a billionaire with a 15 percent stake in the company -- increased their proposed offer to 1,040 pence from 1,000 pence a share, rejected earlier this month. A source familiar with the matter said the process was likely to take three to four weeks and, if no problems emerged, the Alliance Boots board was likely to back the improved offer. Alliance Boots AB.L sells medicines, beauty products and sandwiches and also runs a drugs distribution business. It was  created last year from the merger of 150-year-old health and beauty retailer Boots and drugs wholesaler Alliance UniChem. "The level may disappoint some, but actually, in our view, it is a very good price-as, indeed, 1,000p was, especially after the rather lacklustre trading statement," said Seymour Pierce analyst Richard Ratner. A deal would be Europe's biggest ever leveraged buyout, although it could be trumped if a group of private equity firms including KKR KKR.UL succeed with plans to buy British supermarket group J. Sainsbury Plc ( SBRY.L ). Alliance Boots has about 3,000 retail outlets, including around 2,600 pharmacies, health and beauty stores and optician practices in Britain. It also operates over 380 drug distribution depots across Europe. CHEAP BORROWING Cash-rich private equity firms are pursuing a string of deals, particularly in the retail sector, as they take advantage of cheap borrowing costs to buy companies whose property assets and strong cash flows allow them to pay off debt quickly. "Given Mr Pessina knows the company, probably better than anyone, we suspect he is unlikely to discover any nasty surprises when carrying out the due diligence," Numis Securities analysts wrote in a research note. "We also believe it is unlikely another party will offer a counter bid." A nuclear engineer by training, Pessina turned his family's ailing Naples drug wholesaler into pan-European giant Alliance UniChem and then masterminded the merger with Boots last year. He is the group's biggest shareholder. Sources close to the matter told Reuters on Sunday that private equity group Terra Firma was considering a bid for Alliance Boots. But they also said it was struggling to find an investment bank that was not already involved in a retail deal to both advise it and help finance an offer. Alliance Boots shares climbed as high as 1,046 pence, but by 0910 GMT had retreated to stand up 0.7 percent at 1,034 pence, as investors pared back hopes of a higher bid. Private equity firms have been accused by some trade unions and politicians of running businesses for short-term profit and loading them with excessive debts. KKR said in a statement that its investment rationale was predicated on long-term growth and that it would invest further in Alliance Boots, though it did not say how much. Credit ratings agency Fitch said it might downgrade Alliance Boots due to the extra debt likely to be loaded onto the business by the acquisition. Alliance Boots said on Wednesday it expected a 1.6 percent rise in UK retail like-for-like sales in the fourth quarter of its financial year, and that it was cutting 300 jobs and spending 65 million pounds to spread the Boots brand to its Alliance UniChem chemists. Some analysts had expected KKR and Pessina to raise their bid to around 1,060 pence a share. The 1,040-pence-a-share bid values Alliance Boots at about 22 times forecast earnings, compared with the DJ Stoxx European retail sector .SXRP average of about 19 times, according to Reuters Estimates.
