 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A raft of stronger-than-expected U.S. economic reports on Friday, including data on personal income, inflation and manufacturing, buttressed the view that the economy was on solid footing and interest rates were unlikely to fall any time soon. 

 Personal income rose 0.6 percent in February, below the unrevised 1.0 percent gain for January but double the 0.3 percent increase forecast by analysts in a Reuters poll. February consumer spending also rose 0.6 percent, outpacing forecasts for a 0.3 percent gain after an unrevised 0.5 percent increase in January, according to Commerce Department data. "These are a strong set of numbers right across the board. This suggests that the consumer is a little more on solid ground than we previously realized and the prices data should keep the Fed focused on inflation rather than growth risks," said David Sloan, economist at 4cast in New York. Construction spending also defied forecasts for a decline as gains in nonresidential building overcame drops in home and federal construction, and a Chicago purchasing managers report showed a huge pick-up in Midwest manufacturing, prompting bond traders to bet against a near-term Federal Reserve rate cut. But adding mixed signals, a key consumer survey showed March sentiment at its lowest in six months due to worries about rising prices, while a separate business survey showed March business conditions cooling in the New York region. Treasury debt prices eased after the data but later turned higher as investors focused on tensions in the Middle East and trade issues. Stocks initially rose before turning negative on those concerns. The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago, a barometer of Midwest manufacturing, jumped to 61.7 in March from 47.9 in February, its highest level since early 2005. The index showed new orders soared. "I think the Chicago PMI is an almost shockingly strong number. Some of that may reflect a rebound from weather-related effects but certainly it is a big surprise," said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Florida. "Taken in context with the other data that we got, this is another negative for the bond market." CONSUMER SENTIMENT FALLS Consumer confidence data, however, showed Americans had some concerns with the economy. The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers' final March sentiment index fell to its lowest in six months as worries about rising prices and slowing income gains weighed. The index slid to 88.4, its lowest since September, from 91.3 in February. But analysts said most of Friday's data looked strong. "Income and spending, both higher-than-expected," said Jeoff Hall, chief North American economist at Thomson IFR in Boston. "Wages and salaries are growing at a meaningful clip. You had a bit of a drift in consumer sentiment, but construction spending has risen unexpectedly. Suddenly we've gone from this bias of pessimism to one where we don't see any justification for the Fed to ease." INFLATION CONCERNS Core consumer prices, which exclude volatile energy and food costs, rose 0.3 percent in February, outpacing forecasts for a 0.2 percent rise, following a downwardly revised 0.2 percent gain in January. The core prices were up 2.4 percent compared with a year earlier after a downwardly revised 2.2 percent gain in January. Some officials at the Federal Reserve have said they prefer the 12-month rise in core prices to remain between 1 percent and 2 percent. Fed policy-makers held benchmark borrowing costs steady at a meeting last week and said their predominant concern was that inflation would fail to ease. However, in announcing their decision, they dropped an explicit reference to the possibility of a further "firming" of monetary policy, keeping their options open to lower borrowing costs if the economy stumbles badly. The February savings rate was unchanged with January at a negative 1.2 percent of disposable personal income. The savings rate has been negative since April 2005. U.S. construction spending in February rose 0.3 percent, its biggest jump since a 1.0 percent gain in March 2006, even as private residential spending staged its 11th straight monthly drop, the Commerce Department said. The total spending of $1.171 trillion was driven higher by nonresidential building, made up of commercial construction and local government building.
