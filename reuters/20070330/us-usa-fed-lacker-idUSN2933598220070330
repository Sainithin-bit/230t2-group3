 RICHMOND, Virginia  (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Thursday the risks of disappointingly modest economic growth had mounted but getting inflation lower was still his main concern. 

 "In the last three to six months the downside risks have definitely crept up. At the same time ... the longer we go on without a noteworthy decline in inflation, the more the risk we run of entrenching expectations where they are now," he told reporters after addressing local economists. Asked if he felt the current setting of interest rates was sufficient to bring inflation down at a fast-enough pace, he made plain he would be patient for a while. "The question in that regard will arise later in the year if, as I anticipate, the downside risks ease significantly. "I think at that point there will be a policy question in front of us about inflation. Because if inflation has not moderated by then and the downside risks ease and we get by the housing (slowdown), then the choice is going to face us squarely," he said. Lacker, who is not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, is one of the U.S. central bank's most hawkish members. He dissented at four consecutive policy meetings last year, seeking higher interest rates when the Fed held benchmark rates steady. There are some fears that problems in the subprime mortgage market, which provides loans for borrowers with tainted credit, could spread and hurt the overall economy, but Lacker played these down. "I don't see it as a big risk to growth or housing. At the margin, increasing spreads are going to mean some people who would otherwise be homeowners would be renters instead." Lacker's speech focused on inflation expectations and he emphasized central banks must not take anything for granted. "This apparent stability, relative to the wide swings (inflation expectations) displayed in prior decades, should not be cause for complacency, particularly with inflation running uncomfortably high," he said. "Central banks should not take inflation expectations for granted by acting in ways that are inconsistent with expectations but assuming expectations will not change," Lacker told the Virginia Association of Economists.
