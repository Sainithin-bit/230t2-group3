 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Philip Morris USA said on Friday that it made its full annual payment of $3.5 billion under the Master Settlement Agreement with U.S. states, including about $400 million it could have disputed. 

 The 1998 agreement between 46 U.S. states and the tobacco industry settled state lawsuits over the costs of treating smoking-related illnesses. Tobacco manufacturers can reduce their payments if they lose market share to companies that do not participate in the agreement and if an independent consultant determines that the agreement contributed to the loss, among other factors. Philip Morris paid the full amount, even though it disputes that it owes about $400 million of the total as a result of the 2004 Non-Participating Manufacturer adjustment. "Philip Morris USA hopes that its gesture will facilitate an expeditious resolution of the Non-Participating Manufacturer adjustment dispute, whether by settlement or by the efficient arbitration process specified by the Master Settlement Agreement," Denise Keane, Philip Morris USA's general counsel, said in a statement. Philip Morris USA is a unit of Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ). Since 1997, Philip Morris USA has paid more than $38 billion to the states, including payments under the Master Settlement Agreement and payments to previously settled states.
