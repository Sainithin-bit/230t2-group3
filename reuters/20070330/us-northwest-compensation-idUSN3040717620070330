 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines Corp. NWACQ.PK said on Friday it plans to award about 400 directors and officers a combined stake in the carrier of up to 4.9 percent when it emerges from bankruptcy by the end of June. 

 The stake, in the form of restricted stock and stock options, could be valued at about $382 million, based on the company's estimate of a $7.8 billion valuation. That works out to an average of $955,000 per manager. But the company said the stock option component doesn't have a definite value because it depends on the price of the grant and the development of the shares. "Like all Northwest employees, our management team made financial sacrifices that enabled the company to execute its successful turnaround," Roy Bostock, chairman of Northwest's compensation committee, said in a statement. The equity awards vest over a period of four years and will only have value if the management team achieves the business plan and Northwest's stock price appreciates, the No. 5 U.S. carrier said. Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK, which plans to emerge from bankruptcy by the end of April, plans to give 1,200 managers $240 million, or about $200,000 each, in restricted stock, stock options, and performance shares. Delta's compensation vests over periods between six months and three years. Bostock said attrition rates among Northwest's managers were "unacceptably high." "This equity plan will enable Northwest to recruit, retain and provide financial incentives to top-tier management, which is a key to the company's ongoing success," he said. Northwest pushed forward disclosing its management compensation plans after criticism from unions as well as some bondholders. The issue of executive compensation was especially sensitive to Northwest's workers, who sacrificed $1.4 billion to help the carrier reorganize. Bondholders were concerned that a generous payout would dilute their holdings. The Association of Flight Attendants, which has a very rocky relationship with Northwest, called the compensation plan "a new corporate greed paradox," union spokesman Ricky Thornton said. Northwest said the percentage of equity in the compensation plan was below average for post-Chapter 11 companies, including awards at US Airways and United Airlines. The information on the management compensation plan will be added to Northwest's disclosure statement, which details the airline's reorganization plan. Bankruptcy Judge Allan Gropper on Monday allowed the carrier to begin seeking creditor approval for the plan on the condition that it include details of its executive compensation package. Northwest said it would be begin soliciting creditor approval "shortly." Northwest said the official committee of unsecured creditors, which wields significant influence over the airline's future, supports the management compensation plan.
