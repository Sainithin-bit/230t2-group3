 (Reuters) - Amazon.com said on Thursday it is launching a new free Kindle application that will give customers access to over 420,000 books on a range of BlackBerry devices. 

 Called "Kindle for Blackberry", the free application allows customers using BlackBerry devices on AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, and other U.S. carriers easy wireless access to Kindle books, most for $9.99 or less. "Since the launch of our popular Kindle for iPhone app last year, customers have been asking us to bring a similar experience to the BlackBerry," said Ian Freed, Vice President, Amazon Kindle. Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, has been under pressure from a lot of publishers for the low prices it charges for e-books to spur demand for its electronic reader Kindle, hoping to fend off new rivals such as Apple Inc that are set to join the e-books fray with their own devices. Shares of the company had closed at $116.31 Wednesday on Nasdaq.\ (Reporting by  Nivedita Bhattacharjee  in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)
