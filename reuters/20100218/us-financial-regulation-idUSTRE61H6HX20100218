 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Efforts to tighten financial regulation picked up speed in the U.S. Senate on Thursday as a key committee targeted next week for the unveiling of revised legislation and the week after for a working session on it. 

 The plan signals renewed momentum behind an initiative that last month appeared to lose headway after negotiations broke down between Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd, the banking committee's chairman, and its top Republican, Senator Richard Shelby. Dodd restarted talks last week with Republican Senator Bob Corker. The two have been trying to forge a bipartisan agreement since then, said Dodd spokeswoman Kirstin Brost. "We're working with Corker and hope to have a revised bill to present next week," Brost said. At the same time, some Republicans on the panel are developing substitute legislation, said a Shelby aide. Separately, top White House economic adviser Lawrence Summers said in a CNBC television interview that it was crucial for Congress to move quickly on regulatory reform. He urged action on proposals for managing risks in the financial system and establishing a new way for the government to unwind large financial firms that get into trouble. The U.S. House of Representatives in December approved a bill mandating the biggest crackdown since the 1930s in bank and capital market oversight, including changes similar to what Summers suggested. No Republicans voted for the Democratic bill. "We're certainly pushing the Senate to act as rapidly as it can," Summers said. "Unfortunately, the hundreds of lobbyists -- three for every congressman -- that many in the financial industry have hired ... slowed down this process." BILL SEEN ON SENATE FLOOR BY APRIL Policy analysts have been expecting a regulatory reform bill to emerge from the banking committee and move to the Senate floor this spring, possibly in late March or April. If the Senate approves a bill, final House-Senate compromise legislation could be on President Barack Obama's desk by mid-year, said analysts and lobbyists. Regulatory reform has been working its way slowly through Congress for more than a year, with the aim of preventing another crisis like the one that saw the collapse in 2008 of Lehman Brothers, government-led mergers of Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, and bailouts of many financial firms. A draft reform bill unveiled by Dood in November was immediately rejected by Republicans, and he and Shelby eventually came to an impasse over Obama's proposal to create a new agency to regulate consumer financial products. Corker has said he will not accept a stand-alone agency but would consider new consumer protection powers inside a larger regulator, suggesting this may be an area of Democratic compromise. VOLCKER RULE COMPLICATES TALKS Obama complicated negotiations last month by proposing a rule to limit banks' proprietary trading, get them out of the hedge fund business, and limit their future growth -- dubbed the Volcker rule because it was inspired by White House economic adviser Paul Volcker. Banking committee members are considering adding to their legislation a watered-down version of the Volcker rule that would lean against a strict ban on proprietary trading, but might require stronger supervision of banks involved in such activities, said sources close to the panel. Separately, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank announced on Thursday that his panel will hold a hearing on February 25 looking into pay practices in the financial industry -- a politically sensitive subject with many Americans angry about the bailouts and resurgent banker bonuses. Frank said the hearing will focus on pay at firms such as bailed-out insurer AIG and mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were seized by the U.S. government and put into conservatorship in September 2008.
