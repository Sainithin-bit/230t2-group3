 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A surprise move by the Federal Reserve on Thursday to raise the discount rate for the first time since the financial crisis erupted sent U.S. stock futures and bonds lower after the close of markets and caused the dollar to strengthen further. 

 The euro fell to its lowest level against the dollar since mid-May after the U.S. central bank said it was raising the interest rate it charges banks for emergency loans. The Fed cited improvement in financial conditions and said the move did not signal a tightening of monetary policy, but financial markets read it differently. "The Fed can talk all day about how the discount rate hike is technical and not a policy move, but the market sees it as a shot across the bow," said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York. Stocks had ended the day higher, but the move -- signaled by Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke in recent days -- prompted investors to sell equities, bonds and commodities, including gold. The Fed said it was raising the interest rate it charges banks for emergency loans to 0.75 percent from 0.50 percent, effective Friday. "This may be one small step back toward the normalization of Fed operations, but in the grand scheme of things, the Fed is moving back to doing business as normal and business as normal is not targeting an exceptionally low Fed funds rate of zero to 0.25 percent," Rupkey said. As the February 19 global trading session opened with the news, the euro reached $1.3578 compared with $1.3615 before the announcement. The euro traded as low as $1.3504, according to Reuters data. Against the yen, the dollar traded at 91.47 yen compared with 91.20 before the announcement. The dollar gained against a basket of major currencies .DXY. S&P 500 futures fell 9.30 points, while Nasdaq futures lost 12.25 points, and Dow futures slid 69 points. "The timing is most surprising. The last day of options expirations is tomorrow and this is going to create a lot of angst and ruin a pretty good week we were having," said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. Friday will probably "be a down day, given the good three sessions so far this week and given the news will be seen as negative. But once the market has a chance to digest the news, this may not be a big drop," he added. U.S. short-term interest rate futures showed more chance for Federal Reserve rate hikes after the announcement. The implied prospects that the Fed will raise its target for overnight lending between banks by its September meeting rose to 70 percent, from 54 percent before the Fed's announcement. U.S. Treasury debt prices extended losses on the news. The 2-year Treasury note's price, which moves inversely to its yield, traded down 4/32 for a yield of 0.92 percent, versus about 0.88 percent just before the announcement. Gold traded down $7.20 at $1,112.90 per ounce, as well. U.S. stocks had closed higher on Thursday on positive factory data that reinforced confidence in the economic recovery, and European stocks closed up for a fourth straight session on the U.S. data and on strong earnings. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 83.66 points, or 0.81 percent, at 10,392.90. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  ended the day up 7.24 points, or 0.66 percent, at 1,106.75. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 15.42 points, or 0.69 percent, at 2,241.71. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank's mid-Atlantic factory survey on Thursday showed greater-than-expected growth in February as new orders surged. In addition, private research group the Conference Board's reported that its index of leading economic indicators rose for the 10th month to a record high in January. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares  .FTEU3  closed 0.65 percent higher at 1,021.66 points, after gaining 2.8 percent in the previous three sessions. Swiss engineering group ABB soared 7.64 percent after fourth-quarter results, while Capgemini, Europe's largest computer consultancy, rose 6.19 percent after reporting earnings ahead of forecasts. The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS added 0.37 percent to 291.03. U.S. Treasuries fell as investors focused on the positive economic data and the government announced its auctions for next week. The government said it would auction a record $126 billion in coupon debt next week, including the first sale of 30-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities. Though the supply figures were in line with expectations, they still weighed on the market as traders sought to push down prices to attractive levels for the auctions.
