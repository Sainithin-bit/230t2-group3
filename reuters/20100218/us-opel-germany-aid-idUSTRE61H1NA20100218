 BERLIN  (Reuters) - A German government advisory panel has not made a decision on whether General Motors' reorganization plan for European arm Opel deserves crucial state aid, Deputy Economy Minister Jochen Homann said on Thursday. 

 Earlier on Thursday, the Financial Times newspaper reported that the task force which groups senior government officials and an investment banker deemed the plan "unqualified for government loan guarantees." (Reporting by  Gernot Heller , Writing by Sarah Marsh)
