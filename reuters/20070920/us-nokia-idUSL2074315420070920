 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the world's top cellphone maker, unveiled on Thursday its new phone model 6301, which features unlicensed mobile access (UMA) technology. 

 Nokia said the new model would begin shipping in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2007 at an estimated retail price of 230 euros ($322), before subsidies and taxes. UMA handset users can make calls over the Internet when they are in range of an unlicensed wireless network, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. When they move out of range, the connection will automatically revert to a GSM, GPRS or UMTS mobile phone network. Nokia started its first tests on UMA technology in July last year and it has already launched its 6086 UMA phone.
