 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) and state-run Borse Dubai unveiled a deal on Thursday to join forces and acquire Sweden's OMX OMX.ST, ending a lengthy takeover battle for the Nordic exchange owner. 

 Under the complex agreement, Nasdaq will take Borse Dubai's stake in OMX, Borse Dubai will end up with a 20 percent stake in Nasdaq and will also buy Nasdaq's 28 percent holding in the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ). Nasdaq would take a strategic stake in Dubai International Financial Exchange (DIFX), the firms added in a statement. Borse Dubai will continue its 230 Swedish crown per share offer for OMX while Nasdaq will withdraw its cash-and-share bid under certain conditions.
