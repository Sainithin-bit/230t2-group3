 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Oracle Corp ORCL.O said on Thursday it expects second-quarter revenue to rise 19 percent to 21 percent from a year ago, with new software license revenue increasing 15 percent to 25 percent. 

 It also forecast net profit of 20 cents to 21 cents per share in the quarter, or 26 cents to 27 cents, excluding special items, Chief Financial Officer Safra Catz said on a conference call with analysts. The estimates came after Oracle, the world's third-largest software maker, reported a 25 percent rise in first-quarter net profit to $840 million, or 16 cents per share, on a 26 percent gain in revenue to $4.53 billion, (Reporting by  Jim Finkle )
