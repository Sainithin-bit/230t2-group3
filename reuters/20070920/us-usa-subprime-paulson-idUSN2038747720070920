 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Thursday he is open to temporarily expanding Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's investments into 'jumbo' mortgages to ease housing stress, but only with stronger oversight. 

 Allowing the government-sponsored enterprises to securitize such large mortgages would give a "short-term lift" to parts of the housing market that are not functioning normally, Paulson said in testimony prepared for delivery to the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. "GSE entry into this sector would improve liquidity," he said, but allowing the GSEs to expand their business, and hence a perceived government guarantee to new areas, involves taking on more risks and could reduce longer-term market discipline. Paulson urged the U.S. Senate to pass a bill that strengthens their regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. "It would be unreasonable and irresponsible to expand the GSEs' business without addressing the fundamental problems of their regulatory structure," Paulson said. Currently, Fannie and Freddie can only securitize loans valued at $417,000 or less, eliminating a significant portion of the high-cost East Coast and West Coast housing markets. Paulson said any expansion of GSEs' investments should be limited to a temporary provision and part of legislation strengthening the regulatory structure. "If it goes beyond that it raises difficult public policy issues and could be seen as detracting from the GSEs' affordable housing mission and displacing private sector participation, which the (Bush) administration does not support." He said congressional and other calls to increase the caps on the size of GSE investment portfolios was "misplaced," as this was something that OFHEO should evaluate as Fannie and Freddie become current with their financial statements and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Paulson said the market for prime, conforming loans under $417,000 -- those securitized by Fannie and Freddie -- was functioning well, and there were signs that the jumbo mortgage market was "loosening up" although still not functioning normally. The subprime market, which typically caters to those with poor credit, will take longer to correct, he said. Nonetheless, he said, despite the turmoil in mortgage and credit markets, the U.S. economy was healthy and global growth strong. "Although the recent reappraisal of risk coupled with weakness in the housing sector may well result in a (growth) penalty, the fundamentals point to continued U.S. economic growth," he said.
