 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday that the central bank opted for a one-half percentage point cut in the benchmark interest rate this week in a bid to stay ahead of tightening credit conditions. 

 "We took that action to try to get out ahead of the situation and try to forestall potential effects of tighter credit conditions on the broader economy," Bernanke told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee. The deep rate cut on Tuesday surprised many on Wall Street, who had anticipated a milder 25 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate.
