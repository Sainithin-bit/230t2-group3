 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Carnival Corp & Plc ( CCL.N ) ( CCL.L ) posted a better-than-expected 12 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday on stronger pricing and the introduction of new ships during the busy summer cruising season. 

 But the world's largest cruise ship operator said earnings in the seasonally slower fourth quarter are expected to be below Wall Street expectations, burdened by high fuel costs and the timing of dry-dock expenses. Net profit in Carnival's fiscal third quarter, which ended August 31, rose to $1.38 billion, or $1.67 per share, from $1.23 billion, or $1.49 per share, in the same period a year ago. Carnival, which operates Holland America, Cunard, and Princess cruise lines as well as its namesake line, said revenues rose 10 percent to $4.32 billion, as the number of passengers carried rose 9.5 percent. Wall Street analysts were expecting Carnival to post earnings of $1.62 per share on revenue of $4.34 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking ahead, Carnival said higher fuel costs and dry-cok expenses will to burden fourth-quarter earnings, despite stronger bookings and improved pricing, especially in the key Caribbean market. The cruise operator forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 42 cents to 44 cents per share, compared to 51 cents per share in the same period last year. Wall Street analysts had been expecting the company to post fourth-quarter earnings of 47 cents per share. (Reporting by  Chris Reiter )
