 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Palm Inc PALM.O, maker of the Treo smartphone, on Wednesday posted a quarterly revenue estimate that missed expectations as competition increased from rival devices like Apple Inc's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone. 

 The preliminary results for Palm's fiscal first quarter sent the company's shares down as much as 6.9 percent in after-hours trading before they recuperated to trade down 1.8 percent. Palm also said it would post a per-share net loss of 1 penny or break-even in the quarter ended Aug 31, compared with a net profit of 16 cents per share a year earlier. The Treo competes with a range of devices including Research in Motion Ltd's RIM.TO RIMM.O Blackberry. In particular, Palm faces competition from the iPhone, which was released this summer, said Oppenheimer & Co analyst Lawrence Harris. "The competition will intensify this quarter," Harris said, noting Apple's decision earlier in September to cut the iPhone's price this month. Palm said it expects to post revenue of $359 million to $361 million, below the average analyst view of $362.6 million, according to Reuters Estimates. That would be a small improvement from $355.8 million in revenues in the first quarter of 2007. The company expects smartphone revenue to be $300 million to $302 million on sales of 685,000 to 690,000 phones to consumers in the quarter. Excluding special items, it sees first-quarter profit at 8 cents to 9 cents per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of 8 cents a share before items, according to Reuters Estimates, compared with a profit of 21 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts have said that the music-playing iPhone, which now costs $399, directly competes with the Treo, even though Apple's device is aimed at consumers whereas many Treos are used by business clients for e-mail and Web surfing. The Treo sells for up to $399 at Verizon Wireless, or $199 at Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ) to customers who sign a contract. Because of the iPhone competition, analysts said they expect Palm to shift its focus to lower-end phones like the Centro, which is expected to be released for $99 in coming weeks. Palm is benefiting from its large customer base as well as the appointment of Jon Rubinstein as executive chairman, said Oppenheimer's Harris. Rubinstein previously served as senior vice president and general manager of Apple's iPod unit. He joined in June, but it will take some time for him to help come up with a new design. "The impact of his arrival in terms of a completely new design probably won't be felt for 18 months," Harris said. "It takes one to two years typically to design a new mobile phone or smartphone." Palm has tried to rejuvenate growth by launching new devices such as the Foleo, a compact computer that the company scrapped earlier this month after it was much maligned on technology blogs. The company, which plans to sell a 25 percent stake to Elevation Partners for $325 million, has said it would take a charge of less than $10 million as a result of Foleo. Palm also said it is starting to market its proposed senior secured loan facilities in conjunction with a recapitalization. Shares traded at $15.50 in after-hours trading after falling as low as $14.70. The stock closed up 9 cents at $15.79 on Nasdaq.
