 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Several Goldman Sachs Group's ( GS.N ) hedge funds suffered major quarterly losses, the bank's chief financial officer said on a conference call on Thursday. 

 David Viniar said the Goldman Global Alpha fund was down about 30 percent for the second quarter, while its Global Equity Opportunities fund was down about 20 percent in the quarter. Viniar said the Alpha fund has had over $1.6 billion in redemption requests, or demands for a return of investor capital. Global Alpha currently has a net asset value of about $6 billion, the bank said.
