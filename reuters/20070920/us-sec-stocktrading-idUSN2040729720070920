 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Thursday that it had charged 38 traders in a multimillion-dollar scheme involving phony finder fees and illegal kickbacks in the "stock loan" industry. 

 Those charged include 17 current or former traders at several Wall Street brokerages, including Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Van der Moolen VDMN.AS, Janney Montgomery ( JNYXX.O ), A.G. Edwards, Oppenheimer ( OPY.N ) and Nomura Securities, a unit of Nomura Holdings ( 8604.T ). Stock loans are made as part of short sales or other transactions that require the investor to borrow shares. Federal prosecutors in Brooklyn have filed criminal fraud and conspiracy charges against five traders, who are scheduled to appear before a judge on Thursday afternoon. Ten individuals have already entered guilty pleas in connection with the case in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn, the federal prosecutor's office said. The SEC said the 38 conspired in various schemes to skim profits on stock loan transactions, pocketing more than $12 million from their actions. Prosecutors said the traders funneled millions of dollars in fraudulent "finder fees" to co-conspirators, often when no services had been provided, in exchange for cash bribes or payments to the traders' relatives. Brokerage firms do not allow such fees to be paid in connection with stock-loan transactions, the prosecutor's office said. A Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said two of the defendants who had worked at the firm are no longer there. "The conduct alleged by the government is in violation of Morgan Stanley's values and policies," the company said. "We have and will continue to provide every assistance to the government investigation into this matter." Spokesmen for Nomura Holdings and Van Der Moolen declined to comment. Oppenheimer and Janney Montgomery could not be immediately reached for comment. A spokesman for A.G. Edwards had no immediate comment. Charles Ross, a lawyer for former Janney Montgomery employee Andrew Caccioppoli, said his client was arrested Thursday morning and plans to plead not guilty. The government began investigating the stock loan industry about 21 months ago. In August, Janney Montgomery Scott was fined $2.5 million by NYSE Regulation Inc. for improper stock-lending practices. In a typical stock loan, brokers agree on collateral and the lending fee. The lender invests the cash collateral and retains a small part of the interest. But when a security is scarce, lenders retain most or all of the interest. Finders are third parties who, for a fee, locate a counterparty for stock loans. NYSE Regulation says finders, no longer critical in the age of e-mail and electronic networks, needlessly boost borrowing costs.
