 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Communications equipment network maker 3Com Corp COMS.O on Thursday posted a wider net loss from a year ago, partly due to higher research and development costs. 

 3Com reported a fiscal first-quarter net loss of $18.7 million, or 5 cents per share, compared with a year-ago net loss of $14.1 million, or 1 cent per share. Revenue rose 6.4 percent to $319.4 million. Spending on research and development rose to $52.3 million from $47.8 million. (Reporting by  Duncan Martell )
