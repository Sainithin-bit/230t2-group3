 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said on Thursday the Fed's decision to cut interest rates this week had lowered the risk of a U.S. recession, although chances were still above one in three. 

 Asked in an interview on Bloomberg television whether the Fed's half-percentage-point rate cut on Tuesday had lowered the chances of a recession, Greenspan said: "I think so, but remember that we still have a problem out there, which is a large overhang of unsold newly constructed homes." "There is pressure to get these homes on the market and sold and that is putting downward pressure on house prices, which is a very important economic variable," he said, adding that this could tax household wealth and spending. "To the extent that we see a flattening out in the net worth of households ... we would expect to find some erosion in consumer expenditures. But we haven't seen that yet," he said. Greenspan said the chances for a recession in the United States were still "somewhat more" than 1 out of 3, despite the cut in the Fed's overnight federal funds rate to 4.75 percent, but cautioned it was hard to be more precise. "We are often wrong but never in doubt on too many issues," he said.
