 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Conglomerate Tyco International Ltd's ( TYC.N ) quarterly profit beat Wall Street forecasts on Thursday amid sharply higher earnings in its security business, which were boosted by the acquisition of Broadview. 

 The maker of security systems and fire and safety products reported net income of $359 million, or 76 cents per share, for the third quarter ended June 24, compared with $254 million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations before special items were 85 cents a share, ahead of the 72 cents analysts expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue of $4.29 billion beat Wall Street forecasts of $4.21 billion. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
