 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's Hyundai Motor posted a 37 percent rise in quarterly net profit, outstripping the consensus forecast, after it logged record global vehicle sales and gained market share from Japanese rivals reeling from the March 11 earthquake. 

 Hyundai, the world's fifth-biggest carmaker along with affiliate Kia Motors, on Thursday reported a 2.3 trillion won ($2.2 billion) net profit for the April to June quarter, compared with a consensus forecast of 2.1 trillion won from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. PARK JUNG-WON, FUND MANAGER, YURIE ASSET MANAGEMENT "Despite Japanese rivals recovering, Hyundai has new factories ramping up production. Its quality has improved and foreign sales are good." "In the long term, I think the outlook on Hyundai will remain bright. The won's impact has waned as it now has a bigger portion of production in overseas plants." KIM DAE-HWAN, FUND MANAGER, SHINYOUNG ASSET MANAGEMENT "Growth momentum could slow a bit in the second half. Hyundai has boosted market share, especially in the United States with a weak currency and its rival Toyota lagging." "Hyundai already gained a foothold amid eased competition with Toyota and the U.S. big three carmakers...but in the face of growing competition with a possible recovery by Japanese makers, if the won strengthens to the early 1,000 level versus the dollar, it will pressure Hyundai from early next year. "Now it is really time for Hyundai to stand on its own merits." KONG HYUNG-JOON, FUND MANAGER, HYUNDAI INVESTMENT "The earnings were better than expected, and I expect they will continue to show strength for a while." "Second half growth is expected to slow, since momentum will fall a little bit." "The rising won is one of the biggest concerns but Toyota is expected to threaten Hyundai more than any other factor. Toyota's plans to launch new lines in the second half are going to put Hyundai in a more difficult position. " "Hyundai's labor union issues are not much to worry about. We expect they will be resolved before dragging on too long." KO SEUNG-JAE, FUND MANAGER, DREAM ASSET "Solid growth will continue in the second half but it may lose some momentum as its Japanese rivals are recovering fast and that will provide a more level playing field for Hyundai, which has benefited from its rivals' struggle in the first half. "The rising won and aggressive marketing by European car makers in the Korean market following the (Korea-EU) free trade deal will also pose a risk for Hyundai's growth."
