 (Reuters) - Japan's biggest technology conglomerates reported quarterly results, with weak TV demand a common theme at both Sony Corp and Sharp Corp. 

 Sony, Panasonic Corp, Sharp and Toshiba Corp all kept their full-year profit forecasts, underlying expectations of a swift recovery for the quake-hit companies. Sources also said Panasonic was selling its Sanyo Electric washing machine and refrigerator units in Japan and Southeast Asia to China's Haier Group Co for about $130 million. Following are some reactions from fund managers and analysts: ----------------------------------------------------------- RYOSUKE KATSURA, SENIOR ANALYST, MIZUHO SECURITIES "Sanyo Electric's deficit is serious, and I believe tackling the performance of Solar batteries and devices for example are some of the major tasks for Panasonic." "There are plenty of other issues to be dealt with apart from selling the white goods business to Haier. What it plans to do with the digital camera business, and dealing with business overlap are also major issues that will have to be dealt with in throughout the rest of the year." "The restructuring of Sanyo electric is the biggest issue Panasonic faces, but other aspects such as the semiconductor business also needs attention." "The effects of US/European FX rates will be felt, but the internal fundamentals are a larger issue for Panasonic." ----------------------------------------------------------- SHIGEO SUGAWARA, SENIOR INVESTMENT MANAGER, SOMPO JAPAN NIPPONKOA ASSET MANAGEMENT "The LCD market itself is becoming weaker, so it is not that surprising that (Sony) had to reduce its LCD television sales forecast. "However as a goal, I believe its a very good decision. For Sony, the LCD Television business is a major front, so what it plans to do with this division is vital. On Toshiba "Naando sales are lower than expected; If this trend continues its basic annual revenue predictions may have to be altered, is one impression I am getting. Of course there was the effects from the earthquake, but the impression I am getting is that this is more than production-line disruptions." ----------------------------------------------------------- YOJI TAKEDA, HONG KONG-BASED FUND MANAGER AT RBC ASIA EQUITY FUND "(Japanese tech companies) are facing a lot of competition and also the strong currency. Competition is globally from Korean and Chinese and also the Americans." "Important thing is that they have to come up with competitive products. The TV market is a very tough market because nobody is really making money and there is a lot of capacity available right now." ----------------------------------------------------------- (Reporting by Saeed Azhar in SINGAPORE; Editing by  Anshuman Daga )
