 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ), facing rising costs and tougher competition, plans to trim its expansion through next year because of a slowing U.S. economy and softening travel demand, its chief executive said on Wednesday. 

 Southwest, the leading U.S. discount carrier, intends to adjust its route schedule and reduce its planned fleet expansion by 15 aircraft, CEO Gary Kelly said during a company conference with analysts. The measures would lead to capacity growth of about 6 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and in 2008, down from a planned increase of about 8 percent. The smaller expansion, as well as new business initiatives that Southwest hopes will add more than $1 billion to annual revenue by 2010, should help it meet its target of 15 percent annual earnings growth in the future, though the changes will likely be too late for this year, Kelly said. "Our model isn't broken. It's just a little bent," he said. Southwest, which is often credited with inventing the low-cost airline model, has gotten off to a slow start this year, buffeted by tougher competition, higher fuel costs, and softening demand for air travel. The company, which flies only Boeing ( BA.N ) 737 aircraft, may return leased planes, defer deliveries, or sell some jets to slow its fleet growth. The No. 6 U.S. airline left open the possibility of a further slowdown in growth. "We could find that that growth rate is a little bit too fast," said Kelly. 'BREATHING SPACE' Slower growth could help Southwest reduce capital expenses and lower operating costs, which have been rising as its fuel hedges expire and because the company pays some of the highest wages in the industry. The slower expansion at Southwest is good news for rivals like AMR Corp.'s AMR.N American Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc. ( DAL.N ), but could lead to higher fares for consumers. "It's the equivalent of the biggest, baddest guy on the block backing off," said airline consultant Robert Mann. "It gives (traditional carriers) a little more breathing space. It may give them a little more pricing power." After sluggish revenue growth in the first quarter, as measured against seats available, the company expects unit revenues and earnings to decline in the second quarter. But it is hopeful for a pickup in the second half and said on Wednesday that bookings for July and August are strong. 'READY TO KICK TAIL' To combat rising fuel costs and offset its high wage bill, Southwest plans to start generating revenue from sources other than selling plane tickets. These initiatives, some of which are expected to be rolled out by the end of 2007, could include charging for assigned seats, offering in-flight Internet, and selling hotel rooms through its Web site. Dallas-based Southwest is optimistic about the new revenue sources and a renewed focus on attracting business travelers, which will include a new advertising campaign. "We're ready to kick tail," said Kelly. Southwest shares, which have fallen about 8 percent over the last 12 months, were up 18 cents or 1.2 percent to $14.82 in afternoon trade on Wednesday, the 30th anniversary of its listing on the New York Stock Exchange.
