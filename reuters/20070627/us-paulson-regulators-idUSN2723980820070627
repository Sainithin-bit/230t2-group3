 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson is launching an internal review to recommend changes to the regulatory system to reduce legal and regulatory burdens for U.S. businesses, The Wall Street Journal Online reported on Wednesday. 

 Possible moves could include consolidation of some regulators with overlapping responsibilities, such as the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Journal said, citing Treasury officials. The Treasury-led review will make recommendations by early next year and is expected to be announced at a Journal conference in New York later on Wednesday. It would establish a framework for an eventual overhaul of the regulatory system, most likely after Paulson leaves office, according to the report. The department's press office did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
