 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Video rental chain Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N said on Wednesday it settled a patent dispute with rival Netflix Inc. ( NFLX.O ) that challenged Blockbuster's entry into online DVD rental, but it signaled that the new business was taking a toll on its finances. 

 Although terms of the settlement were not disclosed, shares in Netflix jumped more than 6.3 percent to $20.76 in early trading while Blockbuster slipped 1 percent to $4.17. Blockbuster also disclosed in a securities filing on Wednesday that it plans to seek an amendment to its August 20, 2004 credit agreement that would lower earnings requirements. Blockbuster said in the filing that it plans to modify its popular Total Access plan before the end of the year to "strike the appropriate balance between continued subscriber growth and enhanced profitability." In April, Blockbuster Chief Financial Officer Larry Zine said the company was contemplating seeking changes to the credit agreement to give the company flexibility to grow the online service as fast as possible this year. The amendment would be the fifth that Blockbuster has obtained from its creditors since it started the online rental service in August of 2004. Blockbuster has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into building and promoting its online service -- now the fastest-growing in the U.S. market -- as the $9 billion rental industry has seen in-store rental revenues decline. Blockbuster has said it is aiming for its online service to be profitable in 2008. JP Morgan analyst Barton Crockett said Wednesday's developments were "consistent with our thesis that competition will remain stiff, constraining Netflix's growth." Blockbuster will not make changes to its Web site or business model as a result of the patent lawsuit settlement, a spokeswoman said. Nor will the settlement have "any material effect on our financial performance," Blockbuster spokeswoman Karen Raskopf said. "We have no ongoing obligations to Netflix and we can put this matter behind us," Raskopf said. A Netflix spokesman declined comment. Netflix sued Blockbuster last year, claiming its larger rival had stolen its system for placing movie selections in a "queue" and its business method for charging subscribers a monthly fee to select and rent DVDs from its Web site. Blockbuster countersued Netflix on fraud and antitrust claims and said Netflix's patents were so broad as to be unenforceable. Terms of the settlement were confidential, both companies said on Wednesday. Legal experts had said that if Netflix had prevailed in litigation, it could have forced Blockbuster and any other competitor in the fast-growing online rental industry to pay licensing fees or build an entirely new model.
