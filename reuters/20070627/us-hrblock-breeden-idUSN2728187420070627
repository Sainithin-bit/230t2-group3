 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Richard Breeden, a hedge fund investor and former chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, on Wednesday said he plans to seek three board seats at H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ), citing disappointment in the largest U.S. tax preparer's financial performance. 

 Breeden Capital Management LLC, which said it controls 1.86 percent of H&R Block shares, plans to nominate Breeden and two others for election to H&R Block's 11-person board at the company's September 6 annual meeting. Now an activist investor, Breeden complained that H&R Block shareholders have suffered as the company has strayed into areas outside tax preparation, its largest and best-known business, and lost money in such areas as subprime mortgage lending. "After five years of persistent and substantial underperformance, some new members who aren't tied to decisions made in the past would help," Breeden said at a conference in New York. "If you're underperforming the market for one year, two years, three years, five years, something's wrong." The news sent shares of H&R Block up as much as 6.8 percent. In afternoon trading, they were up 88 cents, or 4 percent, at $22.88, after earlier rising to $23.50. In a statement, Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block said it has met with Breeden and others at his firm several times, and welcomes input from all shareholders. Through Tuesday, shares of H&R Block had fallen 3.3 percent in the last five years, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  was up 50.6 percent. BREEDEN TO PUSH ASSET SALES Kelly Flynn, a UBS Securities analyst, called Breeden's move consistent with her expectation that H&R Block will face "mounting pressure" from shareholders to consider a recapitalization, or being acquired by a private equity firm. She said H&R Block could be worth $29 per share, excluding its mortgage unit, in a leveraged buyout. Breeden told CNBC television that H&R Block should sell some assets, including units unrelated to tax preparation. "Efforts to diversify into activities including subprime mortgage lending, securities brokerage and banking have resulted in substantial lost shareholder value," he said in a statement. For the fourth quarter ended April 30, H&R Block posted an $85.6 million loss, largely stemming from a write-down for its Option One Mortgage Corp. subprime lending unit. The quarter is normally H&R Block's most profitable, encompassing most of the main U.S. tax filing season. H&R Block is selling Option One to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management for as much as $800 million. The price is tied to the unit's value at the time of sale, which is expected to close in October. Breeden was chairman of the SEC from 1989 to 1993. Earlier this year, he won two seats on the board of Applebee's International Inc. APPB.O after complaining of poor performance at the casual dining restaurant chain. The proxy fight pushed Applebee's to consider selling the company. (Additional reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone  and  Dane Hamilton  in New York, and Savitha Kalyanaraman and Neha Singh in Bangalore)
