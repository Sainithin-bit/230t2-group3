 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policy-makers started a two-day meeting on Wednesday that is widely expected to lead to a decision to hold interest rates steady and a restatement of concerns about inflation. 

 The rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee began its fourth meeting of the year at about 2 p.m. (1800 GMT), a Fed official said. A statement outlining the committee's decision is due on Thursday at about 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT). The Fed is expected to hold its target for benchmark overnight borrowing costs steady at 5.25 percent, a level reached a year ago, and repeat that its main concern is that inflation fails to moderate as expected. Nevertheless, policy-makers may nod to recent data that shows price pressures outside food and energy ebbing. While the overall Consumer Price Index was up sharply in May, so-called core prices -- which exclude volatile food and energy prices -- rose just 0.1 percent. The Fed's favorite inflation indicator, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, showed a 2 percent year-on-year rise in April, the smallest in more than a year. Even so, the Fed has suggested a tight labor market could spark inflation, and unemployment was unchanged at a low 4.5 percent in May. Financial markets will scour the central bank's statement for any clues about how officials see risks facing the economy evolving to try to gauge whether interest rates are more likely to rise or fall in the months ahead. A government report on Wednesday that showed surprisingly weak May durable goods orders and suggested some softness in business investment plans will be one factor officials will consider.
