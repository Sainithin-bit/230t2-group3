 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The world is a less risky place these days, but that doesn't mean investors should stop preparing for bad times, Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) Chairman and Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said Wednesday. 

 Recent troubles in the U.S. mortgage market and fears that booming corporate lending has become reckless in recent months has prompted some investors to question whether the market is getting paid enough for taking risk. The spread between top grade and junk debt remains thin, as investors flush with cash snap up every kind of asset around the world. Speaking at a Wall Street Journal dealmakers conference, Blankfein said he remained optimistic about the state of the global economy and the ability of markets to price risk. "I think the world has become less risky," Blankfein said. "That doesn't mean that with hindsight we will find that risk was underappreciated." Blankfein, who rose to the top spot at the world's largest investment bank as a commodities trader, jokes that "nervous is my resting position." One of the most important jobs at Goldman, he told Reuters, is to manage risk and avoid problems. But amid a growing chorus of warnings that the recent boom in financial markets was nearing its peak, Blankfein said his view of the world was "generally positive." Goldman recently reported second-quarter results that show that it has extended more capital through loans and investments than ever before. And while Blankfein noted that the market sets the price of options and credit protection, he notes the market isn't always perfect. The odds of a hurricane striking doesn't change from day to day, he said, "but the day after a hurricane the price of insurance is higher. That's sentiment." He added, "There hasn't been a hurricane in the market for a long time." With that in mind, Blankfein said Goldman Sachs "is positioning the organization like the market is undervaluing risk. We are in a high state of nervousness."
