 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting U.S.-made manufactured goods tumbled sharply in May, the government said on Wednesday, raising doubts about the strength of the factory sector and business expansion plans. 

 Orders for durable goods, items meant to last at least three years, slid a larger-than-expected 2.8 percent after a 1.1 percent April rise, a Commerce Department report showed. It was the first drop since January and reflected weak demand for a wide array of products, including goods businesses need to expand. Separate reports showed Midwest factory activity slipped slightly in May, while U.S. mortgage applications fell last week for the second straight week as interest rates held near recent highs and made home buying more expensive. "The May durable goods report indicates that business decision-makers remain uncertain about the short-term prospects for U.S. economic growth," said Cliff Waldman, an economist for the Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI. Wall Street economists had expected orders to fall just 1 percent and the data initially boosted prices for U.S. government bonds and weighed on stocks and the dollar. Stocks bounced back into positive territory as oil price rises boosted demand for energy companies and as investors bought beaten-down shares after a three-day slide. The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day up more than 90 points, or 0.68 percent, at 13,427.73. Treasury prices turned lower on the late rally in stocks. The report clouded the picture of a manufacturing sector revival painted by other recent data. The Institute of Supply Management had said earlier this month that factory activity rose to its highest level in more than a year in May. In a worrisome sign for business investment plans, nondefense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, seen as a proxy for business spending, slipped a larger-than-expected 3 percent, the biggest drop since January. Economists had expected just a 0.1 percent decrease. "This tells us is that businesses are spending with caution," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. "They are definitely not expanding production capacity within the United States. They may be doing so at their production facilities outside the U.S." WORRIES ON GROWTH Flagging business investment would add to the uncertain recovery of the housing market as another question mark for the economy's ability to bounce back convincingly from a sluggish 0.6 percent annual growth rate in the first three months of 2007, as many analysts have anticipated. Reports earlier this week showed sales of existing U.S. homes slipped 0.3 percent to their lowest level in four years in May, while new home sales dropped 1.6 percent. Federal Reserve officials were certain to discuss both the stress in the housing market and the direction of business spending at a two-day meeting on Wednesday and Thursday that was widely expected to end with a decision to hold interest rates steady. Early this year they had worried about anemic business investment, but more recently had grown cautiously optimistic that strong corporate profits and favorable financial conditions would offer support. Weakness in volatile aircraft orders was one factor behind the drop in overall orders. Demand for civilian aircraft and parts tumbled 22.7 percent, pulling transportation equipment orders down 6.8 percent. Even excluding transportation orders, durable goods orders declined by 1 percent as manufacturing, machinery, metals and electrical equipment orders fell.
