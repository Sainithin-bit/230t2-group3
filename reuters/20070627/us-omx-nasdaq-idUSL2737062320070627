 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Sweden's government will review a proposed takeover of Nordic bourses owner OMX OMX.ST by Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) over worries companies could be forced to obey U.S. stock market rules, an official said on Wednesday. 

 OMX, which is 6.6 percent held by the government, has accepted the offer, worth around $3.4 billion based on Nasdaq's closing share price on Tuesday, and has said tougher U.S. regulations will not apply to trading or companies listed in the region. "The government has not taken a position," Mia Widell, spokeswoman for Financial Markets Minister Mats Odell said. "Part of what we are looking at is whether this will have any impact on the Swedish model for rules and oversight of the bourse," she said. Widell said the government would give its response "in good time before the bid runs out." It is not clear if the government, which has parliamentary permission to sell its holding in OMX as part of Sweden's biggest-ever privatization campaign, could block the deal. "I don't think the state wants to stop the deal; they would need more than 6.6 percent to stop a merger," said Karl Berglund, analyst at ABG Sundal Collier. "I think the whole thing is about making sure that OMX continues to operate under European rules. It is natural for the state to undertake a review before they sell. That would have happened whoever had bid for OMX." Shares in OMX were down 2.87 percent at 203 crowns at 0833  GMT. "Today's fall in the share can also partly be explained by the fact that OMX has traded above the level of the bid for a while, something which sooner or later will be reversed," ABG's Berglund said, adding the bid was worth 197 crowns per share. With a flurry of consolidation activity in the bourse sector, including a bid by the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) for Italy's Borsa Italiana, OMX has been trading above Nasdaq's bid level on hopes of a counterbid. ASSURANCES OMX repeated it had received assurances from the United States that regulatory oversight would not be affected. "We at OMX have been very clear that there is not any danger that U.S. rules can influence markets here," an OMX spokeswoman said, adding the government had said all along it would look at all aspects of selling state assets. Earlier this month OMX chairman Urban Backstrom and Chief Executive Magnus Booker said the Nordic group had held talks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and that the agency had confirmed that trading and listing on OMX bourses would not fall under SEC jurisdiction. OMX owns and operates stock exchanges in Stockholm, Helsinki, Copenhagen, Reykjavik and the Baltic states.
