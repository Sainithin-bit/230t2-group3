 LONDON  (Reuters) - Private equity firms, already under fire by politicians for their tax breaks and borrowing levels, expect their risks to escalate on yet another front -- the courtroom. 

 Almost half (47 percent) of 170 private equity professionals surveyed by Marsh, a unit of the world's largest insurance broker Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. ( MMC.N ), said they expected to defend against more legal action over the next two years. Only 6 percent said they expected less legal action. The buyout industry has been under attack this year by unions and politicians in both the United States and Britain because of firms' ever-larger acquisitions of household names such as the $22 billion takeover of UK pharmacy chain owner Alliance Boots AB.L by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL. Criticism has ranged from job cuts to tax loopholes and has included the amount of leverage used in deals. The mere fact that the secretive firms have been pushed from the business pages to the front page was seen by half the respondents in the survey as a likely contributor to increased litigation. "With the spotlight firmly on the industry, change is afoot," Marsh said in its study. "Though securities litigation in the United States has dropped nearly 45 percent in the last two years ... some insurers have observed a doubling of litigation involving private equity." Private equity firms borrow heavily against funds raised from institutional investors to buy companies and then sell them within three to five years. Regulators were expected by the firms to be the likeliest to bring lawsuits in the future, but so far it has been minority shareholders of the companies owned by private equity that have been suing most often. The survey also found that while emerging markets, which are seeing increased private equity investment, are believed to be less susceptible to lawsuits, the continued application of Western practices in them will lead to more litigation. Insurance companies have reacted to the growing fears. In 2004, only five offered specialized private equity liability coverage, Marsh said, but now 15 do.
