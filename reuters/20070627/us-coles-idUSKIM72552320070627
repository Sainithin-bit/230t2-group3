 MELBOURNE/TOKYO  (Reuters) - Buyout firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) has become the latest to pull out of a consortium bidding for Australian retailer Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX, a source said, further boosting the prospects of rival suitor Wesfarmers Ltd. WES.AX 

 Investors pushed Wesfarmers' shares up as much as 1.7 percent on hopes its A$19.7 billion ($16.7 billion) offer for the troubled supermarket chain will be successful. Wesfarmers shares ended in negative territory amid a broader market selloff. If it succeeds, the takeover would be the largest in Australian corporate history. Coles shares fell 1.45 percent to close A$16.28, below Wesfarmers' A$16.47 offer price, as investors speculated the Perth-based company would face little competition. The status of the private-equity consortium has been in doubt for a week, with speculation focusing on the prospect of Blackstone and the Carlyle Group CYL.UL pulling out, leaving only fellow U.S. private equity firm Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL. A source told Reuters on June 21 that the three firms were likely to withdraw, but a spokesman for the consortium and Coles denied it at the time. Blackstone and Coles declined to comment on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for the consortium also declined comment. Three other members of the original consortium of six, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL, pulled out in late May, citing concerns about the costs involved in turning around Coles' core supermarkets business. Senior TPG executives were due to make presentations at a partner conference in Aspen, Colorado, on Tuesday, about whether to lodge a bid for Coles. Last year, TPG led a group that bought Coles' chain of Myer department stores, and has since boosted profits there by 80 percent. Coles has set a deadline of 9 a.m. local time (2300 GMT) on June 30 for binding offers for all or part of the company. It is being advised by Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and Carnegie Wylie. POOR PERFORMANCE Coles put itself up for sale in February after poor performance at its food and liquor business, and has been consistently losing market share to larger rival Woolworths Ltd. ( WOW.AX ) and to smaller independent supermarkets. If Wesfarmers becomes the only bidder, the other alternative for Coles would be to break itself up, but that would delay the sale process and add complexity. The auction has already dragged on for months, with analysts saying the uncertainty has hurt Coles' operations. "Coles' core supermarkets and liquor business is definitely under pressure. You speak to suppliers and competitors, they haven't seen any change other than a deterioration," said BT Financial analyst Sondal Bensen. "That's the other risk in terms of delay for the board. They can't afford to wait too long." Woolworths is expected to lodge a solo bid for Coles' business supplies chain Officeworks and either of the discount store chains Target or Kmart, whichever chain it receives competition approval for. Woolworths cannot bid for the entire group because of competition concerns, and talks on a joint bid with TPG broke down last week. If Coles and its advisers decide on the break-up option, they could also consider a private-equity partner for the food and liquor business, along the lines of recent similar deals in the Australian market. "I'm not sure that Coles is that excited by a break-up option, but that doesn't mean they're not going to match people to get a total proposal where value can be created," said one source close to the situation. Wesfarmers said on Monday it is considering increasing the scrip part of its offer to make it more attractive to Coles' large retail shareholder base by offering more capital gains tax relief. Any private-equity bid would have to pay a higher price because it could not offer the capital gains rollover relief to shareholders. ($1=A$1.18)
