 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Carlyle Group CYL.UL, a U.S. private equity firm, is considering a stock market listing similar to last week's initial public offering by rival Blackstone ( BX.N ), Dow Jones Newswires reported on Wednesday. 

 Jason Lee, Carlyle managing director and real estate division head in Asia, told Dow Jones that the firm had to consider listing its shares to be competitive. "The Blackstone IPO was highly successful. We are certainly evaluating that option as well," Lee was quoted as saying. "Our peers are obviously going to be accessing a huge amount of capital in the public market," he said, adding that there was no timetable for an IPO. On Tuesday, Blackstone units closed below the $31 price it fetched in its IPO last week, on investors concerns about the firm's lofty valuation and a bill in Congress that would raise the tax rate on the profits of publicly traded private equity firms to 35 percent from 15 percent.
