 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CommScope Inc. CTV.N agreed to buy rival communications equipment maker Andrew Corp. ANDW.O for about $2.6 billion, aiming to cut manufacturing costs and strengthen positioning with service providers, the companies said on Wednesday. 

 The deal comes nearly a year after Andrew rejected as inadequate an unsolicited $1.7 billion offer from CommScope. It also follows a wave of consolidation among large telecommunications operators, such as AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and BellSouth Corp. in late 2006. That trend has prompted equipment companies to follow suit to trim expenses and offer a broader set of technologies. CommScope's latest $15-a-share offer represents a 16 percent premium over Andrew's closing price on Tuesday. At least 90 percent will be paid in cash, the companies said. Andrew shares jumped 11.3 percent, or $1.46, to $14.44. CommScope shares fell 0.2 percent, or 13 cents, at $55.03. Investors had questioned Andrew's strategy after it terminated a merger agreement with ADC Telecommunications Inc. ADCT.O last year. Analysts said on Wednesday they did not expect ADC to make a rival bid. "Since then we have had the opportunity to work closely together to define the strategic rationale," Andrew Chief Executive Ralph Faison said regarding the success of CommScope's latest bid. "We feel confident in the strategic growth of the company, and the current offer represents full and fair value for Andrew shareholders," Faison told Reuters in an interview. LOWER COSTS FOR COPPER Executives said the combination would help trim material costs for making coaxial cable used by cable television and high-speed Internet services. "A lot of the stuff we do requires a great deal of materials, including copper and plastics," CommScope Chief Executive Frank Drendel said. The companies said the deal, expected to close by the end of 2007, would also help them diversify their customer base and strengthen their global distribution. Andrew's expertise in wireless technology and CommScope's strength in wireline made for a good fit, Drendel said. Lawrence Harris, an Oppenheimer analyst, agreed. "We believe that the combination of Andrew and CommScope is solid from a strategic perspective, creating a company with major positions in final-mile connections for wireless, enterprise, and cable networks," Harris said. Based on fiscal 2006 results, a combined company would have sales of around $3.8 billion. CommScope, based in Hickory, North Carolina, and Andrew, based in Westchester, Illinois, also expect savings excluding items of around $90 million to $100 million in the second year after the deal is completed. About $50 million to $60 million of savings are expected in the first full year. Transaction costs are expected to total around $70 million to $80 million in the first two years, the companies said. Andrew will become a wholly owned subsidiary of CommScope, with Drendel remaining chairman and CEO. In a separate statement on Wednesday, CommScope raised its second quarter revenue outlook to a range of $500 million to $510 million, from $490 million to $510 million, helped by increased consumer demand for faster Internet networks. CommScope also expects an operating margin of 15 percent to 16 percent, excluding items, compared with its previous forecast of 14.5 percent to 15.5 percent.
