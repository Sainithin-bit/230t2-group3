 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Lebanese private equity firm appears to have reached a deal to buy Nordstrom Inc.'s ( JWN.N ) Faconnable brand of upscale apparel and accessories, The New York Post reported on Wednesday. 

 The $200 million sale may result in job cuts, the Post said, citing unnamed sources. The report did not name the Lebanese firm. A Nordstrom spokeswoman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. Nordstrom shares closed at $50.20 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
