 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain said a the share swap and Arctic exploration deal struck between British oil major BP ( BP.L ) and Russia's Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) was commercial and there had been no political involvement by the government. 

 "It is a commercial deal between two companies," a spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron said on Monday. Relations between Britain and Russia have been cool since the 2006 killing of a Kremlin critic in London. The spokesman played down suggestions the tie-up indicated a diplomatic thaw. "The prime minister has made the point that our view is that there will be differences of opinion on specific issues between us and Russia, but there will also be areas where it is in our mutual interest to work together and we will do that," he said. The deal has also made waves across the Atlantic, where U.S. congressmen raised security concerns because BP is one of the largest energy suppliers to the U.S. military. Cameron's spokesman declined to comment on the congressmen's concerns, but said he was unaware of any communication between Cameron's office and the White House about the tie-up. He said British energy minister Chris Huhne attended Friday's signing ceremony for the deal in London only because he had been invited to attend by BP. Huhne said on Friday the deal could have huge benefits "not only for both companies but for the relationship between our countries." BP chief executive Bob Dudley said on Monday the company notified the U.S. government about the deal before it was announced but said it did not need U.S. approval.
