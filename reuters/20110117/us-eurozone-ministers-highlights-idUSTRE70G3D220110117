 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Following are comments by euro zone ministers and officials gathering for a meeting of members of the European single currency area in Brussels on Monday. 

 DUTCH FINANCE MINISTER JAN KEES DE JAGER "Economic reforms and fiscal consolidation should be continued. Markets want answers from us, in the short term and in the long term, to make sure that debt levels in the euro zone are sustainable. "If needed, we will stand ready with an emergency fund to assist a country that needs it. "The emergency fund, only, will not be a solution, we need fiscal consolidation." ON WHETHER THE FUND SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO BUY GOVERNMENT BONDS: "There is a lot of suggestion and speculation." "We have an emergency fund in place, we will look if it needs an increase... so as to have 700 billion euros available, instead of a lower amount." AUSTRIAN FINANCE MINISTER JOSEF PROELL "We have enough room to maneuver after the rescue package for Ireland." "I don't think we can spread the solidarity of the alliance into different groups, that's also the case for AAA (rated) countries. We have to consider how we can improve the efficiency of the system and that is possible with various measures. We have to discuss those. I see no acute need to expand." EUROGROUP PRESIDENT JEAN-CLAUDE JUNCKER "We won't make any decisions today."
