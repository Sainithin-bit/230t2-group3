 PARIS  (Reuters) - The rescue fund for troubled euro zone states needs to be replaced and reinforced, and a draft agreement on the revised form it should take should be in place by March, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday. 

 Euro zone countries are in agreement on the broad principles for updating the European Financial Stability Fund, Lagarde told Europe 1 radio. "It needs to be replaced and reinforced. We have started talks...and agree on the big principles, we are looking at how it could be applied," she said. The EFSF can borrow on the market with euro zone government guarantees of up to 440 billion euros ($585 billion). But because it wants to maintain a triple A credit rating, the effective amount it can lend to countries in need is only around 250 billion euros, which would not be enough to cover requests for outside help from Portugal and Spain. "We need a global solution. We can't have a little hike here and some flexibility there, a reinforcement of discipline. We will need a complete package and I hope that we will submit one in March," Lagarde said. The European Commission and the European Central Bank called last week for boosting the effective capacity of the EFSF as well as expanding its scope of operations. Germany, the biggest euro zone economy, is key to any agreement on changes. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday any further measures to stabilize the euro could only be introduced within a complete strategic package also aiming for stronger economic coordination. "We are working in concert with Germany and I am working in tight collaboration" with Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble," she said. "I think, like him, that there is no point in making announcements bit by bit." Schaeuble on Monday ruled out bolstering the size of the EFSF. "The rules agreed on (for the fund) remain in force and whoever wants to change them ... has to get the laws changed by the German Bundestag -- just as with the other national parliaments," he said.
