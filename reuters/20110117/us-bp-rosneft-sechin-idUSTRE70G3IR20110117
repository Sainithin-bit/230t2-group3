 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - BP's $16 billion share swap with state-controlled Rosneft means energy tsar Igor Sechin has delivered on one of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's boldest dreams: taking Russia's national champions global. 

 The deal, which gives Rosneft a 5 percent stake in BP, cements both Deputy Premier Sechin's position at the peak of world energy politics and his clout as Putin's top dealmaker. By luring BP to jointly develop vast offshore oil and gas reserves, Sechin gives Rosneft a foothold among the global titans where the Kremlin believes the destiny of its national champions lies. "Russia has been looking to internationalize its national champions and this is the biggest example so far," said Roland Nash, who helps manage $140 million at Verno Capital in Moscow. Nash said Putin and Sechin believe that Russia's national champions need to go global and that more such deals can be expected in places like China and the Middle East. "Russia wants to position itself between East and West, that is its natural position, and building out these strategic relationships using its national champions is a classic way of building out that influence," said Nash. Sechin, 50, has a made a career by delivering on Putin's wishes and is viewed by diplomats as the leader of a powerful clan of ex-security service officers who crave to restore the clout of the Russian state at home and abroad. In a Reuters interview last June, Sechin dismissed the idea that he led the "siloviki" -- or men of power -- saying he was simply a patriot who had unexpectedly ended up in the Kremlin. But the BP deal shows the former Soviet military interpreter has a knack for pulling off the unexpected: an alliance with BP less than three years after Robert Dudley, now BP CEO, fled Russia during a row with local shareholders in TNK-BP. Dudley ran BP's Russian joint venture TNK-BP at the time. "This comes from Putin. He has always been a champion of interconnection," said a senior Western banker with long experience of Russia. "It's a brilliant implementation by Sechin of his master's ideas: To interconnect but keep control." "Sechin has been underrated in terms of his tactical and long-term thinking," added the banker. "I wonder how much longer people are going to continue to underrate him." PUTIN'S DEALMAKER Putin blessed the deal on Friday at his residence outside Moscow at a meeting with Sechin, Dudley, Rosneft CEO Eduard Khudainatov and Putin's deputy chief of staff, Yuri Ushakov. But it was Sechin -- who is also Rosneft board chairman -- who took the lead in hammering out the deal with BP, preferring to use Rosneft's own executives he hired from Morgan Stanley. No outside investment bank was used by Rosneft, while BP used Philip Lambert, a London energy boutique. "The deal came to life because Igor Ivanovich (Sechin) has a pretty good mutual understanding with top managers of BP," a senior industry source, who requested anonymity, told Reuters. After Putin stepped down as president in March 2008, Sechin came out of the shadows to oversee Russia's energy sector, the world's biggest. "Global capital and Russian companies are clearly ready to invest in world class projects in Russia; and Russian companies are quickly emerging at the forefront of the global energy industry," Sechin said of the deal. BP -- at least for now -- gets a direct line to Putin, Russia's paramount leader, while Russia secures the technology it needs to develop the offshore reserves that will drive Russian oil production in a decade's time. A soft-spoken manner belies Sechin's fearsome reputation as capable of crushing any opponent. An industry source bushed off talk that Russian shareholders in TNK-BP would dare to question a transaction approved by Putin and Sechin. "If Igor Ivanovich has made his decisions, it means the all other options are probably off the table," the source said.
