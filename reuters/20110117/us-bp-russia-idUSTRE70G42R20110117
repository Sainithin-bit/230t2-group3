 (Reuters) - Russia's largest oil producer, state-owned Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ), and British oil major BP ( BP.L ) have struck a deal to swap shares and jointly develop Russia's Arctic offshore, making BP the first foreign company to be granted access the prized Russian oil frontier. 

 Following are BP's energy projects with Russian firms: BP, ROSNEFT SHARE SWAP AND ARCTIC JV * On Friday, BP and Rosneft announced they would swap shares and form a joint venture to explore and develop three Arctic license blocks on Russia's continental shelf. * BP will swap 5 percent of its own shares, valued at around $7.8 billion, for a 9.5 percent stake in Rosneft, giving the British oil major a total 10.8 percent stake. * BP has committed to funding the lion's share of the initial exploration stage, or $2 billion, for the joint Arctic venture in Russia's Kara Sea. The companies estimate this has potential equivalent to that of the UK's North Sea. * The share swap adds to BP's 2006 investment in Rosneft when it invested $1 billion in its initial public offering. EUROPEAN DOWNSTREAM PARTNERSHIP WITH ROSNEFT * In October 2010 Rosneft became a joint owner with BP in four Ruhr Oel refineries in Germany that have a combined capacity of 1.04 million barrels per day. Rosneft purchased the 50 percent stake in the refineries from BP's former partner, the Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA. TNK-BP * In 2003 BP tied up with Russian firm TNK, owned by a quartet of Russia-connected billionaires, to create Russia's No. 3 oil producer TNK-BP TNBPI.RTS. The Russian joint venture, which produces 1.95 million barrels of oil a day, makes up one quarter of BP's total production. * BP's new chief executive, Robert Dudley, was chief executive of TNK-BP from the company's inception until 2008, when he had to flee Russia during a dispute with TNK-BP's oligarch partners. BP accused its partners of being corporate raiders who were trying to grab control of the venture while the Kremlin stood idly by. The conflict has since been resolved. * BP nominated its former CEO, Tony Hayward, who was ousted from his position for his handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, to TNK-BP's board of directors in July. * TNK-BP's subsidiary RUSIA Petroleum is in bankruptcy proceedings over its largest gas asset, the giant Kovyka field in East Siberia, after the company was unable to strike a gas supply deal with Russian energy giant and gas export monopoly Gazprom ( GAZP.MM ). The gas from Kovykta was meant to supply China. OFFSHORE SAKHALIN * In 1998 BP and Rosneft formed a joint venture Elvari NefteGaz, to explore for oil and gas off the coast of Russia's far east island of Sakhalin. BP owns 49 percent in Elvari, and Rosneft 51 percent. * No significant discoveries led the JV to curtail its drilling program -- and BP to close its Sakhalin office -- in 2008. The JV is now only focused on geological exploration. (Compiled by Jessica Bachman; editing by  Alexander Smith )
