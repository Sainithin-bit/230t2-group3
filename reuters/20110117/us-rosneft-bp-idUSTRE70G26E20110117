 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's largest oil firm, Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ), expects many future Arctic oil projects to require technology partnerships similar to the firm's recent tie-up with BP ( BP.L ), Rosneft's vice president said on Monday. 

 Peter O'Brien also said Rosneft would need to buy a small number of its own shares on the market to complete a share swap with BP in which it will swap 9.5 percent of its stake in exchange for 5 percent of BP. "It is a small fraction of our one-day traded volume ... it will not affect the market," O'Brien said on an analyst conference call. Although Rosneft and BP are committed to going after oil first, O'Brien said there is also "huge potential" for gas in the three Arctic license blocks in the Kara Sea that the companies agreed on Friday to jointly explore and develop. He also said both companies are discussing the fiscal workings of their Arctic oil exploration and production project on the most senior level in the Russian government. "(Talks) are encouraging. They take some time to work through. But as commercial production is seen near the end of the decade, any changes do not impact or present risks to the near-term profiles for the Finance Ministry," said O'Brien. "It makes a lot of sense for all sides," said O'Brien. (Writing by Jessica Bachman; Editing by Toni Vorobyova)
