 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - China's President Hu Jintao said he sees "signs of relaxation" in tensions between North and South Korea. 

 "Thanks to joint efforts by China and other parties, there have been signs of relaxation," Hu said in a written exchange with two U.S. newspapers, the Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post. Hu, who will visit Washington this week, also said he was convinced "an appropriate solution to the Korean nuclear issue" could be found, a reference to North Korea's nuclear arms programs.
