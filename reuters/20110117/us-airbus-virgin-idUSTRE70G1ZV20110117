 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - Virgin America unveiled a $5 billion plane order with Airbus on Monday that included the 10,000th aircraft to be sold in the planemaker's 40-year history. 

 The airline became the first firm customer for a revamped model of Airbus' top-selling A320 passenger jet. British entrepreneur Richard Branson, who owns a minority stake in the carrier, announced the deal in Toulouse where it helped push Airbus over the finishing line against Boeing in an annual contest for plane orders. The order is for 60 Airbus A320 jets including 30 with newer engines known as the A320neo. The upgrade aims to prolong the life of the A320 by offering 15 percent fuel savings for operators of the 150-seat, medium-distance plane. The deal expands a provisional order announced at the Farnborough air show last July for 40 A320 single-aisle passenger planes, plus options for 20 more. Since then, Airbus has started offering the greener A320neo at a higher price. Airbus last week announced the world's largest potential plane order by volume from India's IndiGo, including 150 A320neo jets, but that contract has not yet been finalized.
