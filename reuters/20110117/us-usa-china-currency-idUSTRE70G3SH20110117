 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A group of senators, on the eve of Chinese President Hu Jintao's arrival in the United States, said the time has come for congressional action on China's currency policies. 

 Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said Beijing's currency practices give Chinese companies an unfair trade advantage and have acted like "a boot on the throat" of U.S. economic recovery. Hu arrives in Washington on Tuesday for a state visit with President Barack Obama and also is expected to meet with senior members of Congress. Schumer and many other lawmakers have complained for year about China's currency practices. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; editing by  Bill Trott )
