 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP's ( BP.L ) billionaire partners in TNK-BP TNKBP.UL are examining whether the London-based oil major's share swap and arctic exploration deal with Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ) violates the terms of their partnership, British newspapers reported on Monday. 

 The Times and Financial Times said AAR, the vehicle by which four Russia-connected oligarchs own half of TNK-BP, had understood the joint venture agreement meant BP would only pursue new ventures in Russia via TNK-BP. BP and AAR were not immediately available for comment. BP has had operations in Russia outside of TNK-BP since the joint venture was formed in 2003, including offshore exploration with Rosneft around Sakhalin Island in east Russia. BP and Rosneft signed their tie-up late on Friday.
