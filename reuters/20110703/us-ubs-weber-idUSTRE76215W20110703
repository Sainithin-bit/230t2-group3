 ZURICH  (Reuters) - One of the most important tasks facing Axel Weber as UBS's next chairman will be to press on with a change of generations in the Swiss bank's management, he told a Sunday magazine. 

 UBS, Europe's largest wealth manager by assets, named Weber, the former Bundesbank head, as its next chairman on Friday. The surprise move robs rival Deutsche Bank of a top candidate to replace chief executive Josef Ackermann in 2013. "It will be one of my most important tasks to contribute to preparing the bank for the future and pushing ahead with the generation change," Weber told German magazine Der Spiegel. Weber's comments come as speculation swirls about how long Chief Executive Oswald Gruebel will remain as head of the Swiss bank. Like current chairman Kaspar Villiger, Gruebel was brought back from retirement to clean up the bank. Weber said in the interview he took the job because UBS made him an excellent offer. "There were never any other formal contract negotiations or offers," Weber was quoted as saying in the interview. Weber, who will be the first non-Swiss to head the bank, will get a basic salary of 1.5 million Swiss francs ($1.78 million) as vice-chairman, as well as 150,000 UBS shares, which he won't be able to sell for four years. As chairman, Weber's salary will rise to 2 million Swiss francs and 200,000 UBS shares, also locked in for four years. As a one-off payment on joining the board in 2012 Weber will also get 2 million francs and 200,000 shares, locked in for a year. UBS said it would nominate Weber to the board at the annual general meeting in May 2012, and that he was expected to take over from 70-year-old Villiger in 2013.
