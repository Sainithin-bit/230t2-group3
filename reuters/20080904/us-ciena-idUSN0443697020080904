 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. communications equipment maker Ciena Corp ( CIEN.O ) slashed its revenue outlook on Thursday due to phone companies delaying purchases amid a weak economy, triggering a 24 percent fall in its shares. 

 The company, which posted a 59 percent drop in quarterly profit, warned that many phone service providers were delaying orders as they reconsidered their capital spending plans. Ciena sells optical switches and other products that support Internet protocol networks to top U.S. phone companies such as AT&T Inc ( T.N ), Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) and Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ). It said it did not think it was the only one suffering order delays, and its warning dragged down shares in other telecommunications equipment vendors like Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ), Alcatel-Lucent ( ALUA.PA ) and Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O. "The macroeconomic environment gives them a pause for thought, for greater capex scrutiny," Ciena Chief Executive Gary Smith said in a phone interview, adding that customers were not canceling projects or orders but taking more time in making purchase decisions. "I think they're just being prudent and reflective of the concerns in the global macroeconomic world." he said. Ciena forecast revenue in its current fiscal fourth quarter in a range of $190 million to $210 million, dramatically below the market's forecast of $264 million, according to Reuters Estimates. That would mean annual revenue growth of about 17 to 20 percent, compared to its previous forecast of up to 27 percent. MULTI-QUARTER SLOWDOWN Smith said Ciena believed the slowdown would be short-lived, "albeit multi-quarter." He declined to give a forecast on when customers might begin accelerating their purchases. RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue cut his price target on Ciena shares to $18.00 from a previous $25.00 target. Ciena shares tumbled $4.17 to $13.26, and are down 73 percent from their 2007 peak. "Approximately two more quarters of weakness is expected as Ciena works through the lack of urgency at key customers," Sue said. Bank of America analyst Tim Long, in a note to clients, called the outlook "terrible." He had forecast $272 million in fourth-quarter sales. But most agreed Ciena's results for the fiscal third quarter that ended July 31 were in line with expectations. Ciena reported quarterly profit fell to $11.7 million, or 12 cents a share, from $28.3 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings excluding special items slipped 4 cents a share to 37 cents, in line with the average Wall Street forecast. Third-quarter revenue rose 24 percent to $253.2 million, but total operating costs rose as well. Shares in French rival Alcatel-Lucent shares fell 5 percent in Paris. Cisco, the largest U.S. telecommunications equipment vendor, fell 4.3 percent to $22.31, while Juniper fell 6.1 percent to $23.66. Shares of phone service providers also fell, with Sprint down 5.7 percent, Verizon down 4 percent and AT&T down 2.25 percent. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek, Dave Zimmerman, Phil Berlowitz)
