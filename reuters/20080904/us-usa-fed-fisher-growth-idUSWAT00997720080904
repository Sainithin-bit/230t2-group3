 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve President Richard Fisher said on Thursday U.S. economic growth will expand sluggishly in coming quarters and cautioned that despite recent commodity price declines, it is too soon to put inflation worries to rest. 

 "I still envision anemic growth the next couple of quarters," he said in an interview with USA Today. "On the inflation outlook, we've had some very thorough retracements of prices on commodities," Fisher said. "I think we have to be careful not to get too excited about that. For one, they might not last." (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by Tom Hals)
