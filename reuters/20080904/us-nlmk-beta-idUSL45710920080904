 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Novolipetsk Steel ( NLMKq.L ), the Russian steel maker owned by billionaire Vladimir Lisin, has agreed to pay $400 million in cash to acquire U.S. hot-rolled steel maker Beta Steel and expand its presence in North America. 

 Novolipetsk, Russia's fourth-largest steel maker by volume, said on Thursday it would buy the Portage, Indiana-based company from a group of private shareholders to provide feed for another recent U.S. acquisition, steel pipe maker John Maneely Co. "Novolipetsk is trying its best to make its U.S. acquisitions vertically integrated and therefore less exposed to rising raw material input prices," UniCredit Aton metals analyst Marat Gabitov said. "It will increase profitability." Steel makers in Russia, the world's fourth-largest producer, have acquired around 10 percent of U.S. steel-making capacity in the last few years as they spend billions of dollars from record profits betting on steel demand in North America. The latest deal takes Novolipetsk's spending on U.S. assets to nearly $4 billion in the last month, after the $3.5 billion deal to acquire John Maneely Co announced on August 13. Beta Steel will supply hot-rolled steel for John Maneely's pipe mills. "This acquisition is fully in line with our commitment to develop a strong footprint in the U.S. high value-added finished steel market," Novolipetsk Steel's president and chief executive, Alexei Lapshin, said. The deal, which Novolipetsk will finance from existing funds and available credit lines, is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2008. RUSSIAN PRESENCE Russian steel makers, led by Severstal ( CHMFq.L ), Evraz Group HK1q.L and Novolipetsk, have spent over $13 billion buying up North American steel assets at relatively low prices due to the weaker dollar. The billionaire owners of these companies are now looking upstream to secure raw materials for their mills. Severstal this month agreed to buy coal miner PBS Coals Corp for $1.3 billion. Novolipetsk, or NLMK, said over 35 percent of Beta Steel's hot-rolled sheet output is currently sold to pipe and tube producers, including John Maneely's Atlas Tube division. NLMK said it planned to increase hot-rolled coil output at Beta Steel by tackling bottlenecks in its existing operations and supplying its own slabs for re-rolling. Rolling capacity is higher than steel melting capacity, so extra slabs are required. Beta Steel operates an electric arc furnace with an annual capacity of 800,000 short tons, or 725,000 metric tonnes, plus a hot-rolling mill with an annual capacity of 1.2 million short tons, or 1.1 million metric tonnes. The company sold 602,000 short tons (547,000 metric tonnes) last year, generating revenue of $324 million and earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $21 million. NLMK reported a first-half net profit of $1.53 billion, up 44 percent on the same period of 2007.  (Editing by Greg Mahlich)
