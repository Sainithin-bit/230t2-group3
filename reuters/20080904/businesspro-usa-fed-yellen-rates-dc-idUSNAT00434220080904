 SALT LAKE CITY, Utah  (Reuters) - San Francisco Federal 
Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said on Thursday that 
another cut to benchmark interest rates was unlikely, but 
cannot be completely ruled out. 

  Talking to reporters after a luncheon in Salt Lake City, 
Yellen said she still assumes the Fed's next move will be a 
rate increase at some indeterminate time. "I am reasonably 
comfortable" with policy at the moment, she said.  Still, the Fed could be forced to lower rates if the 
"adverse feedback loop" between rising unemployment, weak 
consumer spending, falling home prices and tight credit 
conditions were to worsen substantially, she said.  Yellen is not a voting member of the central bank's Federal 
Open Market Committee in 2008.  Yellen repeated that she is "reasonably confident" of 
inflation tapering off in 2009 and said her forecast was not 
dependent on a further sharp decline in commodity prices.  (Reporting by  Ros Krasny ; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
