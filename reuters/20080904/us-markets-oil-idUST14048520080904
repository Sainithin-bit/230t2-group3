 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures ended more than $1 lower on Thursday, despite government data showing a surprise drawdown in domestic crude stocks last week. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for October delivery settled down $1.46, or 1.34 percent, at $107.89 a barrel, after trading from $106.52 to $110.60. (Reporting by  Gene Ramos )
