 (Reuters) - Insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ) is considering forming a separate company to hold risky credit assets, which have caused it record losses in the past three quarters, the New York Post reported. 

 AIG is working with investment bank JPMorgan Chase to arrange the structure of the company, the Post said, citing people familiar with the matter. No one was available at AIG for immediate comment. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore, editing by Will Waterman)
