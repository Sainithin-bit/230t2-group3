 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - The International Association of Machinists, Boeing Co's largest labor union, said on Wednesday that its members rejected the plane maker's latest three-year contract offer and voted to walk off their jobs at midnight. 

 Nearly 27,000 Boeing workers will start a strike that will cost the company about $100 million in revenue per day as customers' planes sit idle on the production lines. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), mostly based in Boeing's commercial plane plants in the Seattle area, said 87 percent of its members voted to strike and 80 percent rejected Boeing's "best and final" offer. At least two-thirds of its members needed to vote to strike. (Reporting by Laura Myers; Editing by Kim Coghill)
