 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Securities regulators are locking horns with some of America's most powerful mutual funds and Wall Street players over plans to scrap requirements that money market funds hold investment-grade securities. 

 For years, the Securities and Exchange Commission allowed fund firms to buy only highly rated municipal bonds for money market funds but now the SEC is considering changing that rule in an effort to curb investors' reliance on credit ratings. Ironically, players like The Vanguard Group, one of the biggest in the $12.3 trillion mutual fund industry, want less freedom instead of more, arguing the SEC-mandated ratings offer would-be investors a sense of comfort. The SEC's plan would remove an important investor protection and weaken investment standards, and could pose a risk to the stability of the $3.5 trillion money market fund industry, Vanguard Chief Executive John Brennan said in a letter filed with the agency. The Securities Industry and Financial Market Association, a Wall Street lobbying group, said the ratings give investors faith in the funds and create standards for assessing credit risks. Michael Scofield, chairman of the board of trustees that oversees mutual fund firm Evergreen Investments, a mutual fund and asset management unit of Wachovia Corp WB.N, said eliminating the rating requirement would place an inappropriate burden on trustees of money market funds. Comments from SIFMA, Vanguard and others such as Target Mutual Funds are trickling in to the SEC, which has proposed 38 changes aimed at weaning Wall Street and investors off credit ratings. Other proposals include finding alternatives to establish net capital requirements for investment banks the SEC supervises. MONEY MARKET CHANGES CONTROVERSIAL But one of the more controversial is the plan to eliminate part of its rule that requires money market funds to hold securities with ratings in one of the top two investment grades from a major rating agency. Without the ratings, mutual funds and SIFMA warned that market participants would have to rely on vague standards and that it increases the possibility that different funds will apply varying standards of risk assessment. In order to make their bonds investment-grade, many tax-exempt debt issuers bought bond insurance and relied on the traditionally top-flight ratings of the insurance companies. When the three biggest agencies -- Moody's Investors Services ( MCO.N ), Fimalac SA's ( LBCP.PA ) Fitch Ratings and McGraw-Hill Cos Inc's MHP.N Standard and Poor's -- threatened to downgrade, or downgraded, the ratings of the companies in the winter, many bonds were abruptly ineligible to be held in money market funds. Some members of Congress and municipal bond issuers argued that the investment-grade requirement was unnecessary, given that even municipal bonds with low ratings have slim chances of default. SIFMA also said that substituting two new standards in the SEC's net capital rule for the ratings requirement would also create uncertainty. The SEC's comment period for the proposals closes on Friday and the agency's chairman has signaled that the new rules are a priority.
