 (Reuters) - U.S. and European air-safety regulators, concerned by potentially dangerous ice build-ups in the fuel systems of some long-haul jets, will issue new operating rules for about 220 Boeing ( BA.N ) 777 planes, people familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. 

 The mandatory safety directives apply only to planes with engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce PLC, which comprise about a third of the Boeing 777 fleet world-wide. But under prodding from British officials, Boeing will analyze whether similar precautionary measures should be extended to the rest of its 777 line, people familiar with the matter told the WSJ. The rules are expected to be released in the next few days. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore, editing by Will Waterman)
