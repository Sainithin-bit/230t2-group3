 NAGOYA, Japan  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp, the world's largest auto maker, said on Monday it will cut capital expenditure and auto production in an effort to cope with tanking global auto demand. 

 Toyota said it will shrink planned output capacity at its new plant in India, and cut capital expenditure in the next business year starting April 2009 to below 1 trillion yen ($11 billion). (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
