 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) expects December sales at existing stores to be weaker than the past two months, but it stood by its earnings forecast, helping its shares recover from a steep decline. 

 Shares of CVS had fallen more than 6 percent on Monday morning after rival Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit and again cut its store opening plans as shoppers trim their spending during the recession. "There is no question that the economy continues to be difficult and consumers are reacting with increasing caution," CVS Chief Executive Tom Ryan said in a statement. Ryan said it looked like December sales at stores open at least a year "will be well short" of the increases of 4.3 percent in October and 6.1 percent in November. CVS stood by a forecast it gave in October, calling for 2008 adjusted earnings of $2.42 to $2.47 per share, including the impact of its acquisition of Longs Drugs. Shares of CVS were down 1.8 percent at $26.48 after falling as low as $24.83 earlier in the session, while Walgreen was down 4.8 percent at $24.83.
