 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish bank shares rose on Monday after the government said it would inject 5.5 billion euro ($7.70 billion) into the country's three biggest lenders and moved to take majority ownership of the weakest one. 

 Bank of Ireland shares rallied by over a third to 97 cents and Allied Irish Banks jumped 26 percent to 2.1 euros as Ireland belatedly joined other European countries bailing out its financial sector. Each will get a capital boost in return for giving the state 25 percent of voting rights on major issues. Further government backed fund raisings are set to follow. "This is a good start," said Davy analyst Scott Rankin in a note. "This should help put a floor under the banks and get us into the New Year." Shares in Irish Life & Permanent, which did not receive a state investment, were up over 17 percent at 1.70 euros. IL&P said it has a lower risk lending book and so did not need help. ANGLO IRISH SHARES TUMBLE ON OUTLOOK A third recipient of government help, Anglo Irish Bank, will be majority owned by the state after the bailout. Its shares jumped 20 percent in early trade, but then reversed to stand as much as 30 percent lower, as investors raised concerns it may fare less well than the other two in future. "There is uncertainty out there as to what the writedowns at the bank will be," a Dublin-based trader said. "There is a sense that there may not be as much appetite amongst institutional investors for any Anglo rights issue as at the other two banks." Anglo Irish shares slid 20 percent by 8:26 a.m. EST to 28 euro cents, after rising as high as 42 cents earlier. The government announced late on Sunday it would make an initial investment of 1.5 billion euros in Anglo Irish, giving it control and a fixed annual dividend of 10 percent. Dublin said it would make further capital available if required. The government will also invest 2 billion euros each in market leaders Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish through preference shares paying 8 percent annual interest. Investors have been waiting for months for a bailout plan to match schemes in other countries. Pressure intensified last week after Anglo Irish revealed its former chairman had kept shareholders in the dark about 87 million euros worth of loans he had received from the lender. Irish finance minister Brian Lenihan told public broadcaster RTE the move was crucial to the health of the Irish economy and raised the possibility of consolidation in the sector. "We are dealing with a very difficult economic situation," he said. "Consolidation is something that may assist the banking sector but it's not as important as ensuring that the main banks ... are in a position to lend money and the public and international have confidence in them," he said. MORE CAPITAL, MORE LENDING Anglo Irish's new chairman Donal O'Connor said the state's commitment to make further capital available ensured his bank "will continue to be a sound and viable institution." Bank of Ireland and AIB are considering privately raising another 1 billion euros each, underwritten by the state. Brian Goggin, BoI chief executive, said the extra capital could come from issuance of new shares and/or preference shares. He and his counterpart at Allied Irish Bank said they were in talks with investors about how they could best raise cash. The plan will lift BoI's core tier 1 capital ratio to about 8 percent and increase Allied Irish's ratio to near 7.5 percent, both in line with European peers after recent recapitalizations. The ratios would rise by about another 1 percentage point if they raised the extra 1 billion euros. "We do feel this has a good chance of stabilizing the banks -- whilst the quantum is smaller than we had hoped for, the implicit guarantee that the Irish government will do what it takes should help the banks in the near term," said Alex Potter, analyst at Collins Stewart.
