 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ), the No. 3 U.S. drugstore chain, swung to a small quarterly profit on Thursday, as its shoppers filled more prescriptions despite the influx of cheap generic drugs at chains like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ). 

 Rite Aid, which plans to buy the U.S. Eckerd and Brooks chains from Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ), also stood by its fiscal 2007 financial forecasts. Shares of Rite Aid rose as much as 4.3 percent on the heels of the results before easing to a 2.2 percent gain at midmorning. Rite Aid earned $1.1 million but posted a loss of 1 cent per share for the fiscal third quarter, ended December 2, after paying preferred stock dividends. A year earlier, it posted a net loss of $5.2 million, or 2 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected Rite Aid to post a loss of 1 cent per share, according to Reuters Estimates. President and Chief Executive Mary Sammons said in a statement that Rite Aid continued to add prescriptions at its stores, showing that its renewed emphasis on customer service and operational changes within its pharmacy are paying off. The number of prescriptions filled in comparable Rite Aid drugstores rose 2.3 percent in the quarter, even as Wal-Mart and other stores offered $4 monthly prescriptions for generic drugs. Major drug chains such as Rite Aid and its larger rivals, Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) and CVS Corp. ( CVS.N ), have not matched that pricing. They assert that they can attract customers with convenient locations and services rather than price-cutting and that the overwhelming majority of their customers have insurance to cover much of their drugs' cost. Rite Aid, based in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, previously said sales rose 4.2 percent to $4.3 billion. As previously reported, same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose 3.4 percent. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 4.3 percent, and general merchandise same-store sales were up 1.9 percent. For fiscal 2007, Rite Aid still projects a net loss of $5 million to a net profit of $40 million, or a loss of 7 cents per share to a profit of 2 cents per share; sales of $17.4 billion to $17.65 billion; and a same-store sales increase of 2 percent to 4 percent. Analysts, on average, expect Rite Aid to post a profit of nil per share on revenue of $17.51 billion. The company also still expects capital expenditures of $450 million to $500 million, excluding proceeds from sale and lease-back transactions. Shareholders are set to vote on the Jean Coutu deal in January. If approved, the acquisition should close shortly after the company's fourth quarter ends on March 3, 2007. The deal would bring Rite Aid's store count to about 5,170, up from 3,322 stores at the end of the third quarter. It would still be the third-largest chain, behind Walgreen and CVS. On Thursday, Rite Aid said it was responding to a second request from the Federal Trade Commission for information on the Jean Coutu deal. Shares of Rite Aid were up 12 cents to $5.49 after rising as high as $5.60 in morning trading, their highest level since April 2004.
