 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Highland Capital, a hedge fund that is the second-largest shareholder in Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK plans to send a letter on Thursday to Delphi's board outlining a $4.7 billion capitalization plan for the company, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site. 

 That would counter a proposal from a group of investors led by Appaloosa Management and Cerberus Capital Management. Delphi, which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection, laid out a road map for reorganization on Monday that includes an investment of up to $3.4 billion from a private equity group, potential creditor recoveries and an executive succession plan. Appaloosa Management LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP are leading the group that will invest up in the auto parts maker, giving the investors a large stake when Delphi emerges from bankruptcy. Highland is expected to demand that Delphi's board treat shareholders equally in the recapitalization of the company and that there be a promise of broader representation on the board, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with Highland's plans. Highland estimates Delphi would be worth about $53 to $58 a share when it emerges from bankruptcy-court protection, the paper said. Highland, which holds a substantial amount of Delphi's debt, expects the company's value to increase in coming years as it begins operating with lower labor costs and an overall leaner structure, the WSJ said. The paper quoted a Delphi spokeswoman saying that the company "anticipated that there might be" opposition to the Appaloosa-Cerberus plan. "Not all parties will agree with all aspects of the plan" and she said dissenters will have a chance to voice concern in court, the paper said. Delphi was not immediately available for comment. Highland was not reachable for comment. Delphi's shares closed up 16 cents at $2.78.
