 LONDON  (Reuters) - European stocks and bonds traded in narrow ranges and the dollar slipped on Thursday ahead of U.S. data expected to give some clue to the key U.S. economy's direction. 

 Many markets were at diminished strength ahead of the Christmas and New Year holidays. Investors were eyeing the final reading of U.S. third- quarter gross domestic product at 1330 GMT and, more crucially, the Philadelphia Federal Reserves manufacturing survey for December, due at 1700 GMT. The direction of the U.S. economy -- specifically whether it can engineer a soft landing and whether interest rates will fall or rise -- is the key issue facing investors as they enter 2007. Surveys this week showed that most investors are banking on a benign global economic environment next year. The main risk is that the U.S. disappoints. The dollar softened against the euro ahead of the data. "If we get a disappointing figure in the Philly Fed, it could weigh on the dollar," said Niels From, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. The euro was up 0.16 percent at $1.3195  EUR=  and the dollar slipped 0.2 percent against the Japanese yen to 118.15 yen  JPY= The yen also hit a record low against the euro for a third consecutive day on expectations the Bank of Japan could skip raising rates to 0.5 percent in January. European shares shook off early weakness to be little changed. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  of top European shares was up around 0.1 percent. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  added 0.22 percent, edging further above 17,000 to its highest close in seven months. It closed up 36.79 points at 17,047.83 while the broader TOPIX index  .TOPX  rose 0.26 percent to 1,671.30. Euro zone government bonds opened slightly weaker but were generally flat. The 10-year bond EU10YT=RR was yielding 3.864 percent.
