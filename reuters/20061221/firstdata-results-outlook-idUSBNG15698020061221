  (Adds analyst comment, NEW YORK dateline) 

 NEW YORK  Dec 21 (Reuters) - First Data Corp. FDC.N
forecast 2007 earnings below Wall Street expectations on
Thursday, as analysts grapple with estimating results for the
company after it spun off Western Union Co. ( WU.N ) at the end
of September.  First Data's shares fell as much as 4.4 percent.   First Data said it sees 2007 earnings from continuing
operations of $1.20 to $1.26 a share, while analysts had on
average forecast results of $1.36, according to Reuters
Estimates.  "There was a good deal of confusion about what First Data
looks like as a standalone company," said Steve McSorley, an
analyst at Cathay Financial in New York.  For the fourth quarter, the Denver-based payment-processing
company expects to earn 33 cents to 35 cents a share, excluding
items, while for fiscal 2006 it expects to earn $1.08 to $1.10
a share, excluding items.  Analysts had forecast 34 cents for fourth quarter results.  The company plans to buy back an additional $450 million in
stock by the end of 2007, it said in a statement.  First Data's shares were down 42 cents at $24.48 in early
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after trading
as low as $23.80.
