 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - For at least a year, drug company Eli 
Lilly and Co. ( LLY.N ) provided information to doctors about the 
blood-sugar risks of its drug Zyprexa that did not match data 
that the company circulated internally when it first reviewed 
its clinical trial results, the New York Times reported on its 
Web site, citing company documents. 

  The Times said part of the information comes from a 
February 2000 memo sent to top Lilly scientists. The memo is 
one of hundreds of internal Lilly documents provided to The New 
York Times by a lawyer in Alaska who represents mentally ill 
patients, the paper said. Zyprexa is a drug for schizophrenia.  Eli Lilly was not immediately available for comment.  The New York Times said in response to questions about the 
difference between its first view of the data and its 
subsequent public description, Lilly issued a statement on 
Wednesday saying that later figures were accurate and the 
information in February 2000 was out of context.  In yesterday's statement, the company said that after the 
February 2000 memo, it re-examined its clinical trial results 
and found errors in its "final, standard quality check of the 
data," the New York Times reported.
