 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - ConAgra Foods Inc. ( CAG.N ) posted a 44 percent jump in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by improved operating margins and asset sales, and forecast full-year earnings above Wall Street expectations, sending the stock to a 21-month high. 

 The maker of Healthy Choice meals and Slim Jim beef sticks reported strong earnings from its consumer foods segment, with sales growth in products ranging from Swiss Miss hot chocolate to Hebrew National hot dogs. ConAgra has been closing factories, selling off brands and spending more on marketing to jump-start its businesses. The company said better-than-expected earnings in the first half of its fiscal year would allow it to further increase spending on marketing and innovations. Net income rose to $219.6 million, or 43 cents a share, in the fiscal second quarter ended November 26, up from $152.5 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results included several one-time items, such as a gain on the sale of an oat milling business. It also sold its refrigerated packaged meats business, an interest in a malt joint venture, and its Mama Rosa refrigerated pizza operation. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 40 cents per share. On that basis, analysts' average forecast was 33 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "Rapid expansion of our operating margins is helping build a solid foundation for the future," Gary Rodkin, chief executive officer, said in a statement. "Together with earlier-than-expected completion of key divestitures, this is providing a significant boost to our fiscal 2007 results." ConAgra's quarterly sales rose nearly 3 percent to $3.09 billion. CURBING ADDICTION Prudential analyst John McMillin said asset sales, share repurchases and margin improvement from cost-cutting efforts drove a faster-than-expected turnaround at ConAgra this year. "Still, the hard work of new CEO Gary Rodkin is just starting, and that includes building and growing branded (food) positions," he wrote in a note to clients. On a conference call with analysts, Rodkin said he was particularly pleased with a 17 percent increase in operating profit in the consumer foods segment. The company has focused its marketing spending on what it calls "priority" brands that offer the best return on investment. Those brands, which include household names such as Orville Redenbacher's popcorn, account for about three-quarters of the consumer foods segment. While ConAgra plans to increase marketing spending in the second half, Rodkin said the company will be smart with its investments and will not chase unprofitable sales. "We will not allow ourselves to slip back to being addicted to the rented volume that some of these deals drove," he said. "A prime example as we go forward will be to no longer fund 10 for $10 price points on Healthy Choice frozen entrees. That kind of merchandising price point doesn't make sense for us, for the brand equity, or for the retailer." For the full year, ConAgra forecast earnings of $1.28 to $1.33 per share, excluding one-time items. Analysts, on average, expected $1.26 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of ConAgra were up 60 cents at $27.45 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $28.35 earlier, their best level since March 2005. The shares trade at about 19.5 times analysts' profit forecasts for next year, compared with multiples of 17.7 for H.J. Heinz Co. HNZ.N and 19.1 for Sara Lee Corp. SLE.N.
