 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) expects Japan's 
Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) to unseat it next year as the 
second biggest company behind General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) in 
the American car market, a position Ford has held since the 
1920s, the New York Times said on its Web site on Thursday. 

  Citing internal Ford projections, the paper says the 
projections show that company officers believe Ford will 
permanently fall to third place as soon as January.  Ford, which is struggling to restructure itself under a 
plan called The Way Forward, predicted in September that its 
market share within two years would bottom out at 14 to 15 
percent of the market, making it smaller than Toyota is now, 
the paper said.  While it had not specifically predicted that it would end 
up behind Toyota, the implication was clear, the New York Times 
said.  Edmunds.com, a Web site offering car-buying advice, plans 
to issue its own forecast Thursday that will echo the internal 
Ford projections, predicting second place for Toyota by 
mid-2007, the paper said.  The New York Times said that Ford's chief sales 
statistician, George Pipas, declined to comment Wednesday night 
on the internal projections. Of the Edmunds forecast, Mr. Pipas 
said only: "Unless you think Toyota is going to go backwards, 
it's a good possibility that they will gain market share," 
according to the paper.  Ford was not immediately available for comment.
