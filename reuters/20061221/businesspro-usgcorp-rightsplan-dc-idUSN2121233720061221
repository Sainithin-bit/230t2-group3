 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - USG Corp. ( USG.N ) said on Thursday it 
made a final payment of $3.05 billion into its asbestos 
personal injury trust, ending the building materials maker's 
financial obligations under a settlement announced in January 
2006. 

  Under terms of the Chicago-based company's bankruptcy 
reorganization plan, USG agreed to make three payments totaling 
$3.95 billion to a trust that will compensate asbestos personal 
injury victims.  The first payment of $900 million was made on June 20. USG 
said it combined the last two payments due into a single 
payment of $3.05 billion to maximize the 2006 deductions needed 
for a $1.1 billion federal tax refund it expects in 2007.  "We are optimistic about USG's future and look forward to 
continued success implementing our strategic plans, 
unencumbered by asbestos liabilities," USG Chairman and Chief 
Executive William Foote said in a statement.  The trust payment was funded using cash on hand, proceeds 
from a $500 million senior note offering and borrowings. The 
$1.1 billion federal tax refund will be used to help repay the 
borrowings, USG said.  USG, which emerged from bankruptcy on June 20, also said it 
has adopted a new shareholder rights plan that has a 15 percent 
share ownership trigger.  The new plan will replace one which had a 5 percent 
trigger, and was adopted in connection with the company's 
emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  As part of an existing agreement, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 
( BRKa.N ), which backstopped the $1.8 billion rights offering 
that USG completed in August, may acquire up to 40 percent of 
USG's shares through August 1, 2013 without triggering the 
rights plan.  Shares of USG edged down 36 cents to close at $54.48 on the 
New York Stock Exchange.
