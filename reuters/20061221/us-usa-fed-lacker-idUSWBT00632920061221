 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - U.S. growth should pick up gradually next year, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said on Thursday, and he warned the main threat to this benign outlook was higher inflation. 

 "The risk that core inflation surges again, or does not subside as desired, clearly remains the predominant macroeconomic policy risk," he told the Charlotte Chamber of Commerce in a lunchtime speech. Lacker has dissented in the last four policy meetings of the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee, voting against its decision to leave interest rates on hold at 5.25 percent. He preferred another quarter-point hike to keep price pressures at bay. Lacker is not a voter in 2007, but remains hawkish, offering an insight into the debate that will dictate whether the Fed tilts toward easing borrowing costs at some point in the first half of next year, as investors bet, or stays put. "Many forecasters have been saying core inflation will moderate in the near term, and this would be desirable. But such a moderation is not yet evident, despite the two most recent CPI (Consumer Price Index) reports," Lacker said. "The longer core inflation persists above 2 percent, the greater the danger of inflation becoming entrenched at too high a rate," Lacker said, referring to core PCE (personal consumption expenditures index), the Fed's favored gauge. Lacker, like all 19 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, gets to argue his point of view at every policy meeting, although votes among 11 of the regional Fed presidents rotate every year. The New York Fed has a permanent vote. Asked by reporters whether the U.S. central bank risked its anti-inflation credibility by not acting against lofty prices, Lacker hinted that he felt this might be the case. "The longer that inflation stays at a level that I and many other members of the committee have said they view as undesirable, the more questions are going to arise about when inflation is going to come down," he said. Core consumer inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, was unchanged in November but was up 2.6 percent pace from the same month in 2005. Lacker welcomed the data but cautioned it did not mean price pressures had turned decisively downward. "It was encouraging, but it's too soon to make a trend out of it," he said. "It is going to take a string of lower numbers to say that core inflation has moderated." Lacker forecast growth picking up slowly next year as the drag from the cooler housing market fades, provided it does not weaken again. He said growth should rise to around 3 percent by the end of 2007, and average between 2.5 and 2.75 percent over the year as a whole. In any case, strength from consumer spending should offset the impact of slower housing and fears of a downturn in overall growth seem misplaced, he said. "The weakness in housing will continue to be a drag on overall economic activity, into the first half of next year... But I seriously doubt it will be enough of a drag to tip the economy into recession," Lacker said in his speech.
