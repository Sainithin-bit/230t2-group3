 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Highland Capital Management L.P. on Thursday proposed a $4.7 billion reorganization plan for Delphi Corp., setting the stage for a fight for control of the auto parts supplier between its two largest investors as Delphi emerges from bankruptcy. 

 The rival recapitalization plan from Dallas-based hedge fund Highland counters a $3.4 billion equity investment deal Delphi reached this week with a group led by Appaloosa Management LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP. Shares of Delphi closed up $1.03, or 37 percent, at $3.81 in over-the-counter trade, taking the stock to its highest level since the company's bankruptcy filing in October 2005. Delphi, the largest parts supplier to General Motors Corp., declined to comment on the new offer. Appaloosa also declined to comment. A representative for Cerberus could not be immediately reached. GM, which spun off Delphi in 1999, depends on the parts supplied by the Troy, Michigan-based company to keep its factories running and has made resolving its remaining labor-related issues with Delphi a top priority. The initial Delphi plan was seen as a prod to a faster deal between GM, Delphi and the United Auto Workers Union since the plan set a January 31 deadline for reaching a three-way agreement as a condition for the offer. By contrast, Highland said it would file its opposition to the Appaloosa-Cerberus plan with the federal bankruptcy court overseeing Delphi's Chapter 11 reorganization by January 2. In a statement, the hedge fund also indicated that it could ask the court for more time to weigh the rival offers, saying the "compressed timeframe" was not suited to a "a proposal of this complexity and magnitude." Morningstar analyst John Novak said the bidding war for Delphi underscored the value unlocked by a restructuring plan to close or sell 21 of Delphi's 29 U.S. plants. Novak said that while the complication of competing bids could slow a final resolution for GM, the outcome would be positive for the automaker in either case. "I think while the timeline may slip, GM will be fine no matter which side wins," he said. Highland said it would support the planned exit of Delphi Chief Executive Steve Miller, who joined the parts supplier in mid-2005 to guide its restructuring. Miller, a target of UAW criticism, is scheduled to be succeeded by Rodney O'Neal in January. O'Neal has been Delphi's chief operating officer, with responsibility for daily business operations. Miller will remain chairman. A UAW spokesman declined to comment. 'SWEETHEART' DEAL? In a letter to Delphi's board, Highland criticized the current Delphi plan as a "sweetheart" deal that would give control to investors led by Appaloosa and Cerberus through a $1.2 billion preferred stock offering and the ability to name six of 12 board directors. With a 9 percent stake, Appaloosa is the largest Delphi investor, while Highland is No. 2 and has a 7 percent stake, according to Reuters Knowledge. Including affiliates, Highland's stake is 8.8 percent, the fund said in its letter to Delphi. Highland's offer would scrap the proposed convertible preferred offering in favor of a larger, $4.7 billion rights offering open to all shareholders. Pat Daugherty, a Highland partner in charge of its distressed investment group, said the hedge fund had contacted Appaloosa about participating in its Delphi reorganization in recent weeks, but had never heard back before Monday's announcement. Coming just ahead of year-end holidays, the existing Delphi plan appeared timed to shut out rival offers, he said. In addition, Highland believes the Appaloosa-Cerberus bloc would be enriched by over $1 billion at the expense of other investors under its offer because of fees and the exclusive nature of the preferred offering, he said. "We understand a fleecing when we see one," Daugherty told Reuters. The Appaloosa-Cerberus investor group also includes Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund I Ltd., Merrill Lynch & Co. and UBS Securities LLC. Cerberus has been an active investor in auto-related businesses as many companies in the troubled sector look to sell off assets and restructure. The private-equity firm last month completed a deal to buy a 51 percent stake in GMAC. It has also been named as the lead bidder for a unit of bankrupt parts supplier Collins & Aikman, according to a person familiar with the matter. Highland, which manages some $35 billion across a range of asset classes, is in negotiations with two Wall Street firms advisors in its Delphi offer, Daugherty said. He declined to name them, saying the hedge fund was still discussing the range of their involvement.
