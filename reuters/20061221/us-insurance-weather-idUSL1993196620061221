 LONDON  (Reuters) - Are you an Alpine ski resort owner facing a financial headache because your slopes are blanketed in flowers rather than snow? Don't worry, help is at hand from the insurance industry. 

 Insurance exists that pays out if there's an unwanted spell of weather -- be that cold, heat, rain wind or snow. This is most commonly offered through weather derivatives, trading in which has recently surged as energy companies have enthusiastically embraced them to hedge against fluctuating demand for oil, gas and electricity due to climate vagaries. But, despite trillions of dollars being at risk in the global economy from adverse weather, other businesses have been slow to catch on to the fact they can insure themselves against a dip in profits caused by adverse weather just as they can against a factory fire or a product recall. That may be about to change. Predictions that global warming is likely to trigger unusual climate patterns has meant shareholders' patience is likely to wear increasingly thin with firms who blame missed earnings targets on unforeseen weather. "People are increasingly aware there are now variances in weather that are extreme enough to impact their daily lives and their businesses," said Warren Isom, senior vice president at insurance broker Willis's reinsurance unit. "Ten years ago, if I went to speak to a company in Europe about the potential impact on them of hot summers they would look at me as if I had just landed from Mars," said Isom. "They told me the climate in Europe was so stable that it wasn't a problem. But in the past few years there have been two almost catastrophically hot summers." WEATHER TRADING JUMP Firms' growing realisation they can manage their weather exposure can be seen in the recent boom in trading weather derivatives in places like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Weather risk trading has jumped from $4.7 billion in 2003-2004 to $45.2 billion in 2005-2006, according to a survey conducted for the Weather Risk Management Association (WRMA). Though the vast majority of trading is done by utility companies, firms in other weather-sensitive businesses are becoming increasingly aware of these products. "There's an expansion into other market sectors beyond the energy sector for these kind of products, which is very interesting," said Juerg Trueb, global head of environmental & commodity markets at Swiss Re. "We have executed transactions with people who run ski resorts, with people in the construction industry and agriculture," said Trueb. Despite the growing awareness of the financial effects of global warming and an increasingly unpredictable climate, insurers acknowledge these products remain a tough sell. Sales of weather insurance policies have been slowed because, unlike energy companies, most potential buyers' own financial losses do not closely mirror the weather recorded at a range of weather stations across a particular country or region -- usually the trigger for these policies to pay out. "Lots of companies would dearly love to buy something that protects their revenues but that isn't precisely what weather contracts provide," said Claire Wilkinson, executive director at Willis's Capital Markets unit. "They respond to the impact of weather; they do not provide comprehensive revenue protection, (so) there is basis risk." But market players are optimistic about the market's future, providing they can find ways of structuring these contracts so they better match client needs. Gearoid Lane, president of WRMA and director of gas and electricity procurement at Centrica, which has hedged its weather risk in the derivatives market for the past five years, likens its potential with the foreign exchange market. "If you think of foreign exchange trading, it started between banks. Now pretty much everyone in every sector is hedging their FX risk. It's an integral part of your business and you wouldn't think of not doing it."
