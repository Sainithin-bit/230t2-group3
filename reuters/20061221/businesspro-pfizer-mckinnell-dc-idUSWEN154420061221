 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) Chief 
Executive Hank McKinnell will receive $198 million in total 
compensation after his departure in February, the company said 
in a filing on Thursday. 

  McKinnell, who will serve on the company's board until 
February, will receive a $12 million severance payment, $2 
million pro-rated bonus for 2006, $6 million in restricted 
shares, $18 million in other share payments as well as about 
$78 million in compensation that McKinnell has deferred and 
earned interest on during his roughly 35-year Pfizer career.  Those payments come in addition to a previously disclosed 
$82 million lump sum pension payment due McKinnell.  Pfizer abruptly replace McKinnell in July amid a sluggish 
stock price for the world's largest drug maker. He was 
originally slated to stay on as head of Pfizer until February 
2008.
