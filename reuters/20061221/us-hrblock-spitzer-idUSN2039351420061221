 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer has again sued H&R Block Inc. ( HRB.N ), accusing the No. 1 U.S. tax preparer of steering customers into money-losing savings accounts, just three weeks after his first lawsuit was dismissed by a state judge. A Spitzer spokesman said the latest suit, filed on December 18, resolves jurisdiction problems brought up by the judge, and will prevail. The company said on Wednesday that Spitzer's refiled case still has no merit and ignored that many customer accounts had grown. "Other than changes to the corporate entities named as defendants and added statements on their relationships to one another, the new filing replicates the March 2006 lawsuit as amended," the company said. In March, Spitzer filed the first lawsuit, alleging that the company had fraudulently marketing "Express IRA" savings accounts, and sought at least $250 million in penalties. Some 85 percent of 600,000 customers who opened these money-market accounts lost money when maintenance and other fees outpaced interest earned, the suit said. On November 29, New York State Supreme Court Justice Karla Moskowitz threw out the suit on jurisdictional grounds, noting it addressed a Kansas-City-based parent company with no physical presence in New York. She told Spitzer to file again if lawyers showed the state had jurisdiction. Spitzer, who will take office as New York governor in less than two weeks, refiled the civil suit on Monday, naming H&R Block Inc. as well as several units that do business in the state, including H&R Financial Advisors. Spitzer filed the initial suit when Block refused to settle and H&R Block Chief Executive Mark Ernst attacked the lawsuit in a national newspaper opinion piece. The attorney general, who has secured billions of dollars in fines and penalties through settlements with banks and insurers, responded by threatening to extract "vast fines" from H&R Block. In May, Spitzer had amended the original suit to also allege that senior H&R Block managers pressured employees to promote the accounts. The dismissal was the latest in a series of legal setbacks suffered by Spitzer in recent years, including the acquittal of Bank of America broker Theodore Sihpol. Spitzer also during a TV interview accused former American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ) chief Hank Greenberg of criminal fraud, although he never filed charges. Spitzer struck a $1.6 billion agreement with AIG to settle a civil suit.
