 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A key forecasting gauge for the U.S. economy rose for the third straight month, indicating the economy will likely continue to slow in the first half of 2007, a private research firm said on Thursday. 

 The U.S. Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.1 percent to 138.2 in November, matching the 0.1 percent gain in October, the New York-based Conference Board said. The October increase was revised from an initially reported gain of 0.2 percent and was greater than the Wall Street forecast for unchanged. The index rose 0.4 percent in September. Ken Goldstein, labor economist for the Conference Board, said that while the slower economy in the second half of 2006 could continue into 2007 it may not get any slower. "At this stage, something else must develop, either to give the economy a new jolt of energy to speed it up, or a new snag that could force the economy to slow more," Goldstein said in a statement. The leading index, which measures a basket of economic indicators ranging from unemployment benefit claims to building permits, is designed to forecast economic trends up to six months ahead. The coincident index, a barometer of current economic performance, rose 0.2 percent in November after rising 0.2 percent in October, the board said. The lagging index, which measures past trends in the economy, rose 0.5 percent in November after a 0.2 percent in October gain.
