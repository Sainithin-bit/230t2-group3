 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) said on Thursday it will sell its aircraft business, which makes Hawker and Beechcraft business jets, to a unit of investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Canadian buyout firm Onex Partners ( OCX.TO ) for about $3.3 billion. 

 The defense contractor said it expects about $2.5 billion in net after-tax proceeds from the sale and added that it would reduce debt and buy back shares. The company also lowered its forecast for full-year 2006 and 2007 profits, saying it would now report the subsidiary as a discontinued operation. "I think the aircraft operation was probably taking more of their time than was justified given the return that they were getting on their sales," said Paul Nisbet at aerospace specialists JSA Research. "In fact, it was a losing operation for a few years." Shares of Raytheon Rose 2 cents to $53.88 on the New York Stock Exchange. Raytheon, the No. 5 Pentagon contractor, put its Raytheon Aircraft Co. unit up for sale in July. The unit, which makes business jets under the Beechcraft and Hawker names, as well as military training planes, has been lagging competitors and falling behind Raytheon's more profitable defense operations. The unit, which traces its roots to the founding of the Beech Aircraft Corp. in 1932, had $2.9 billion in sales last year. It competes directly with General Dynamics Corp.'s ( GD.N ) Gulfstream unit, Textron Inc.'s ( TXT.N ) Cessna unit and Canada's Bombardier Inc. ( BBDb.TO ), which makes Lear jets. Hawker Beechcraft Corp., a new company formed by GS Capital Partners and Onex, which bought several Boeing Co.( BA.N ) plants in the United States last year, will buy the Raytheon unit. Onex's investment in Raytheon's business jet operations is the company's third major foray into the aerospace sector in the past 18 months. "We believe strongly in the future growth of the business aviation sector, as new demand from Europe and Asia adds to strength in North America," Onex Managing Director Nigel Wright said in a statement. Aside from aerospace, Onex has investments in electronics manufacturing services unit Celestica Inc. ( CLS.TO ) and Cineplex Entertainment Limited Partnership. Raytheon said subject to the closing of the transaction, expected in the first half of 2007, its board approved early retirement of about $1 billion in debt and repurchase of up to an additional $750 million shares. Raytheon said it now expects 2006 earnings per share from continuing operations to be $2.35 to $2.45, down from $2.70 to $2.80 earlier. For 2007, the company expects earnings per share from continuing operations to be $2.75 to $2.90, compared with $2.95 to 3.05 forecast earlier.
