 MUNICH  (Reuters) - German industrial conglomerate MAN AG 
( MANG.DE ) no longer rules out a breakup of its corporate 
structure and sale of its non-truckmaking businesses, the 
company said late on Wednesday. 

  In comments that could help facilitate its 10.3 billion 
euro ($13.59 billion) takeover bid for Swedish truckmaker 
Scania ( SCVb.ST ), MAN's chief executive suggested he could 
decide to focus the company on its core commercial vehicles 
business and thereby assuage Scania's objections to a link-up 
with a sprawling conglomerate.  "We don't have a problem with the current structure, but we 
also do not have any dogmas," Chief Executive Hakan Samuelsson 
told reporters in comments embargoed for Thursday.
