 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - General Mills Inc. ( GIS.N ) posted better-than-expected second-quarter earnings on Thursday and raised its profit forecast for the year on strong sales of new, higher-priced products such as Fruity Cheerios cereal and Caribou Coffee Co. Inc. CBOU.O granola bars. 

 The news sent General Mills' shares up 2.1 percent to an all-time high, although the world's No. 2 maker of breakfast cereals said growth would moderate in the second half of the fiscal year in part due to higher grain and marketing costs. General Mills has raised promoted prices on many of its products, added more new items, and increased marketing spending to help boost sales and profit, while fending off competition from rival Kellogg Co. ( K.N ) and others. That strategy appears to be paying off so far this fiscal year as results exceeded Wall Street expectations in the first two quarters. Net income for the period ended November 26 rose to $385 million, or $1.08 per share, from $370 million, or 97 cents per share, a year earlier. Wall Street analysts, on average, had been expecting the maker of Progresso soups and Pillsbury dough to earn $1.03 per share, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. General Mills shares were up $1.09, or 1.88 percent, at $59.08 in afternoon trading after hitting a lifetime high of $59.20. Sales rose 5 percent to $3.47 billion. Analysts were expecting sales of $3.42 billion, on average, according to Reuters Estimates. So far this year, sales are up 6 percent -- above the company's long-term goal of posting sales increases in the low single digits on a percentage basis. "We're not building our plan around the continuation of 6 percent sales growth," Chief Executive Steve Sanger said in an interview. 2007 FORECAST RAISED Nevertheless, General Mills raised its 2007 earnings outlook to a range of $3.09 to $3.13 per share, including 12 cents per share in stock option expenses, up from its prior forecast of $3.03 to $3.08 per share. U.S. retail sales rose 3 percent in the quarter to $2.44 billion and operating profit in that business rose 8 percent. Sales of Yoplait Light yogurt and snacks like Chex Mix and new Caribou Coffee granola bars were particularly strong. Sales of General Mills' flagship "Big G" cereals rose 2 percent, helped by demand for new Fruity Cheerios and brands like Cocoa Puffs and Fiber One. International sales rose 15 percent to $545 million, and profit also rose 15 percent. The company's recent acquisition of the Uncle Toby's cereal brand in Australia through its joint venture with Nestle ( NESN.VX ) was a key part of that growth. Volume, a measure of products sold that factors out currency and price fluctuations, rose 3 percent while overall gross margin improved by nearly 40 basis points. J.P. Morgan analyst Pablo Zuanic said in a note to clients that the company's gross margins were well above his estimates due to higher prices in its international and food service businesses and lower-than-expected costs. Zuanic, however, kept his "underweight" rating on General Mills shares as he questioned whether the company's current profit margins could be sustained. Higher prices on ingredients like wheat and corn are will hike manufacturing costs by about $145 million this year, the company said, most of which will be logged in the next two quarters. At the same time, General Mills will introduce more new products in the second half of the year, including Nature Valley cereals and a new line of Disney-branded ( DIS.N ) childrens' cereals that are lower in sugar.
