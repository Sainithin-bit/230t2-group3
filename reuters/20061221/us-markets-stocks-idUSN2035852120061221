 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks dropped on Thursday as concerns that U.S. economic growth could be slowing faster than expected dented optimism about corporate profits. 

 The market took a hit at noon when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its December index of business activity fell unexpectedly. This followed a downward revision in the Commerce Department's estimate of third-quarter growth in gross domestic product. Those two reports spoiled the buying mood created by a fresh flurry of corporate takeovers, which had pushed stocks higher at the opening. Leading the blue-chip Dow average lower were shares of companies considered to be economic bellwethers, including aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) and industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) "We are looking at a situation where economic numbers have to come down even further in terms of expectations," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of U.S. equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 42.62 points, or 0.34 percent, to end at 12,421.25. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  slipped 5.23 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,418.30. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 11.76 points, or 0.48 percent, to close at 2,415.85. RESEARCH IN MOTION AND MICRON FLY - LATE After the closing bell, shares of Research In Motion Ltd. RIMM.ORIM.TO jumped 4.8 percent to $140.14 in electronic trade after the maker of Blackberry handheld e-mail devices reported a profit that beat expectations and forecast an even stronger fourth quarter. The stock closed on Nasdaq at $133.70, down 0.8 percent, or $1.05. Also expected to give a lift to tech shares on Friday, the stock of Micron Technology Inc. MU.N gained 4.3 percent to $14.07 after the bell. The U.S. memory chip maker posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly profit. Micron's stock ended New York Stock Exchange trading at $13.49, up 0.2 percent, or 2 cents. DOUBLE DOSE OF BAD NEWS During the regular session, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said at midday that its business activity index fell to -4.3 in December from 5.1 in November. Wall Street analysts had forecast a gain of 4.0. The index was negative for the third time in the past four months.  Before the opening bell, the Commerce Department reported that GDP, which is the output of all goods and services within U.S. borders, grew at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter -- slower than the previous estimate of 2.2 percent. The data stirred concerns that the economy may be slowing down, and along with it, the trend of steadily rising profits may also falter. Adding to negative sentiment, Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker said in a speech in Charlotte, North Carolina, that inflation remained the main risk facing the U.S. economy.  Those concerns overtook earlier enthusiasm prompted by a fresh wave of takeovers and a drop in oil prices. Alcoa's stock slid 2.5 percent, or 74 cents, to $29.30 on the NYSE, while Caterpillar shares fell 0.9 percent, or 56 cents, to $60.81 and United Technologies stock lost 0.7 percent, or 46 cents, to $62.76. On the Nasdaq, the top drags included the stock of Web search leader Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), down 1.5 percent, or $6.70, at $456.20. Google earlier failed to hold above its 60-day moving average, a key technical gauge of a stock's resiliency. MOTOROLA AND EXXON MOBIL SLIP On the deal-making front, cellphone maker Motorola Inc. MOT.N said it planned to buy digital video technology company Tut Systems Inc. TUTS.O for about $39 million to bolster its Internet-based video business. Motorola shares were down 0.4 percent, or 9 cents, at $20.32 on the NYSE, while Tut shares jumped 16.5 percent, or 16 cents, to $1.13 on the Nasdaq. Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 0.3 percent, or 21 cents, to $75.87 on the NYSE, in sync with falling crude prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, February crude CLG7 dropped $1.06 to settle at $62.66 per barrel. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.36 billion shares changing hands, below last year's daily average of 1.61 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.81 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 1.80 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of 10 to 7 on the NYSE and by 17 to 13 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu )
