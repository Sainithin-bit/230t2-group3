 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Istithmar, an investment firm owned 
by the Dubai government, has moved further into U.S. property 
by buying a 73 percent stake in the Mandarin Oriental New York 
in a deal valuing the hotel at $340 million. 

  Singapore-listed Mandarin Oriental International Ltd. 
( MOIL.SI ) said in a statement on Thursday that it had sold half 
of its 50 percent stake to Istithmar.  Apollo Real Estate and related companies would sell almost 
all of their 50 percent equity stake to the Dubai investment 
house in February 2007, it added.  The 248-room hotel, which opened at the end of 2003, was 
valued at $340 million for the purposes of the transaction, the 
statement said.  Mandarin Oriental International said it would receive after 
tax proceeds of US$29 million and post a post tax gain of US$16 
million, to be recognized in 2007. But as part of the deal it 
would also receive repayment of its outstanding mezzanine loan 
to the hotel of $40 million.  Istithmar, 100 percent owned by Dubai World, which is in 
turn owned by the Dubai government, has been buying up U.S. 
property and other assets aggressively this year. It acquired 
retailer Loehmann's in July, the Knickerbocker Hotel in New 
York in June, and office block 280 Park Avenue in April.  The firm also told Reuters in September that it was in 
talks to buy diversified real estate investment trust Crescent
