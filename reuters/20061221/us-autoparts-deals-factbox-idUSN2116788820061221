 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hedge fund Highland Capital Management fired the latest salvo in the automotive parts sector on Thursday, proposing a $4.7 billion reorganization plan for Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK just a few days after the company backed a different plan. 

 Despite its struggles with financial losses, production cuts by U.S. automakers and onerous raw materials and energy costs, the sector has seen its share of mergers and acquisitions. In addition to the proposed Highland deal, some of this year's deals, based on information from Reuters and Dealogic, include: * On Monday, Delphi announced a plan for an investment of up to $3.4 billion from the group led by Appaloosa Management LP and Cerberus Capital Management LP that also included potential creditor recoveries and an executive succession plan. Under the plan, the Appaloosa and Cerberus group would own up to two-thirds of Delphi after it emerged from bankruptcy. * December 13 - Collins & Aikman Corp. CKCRQ.PK said it had selected a lead bidder for the planned sale of the unit that supplies carpeting and sound-deadening materials for vehicles. The company, which had previously said it would sell off its operations rather than seek to emerge from bankruptcy as a stand-alone company, did not identify the bidder, but a person familiar with the matter said it was Cerberus. * December 5 - the U.S. subsidiary of Japanese tire maker Bridgestone Corp. ( 5108.T ) said it would buy Bandag BDG.N, a maker of tire retreading materials and equipment, for $1.05 billion. * December 4 - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said it had reached a preliminary agreement to sell its Automotive Components Holdings (ACH) unit's climate-control business to French car parts maker Valeo ( VLOF.PA ). Financial terms were not disclosed. ACH is a Ford-managed holding company formed in October 2005 when Ford took back 23 facilities from struggling former parts subsidiary Visteon Corp ( VC.N ). * December 1 - Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ) said it had reached a definitive agreement to sell its North American interiors business to a joint venture led by billionaire financier Wilbur Ross, in exchange for a 25 percent stake in the venture and warrants for an additional 7 percent. * October 16 - Auto-parts supplier Martinrea International Inc. of Canada agreed to buy the North American auto body and chassis operations of ThyssenKrupp Budd Co. for $275 million. The deal closed in early December. * September 1 - Asahi Tec Corp. 5606.T, a Japanese auto-parts maker controlled by U.S. buyout firm Ripplewood Holdings LLC, said it would buy privately held U.S. rival Metaldyne Corp. for $1.2 billion, including debt. * April 3 - Continental AG ( CONG.DE ) said it would pay $1 billion to buy Motorola's MOT.N global auto electronics business. The deal closed in early July.
