 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - American Greetings Corp. AM.N said on 
Thursday that quarterly profit nearly quadrupled, helped by a 
$20 million one-time gain. 

  Net income for the fiscal third quarter that ended November 
24 rose to $49.7 million, or 83 cents per share, from $12.9 
million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier.  Results in the latest period included a $20 million pretax 
gain related to long-term supply agreements. The greeting card 
maker provided few details in its statement, and said no one 
would be available to comment until after a mid-morning 
conference call with analysts.  Sales fell to $512.2 million from $552 million a year 
earlier.  American Greetings has been rolling out new greeting card 
displays, and said it would continue to invest in that project 
this year and next.  The company forecast fiscal 2007 earnings per share in the 
range of 80 cents to $1. Analysts, on average, expected 81 
cents, according to Reuters Estimates.  American Greetings said 2007 earnings may be above that 
forecast, depending on the timing of two small product line 
dispositions.  The company also raised its full-year cash flow forecast to 
about $200 million from its earlier estimate of $100 million to 
$130 million, reflecting cash receipts related to contract 
terminations and lower-than-expected capital spending.
