 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An information-sharing accord aimed 
at uncovering terrorist financing and money laundering was 
announced on Thursday by the U.S. Treasury Department's 
financial crimes unit and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 

  Under the agreement, the SEC and the Treasury's Financial 
Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) each quarter will share 
information they have gathered to make sure SEC-regulated 
companies comply with the Bank Secrecy Act.  "The agreement will better ensure that SEC-regulated firms 
have robust anti-money laundering programs," the SEC said in a 
statement.  The SEC said the agreement will help authorities identify 
financial institutions with significant bank secrecy law 
violations or deficiencies and take enforcement and other 
action when needed.  The announcement comes after U.S. financial authorities 
cited two international banks for deficient anti-money 
laundering compliance procedures and internal controls.  Federal and state banking regulators this week announced 
cases involving the New York branches of Habib Bank Ltd., one 
of Pakistan's largest banks, and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ 
Ltd. ( 8306.T ), the world's biggest bank in terms of assets.  FinCEN coordinates with other government agencies and the 
banking sector to protect the U.S. financial system from crime 
and abuse, including terrorist financing and money laundering, 
through a system of regulatory controls and financial 
reporting.  FinCEN works with federal banking regulatory agencies -- 
the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of 
Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- 
and the Internal Revenue Service.
