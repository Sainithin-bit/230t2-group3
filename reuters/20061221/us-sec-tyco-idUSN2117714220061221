 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. securities regulators on Thursday accused two former executives at Tyco International Ltd. of improper accounting practices that resulted in overstating Tyco's income by $567 million from 1998 to 2002. 

 The alleged fraud involved the use of sham transactions of commercial and residential security monitoring contracts through the conglomerate's Fire & Security Services division. According to its civil complaint, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said payments between Tyco and independent dealers offset each other and no money actually changed hands. The transactions, the SEC contends, were directed by former Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski, who is serving a prison sentence of up to 25 years for his role in looting $600 million from Tyco. The SEC charged Richard Power, who held several senior financial reporting positions, and Edward Federman, assistant controller who reported to former Chief Financial Officer Mark Swartz, with fraud for inflating the company's operating income by hundreds of millions of dollars through a sham transaction. "This is a fraud that was cleverly led by Dennis Kozlowski and Mark Swartz," said Scott Friestad, an SEC associate enforcement director. "We view that the two guys acted as henchmen for senior management to carry out the Tyco accounting fraud." Power's attorney, Daniel Horwitz, said he and his client, whom he called "a person of integrity," intend to vigorously fight the SEC claims. Federman's attorney did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. While announcing the charges against Power and Federman, the SEC also said it had reached an agreement with Richard "Skip" Heger, who oversaw the finances of the company's Fire & Security Services division. Heger agreed to pay $450,000 to settle financial reporting and record-keeping charges. He agreed to settle without admitting or denying any wrongdoing, the SEC said. Earlier this year Tyco settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay $50 million to settle accounting fraud charges. The SEC said Tyco overstated its results by $1 billion between 1996 and 2002 in a fraud that was orchestrated by the company's top officials. Power and Federman were involved in Tyco's financial reporting, the SEC said, with Power reporting directly to Kozlowski and Federman serving as chief financial officer of a major division. Under the deal, Tyco charged authorized dealers of Tyco's ADT Security Services Inc. subsidiary with a "dealer connection fee" whenever Tyco bought security contracts from them. That fee was then fully offset by a simultaneous price increase in the contracts, making it a sham, the agency said. The SEC also said Power and Federman further inflated the company's operating income through fraudulent acquisition accounting. Heger oversaw the financial results of Tyco's security monitoring division and approved the results that he knew, or was reckless in not knowing, were improper, the SEC said. His attorney could not immediately be reached for comment. (Additional reporting by  John Poirier )
