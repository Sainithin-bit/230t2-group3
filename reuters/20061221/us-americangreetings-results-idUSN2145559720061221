 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Greetings Corp. AM.N said on Thursday that quarterly profit nearly quadrupled due to a $20-million one-time gain, and said that 2007 earnings could be above its forecast, helping to send shares up 2 percent in late morning trading. 

 The No. 2 U.S. greeting card company behind Hallmark Cards Inc. said that depending on the timing of two small product line dispositions, its 2007 profit could exceed its previous forecast, which called for profit in the range of 80 cents to $1 per share. Analysts on average were expecting 81 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income rose to $49.7 million, or 83 cents per share, for the fiscal third quarter that ended November 24, from $12.9 million, or 19 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter included a $20 million pretax gain that the company said was due to changes in its long-term supply agreements as retailers consolidate. The company, based in Cleveland, Ohio, said it expects a related cash inflow of $60 million in the fourth quarter. "If you remove the effect of that gain, our performance was slightly above our internal expectations," said Chief Executive Zev Weiss on a conference call, citing a more efficient supply chain and lower-than-expected expenses related to the rolling out of a new strategy for managing inventory. But the company fell short of its internal sales plan, Weiss said, due to the fact that its cards and gifts are being sold in fewer stores, due to consolidation. Sales fell 7 percent to $512.2 million, missing analysts' average expectation of $515.2 million, according to Reuters Estimates. American Greetings has been rolling out new greeting card displays, and said it would continue to invest in that project this year and next. The company also raised its full-year cash-flow forecast to about $200 million from its earlier estimate of $100 million to $130 million, reflecting cash receipts related to contract terminations and lower-than-expected capital spending. American Greetings shares were up 53 cents at $23.65 on the New York Stock Exchange, after rising as high as $26.00 earlier in the session.
