 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew at a tepid 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, hurt by the sharpest housing slump in 15 years, while mid-Atlantic region business activity stumbled in December, data showed on Thursday. 

 The growth rate for gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity within U.S. borders, was revised down in the July-September period from 2.2 percent estimated a month ago, the Commerce Department said. That was a slowdown from the second quarter's 2.6 percent rate of GDP increase. Another report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank implied persistent economic softening. Its business activity index for the mid-Atlantic region fell to -4.3 percent in December from 5.1 in November -- the third month in the past four it has been negative. "At the end of the year, the economy is weak and a quick turnaround is not clear," said Robert Brusca, chief economist for New York-based Fact and Opinion Economics. The third-quarter GDP figure was revised down because consumer spending on services was softer than thought before, the department said. Stock prices declined on the signs of weakening economic activity. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 42.62 points to end at 12,421.25 and the Nasdaq composite index lost 11.76 to close at 2,415.85. U.S. government debt prices jumped on hope a slowing economy boosts chances for lower interest rates. Benchmark 10-year notes climbed 11/32 in price and their yield, which moves in the opposite direction, eased to 4.56 percent from 4.60 late on Wednesday. MIXED VIEWS ON INFLATION The GDP report said so-called core prices, which exclude food and energy items, slowed to 2.2 percent in the third quarter from 2.7 percent in the second quarter. Analysts said the slower quarterly rise in prices was reassuring. "The worst of inflation is behind us," said Christopher Low, chief economist for FTN Financial in New York. However, the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank president, Jeffrey Lacker, made clear to a business group in Charlotte, North Carolina, that inflation is a serious risk. "The longer core inflation persists above 2 percent, the greater the danger of inflation becoming entrenched at too high a rate," said Lacker, who dissented at the last four Fed policy sessions against its majority decision to keep rates steady and instead said increases were needed. On a year-over-year basis, third-quarter core prices rose 2.4 percent -- the strongest since a matching 2.4 percent in the second quarter of 1995 -- after gaining 2.2 percent year-over-year in the second quarter. Federal Reserve policy-makers, who have kept interest rates steady since mid-year, say they continue to remain vigilant against any possibility inflation does not recede. A midmorning report from the New York-based Conference Board, a private research group, underlined the uncertainty in the economic outlook. Its U.S. Index of Leading Economic Indicators rose 0.1 percent to 138.2 in November, the same as in October but down from a 0.4 percent pickup in September, pointing to a likely slow start next year but not necessarily a downturn. "At this stage, something else must develop, either to give the economy a new jolt of energy to speed it up, or a new snag that could force the economy to slow more," board economist Ken Goldstein said in a statement. LONGER JOBLESS LINES Separately, the Labor Department said 9,000 more workers applied for first-time jobless benefits last week -- a total 315,000 and roughly the number that analysts had forecast. Spending on new-home building plunged 18.7 percent, the biggest quarterly drop since a 21.7 percent fall in the first quarter of 1991. Some analysts suggested weak homebuilding might be less of a drag on growth since the sector's prolonged slump must have wrung out some weakness in the sector. "We're not going to see a dramatic rebound but we're not going to see further drops from here because it's so low," said Andy Busch, senior currency strategist for BMO Capital markets in Chicago. A monthly index of national activity compiled by the Chicago Federal Reserve Bank, also issued on Thursday, showed a slight improvement in November but still pointed toward growth that is likely to stay below historical trends. The GDP report showed business spending grew at a 10 percent rate in the third quarter, the same rate estimated a month ago, and more than twice the 4.4 percent rate posted in the second quarter. Corporate profits after taxes increased by a revised 4.2 percent rate in the third quarter, down modestly from last month's estimated 4.6 percent, and a strong gain from the second quarter's meager 0.3 percent rise in profits.
