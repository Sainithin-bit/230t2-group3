 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russia's grain export halt will probably not be enough to limit inflationary pressures from drought, while the economy and the budget may be hurt by the ban and other consequences of the country's record heatwave. 

 Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on Thursday banned grain exports from August 15 until the end of the year, saying the government "must not allow a rise of food prices in Russia" even though a drought is expected to reduce grain production by around a quarter from 2009 levels. Analysts said the move was likely due to pressure from export agents, locked into contracts to supply grain far below current prices, and would not fully quell price rises. And, given the one-off nature of the inflation pressure, the onus to act is on the government rather than the central bank. "It is clearly not monetary inflation, and the central bank should not react to it. It is not the central bank's business," said Anton Stroutchenevski, economist at Troika Dialog. "A rise in interest rates will not bring rain." The central bank has yet to comment on the impact of the heatwave and consequences on monetary policy, and made no mention of it on July 30 after leaving rates on hold. Rate hikes could be a bad idea given that the heatwave, drought, and to a lesser extent the grain export ban, are expected to slow down the economy's recovery from recession. July's service sector PMI survey gave the first signs of activity growth slowing due to the heatwave. Pollution from fires -- including in Moscow -- has prompted some companies to temporarily halt production or send some workers home. "We expect a temporary slowdown in activity, except for electricity consumption. Overall productivity will likely fall, and demand will also fall - people have gone away to the countryside. But the heat will eventually subside and everything will return back to normal," said Alexandra Evtifyeva at VTB. Higher food prices could also leave consumers with less cash to spend on other things, thus hitting demand in the broader retail and services sector, Troika Dialog said. The hit on the budget will include 35 billion roubles ($1.17 billion) in subsidies and loans pledged to the agriculture sector and at least 6.5 billion roubles to rebuild damaged homes, as well as the cost of putting out the fires. PRICE CAPS EYED The export ban will work only if producers sell stocks on the domestic market and do not wait in hopes of higher prices. Even if they do sell now, the effect will be limited because drought and other factors are also likely to drive up the cost of other Russian staples such as potato and cabbage. Alexander Morozov, chief economist for Russia and CIS at HSBC, retained his pre-ban forecast that the boost to food costs would add 1-1.5 percentage points to annual inflation. "Yes, this measure could contain the rise for grain products. But inflation expectations have already grown ... and there are attempts to raise prices for a wide range of goods which are not linked to the drought," he said. There could be further inflationary pressures once the ban ends. "The ban on wheat exports may bring only temporary effects, with higher exports and price pressures becoming more pronounced in the longer term," Deutsche Bank's analysts said in a note. Food accounts for 38 percent of Russia's consumer price basket, with around two-thirds of that potentially sensitive to drought -- either directly, like bread and potatoes, or indirectly, like meat and dairy products which will be hit by any potential increase in animal feed costs. Parliamentary elections due in 2011 and a presidential vote in 2012 may give the government an incentive to take broader action. "Such anti-inflationary measures are likely to be extended into direct retail price controls on socially sensitive goods," said Vladimir Osakovsky at Unicredit. The government can put caps on cost of socially-vital goods -- such as bread and milk -- if prices for them rise by more than 30 percent, but this only affects the most basic varieties. In addition, in 2007-8, it persuaded companies to agree to a freeze on basic good prices in a bid to curb inflation, although prices on non-affected goods surged at the time.
