 (Reuters) - Here are some developments in BP Plc's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the largest offshore oil disaster in U.S. history. 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * BP said on Friday the cement seal on its crippled Gulf of Mexico oil well was holding and a relief well to permanently plug the ill-fated borehole was on track to reach its target in mid-August. MARKET IMPACT/COMPANIES * Lloyd's of London insurer Catlin on Friday reported a steeper than expected slide in first-half profit, hit by the BP oil spill, the Chilean earthquake and currency fluctuations. * Dutch engineering consultancy Fugro NV posted a smaller-than-expected drop in earnings on Friday, with the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico having little impact on its activities so far. * BP is suddenly enjoying a lot of good news in a very short time. That has helped the UK oil major's shares snap back 40 percent from their June low. The rally could have further to go. * BP shares closed up .46 percent in London and shares in New York closed up 1.6 percent on Friday. POLITICS/POLICY * Mexico's state oil company Pemex said on Friday it has delayed drilling its deepest-ever offshore well until April and is continuing with other deep water exploration projects with increased safety standards. * U.S. Senate Democrats on Thursday proposed repealing a tax break for some major oil companies, including BP Plc, effective December 31. ENVIRONMENT * The Gulf of Mexico oil spill has spurred a race within the scientific community to develop faster ways of identifying U.S. seafood tainted by petroleum. * Oil from BP Plc's blown-out well has stopped flowing into the Gulf of Mexico and so far there is little sign of the 1.8 million gallons of dispersants used to combat the oil slick.
