 CHARLOTTE, North Carolina  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) projects that its losses from pending litigation could be as high as $1.4 billion, the company disclosed in its second-quarter report filed Friday with securities regulators. 

 The bank said its potential losses could range from $250 million to $1.4 billion for some, but not all, of the outstanding litigation involving the company. The estimate is a rare projection by Bank of America of the potential losses associated with a range of lawsuits, many of which stem from the financial crisis. Separately, the bank also said mortgage repurchase requests have increased from government-backed entities and private sector companies, and now total $11.1 billion. Since the 2008 crisis, banks have increasingly repurchased soured mortgages from mortgage-backed securities holders. Typically, such mortgages are held by government-backed agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But in rare instances, the securities are held by private, third party organizations. The repurchase requests have increased by $3.5 billion over the last six months, when they totaled $7.6 billion at year-end 2009. Bank of America said in its quarterly report it must raise an additional $1.1 billion by year's end to satisfy a Federal Reserve requirement from its bailout aid repayment. When Bank of America repaid its $45 billion in government aid last December, it was required to raise an additional $3 billion by the end of 2010 as part of the repayment plan. It has sold $10 billion in assets as part of that process, netting $1.9 billion in after-tax proceeds. If the year-end deadline isn't met, the bank will raise the funds through an equity raise. Shares in Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America closed down 0.43 percent at $13.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Joe Rauch; Editing by  Gary Hill )
