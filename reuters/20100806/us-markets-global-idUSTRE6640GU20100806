 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stock markets and the dollar slumped on Friday as investors fled to safe-haven bonds and gold after U.S. employment data signaled the economic recovery was losing traction. 

 The U.S. economy lost 131,000 jobs in July as more temporary U.S. census jobs ended, and private employers added fewer workers to their payrolls than expected in July. U.S. employment has become a major focus for investors as the economy shows signs of weakness while U.S. and European companies report strong profits. "Initial market reactions signal concerns about the impact of the poor employment picture on spending, corporate revenues and sustainable profitability," said Mohamed El-Erian, co-chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co in Newport Beach, California. "The U.S. Treasury market has been pricing in the muted growth outlook ... and the equity markets are now catching up," El-Erian added. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  dropped 141.03 points, or 1.32 percent, to 10,533.95 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  declined 15.72 points, or 1.40 percent, at 1,110.09, falling below its 200-day moving average. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 29.41 points, or 1.28 percent, to 2,263.65. Consumer stocks were among the biggest losers as the jobs report added to worries about consumer spending, while a drop in oil prices weighed on the energy sector. The S&P consumer discretionary index .GSPD fell 1.6 percent and energy shares .GSPE lost 1.8 percent. Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N was a bright spot, gaining 1.8 percent to $30.20 after it reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its target for cost savings from the acquisition of Cadbury. In Europe, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  declined 1.1 percent after a 0.4 percent gain before the U.S. jobs data. World stocks as measured by MSCI .MIWD00000PUS dropped 0.6 percent. The Thomson Reuters global stock index  .TRXFLDGLPU  fell 0.7 percent. Safe-haven bellwethers gained, with gold rising and yields on U.S. and German benchmark bonds declining. U.S. benchmark 10-year Treasury debt yields fell to a 15-month low, while two-year note yields dipped to a record low of 0.50 percent after the payrolls report. In late morning in New York, the 10-year yield was at 2.83 percent, down from 2.90 percent on Thursday. Gold, rose $12.65, or 1.06 percent, to $1,206.70 an ounce. The U.S. dollar fell to 85.20 yen, approaching a 15-year low, and fell against the euro at $1.3269 amid economic growth. DOLLAR DECLINES The jobs report "increases the odds of the Federal Reserve having to implement fresh stimulus measures to jump-start the recovery," said Joe Manimbo, an analyst at Travelex Global Business Payments in Washington. "Nothing is in there to argue for a firmer dollar." The dollar declined against a basket of major trading-partner currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.6 percent at 80.349. Investors are concerned the U.S. economy is slipping back from recovery and threatening to take the rest of the world with it. In recent weeks, however, investor sentiment has been boosted by a series of generally positive earnings reports, particularly from the financial sector. Among the latest were part-nationalized Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC ( RBS.L ), which reported a second-quarter operating profit of 869 million pounds, and Europe's biggest insurer, Allianz SE ( ALVG.DE ), which had stronger-than-expected operating profit. In commodities markets, wheat markets tumbled, posting their biggest daily percentage loss in nearly four months as investors took profits a day after panic buying pushed prices higher after Russia's suspended grain shipments due to its worst drought in a century. Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) front-month wheat futures were down 5 percent at $7.43 per bushel but below two-year highs as markets reacted to Russia's ban on grain exports. In other commodities, U.S. light sweet crude oil fell 1.1 pct to $81.13 per barrel. (Additional reporting by  Jennifer Ablan ,  Leah Schnurr  and  Steven C.
