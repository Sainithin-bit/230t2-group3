 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of the effect on auto makers and electronics makers following Friday's devastating earthquake and tsunami. 

 AUTO MAKERS - Toyota Motor Co ( 7203.T ) said production still stopped at all its 12 Japan factories until at least Wednesday. A three-day production halt would reduce output by 40,000 vehicles. The company also stopped scheduling overtime work in its North America plants. - Honda Motor Co ( 7267.T ) reiterated its plans to suspend all production in Japan until at least Sunday. Honda manufactured 69,170 cars in January in Japan, where it made 24 percent of its cars. - Nissan Motor Co ( 7201.T ) said output is stopped at all four of its car assembly factories in Japan. Nissan made 81,851 cars in January in Japan, where it manufactured 23 percent of its vehicles. Goldman Sachs said in a report that rough calculations indicated the profit impact of stopping production for one day would be about 6 billion yen ($74 million)for Toyota and 2 billion yen for Honda and Nissan. - Mazda Motor Corp ( 7261.T ) said it still plans to extend the suspension of production at two plants in southwestern Japan to March 20, but has not decided on how to proceed after that. - Fuji Heavy Industries Co ( 7270.T ) said all five of its car and car parts-related plants for its Subaru-brand vehicles in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, will be closed until at least Sunday. ELECTRONICS MAKERS: - Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) opened one factory, which makes optical films, used in LCDs and also manufactures adhesives, on Wednesday. Seven plants, which make an array of devices from IC cards to blu ray discs to lithium batteries, remain closed. Sony is not sure when the plans will resume operations. Some of the plants' output is supplied to other manufacturers, including customers overseas. - Toshiba ( 6502.T ) said output was still halted at a factory in Iwate prefecture making system LSI chips used in microprocessors and image sensors. It has begun work to bring the factory back on line but has no time frame to resume output. - Canon ( 7751.T ) said on Tuesday it may not be able to resume production this week at three plants that sustained serious damage in the quake. One manufactures lenses, another makes ink jet printers and the third produces equipment for manufacturing LCD screens. Company officials were unable to immediately comment on Wednesday. - Nikon Corp ( 7731.T ) said four of its production facilities were closed, including two out of its precision equipment plants, but the effect on cameras and lenses is seen as minor, since almost all output for those devices is done in Thailand. Nikon does not have a timetable to re-open the plants. - Panasonic ( 6752.T ) said on Tuesday continuing aftershocks were preventing it from inspecting factories in northern Japan, including those making optical pick-ups and other electronic parts, digital cameras and audio equipment. None of the manufacturing facilities was badly damaged but it would take time to resume operations as infrastructure needed to be restored, a company spokesman said. Company officials were unable to immediately comment on Wednesday. OTHERS - Shin-Etsu Chemical ( 4063.T ), the world's leading maker of silicon wafers, said two of its plants near the worst-hit areas remain offline. The firm is unable to say when operations will restart. A portion of the silicon wafer production at these plants is shipped to chip companies overseas. The company is trying to boost production elsewhere, particularly of 300-millimetre wafers, to make up the shortfall.
