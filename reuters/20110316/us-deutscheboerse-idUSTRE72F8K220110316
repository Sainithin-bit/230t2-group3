 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) has thought about "everything" that could thwart a combination with NYSE Euronext NYX.N, a board member for the Frankfurt Exchange operator said on Wednesday. 

 Upon being asked whether Deutsche Boerse would be ready to counter any rival offer for NYSE Euronext, Frank Gerstenschlaeger said it was too early to comment given that there was no rival offer. He said that the Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext combination was "difficult to top" adding: "We have thought about everything that could pose a risk to the deal." Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext clinched plans jointly to create the world's largest bourse last month, in a deal through which the German operator will own 60 percent of the combined group. Earlier this week, sources told Reuters that Nasdaq OMX Group Inc ( NDAQ.O ) was closer to making a counter-bid for NYSE Euronext. Such a move would challenge the Big Board's blockbuster deal with Deutsche Boerse by merging two of Wall Street's fiercest rivals. An offer could come as early as this week, the source said. If the merger between NYSE and Deutsche Boerse goes ahead, the new exchange which will have 2010 net revenues of $5.4 billion, will have dual headquarters in New York and Frankfurt and be incorporated in the Netherlands.
