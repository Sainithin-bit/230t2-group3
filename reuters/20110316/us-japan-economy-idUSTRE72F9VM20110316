 TOKYO  (Reuters) - A senior Japanese finance ministry official on Thursday declined to comment on the yen's surge to an all-time high against the dollar, or on whether G7 finance leaders will hold a conference call. 

 "I will not comment," the official told reporters, when asked about the yen's spike. The yen hit a record high against the dollar on Wednesday on expectations that Japanese investors will bring home cash from abroad to help finance reconstruction from a devastating earthquake that hit northeast Japan last Friday. The dollar fell more than 4 percent against the yen to as low as 76.25 yen on trading platform EBS, breaching a previous record low of 79.75 set on April 19, 1995. It now bounced back above 78.50 yen in choppy trade. The Group of Seven rich nations will discuss on Thursday possible steps to calm volatile financial markets roiled by fears about the deepening crisis in Japan. A G7 source told Reuters that G7 finance ministers and top central bankers would hold a conference call "late" on March 17. The source provided no further details.
