 BOCA RATON, Florida  (Reuters) - Starting next week, U.S. interest-rate futures traders will have three exchanges to choose from as NYSE Euronext NYX.N joins startup ELX Futures LP in challenging CME Group Inc's ( CME.O ) virtual monopoly in the contracts. 

 NYSE's U.S. futures market will begin offering futures tied to short-term U.S. interest rates on March 21, using a co-owned clearinghouse whose ten initial members include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Getco LLC, the market said in a statement on Wednesday. All are big users of CME's existing rate-futures franchise. "The enthusiasm will start to build as they see the machine work," Tom Callahan, chief of NYSE's U.S. futures unit, told Reuters on the sidelines of a Futures Industry Association meeting here. "Exchanges are all about momentum." NYSE last month agreed to combine with Germany's Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ), a move that would put virtually all European interest-rate futures trading under a single roof. The U.S. effort, which began two years ago, is unaffected by the merger plans and will go on as scheduled. "It's business as usual," said Gerry Jones, who heads NYSE Euronext's global derivatives business. NYSE has sought to differentiate its U.S. rate-futures offering from the competition by offering margin discounts to dealers that also use its clearinghouse to trade Treasuries and other fixed income securities. Discounts will eventually be offered to other types of traders, Callahan said. But CME, which owns the Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has said it will also offer margin discounts that will match or exceed those at NYSE. Taking on CME, even for a giant exchange operator like NYSE, will be tough, ELX Futures chief Neal Wolkoff said. ELX been fighting for a foothold against CME in rate futures since 2009, and now trades close to 100,000 contracts a day, to CME's 15 million. But Wolkoff counts his venture a success. "We have established a tremendous beachhead" against CME in the United States, Wolkoff said Tuesday. ELX plans to offer European rate futures to compete with NYSE and Deutsche Boerse as well, he said. Meanwhile, NYSE's U.S. plans do not pose a threat to ELX, Wolkoff said. "I'm not concerned that we are somehow going to be knocked out of the box," he said. "They need to prove something." (Reporting by Ann Saphir; Editing by Andrew Hay)
