 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Wednesday he is closely watching the currency market, a ruling party lawmaker said. 

 Noda made no mention of currency market intervention, Democratic Party lawmaker Yoshihiro Kawakami told reporters following a meeting with the minister. Noda was also quoted as saying the government is not considering tax hikes to fund an extra budget it is mulling to fund relief measures following last Friday's earthquake that hit northeastern Japan.
