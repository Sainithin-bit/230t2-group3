 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Japanese yen surged to a record high against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday, while two broad U.S. stock indexes erased their gains for the year as the appetite for risk evaporated in volatile trade on rising fears that Japan's nuclear crisis will slow the global economy. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq turned negative for 2011. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.04 percent, but clung to a modest gain for the year. Volatility in the market has surged on speculation that damage to nuclear reactors in Japan remain uncontained. Phil Flynn, senior market analyst with PFG Best in Chicago, said markets were trading "headline to headline, so I'm telling people not to overcommit to markets at this time." The yen reached 77.60 per U.S. dollar on the EBS trading platform, blowing through the April 1995 record of 79.75. Speculation that Japanese insurers will have to repatriate yen home to pay for claims was viewed as the main reason for the move. Traders are nervously watching whether the Bank of Japan will intervene in the currency market to stem the yen's gains. A stronger currency makes Japanese exports less competitive and hurts the economy. Heading into Thursday's Tokyo trading session, June Nikkei stock futures pointed to a weak open, with contracts traded in Chicago down 80 points at 8,450. The chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission on Wednesday told Congress that the agency would recommend an evacuation area larger than that already in place, also noting that radiation levels are "extremely high." U.S. Treasury bonds' prices surged as investors snapped up government debt in their flight to safety for a third straight day, driving prices up nearly a full point or more and pushing yields down to fresh three-month lows. Crude oil prices rose steadily on the escalating violence in the Middle East, giving investors another reason to sell riskier equities. Spot gold advanced. "We are so fixated here on Japan, and this intraday volatility is without question here to stay as we are all quickly learning what nuclear power is. You can throw everything else out the window," said Ryan Detrick, senior technical strategist at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio. The Dow  .DJI  lost 242.12 points, or 2.04 percent, to close at 11,613.30. The Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  fell 24.99 points, or 1.95 percent, to finish at 1,256.88. The Nasdaq  .IXIC  dropped 50.51 points, or 1.89 percent, to close at 2,616.82. For the year, the Dow is still up 0.31 percent. But the S&P 500 is down 0.06 percent and the Nasdaq is off 1.36 percent. "Based on the events now, it isn't impossible that the VIX could get up to where it was at the height of the (financial) crisis. It could triple," said PFG's Flynn. The CBOE Volatility Index or VIX .VIX, Wall Street's favorite measure of investor fear, rose 20.89 percent to close at 29.40, its highest level since July 6. In the last two days, the VIX is up nearly 40 percent. U.S. and European markets also weakened after the U.S. government said its Producer Price Index surged at its fastest pace in more than 1-1/2 years in February. MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.75 percent. Over the past three sessions, the index is down 3.79 percent. Following a near 20 percent, two-session dive in Japan's Nikkei average  .N225 , the market rose 5.7 percent on Wednesday, driving a recovery in Asia. The Nikkei, however, is down more than 11 percent for the year. The Eurofirst 300 Index  .FTEU3  dropped 1.6 percent, extending losses to a sixth straight day. Banks' shares led decliners after the Moody's downgrade of Portuguese debt. TREASURY DEBT PRICES, GOLD AND OIL GAIN Benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields declined to 3.19 percent, after earlier hitting a three-month low of 3.14 percent. Investors pushed the 10-year Treasury note's price up 30/32 of a point. Gold prices rebounded after two days of decline. Some focus in the precious metals market shifted back to loose monetary policies and geopolitical tensions, moving away from the nuclear crisis. Bullion was underpinned by a European Central Bank policymaker's comment that suggested the ECB could possibly delay an April interest-rate hike, and after the downgrade of Portugal by Moody's. "Now that the dust has settled a little bit and we've had particularly a recovery in energy and other commodities, that's given a tailwind to gold," HSBC analyst James Steel said. "If the focus ceases to be entirely on Japan, and the Middle East again gets some headlines, then the geopolitical risk levels will come back in and support gold." Spot gold prices rose $4.50, or 0.32 percent, to $1,398.40 an ounce. Brent crude for May rose $2.01 to settle at $110.60 a barrel. Concerns about the unrest in Bahrain -- where troops from OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia have intervened -- as well as intensifying clashes in the streets of Yemen, Syria and Algeria, overpowered the risk aversion caused by Japan's crisis. "The increasing unrest in Bahrain -- and the interest taken by Saudi Arabia in trying to resolve it -- must not be overlooked as a risk driver," said J.P. Morgan analyst Lawrence Eagles in New York.
