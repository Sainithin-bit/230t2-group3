 (Reuters) - Japanese policymakers are grappling with sharp swings in share prices and foreign exchange rates in the wake of last Friday's massive earthquake and an ensuing nuclear safety crisis. 

 While authorities have fired warning shots against a yen rise that could hurt Japan's key export sector, some ruling party lawmakers are calling for more radical measures to bolster stocks, including a ban on short-selling in futures markets. The yen edged lower on Wednesday, taking its cues from a short-covering bounce in Tokyo shares, but may see more gains in the near term as jitters about Japan's nuclear crisis keep investors on edge and their appetite for risk subdued. Following are some measures Japan has taken or mulled in the past to prop up share prices and to curb rises in the yen. GOVERNMENT STOCK BUYING -- Japan Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said he was not considering measures to support share prices on Tuesday when Japan's benchmark Nikkei average plunged 10.55 percent, its largest one-day fall since October 2008. But he cited a need to keep in mind a previous proposal for direct government buying of stocks from the market as one idea. -- Government buying of shares, not employed since the 1960s except for purchases by public pension funds, was floated by the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) early in 2009 after the global financial crisis sent Japanese shares tumbling. -- The LDP and its coalition ally sent a bill to parliament aimed at buying as much as 50 trillion yen ($620 billion) in shares, exchange-traded funds and derivatives from the market. -- But the proposed scheme was never implemented, in part because share prices eventually rebounded from their lows around 7,000 yen, the lowest since the bursting of an asset-price bubble in early 1990s. -- When the government last bought stocks directly from the market in the 1960s, it set up two consortiums in which private brokerages and banks took stakes that bought about 400 billion yen in shares. -- Japan intervened heavily in domestic share markets in the 1990s to support prices after the bursting of the bubble, using savings from public pension funds. Those efforts were deemed a failure, however, as they did not have a lasting impact. -- In 2002, when Japan was reeling from a banking crisis, the government launched a scheme to buy shares from banks. From 2002 to 2006, the government-owned Banks' Shareholdings Purchase Corp bought a total of 1.6 trillion yen in bank shareholdings that were a legacy of times when banks and firms exchanged shares to cement business ties. -- The share-buying scheme was revived after the global financial crisis triggered by Lehman Brothers' collapse. The scheme, effective for three years from 2009, had bought 549.5 billion yen of shares as of February. BOJ STOCK BUYING -- The BOJ bought 2.018 trillion yen in shares from banks from November 2002 to September 2004 as share prices plunged due to a banking crisis. The step was intended to contain the market impact as banks unloaded part of their massive shareholdings. -- The BOJ initially said it would buy up to 2 trillion yen of shares and the scheme was later expanded to 3 trillion yen. A recovery in Japanese share prices from mid-2003, however, reduced banks' need to offload shares. -- The BOJ also revived the share-buying scheme during the latest global financial crisis, from 2009 to 2010, but only bought 387.8 billion yen in shares as there was limited interest in making use of the programme. -- In October 2010, the BOJ announced plans for an asset-buying scheme that included the unprecedented purchase of relatively high-risk assets, among them 450 billion yen in exchange-traded funds and 50 billion yen in real estate investment trusts. The aim was to push down long-term rates and risk premiums, rather than to shore up the markets. -- The move sent the index for REITs soaring and helped to boost share prices. -- This week, in the aftermath of the devastating earthquake and tsunami, the BOJ decided to double the scale of its asset-buying scheme to 10 trillion yen. It will purchase an additional 450 billion yen of ETFs and 50 billion yen of REITs, while increasing the weighting of relatively high-risk assets in the scheme. FOREX INTERVENTION -- Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda repeated this week that he was closely watching currency moves while one of his senior staff told Reuters that Japan was ready to step into the market again as the yen approached a 15 year high above 80 yen versus the dollar. -- Japanese authorities spent 2.1249 trillion yen on currency intervention in the month to September 28 last year, their first foray into the foreign exchange market in more than six years. They subsequently stayed out of the market at least until February 24, according to Ministry of Finance data. -- From January 2003 to March 2004, Japan spent 35 trillion yen, roughly 7 percent of its gross domestic product, to prevent yen rises from derailing an export-driven economic recovery. -- Before that 15-month bout of currency intervention, Japan often stepped into the currency markets to stem yen strength by making sizable dollar purchases. Those purchases are believed to make up the bulk of its $1 trillion reserves, the world's second-largest after China.
