 KURGAN, Russia  (Reuters) - Russia is ready to work with OPEC on possible oil output cuts, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday. 

 "Our partners and colleagues from the oil club are very actively asking us (to work with them). In order to maintain a coordinated policy... We are ready to do this," Medvedev told journalists during a visit to the southern Urals city of Kurgan. "Such protective measures could be linked to a cut in oil output as well as taking part in existing supplier organizations or new organizations," Medvedev said.
