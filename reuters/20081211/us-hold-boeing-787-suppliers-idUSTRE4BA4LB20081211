 (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) pushed back the schedule for its troubled 787 Dreamliner for the fourth time on Thursday, making its new plane almost two years late and further angering its airline customers and risking cancellations [nN10345264]. 

 The project has been hit by a series of problems with suppliers and shortages of parts, aggravated by a recent machinists' strike at Boeing. The U.S. planemaker is pioneering a new way of making its latest carbon-composite aircraft, outsourcing most of the structure and components to companies around the world and assembling the pieces at its plant in Everett, Washington.
