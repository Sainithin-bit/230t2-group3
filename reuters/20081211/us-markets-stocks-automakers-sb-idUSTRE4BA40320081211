 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co fell sharply on Thursday ahead of an expected Senate vote on a rescue plan for the ailing automakers. 

 GM shares fell 12 percent to $4.03, while Ford shares fell 5.5 percent to $3.07. The proposal, providing up to $14 billion in loans to the beleaguered companies, was cleared by the House of Representatives by 237-170 on Wednesday. Still, its prospects looked grim in the Senate.
