 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The legislation crafted in  recent days aimed at helping the ailing U.S. automakers is an "effective and responsible approach," the White House said on Wednesday amid criticism from fellow Republicans. 

 "Many Republicans and Democrats agree that a disorderly bankruptcy could be fatal to U.S. automakers and have devastating impacts on jobs, families and our economy," White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said in a statement. "We believe the legislation developed in recent days is an effective and responsible approach to deal with troubled automakers and ensure the necessary restructuring occurs," she said. Perino added that the administration would work with Democrats and Republicans to finish legislation "that will lead to restructured and viable automakers, while protecting the taxpayer's interests."
