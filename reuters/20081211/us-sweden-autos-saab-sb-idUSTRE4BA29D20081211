 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The Swedish government is set to unveil on Thursday emergency measures to support Saab Automobile, owned by struggling U.S. auto maker General Motors, a Swedish newspaper reported. 

 Business daily Dagens Industri reported on its Web site, without identifying its sources, that the measures included short-term loans as well as loan guarantees. Saab declined to comment on the report. The government has called a news conference for 1100 GMT, but officials declined to comment on what would presented. Ford and General Motors, the respective owners of Volvo Cars and Saab Automobile, both want to sell their Swedish units and have held talks with the government over possible support.
