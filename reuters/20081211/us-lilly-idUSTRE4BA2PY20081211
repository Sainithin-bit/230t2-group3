 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) forecast weaker-than-expected 2009 profit on Thursday, because of costs tied to its acquisition of ImClone Systems Inc and weaker foreign currencies. 

 Lilly, which is holding its analyst day in New York, forecast 2009 earnings per share of $4 to $4.25, including a 30 cent to 35 cent hit from the ImClone acquisition, which was completed last month. Analysts on average expected $4.26 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Many analysts underestimated costs from the $6.5 billion deal for the biotechnology company, according to Lilly. Lilly shares were unchanged at $35.01 in premarket trading. Excluding costs from the ImClone deal, Lilly expects earnings of $4.35 to $4.55 next year, which would equate to annual growth of 8 percent to 15 percent. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker outbid Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY.N ) for ImClone, maker of the colon cancer drug Erbitux and three experimental cancer drugs that Lilly expects to be in late-stage studies next year. But some analysts and investors contend the ImClone deal will not make up for revenue lost to generic rivals, including Lilly's $4.8 billion-a-year schizophrenia drug Zyprexa, which faces U.S. generic competition in October 2011. To help fill the void, Lilly is counting on U.S. approval of a blood-clot preventer called prasugrel, a potential blockbuster that has been twice delayed by U.S. regulators. Lilly said it remains in talks with regulators and anticipates launching the drug next year. Lilly also said it expects to seek approval by the end of the first half of 2009 for its a once-weekly version of its diabetes drug, exenatide, also known as Byetta. Recent reports of pancreatitis associated with Byetta have clouded the prospects of the new version, which Lilly is developing with Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc AMLN.O. Lilly also pushed back the timeline by two years for its experimental lymphoma drug, enzastaurin, because the company is considering expanding a late-stage clinical trial. It now expects to seek U.S. approval for enzastaurin in mid-2013. The company backed its long-term forecast of double-digit compound annual earnings per share growth between 2007 and 2011. Because of a huge charge from the ImClone acquisition, Lilly now expects to post a loss of $1.56 to $2.06 per share for 2008. But, excluding items, the company still expects 2008 earnings of $3.97 to $4.02 per share. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  and Ransdell Pierson; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Steve Orlofsky)
