 (Reuters) - Senate Republicans have more than enough votes to block a White House-backed bill to bail out the U.S. auto industry, forcing fresh talks among lawmakers to find alternative. 

 Here is where the political players in Washington stand: THE WHITE HOUSE: The Bush administration, which retains power until January 20, negotiated a compromise $14 billion bailout deal with Democrats. Vice President Cheney and senior White House officials have lobbied senators but their influence is waning in the final weeks of an unpopular administration. White House officials insisted on Thursday that there was still a chance legislation could be approved. CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS: Democrats who control both chambers of Congress pushed a bill through the House of Representatives on Wednesday, but it is stalled in the Senate. Senate Democrats hold a razor-thin majority and do not believe they have the votes to get their bailout plan over procedural hurdles despite conditions to force restructuring and hold automakers accountable for repayment. They plan to hold a procedural vote later Thursday or Friday. CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS: Republicans hold all the cards in the bailout debate and oppose the Democratic plan as not "nearly tough enough." Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee offered an alternative that prompted new talks among lawmakers from both parties. It would force automakers to obtain concessions from labor, bondholders and other stakeholders before receiving bailout loans. Companies would have to seek bankruptcy protection if conditions for loans are not met by a fixed date. Fueling Republican opposition is voter backlash from the $700 billion financial services industry rescue and public skepticism of new bailouts. Key opponents are lawmakers who want union wages brought in line with scales paid to non-union workers at auto plants operated by foreign automakers in their states. PRESIDENT-ELECT BARACK OBAMA: President-elect Barack Obama hopes for a congressional deal to avert a potential industry collapse. Obama told a news conference on Thursday he remained in favor of short-term government assistance to the industry that would keep it operating and accountable to the U.S. taxpayers. Obama had solid support from labor unions during his presidential campaign and won Michigan handily as well as Ohio and Indiana, other auto states. (Edited by Philip Barbara)
