 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc ( AMAT.O ) expects revenue in its current fourth quarter to rise 2 percent to 10 percent from the prior period, the company's chief financial officer said on Tuesday. 

 Chief Financial Officer George Davis also said on a conference call that earnings per share in the fourth quarter should be in a range of 12 cents to 15 cents. Davis said that the revenue gain would be helped by good demand in its products used to make solar panels. He also said that he expected orders to be up in the fourth quarter in a range of 5 percent to 10 percent when compared with the third quarter. Analysts currently expect revenue in the fourth quarter of $2.02 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Duncan Martell , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
