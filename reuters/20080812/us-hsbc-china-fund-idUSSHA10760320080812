 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - The plunge of China's stock market has created long-term buying opportunities in infrastructure and consumer shares, the head of HSBC's ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) asset management unit said on Tuesday. 

 "Even after you modify China's growth rate down, it's still showing very strong and solid growth forecasts in the coming years," Mark McCombe, chief executive of HSBC Group Investment Businesses, said in an interview in Shanghai. "The upside should be better than the downside at the moment and we don't think we have much further to go," he said of the market's slide. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index sank to a fresh 19-month closing low of 2,457.198 points on Tuesday, down 60 percent from last October's record peak. It has been hit by heavy supplies of fresh equity and concern that a slowing economy will hurt corporate profit growth. But McCombe said that though the U.S. economic slowdown was dampening emerging markets, China's long-term outlook for economic growth remained strong enough to justify investment in infrastructure and consumer shares that would benefit from expanding domestic demand. "When I was here a year ago, you had a stock market which was booming and you had the currency appreciating," he said at the Shanghai office of HSBC Jintrust Fund Management Co, HSBC's China fund venture, which was founded in 2005. "These things cannot go on forever." DIVERSITY Despite this year's turmoil in global markets, McCombe said HSBC's asset management business would continue to grow because of its diversity in terms of regions, asset classes and customer types. "When one region, one asset class, one type of customer are conservative, the others may be growing, so you get a nice mix and you're still able to grow your business." HSBC Group Investment's assets under management were $395 billion on June 30, up from $343 billion a year earlier, with about half of the money coming from Europe. McCombe also said he did not believe that sharp pull-backs in the prices of commodities including crude oil over the last few weeks marked the start of extended downtrends. "Personally, I would not describe it as a bear market in commodities, because I believe global demand will still put (upward) pressure on the prices, particularly growth in emerging markets such as Asia where there's a lot of consumer demand."
