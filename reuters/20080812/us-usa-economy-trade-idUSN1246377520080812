 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit shrank unexpectedly in June, as the weak U.S. dollar helped push exports higher and overpowered the effect of record-high prices for imported oil, a Commerce Department report showed on Tuesday. 

  KEY POINTS: * The trade gap totaled $56.8 billion, down from a revised estimate of $59.2 billion in May.  * The monthly tally was also much lower than the $61.5 billion midpoint estimate of analysts surveyed before the report.  * Both exports and imports of goods and services set records in June, but exports rose by 4.0 percent compared to a 1.8 percent gain for imports.  * The deficit totaled $351.4 billion for the first six months of the year, down slightly from $358.4 billion in the same period in 2007.  COMMENTS:  DUSTIN REID, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, ABN AMRO, CHICAGO "It's better than expected. The real trade data was also probably a bit better than expected, which means there is likely to be some upward revisions for Q2 GDP when we get the second round of data. I don't think the (dollar) move is significant. I think there might be some people just trying to get out of recently established long dollar positions on the back of stronger than expected data."  BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER,  NEW JERSEY: "Relatively minimal dollar reaction on an outright positive trade deficit suggests a dollar top might be in place. Exports rose the most 4 years, so little evidence (as of June) that slowing global growth was hurting the U.S. outlook. The data is a bit old at this point, so the market could justifiably ignore it, but it will add to Q2 GDP revisions, the inflation adjusted trade deficit narrowed to $39.1 billion from $43.5 billion with exports still rising. It's all dollar-positive, so the lack of reaction tells us that dollar profit-taking en vogue at the moment."  BETH MALLOY, BOND MARKET ANALYST, RESEARCH COMPANY,  BRIEFING.COM, CHICAGO: "The narrowing was a surprise. It is an overall negative for Treasuries because that is playing into growth expectations."  KURT KARL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK: "We are getting slow and sure for a turnaround. Underlying exports still show an improvement after taking into account inflation. This will support growth going into the third quarter. The deficit is heading in the right direction. I say we are in a recession so the trade balance typically gets better because we import less."  GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS: "The June U.S. trade gap was expected to widen but instead it narrowed. Our weak economy is damping the demand for imports. In particular, if you exclude oil, we saw imports decline in June, led by a decrease in capital good imports. This is slightly favorable for second-quarter GDP; imports will be a little less of a drag on economic growth than appeared earlier. But weaker imports still reflect the overall weakness in the U.S. economy. We may start the third quarter with weak demand for imported capital goods."  MARKET REACTION:  STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures hold losses on the session  BONDS: U.S. Treasury prices were steady at higher levels  DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rises versus the euro  RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures suggest about a 20 percent chance of September FOMC rate hike.
