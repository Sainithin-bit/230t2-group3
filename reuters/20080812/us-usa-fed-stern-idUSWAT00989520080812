 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lower oil prices should help keep inflation under control and the U.S. central bank should be "patient" in its approach to monetary policy, the head of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank said on Tuesday. 

 "It should help to alleviate some of the inflation concerns and inflation pressures that we had been confronting, assuming this sticks," Minneapolis Fed chief Gary Stern said of the sharp fall in oil prices in an interview on CNBC television. "My guess is it's going to pay to be patient (on interest rates) at this point," said Stern, a voting member this year on the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. A month ago, Stern was expressing concern that inflation risks were on the rise. On Tuesday he indicated the mix of lower oil prices and tight credit might merit holding off on rate rises. Stern said tight credit conditions were reminiscent of the period in the early 1990s when a scarcity of credit restrained growth for two or three years. He suggested the economy faces similar constraints now because lenders have grown cautious in the wake of subprime mortgage losses. "I think it'll taken some time for these headwinds to diminish," Stern said, "In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't pick up a little more momentum first." Stern said that policy-makers will inevitably see a series of mixed signals when the economy does begin to grow more normally and it must be ready to act quickly to avert any possibility of inflation getting out of control. "If you wait till you have conclusive evidence, you run the risk of waiting too long," he said. "The real message is that you've got to be willing, at some point along the way, to say 'you know, I have enough confidence in my outlook that it's time to go'," Stern said. Fed policymakers voted 10-1 on August 5, at the most recent meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, to keep the benchmark federal funds rate at 2 percent where it has been since April. Stern indicated that cheaper energy costs made it easier for the Fed to stay on hold. "From my perception, some of the concerns about inflation and inflation expectations seem to have diminished," he said. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville  and  Tim Ahmann ; Editing by Tom Hals)
