 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales are expected to have slipped in July after a small increase in June as the effect of U.S. tax rebates waned, according to a Reuters survey. 

 Economists polled by Reuters estimated that retail sales slipped 0.1 percent in July after a slight 0.1 percent increase in June. "The July report will likely show broad-based slowing in spending," said economists at UBS. "Tax rebates probably are no longer boosting sales growth." Excluding autos, sales were forecast to have risen 0.5 percent, according to the economists, after an 0.8 percent jump in June. Forecasts from the 85 economists polled for a retail sales forecast ranged from a drop of 1.0 percent to an increase of 0.7 percent. Forecasts from the 80 economists who estimated retail sales excluding autos ranged from a rise of 0.1 percent to a 1.0 percent increase. The retail sales report is due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) on Wednesday. Here is a selection of comments from economists: MICHAEL MORAN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, DAIWA AMERICA SECURITIES: Forecasts: 0.1 percent 0.6 percent ex-autos "As in other recent months, a drop in sales of new vehicles is likely to constrain the auto component and lead to minimal growth in the headline figure. Elsewhere, tax rebates should provide support in several categories. In addition, higher prices are likely to inflate the value of sales at service stations." RDQ ECONOMICS: Forecast: minus 0.5 percent 0.4 percent ex-autos "Chain store sales results were weaker than expected in July and point to some moderation in general merchandise spending (this area of the retail sales report has risen in each of the last five months, by 9.6 percent at an annual rate over that period). We look for non-auto retail sales to have risen 0.4 percent in July. Manufacturers reported an 8.3 percent plunge in unit auto sales in July. Given this, we see total retail sales down 0.5 percent in July." UBS: FORECAST: minus 0.7 percent 0.2 percent ex-autos "The July report will likely show broad-based slowing in spending: Auto sales plunged, and soft sales ex-autos and gasoline probably mostly offset a price-related rise in gasoline outlays (the data are nominal). "Tax rebates probably are no longer boosting sales growth. About 86 percent of the rebates had been sent out by the end of July, with 44 percent in May, 26 percent in June, but only another 12 percent coming in July. In mid-July, 40 percent of individuals reported having spent all or most of their rebates, well above the earlier reported 22 percent who had planned to do so. The higher spend-out rate, with less of the rebates saved than had been intended, suggests larger consumption cutbacks later."
