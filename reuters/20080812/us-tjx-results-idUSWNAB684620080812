 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc ( TJX.N ) posted a higher quarterly profit on Tuesday as cash-strapped shoppers headed to its stores for deals on clothes, and the off-price retailer and raised its full-year earnings forecast. 

 The operator of chains including T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and A.J. Wright said profit rose to $200.22 million, or 45 cents per share, for the fiscal second quarter ended July 26, from $59.03 million, or 13 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest quarter's results included a charge of 2 cents per share, while its year-ago results included a charge of 25 cents per share due to a computer system security breach. Excluding the charge, TJX's adjusted earnings per share were 47 cents for the latest quarter, matching Wall Street's view for earnings of 47 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose 7 percent to $4.6 billion, while comparable store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, rose 4 percent. TJX has not been hit as hard as other retailers by the weak U.S. economy as consumers trade down and search out deals to save money amid rising gasoline and food prices. Last week the retailer, which buys excess merchandise in bulk at below-wholesale prices, posted a 3 percent rise in July same-store sales. That was slightly below Wall Street estimates, but it raised its profit forecast for the second quarter. For its full fiscal year, TJX expects earnings per share of $2.26 to $2.31. In May, the company said it expected full year earnings of $2.20 to $2.25 a share. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Gerald E. McCormick and  Derek Caney )
