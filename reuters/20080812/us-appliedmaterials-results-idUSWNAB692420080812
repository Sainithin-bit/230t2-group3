 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Applied Materials Inc ( AMAT.O ), the No. 1 computer-chip equipment maker, posted a lower quarterly profit as revenue slid 28 percent amid a slump in its industry. 

 Applied said on Tuesday net income for its third fiscal quarter fell to $164.8 million, or 12 cents per share, from $473.5 million, or 34 cents per share, a year ago. Revenue fell to $1.85 billion from $2.56 billion. Applied, along with others in the chip equipment industry, have suffered from a glut of manufacturing capacity in the memory chip market.
