 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Trucking company YRC Worldwide Inc. ( YRCW.O ) said on Monday that it will merge the management teams of its two largest units as it moves to cut costs and boost efficiency in subsidiaries acquired through acquisitions. 

 Overland Park, Kansas-based YRC said in a statement that Yellow Transportation and Roadway will be led by a single management team for "accelerated business growth." In an interview after the announcement YRC Chief Executive Officer Bill Zollars told Reuters that creating a single management team will allow the company to "go after the next round of cost reductions." Zollars said YRC will detail the cost reductions during its fourth-quarter earnings conference call in late January. "Having one team also presents us with the opportunity to grow our business more effectively," he added. Roadway President Mike Smid will head the new team. Following the acquisition of trucking companies USF in December 2003 and Roadway in May 2005, YRC has been cutting costs to boost efficiency and streamline operations. In 2006 YRC planned overall cost reductions of $130 million for both units and the company has said repeatedly that there is room for further cost cutting in 2007. "We have lots of opportunity on the cost side," Zollars said. YRC also said on Monday that it has created a single group to handle sales and customer service for all of its transportation and logistics brands. This group will be run by Chief Marketing Officer Greg Reid. "This will provide our sales people with a comprehensive sales view of our national and global businesses and allow a more coordinated approach to sales," Zollars said. He added that YRC will provide updated earnings targets that include the expected impact of the new sales team during its fourth-quarter conference call. YRC is the largest U.S. less-than-truckload operator. Less-than-truckload companies consolidate smaller loads into a single truck. The company has recently expanded into China, where it has acquired two trucking companies to serve U.S. customers operating in that market. In 2005 YRC reported revenue of $8.74 billion, compared with $6.77 billion.
