 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A fire at a Chevron ( CVX.N ) refinery 
in Richmond, California has sent flames leaping 50 feet into 
the air and an employee reported workers were being evacuated, 
local KGO television reported on its Web site. 

  KGO said toll operators at the nearby Richmond-San Rafael 
bridge were removed due to health concerns. A Chevron spokesman 
was not immediately available for comment.
