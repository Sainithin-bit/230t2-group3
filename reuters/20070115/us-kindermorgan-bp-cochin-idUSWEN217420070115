 CALGARY, Alberta  (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Energy Partners ( KMP.N ) said on Monday it pay BP Plc ( BP.L ) $50 million for the half stake in Canada's main natural gas liquids pipeline it doesn't already own. 

 Kinder Morgan, which has been boosting its interest in the Cochin Pipeline since 2000, will own all of the line, which runs 1,900 miles to Windsor, Ontario, from Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, it said. Cochin carries such hydrocarbon liquids stripped from natural gas as propane and butane across three Canadian provinces and seven U.S. states. Interests have changed hands several times over the past decade. Houston-based Kinder Morgan will take over as operator when the transaction closes, likely in the current quarter, it said. BP will remain a shipper.
