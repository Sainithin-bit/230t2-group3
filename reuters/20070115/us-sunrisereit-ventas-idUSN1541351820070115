 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Ventas Inc. ( VTR.N ) is offering to buy Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust's SRZ.N SZR_u.TO private pay assisted living communities for US$1.8 billion including debt, the companies said on Monday. 

 Ventas is offering C$15 for every Sunrise unit to gain access to Sunrise's interest in 74 private pay assisted living communities in the U.S. and Canada, as well as the exclusive right of first offer to acquire other newly developed assets in Canada and portions of the United States. The offer price represents a 35.7-percent premium over Sunrise units' closing price of C$11.05 Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. On Monday morning, units of Sunrise rose C$3.85, or 35 percent, to C$14.90. The transaction values the equity of Sunrise REIT at about C$1.14 billion and the total enterprise at about C$2.14 billion ($1.8 billion), the companies said. The 74 communities are located in demographically desirable metropolitan areas of 17 states and two Canadian provinces, Ventas said. It expects the assets to increase revenue from private pay assets to about two-thirds of its total revenue. ($1=$1.17 Canadian)
