 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China drew a record $63.0 billion in 
foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2006, up 5 percent from 
2005, the official Xinhua news agency cited Commerce Minister 
Bo Xilai as saying on Monday. 

  It gave no figure for December alone, but China reported 
cumulative FDI of $54.26 billion in the first 11 months, 
pointing to December FDI of around $8.74 billion.  In all of 2005 China drew $60.33 billion in FDI, down 
slightly from the previous record of $60.6 billion in 2004.  Xinhua did not explain how it had arrived at the percentage 
growth figure for 2006. The $63.0 billion figure it reported is 
4.43 percent greater than the $60.3 billion reported for 2005.  The figures cited by the Commerce Ministry do not include 
investments by foreigners in the financial sector.  Xinhua also cited Bo as saying that investment overseas by 
Chinese firms rose 32 percent from a year earlier in 2006, to 
$16.1 billion.  Beijing, intent to stimulate capital outflows to ease the 
upward pressure on the yuan  CNY=CFXS , has been encouraging 
its companies to invest abroad to secure resources, build 
brands and win market share.  Such outbound investments more than doubled in 2005 to 
$12.3 billion.
