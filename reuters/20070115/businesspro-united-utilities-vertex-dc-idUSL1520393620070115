 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's United Utilities ( UU.L ) said 
it had sold its Vertex outsourcing business to a consortium of 
private equity firms led by Oak Hill of the United States for 
217.5 million pounds ($420.7 million). 

  "Completion of the sale is expected by the end of March," 
the company said in a statement on Monday.  United Utilities had announced in December that it was to 
sell its Vertex business as part of its strategy to focus on 
its core skills of managing water, wastewater, electricity and 
gas networks.  "We believe this transaction serves the best interests of 
our shareholders, allowing the group to concentrate on its core 
skills," Chief Executive Philip Green said in a statement.  "We aim to be a world class operator of utility 
infrastructure," he added.  United Utilities provides water to around 7 million 
customers in northwest England and electricity to about 2.2 
million domestic and industrial users across Britain.  The sale price of 217.5 million pounds comprises cash, the 
repayment of intra-group debt and the retention by the buyer of 
certain Vertex liabilities.  The consortium of U.S.-based private equity firms also 
includes GenNx360 and Knox Lawrence International.
