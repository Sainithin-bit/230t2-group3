 LONDON  (Reuters) - United Utilities ( UU.L ) on Monday is expected to announce the sale of its Vertex outsourcing unit to a private equity consortium led by Oak Hill of the United States for between 215 million and 220 million pounds ($415.9 million and $425.5 million), the Financial Times reported. 

 The Daily Telegraph also said the utility could announce the sale to the London Stock Exchange as early as Monday. It said the deal was worth about 217 million pounds. Neither newspaper quoted a source. A comment was not immediately available from the firm. United Utilities, which provides water to around 7 million customers in northwest England and electricity to about 2.2 million domestic and industrial users across Britain, said in December it planned to sell the unit, which accounts for around 5 percent of revenue. It asked investment bank Merrill Lynch to rustle up would-be buyers.
