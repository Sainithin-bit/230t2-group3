 ALBANY, California  (Reuters) - A fire at a Chevron ( CVX.N ) 
refinery in Richmond, California, on Monday sent flames leaping 
as high as 100 feet into the air but the fire appears contained 
to a small area, a Contra Costa County official said. 

  "It looks like the fire is contained to a small area in the 
crude unit," which is where the fire started, said Tony 
Semenza, executive director of county's emergency response.
