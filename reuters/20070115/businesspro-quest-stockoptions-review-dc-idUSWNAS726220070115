 (Reuters) - Quest Software Inc. QSFT.O said it will 
restate certain prior results after a special committee 
determined that the company misdated some stock options from 
July 1998 to May 2002. 

  The committee's preliminary estimate of the pre-tax, 
non-cash stock option expense arising from its findings is 
about $150 million through the period ended March 31, 2006, the 
company said in a statement.
