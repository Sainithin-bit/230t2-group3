 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ) posted its first profit in almost three years on Tuesday, beating Wall Street estimates, but its shares fell as orders for its new line of smaller, cheaper houses came in lower than expected. 

 The company, one of the top five U.S. homebuilders, reported earnings of $100.7 million, or $1.31 per share, for the fourth quarter ended November 30, compared with a year-earlier loss of $307.3 million, or $3.96 per share. Wall Street expected a profit of 42 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. KB last made a profit in the first quarter of 2007. The company raised the possibility it will return to sustained profitability in the second half of 2010, but stopped short of making a definitive forecast. "As we sell through the spring season, we should have greater visibility on the direction of the market and overall economy, and we can then be in a better position to plot the trajectory of our return to profitability," Chief Executive Jeffrey Mezger said during a conference call with analysts. Excluding a tax benefit of $191.7 million from an extension of a federal tax law allowing companies to apply losses to prior income, the company posted a fourth-quarter loss of $91 million as revenue slumped 27 percent to $674.6 million. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For a graphic on the fourth quarter's results, click link.reuters.com/bup23h ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Los Angeles-based KB's orders rose 12 percent to 1,446 homes during the quarter, but that was still slightly less than Morningstar analyst Eric Landry forecast, especially since orders rose 62 percent in the third quarter. At the end of the quarter, KB found itself at a disadvantage because the company's policy against building "spec" homes that are close to finished meant it did not have enough on hand for buyers taking advantage of the federal tax credit set to expire in November. "Not building spec homes is a fine strategy, but spec volume helps absorb fixed overhead costs," said Macquarie Securities analyst Ken Zener. To avoid the same problem when the tax credit, subsequently extended, threatens to expire again in April, the company is considering having some homes ready at a more advanced stage of construction in the spring, it said during the call. Also, expectations for KB's orders were particularly high, Landry said, because of the buzz surrounding the company's new "Open Series" of smaller, cheaper homes designed to compete directly with foreclosures. "This was a very solid quarter operationally, but given the strong momentum of stock since the beginning of the year, it is retreating a little bit," Zener said. KB's shares were up 17 percent year to date before the company released its results. Like KB, rival Lennar Corp ( LEN.N ), posted an order increase and its first profit since the first quarter of 2007, but Lennar's shares rose on those results. Expectations for Lennar's order numbers were not as high as they were for KB's, Landry said. Heading into the first quarter, some see demand resulting from the tax credit leveling off. KB said it will lose money in its first quarter, as did Lennar. While the housing market seems to be stabilizing in some regions, Mezger said, economic weakness, unemployment, and rising foreclosures and mortgage loan delinquencies, as well as changing U.S. government policies could undermine that trend. KB shares were down 6 percent at $15.39 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange trading. (Reporting by Helen Chernikoff; editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Andre Grenon )
