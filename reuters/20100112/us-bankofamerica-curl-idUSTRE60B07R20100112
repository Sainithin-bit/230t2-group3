 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America executive Gregory Curl is expected to lose the chief risk officer post he has held since mid-2009 as new Chief Executive Brian Moynihan installs his own circle of close lieutenants, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition. 

 Curl's new duties likely would include managing certain relationships, but people close to him said he probably will leave Bank of America after an unspecified period of time, the Journal reported on Monday. Moynihan became CEO on January 1, succeeding Kenneth Lewis. Bank of America was not immediately available to comment on the Journal report. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by  Gary Hill )
