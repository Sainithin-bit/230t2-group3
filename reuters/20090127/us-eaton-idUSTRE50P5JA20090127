 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - For a global industrial company facing slowing markets, shrinking developed economies, and the headwind of a rising U.S. dollar, it is best to cut costs and jobs as early in the downturn as possible, Eaton Corp Chief Executive Sandy Cutler said on Monday. 

 Deciding where to cut, and how deeply, poses a challenge to even the most experienced management team, said Cutler, whose company has cut about 8,600 full-time jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, over the past year. "It's hard to estimate when markets will bottom and then how long they'll be there," Cutler said in an interview. "The management team has been through multiple recessions, and knows you have to attack cost structure very early. If you don't attack them early, you can never get ahead of them." A slowdown that initially hit the financial sector has now moved to manufacturers, he said, and this is the first simultaneous, liquidity-driven downturn since the Great Depression. Its speed, meanwhile, is faster than past recessions. "We were really trying to make these (jobs) decisions in the October time frame, and we've seen in almost every month, the outlook keeps getting darker." Eaton, which provides detailed economic and market forecasts when it reports quarterly earnings, said Monday that economic models created after recessions in the 1990s and 2000s are "not tremendously helpful." As a result, the diversified industrial manufacturer issued a much wider-than-usual 2009 earnings forecast on Monday, estimating full-year operating profit in a range of $4.20 to $5.20 per share. In the past, the range was about 50 cents, Cutler said. Eaton said it may have to cut costs further as conditions change. Eaton estimates U.S. gross domestic product will contract in each of the first two quarters of the 2009, on top of a steep expected contraction in the fourth quarter of 2008. The government is set to report fourth-quarter GDP data on Friday. Separately, Cutler said the recent strength of the U.S. dollar was a key variable this year, and under current estimates, it would reduce 2009 sales by about 6 percent. The euro as well as the Brazilian and Chinese currencies, are the most important to Eaton's outlook, Cutler said. The currency impact comes against the backdrop of shrinking U.S., European and Japanese economies, and rapidly slowing growth rates in Brazil, India and China. "You're getting a double whammy from the change in the value of the U.S. dollar as well as this contraction," Cutler said. Earlier, Eaton reported a lower quarterly profit, but the results beat Wall Street estimates. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
