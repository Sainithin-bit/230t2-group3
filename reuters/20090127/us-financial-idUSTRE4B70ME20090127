 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Governments strung together lifelines to rescue their battered economies on Tuesday as the worldwide financial crisis that has cost trillions of dollars and claimed millions of jobs ground on. 

 Britain announced $3.25 billion of loan guarantees to its automakers, Japan pledged $16.7 billion to the small- and medium-sized companies at the heart of its economy and Canada's government proposed a two-year, $32 billion stimulus package, its hold on power requiring opposition support for the plan. U.S. President Barack Obama also went to opposition lawmakers to gain support for his $825 billion stimulus proposal. But despite polls showing optimism over the new president's inauguration, U.S. consumer confidence fell to a record low in January, The Conference Board said, as layoffs grew and the housing market continued to struggle. U.S. home prices plunged a record 18.2 percent in November from a year earlier, according to an index from Standard & Poor's. "Consumers remain quite pessimistic about the state of the economy," said Lynn Franco, director of The Conference Board Research Center. "Until we begin to see considerable improvements in the expectations index, we can't say the worst of times are behind us." In Germany, however, corporate sentiment improved in December for the first time in eight months, defying fears it would dip to a new post-reunification low for January. Oil fell 9 percent after the bleak U.S. economic data raised concerns over demand. PLANS IN CANADA, RUSSIA Governments continued crafting rescue plans. Canada's minority Conservative government laid out a budget and stimulus package that would result in a deficit after 11 years of surplus. The stimulus, amounting to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product this year, would consist of tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners, infrastructure spending and wide-ranging targeted loans and measures to bolster the financial system. Two opposition parties immediately rejected the plan but the more influential Liberals were widely expected to approve it -- though not until Wednesday. In Russia, sources told Reuters that the government was set to help top bank Sberbank and other lenders with a second bailout package worth more than $27 billion. One government source said Russia planned to offer Sberbank a 500 billion rouble loan. Shortly before Obama arrived on Capitol Hill, House Minority Leader John Boehner urged fellow Republicans to oppose the stimulus bill, which could go to a vote on Wednesday. Republicans complain the bill's $550 billion spending component is excessive, while its tax cuts of $275 billion are not enough. After the meeting, Obama told reporters: "The key right now is to make sure that we keep politics to a minimum. There are some legitimate philosophical differences with parts of my plan .. and I respect that. In some cases they may just not be as familiar with what is in the package as I would like." Governments around the world have spent hundreds of billions of dollars on bank bailouts and fiscal stimulus, while central banks have slashed interest rates to record lows since a U.S. housing slump burst a global credit bubble. Meanwhile, individuals have lost trust in business, questioning industry's ability to bring prosperity, according to a survey released on Tuesday. The biggest drops came in Ireland, Japan and the United States. U.S. stocks rose on better-than-expected results from American Express and chipmaker Texas Instruments, and a profit jump by US Steel Corp. The blue-chip Dow added 0.7 percent, the tech-laden Nasdaq 1 percent and the broad S&P 500 1.1 percent. Bond prices rose. Stocks in Europe rose modestly. Tokyo's benchmark Nikkei added 4.9 percent. Britain's announcement of a guarantee of up to 2.3 billion pounds ($3.25 billion) of loans to the car industry, much of which is foreign-owned, followed UK job cuts by Nissan Motor Co and India's Tata Motors, which bought British brand Jaguar Land Rover last year. The British auto industry employs more than 800,000 people. POLITICAL PRESSURE The Japanese government, which said it would use public funds to directly help nonfinancial companies, has already committed funds to help banks and spur lending, but Prime Minister Taro Aso's ruling bloc is under pressure ahead of an election that must be held by October. "In light of the looming election, the government needs to help companies that are bleeding losses," said Hiromichi Shirakawa, chief economist at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. As euro zone companies and households cut back on imports from emerging European economies, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development slashed its 2009 growth forecasts for emerging Europe to 0.1 percent from a level of 2.5 percent to 3 percent announced in November. It cut its growth estimate for Russia to 1 percent from 3 percent. The latest repercussions of the crisis hit Verizon Communications Inc, the No. 2 U.S. phone company, which reported fewer-than-expected wireless subscribers and warned that pension and other retiree expenses would hurt 2009 earnings -- joining a growing number of companies forced to fill funding gaps due to turmoil in financial markets. Corning Inc, which makes glass for televisions and computer monitors, posted disappointing results and said it would eliminate 4,900 jobs, blaming economic conditions. Top Japanese brokerage Nomura Holdings Inc posted a record $3.8 billion quarterly loss due to soured trades, the purchase of Lehman Brothers' operations, and exposure to Iceland and accused swindler Bernard Madoff.
