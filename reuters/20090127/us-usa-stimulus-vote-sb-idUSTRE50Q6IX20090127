 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A massive $825 billion economic stimulus bill moved closer to passage on Tuesday when the U.S. House of Representatives approved the rules for debating the bill that Democrats in that chamber hope to pass on Wednesday. 

 Despite Republicans voting in opposition, the House cleared the emergency spending and tax-cut bill for consideration and a likely vote on passage on Wednesday. (Reporting by  Richard Cowan )
