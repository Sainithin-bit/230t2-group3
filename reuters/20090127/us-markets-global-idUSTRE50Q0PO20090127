 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Better-than-expected corporate results lifted U.S. and European stocks on Tuesday but a plunge in U.S. consumer confidence capped a rise in equities as it reminded investors of a bleak economic outlook. 

 European stocks staged a late rally as Siemens, the German industrial conglomerate, calmed investors' fears about earnings at companies reeling from the global slowdown. The dire outlook worldwide boosted the greenback's safe-haven appeal as currencies sharply shifted direction in volatile trade. Traders seemed to favor the lower-yielding dollar and yen over higher-yielding currencies. Oil prices fell toward $43 a barrel as the fall in U.S. consumer confidence stirred fears about demand in the United States, the world's top energy consumer, and ahead of data expected to show rising fuel inventories in the United States, another reflection of slowing economic growth. American Express ( AXP.N ) led the Dow higher, gaining 5.9 percent after its results late Monday surpassed expectations. However, like many companies, it warned 2009 will be tough. "We've had some more numbers coming through that have been -- I don't want to say good -- but to some extent not as bad as people had thought," said Tim Smalls, head of U.S. stock trading at brokerage firm Execution LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. The Conference Board's report that U.S. consumer confidence index fell to a record low in January, dragged down by a slumping housing sector and jitters over job prospects, cut gains in U.S. stocks and dragged down European shares by 1 percent, though markets later rebounded. "When you have consumer confidence come out and question yet again the strength of any kind of activity economically, you're going to have those gains really pare down," said Bruce Zaro, chief technical strategist at Delta Global Advisors in Boston. Before 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 90.32 points, or 1.11 percent, at 8,206.35. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 12.00 points, or 1.43 percent, at 848.57. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 20.58 points, or 1.38 percent, at 1,510.04. Chip maker Texas Instruments reported a quarterly profit that fell less than feared and announced a 12 percent cut in jobs, pushing its shares up 3.6 percent and helping the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOXX rise 3.2 percent. Among the unexpected bright spots: Travelers Cos Inc ( TRV.N ), a large U.S. home, auto and commercial insurer, posted better-than-expected quarterly operating earnings. Its shares gained 7 percent. Hershey Co ( HSY.N ) reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit as increased spending on marketing lifted sales of its namesake candy and Reese's brands. Shares rose 4.5 percent. In Europe the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top regional shares staged a late rally and closed 0.1 percent higher at 785.64 points. Siemens stuck ( SIEGn.DE ) to its full-year profit outlook, sending its stock up 2.8 percent and boosting industrial shares, with Alstom ( ALSO.PA ) gaining 4.2 percent. But many investors remained skeptical. "Short-term rallies are to be expected, but stocks will certainly revisit their historical lows before we get an L-shaped recovery, with anemic growth for a while," said Pierre Sabatier, head of strategy at Pythagore Investment, in Paris. U.S. Treasury debt prices rebounded as traders speculated that a week of steep losses might force Federal Reserve policy-makers to approve the buying of longer-dated bonds. The prospect of a huge wave of U.S. government debt issuance, highlighted by an expected record auction of $40 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday, has pushed Treasury bond prices lower and yields higher. That threatens to push rates up on consumer and business loans and prolong the recession. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 6/32 in price yield 2.62 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond gained 35/32 in price yield to 3.33 percent. The dollar was break-even against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY at 84.394. The euro rose 0.09 percent at $1.3177, and against the yen, the dollar was off 0.02 percent at 88.98. U.S. light sweet crude oil fell $2.23 to $43.50 a barrel in New York. Spot gold prices fell $3.35 to $899.75 an ounce. Japan's Nikkei average  .N225  rose 4.9 percent, its biggest one-day gain in percentage terms since mid-December, after the government unveiled a $16.7 billion program to buy stakes in non-financial companies threatened with collapse. The MSCI index of Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS was up 1.36 percent, (Reporting by  John Parry ,  Leah Schnurr  in New York; Jane Merriman in London and Blaise Robinson in Paris; writing by Herbert Lash; Editing by Leslie Adler)
