 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Most Wall Street professionals took home smaller year-end bonuses and nearly half were dissatisfied with their payout, according to a survey released on Tuesday. 

 The survey, by eFinancialCareers.com, a unit of specialty jobs site operator Dice Holdings Inc, found 54 percent of respondents took home a smaller bonus this year. More than a third reported getting a bonus that was at least 31 percent less than last year's, and 1-in-10 said their bonus was slashed more than 70 percent. At the other end of the scale, 12 percent said their bonus was at least 51 percent higher than last year, according to the survey, which included responses from 900 currently employed people and was conducted earlier this month. That reflects continued demand for talented finance professionals, despite one of the most turbulent years in Wall Street history, eFinancialCareers Chief Executive John Benson said. "The future of the financial services industry may be opaque, but the industry has a vital role to play in the global economy," Benson said. One in five respondents said they were not satisfied with their bonus, while another 26 percent said they were very dissatisfied. A majority said they expected to be job hunting in 2009.
