 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Tuesday voiced confidence that he would get some bipartisan support for a $825 billion economic stimulus package as he lobbied Republican lawmakers to get behind the plan. 

 "We had a very constructive meeting with the House members," Obama told reporters after sitting down with House of Representatives' Republicans. "I recognize that we're not going to get 100 percent support, but I think everyone there felt good about that I was willing to explain how we put the package together, how we were thinking about it, and that we continue to welcome good ideas," he said.
