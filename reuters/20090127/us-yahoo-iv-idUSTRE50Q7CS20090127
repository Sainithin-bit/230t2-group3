 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit after several months of cost-cutting moves in a weak advertising environment, sending its shares up 3 percent in after-hours trade. 

 But the Internet company gave forecasts for first-quarter operating income that were below average Wall Street expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. COMMENTARY: SANDEEP AGGARWAL, ANALYST, COLLINS STEWART On the lack of full-year forecast: "If you look at eBay, this now has become a common phenomenon. Microsoft withdrew its previously provided guidance... Guiding into the quarter, we had highlighted that the large-cap technology companies might not provide full-year guidance. ... It is really more of a macro-economic thing." "We do not see any phenomenal improvement for topline growth ... In fact, things continue to slide down ... I think the guidance is disappointing, both for the top line as well as margins. They need to show a more sustainable cost discipline. Rather than going one quarter, they need to show a financial discipline that can sustain them better throughout the entire economic uncertainty rather than one quarter long." GENE MUNSTER, ANALYST, PIPER JAFFRAY "The December quarter was better than expected on revenue and earnings, but the guidance on the earnings side seems comically conservative." "Margins were positive in December and the company just laid off all these people and the benefits of that should kick in during March, so it (guidance) just doesn't add up." TODD GREENWALD, SENIOR ANALYST, SIGNAL HILL CAPITAL GROUP "It was largely in line with what was expected. There was a lot of charges and items, but it was a pretty in-line Q4 and a conservative outlook for Q1, which was to be expected with new management." "There's some disappointment there was no guidance for full year 2009, but understandable given the huge challenges facing Yahoo and the challenges in the display ad market which is a function of the economy." TRIP CHOWDHRY, ANALYST, GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH "I think the numbers were pretty much as we had expected. The macro conditions as well as company-specific issues will take some time to get resolved. It's nothing too surprising, but they did guide lower on the revenue." "It will be at least another 18 months to 24 months before the company-specific issues can be resolved. There was nothing too exciting about the numbers other than, you know, it could have been much worse." "If you're an investor in Yahoo, you're thinking you need to have patience -- patience for at least two years. Also, there is some factor of hope and pray: You hope that Carol Bartz creates miracles, and you pray she does it within two years." "If Yahoo goes and does something with AOL, that will reduce the confidence that investors have in Carol Bartz. Because AOL is the day before yesterday's story." "I don't see any deal activity. What I see is Yahoo taking time to continue pruning properties that are not profitable and which are not No. 1 or No. 2 in that specific category. I think the faster they do the pruning, the better the chances are for Yahoo to recover." MARTIN PYYKKONEN, ANALYST, WUNDERLICH SECURITIES "To a certain extent, was not as bad as some of the dire cases we were talking about. They didn't bleed to death as much as some of the bear scenarios." "It's not surprising that they didn't give guidance for the full year. Nobody was expecting it... There's obviously a lot of uncertainty and they're putting a broad range out there, much broader than they normally would." "It's certainly not good results and not a good outlook, but relative to the kind of general fears in the market, I wouldn't say it was any worse." "If I'm right about search being on a relative basis a little better than display, it makes me think that if you're running Yahoo -- if you're Carol Bartz -- you're thinking, 'Why should I necessarily be selling right now?" YOUSSEF H. SQUALI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, JEFFERIES & CO "The quarter was in line or a tad better than expected, which is a positive for the stock given the valuation. Q1 guidance is below expectations."
