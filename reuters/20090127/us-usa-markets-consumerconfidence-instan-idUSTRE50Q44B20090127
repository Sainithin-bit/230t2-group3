 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer confidence fell to a record low in January as a downtrodden housing sector and worsening job prospects kept the country in a somber mood. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Conference Board, an industry group, said its sentiment index fell to 37.7 in January from a revised 38.6 in December, confounding forecasts for a small uptick. * The expectations index dropped to 43.0 from 44.2 the previous month. * The number of respondents saying jobs were hard to get edged down slightly, although the proportion of consumers expecting their incomes to rise declined to 10 percent from 12.7 percent. * Only 13.3 percent of consumers expect business conditions to get better within the next six months, The Conference Board said. COMMENTS: ALAN RUSKIN, CHIEF INTERNATIONAL STRATEGIST, RBS GREENWICH CAPITAL, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "U.S. confidence data was again very poor. The two measures that show the closest coincident link to personal consumption, the present situation index and jobs plentiful/hard to get, remained at very soft levels. The best that can be said is that confidence is now stabilizing at very low levels and that some metrics, such as plans to buy an auto in the next six months, have crept up, even if it is a used car. Nothing to feed a market where risk trades look choppy and directionless for now." CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "This index is heavily influenced by labor market conditions so all the news headlines about new layoffs in the last few days will probably keep this index low for some time. Other than the fall in oil prices, the consumer has every reason to be gloomy -- and oil prices are falling because the global economy is very weak. "The consumer confidence report was disappointing because it fell to another new low. The January decline was smaller than the December decline, but this index was as high as 61 in September and at nearly 90 a year ago." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW Y0RK: "It is a modest decline, a fresh record low. Looking at the breakdown I was actually surprised -- they are slightly less pessimistic about employment so it is not employment that is causing the pessimism. There is a slight deterioration (overall) but not really much of a change. Increased worries over the financial markets may have been causing some concern." KATHY LIEN, DIRECTOR, CURRENCY RESEARCH, GFT, NEW YORK: "The consumer confidence number fell to a record low. This will really weigh on the market's risk appetite driving equities lower, then driving investors back into the safety of low yielding currencies, the dollar and the yen. It is not surprising to see confidence slip to these levels since layoffs just continue to build. Consumer confidence going forward will remain very weak. We have fourth-quarter GDP numbers later this week that will just highlight all of the troubles that we are having in the U.S. economy." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes pare gains after consumer confidence data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar trims gains versus major rivals.
