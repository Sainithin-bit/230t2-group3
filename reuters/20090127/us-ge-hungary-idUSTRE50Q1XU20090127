 BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - General Electric ( GE.N ) Consumer and Industrial plans to suspend production at its lighting factories in Hungary for two weeks due to a decline in orders, business daily Napi Gazdasag reported on Tuesday. 

 It said the decision affected eight out of nine GE plants in Hungary. A spokesman for the company told Reuters he was unable to give an immediate comment. The paper also said GE planned to introduce four-day workweeks at its Hungarian factories from April to November to prevent further job cuts. The company said in October it would lay off 500 of its 10,000 workers at its consumer and industrial unit in Hungary by the first quarter of this year.
