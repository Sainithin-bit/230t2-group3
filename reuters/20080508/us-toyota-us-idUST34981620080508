 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) President Katsuaki Watanabe said on Thursday it would be difficult to expect a recovery in the U.S. economy this year. 

 Many auto executives had flagged a recovery in the U.S. vehicle market in the latter half of 2008, but instead have been forced to lower their projections for total industry demand. Senior Managing Director Takeshi Suzuki said Toyota's U.S. operations were working on altering the automaker's sales forecast for this calendar year, from 2.64 million vehicles.
