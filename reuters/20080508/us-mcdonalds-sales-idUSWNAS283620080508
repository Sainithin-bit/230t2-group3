 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ), the world's largest fast-food chain, said on Thursday that sales at restaurants open at least 13 months rose 5 percent globally in April, helped by strong sales in China, Australia and Russia. 

 Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail health, rose 2 percent in the United States, compared with a 6.3 percent rise in Europe. The Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa division posted comparable sales growth of 7.8 percent. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman  and  Lisa Baertlein ; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)
