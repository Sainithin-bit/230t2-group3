 LONDON  (Reuters) - Unilever ( ULVR.L ), the maker of Dove soap, Sunsilk shampoo and Knorr soups, beat forecasts with a 7.2 percent rise in first-quarter underlying sales and said annual sales will top its target, sending its shares higher. 

 The world's third largest consumer goods group Unilever Plc/NV ( UNc.AS ) on Thursday also beat quarterly earnings forecasts, boosted by profits from disposals, as it raised prices to offset the rise in raw material costs. "While it is early in the year, we now expect underlying sales growth in 2008 to exceed our 3 to 5 percent target range," said group Chief Executive Patrick Cescau in a statement. In February, Anglo-Dutch Unilever had expected a sales increase at the upper end of its 3 to 5 percent target range. Cescau said the group saw a good start to the year with strong growth across all categories and regions, and emerging markets being particularly strong, while it posted a higher than expected rise in operating margins of 0.3 percentage points. Unilever Plc shares jumped 5 percent to 17.45 pounds by 5:03 a.m. EDT (0903 GMT), to be the FTSE 100 index's  .FTSE  biggest riser, after a sluggish performance so far this year as they have underperformed London benchmark index by 10 percent. "A fifth consecutive quarter of underlying sales growth in excess of 5 percent begins to look like a trend," said analyst Rob Mann at brokers Collins Stewart, added that improved innovation at the group has boost its overall performance. "...the caveats are not as significant as the fact that we have now had five successive quarters without disappointments, that this is a genuine beat, and that from the raising of guidance we may infer that no material slowdown is being envisaged by the company," said Deutsche analyst John Parker. Cescau has led Unilever's recovery from a shock 2004 profits warning, but has had to push up prices and cut costs to offset the sharp upswing in commodity costs such a vegetable oils, milk and packaging which rose 400 million euros in the quarter. He added the group had increased pricing 4.8 percent in the quarter in response to rising commodity prices, but still expected to see competitive growth and an underlying rise in operating margins in 2008 despite the tough conditions. "These numbers confirm once again that the food industry has proved pretty adept at covering off what has been one of the worst input cost environments in living memory, with all the food majors reporting very high pricing -- record levels in real terms," said Credit Suisse analyst Charlie Mills. The 7.2 percent quarterly rise in underlying sales topped analyst forecasts which ranged from 4.8 to 6.4 percent and a 5.7 percent consensus, and from its two bigger consumer goods rivals beat Procter & Gamble's ( PG.N ) 5 percent rise but lagged the 9.8 percent increase from Swiss Nestle SA ( NESN.VX ). Unilever measures underlying sales by stripping out the effect of acquisitions, disposals and currency movements. The group, whose 400 brands include Lipton tea, Lux soap and Omo detergents, saw quarterly earnings per share also beat forecasts with a 35 percent rise to 0.47 euros, against forecasts of 0.23 to 0.38 euros and a consensus of 0.30 euros. Unilever added that it has had interest from a number of parties for its North American laundry business which it put up for sale last August and which analysts estimate is worth up to 1.2 billion euros. Unilever stock trades at 15.5 times forecast 2008 earnings, below both its key European food rivals Nestle on 16.7 and Danone ( DANO.PA ) on 20.1 times, according to Reuters Estimates.
