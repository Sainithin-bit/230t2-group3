 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), the world's most profitable car maker, reported a bigger-than-expected 28 percent fall in fourth-quarter net profit, hit by a stronger yen and finance-related losses, and forecast its first fall in seven years for 2008/09, due to a sharp drop in the dollar against the yen and rising commodity prices. 

 For a Toyota earnings graphic, click  here Following are initial reactions of analysts and investors: YOKU IHARA, GENERAL MANAGER, RETELA CREA SECURITIES CO "It's a bit of a surprise that Toyota sees a more than 40 percent fall in operating profit for the first half of this business year. The forecast of a larger-than-expected profit fall could temporarily put downward pressure on its stock price. "What I'm worried is a slowdown in its U.S. sales growth. Toyota sees sales growth of 1 percent for the year to March 2009, a substantial slowdown from the 4-5 percent growth in past years. "Now that Toyota sees a 30 percent fall in profit, there is a possibility that other Japanese carmakers and steelmakers could see a similar profit decline for this year." TATSUO YOSHIDA, ANALYST, UBS SECURITIES "The earnings figures from the previous business year were within expectations, although it was a surprise to see Toyota missed its operating profit target, albeit by a small margin, as it has seldom happened in the past. "The forecast for an operating profit of 1.6 trillion yen for the current business year is way below what the market expected. Toyota forecasts worldwide auto sales of 9.06 million, not expecting sales to rise at all. That's a surprise, too. "The earnings forecast figures are negative for Toyota's share price, likely causing it to give up gains made in its recent rebound." KOICHI OGAWA, CHIEF PORTFOLIO MANAGER, DAIWA SB INVESTMENTS "The forecast for group pretax profit is rather tough, down 30 percent, and the forecast for sales is pretty tough too. It's a very conservative forecast. "The dollar/yen assumption is fine, but what's unclear is how much material costs will rise, especially for steel. This is likely to rise a lot. "A fall of 20 to 30 percent was predicted, so it wasn't a surprise and it wasn't really bad, except that for this company it's pretty tough and was a very conservative forecast." MITSUSHIGE AKINO, CHIEF FUND MANAGER, ICHIYOSHI INVESTMENT  MANAGEMENT CO LTD "I think these forecast numbers are likely to hold up, given the currency situation, the U.S. market and rising steel prices, but there were predictions to this effect -- including the fall in operating profit by 30 percent -- so this isn't such a huge surprise. "Toyota shares are likely to fall a bit on this but it shouldn't lead to a sharp fall given the overall market situation. "But without a doubt these are results the market was watching for and in that sense it could become a way of telling the fortune of the market overall." MARKET Toyota shares closed down 1.8 percent at 5,480 yen ahead of the results announcement. (Reporting by Tokyo Newsroom)
