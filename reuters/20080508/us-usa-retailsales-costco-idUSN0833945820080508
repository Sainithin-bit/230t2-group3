 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) on Thursday reported a better-than-expected 8 percent rise in April sales at stores open at least a year, boosted by higher gasoline prices, strength in foreign currency and more customers shopping at its clubs. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting the company's same-store sales to rise 6 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales at its U.S. locations increased 7 percent, while international division sales rose 14 percent. Excluding gasoline price inflation, it said U.S. comparable sales would have been up 5 percent, while on a local currency basis, it said international same-store sales increased 6 percent in April. Customers pay an annual fee to shop at Costco's warehouse locations, which sell everything from digital cameras and watches to bulk-sized packages of toilet paper and soda. The clubs also sell gasoline, a lure to shoppers looking to fill their tanks with cheap fuel. Costco, the largest U.S. warehouse club, said the average price for a gallon of gasoline during the month was $3.43, up from $2.93 a year ago, helping boost sales in that category. On a recorded call, it also said its food business continued to be very strong. "We are of course benefiting from some inflation on the food side as a result of the recent run up in the cost of commodities and the continued run up in the price of oil and gasoline," the company said. Costco said total sales in the four weeks that ended May 4 rose 12 percent to $5.54 billion. (Reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman  and  Nicole Maestri ; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
