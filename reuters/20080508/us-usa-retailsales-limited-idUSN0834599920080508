 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday that sales at established stores fell a bigger-than-expected 5 percent in April, due to weak mall traffic and soft underwear sales at Victoria's Secret. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the retailer to post a same-store sales decline of 2.5 percent. The operator of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains said that total sales fell to $577.5 million for the four weeks ended May 3, from $688.0 million last year. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 4 percent at Victoria's Secret and 8 percent at Bath & Body Works, but rose 5 percent at the company's La Senza chain. The company expects May same-store sales to be down at a mid single-digit percentage range. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri  and  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Derek Caney  and Dave Zimmerman)
