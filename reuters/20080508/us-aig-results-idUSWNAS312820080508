 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer, posted its largest ever quarterly loss on Thursday and said it would raise $12.5 billion to fortify its balance sheet. 

 The result marked the second consecutive quarter that AIG had posted record losses, hurt by a write-down of derivatives exposed to bad mortgage investments. Separately, the company said it was looking for a new CFO after naming Steven Bensinger vice-chairman of financial services, effective immediately. AIG said the first-quarter net loss was $7.81 billion, or $3.09 a share, compared with net income of $4.13 billion, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier. Included in the results was a $9.11 billion charge for unrealized market valuation losses on credit swaps, a portfolio that also proved a thorn in the fourth-quarter. AIG also recorded capital losses of $6.09 billion, primarily from impairment charges in its investment portfolio. AIG said it expected to raise $7.5 billion of the total capital through a common stock and equity-lined offering. On an adjusted basis. AIG said its net loss was $3.56 billion, or $1.41 a share, AIG said. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
