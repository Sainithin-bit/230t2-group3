 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N disclosed on Thursday that some shareholders want a federal judge to block the troubled investment bank's impending takeover by JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ). 

 According to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cohen v. The Bear Stearns Coswas filed in Manhattan Federal Court. Plaintiffs seek permission to file a motion that would stop the merger. This suit is separate from a shareholder lawsuit filed in New York State court that also wanted to stop the controversial bank merger. On Wednesday, the state suit plaintiffs withdrew a motion to prevent JPMorgan from voting a large block of shares it acquired on April 8 during the May 29 special shareholder meeting. The state suit will still go forward, although it is now focused on winning as much as $2.8 billion of damages for Bear investors. (Reporting by  Joseph A. Giannone ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
