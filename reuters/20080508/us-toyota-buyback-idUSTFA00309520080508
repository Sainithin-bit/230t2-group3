 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Thursday it would seek shareholder approval to buy back up to 200 billion yen ($1.9 billion) of its own shares. 

 The potential buyback would be up to 30 million shares or about 0.95 percent of all shares outstanding. The buyback period would run one year from the first day after its annual shareholders meeting in June, it said. (Reporting by  Elaine Lies )
