 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) President Katsuaki Watanabe said on Thursday that the automaker's target for reaching and sustaining a 10 percent operating profit margin in the medium term remained in place. 

 "We haven't thrown in the towel on that target," he told a news conference. Toyota earlier forecast an operating profit of 1.6 trillion yen on revenue of 25 trillion yen for the year to March 2009, for a profit margin of 6.4 percent. Its margin stood at 8.6 percent in 2007/08. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
