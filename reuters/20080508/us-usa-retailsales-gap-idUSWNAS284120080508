 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailer Gap Inc ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a year fell a bigger-than-expected 6 percent in April. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 2 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap, which runs Banana Republic, Old Navy and its namesake Gap stores, said total sales for the four weeks ended May 3 rose 1 percent to $1.10 billion.
