 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - The apparent end of a bull run in Chinese stocks is prompting minor flows of funds into the battered bond market -- but not enough to keep yields from climbing. 

 But if it becomes clear the stock market has temporarily stalled, some traders estimate mutual funds, which control about 700 billion yuan ($92 billion), could divert as much as 10 percent of that amount into government bonds by the end of 2007. Insurers could also step up investment in longer-term bonds, while banks could have more funds to put into bonds as disillusioned stock investors returned some of their money to longer-term savings deposits. A plunge of as much as 21 percent in Shanghai's main stock index  .SSEC  since early last week suggests the biggest equities bull market in China's history, which nearly quadrupled the index over 18 months, may be over for now. So far, the positive impact for bonds has not been enough to outweigh concern about rising inflation and further increases in interest rates. "Some liquidity has been diverted into bonds from stocks, but not a lot," says Shi Lei, analyst at Bank of China. "Fund flows may increase if the stock index doesn't rebound sharply. But bond yields may still not fall because May CPI is expected to be high, fuelling worries over another interest rate hike." The government triggered the stock market's tumble by lifting the stock trading tax to cool speculation. Many analysts believe the index, which closed on Thursday at 3,890 points, may now stay in a range of roughly 3,500-4,000 for weeks or months. SHORT-TERM ATTRACTION? A total inflow of 60 billion yuan into government bonds would cover roughly two months of fresh supply -- enough to have an impact on prices by the end of the year. "Quite a few government bonds maturing in around one year now have a yield of around 3 percent, higher than real returns from one-year bank deposits," says bond analyst Zhang Yong at Guotai Junan Securities. "That means short-term bonds may be attractive to money which is leaving the unstable stock market." One such bond is the three-year Treasury due to mature in August 2008, listed on the stock exchange. Its yield of 2.7427 percent exceeds the tax-adjusted one-year deposit rate of about 2.45 percent. As most bond prices have continued sliding in the past week, the August 2008 bond has stayed stable while turnover has hit a six-week high -- indicating fresh buying interest. Overall flows into bonds remain minor, however, partly because the government has done a good job of signaling to investors that while it wants the stock market to cool, it doesn't want a crash. In the past few days, turnover in Shanghai A shares has been around 175 billion yuan -- compared with more than 200 billion at the height of the bull market last month, but still above levels seen early this year. Similarly, the number of A-share investment accounts opened on Wednesday was 206,000, below levels exceeding 300,000 in past weeks but still high compared to last year. This implies many retail investors are not putting money back into bank deposits. INFLATION CONCERN The equities pull-back has occurred while inflation worries are growing. Economists believe May consumer prices, due next Tuesday, rose around 3.4 percent from a year earlier, the strongest annual pace in more than two years. That could mean another 0.27 percentage point hike in the nominal one-year deposit rate, now 3.06 percent, as the central bank prevents real rates from turning sharply negative. Goldman Sachs believes rising food prices could push annual inflation up to 4 percent in coming months -- which would require a full percentage point in hikes to avoid negative real rates. Many analysts think hefty flows into bonds will not happen unless inflation stabilizes for several months, or unless stocks show clearer signs of cooling -- perhaps through a further drop of at least 30 percent in turnover and new investment accounts. Duan Yunfei, analyst at China Merchants Bank, said that since the share trading tax hike, there had been significant flows out of stocks into the short-term money market, but not into longer-term bonds because of their vulnerability to inflation. "If May CPI is poor, the stock index could fall to 3,500. This would certainly help funds flow from stocks, and banks would buy central bank bills below one year with the liquidity. But bonds would not benefit much," he said. ($1 = 7.65 Yuan)
