 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Higher interest rates in Europe and growing uncertainty over the cost of borrowing in the United States could slow down the global mergers and acquisitions boom, experts say. 

 Announced global M&A volume slowed to roughly $75 billion this week, compared with weekly volume of between $100 billion and $285 billion for most of April and May, according to research firm Dealogic. Accommodating debt markets helped spur M&A to record levels in the past year, with more than $4 trillion of deals in 2006 alone. Any increase in the cost of borrowing can make some deals, especially leveraged buyouts led by private equity firms, less affordable. So far this year, LBOs account for more than a third of all deals in the United States. "The private equity-led part of the corporate activity cycle will find it more difficult," said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments, which manages assets of $270 billion. Borrowing costs are already rising in the junk bond market. Average yields have risen by about 0.25 percentage point since the middle of May, to about 7.66 percent, according to Merrill Lynch data. That means it costs an additional $2.5 million in annual interest payments for every $1 billion borrowed. Hub International Holdings trimmed the size of a two-part junk bond sale on Friday and boosted yields to attract buyers. Originally expected to be a $790 million issue, it was cut to $700 million, according to a market source familiar with the sale. STILL STRONG The European Central Bank raised interest rates by a quarter point to 4.0 percent on Wednesday, marking a doubling of euro-zone borrowing costs in the past 18 months. Global bond and share prices have tumbled since the ECB move, as markets fear tighter monetary policy worldwide. However, experts were quick to point out that M&A is not about to grind to a halt. Many deals, big and small, will still be done. For the year to date, global leveraged buyout volume is $499.5 billion, more than double the volume of a year earlier, according to Dealogic. Private equity deals currently make up about 20 percent of global M&A, up from 11 percent four years ago. In the United States, LBOs make up 35 percent of deal volume so far this year. "My view is that rates are much less important than the magnitude of leverage that can be brought to bear," said Glenn Gurtcheff, managing director with M&A advisory firm Harris Williams & Co. But Gurtcheff added, "Over time, certainly if there is a sharp move either upward or downward in rates, it has an effect. It makes transactions either more affordable or less affordable." Standard Life Investments' Milligan, too, stressed that interest rates are just one part of the equation for M&A. He said higher rates would be seen as a positive signal for some companies, a negative signal for others, and irrelevant for some. "It will be positive for some corporates because they are saying the fact that bond yields are rising means the world is getting better," Milligan said. "It will be more difficult for some who will be saying the cost of funding has just made that deal not worthwhile. And for some people, they are going to be saying that from a structural viewpoint we need to take the following positions ... and the cost of debt is completely irrelevant."
