 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The lead singer of U.S. rhythm and blues band The Gap Band sued EMI Music Inc. and Heineken Inc. on Friday for using a song he recorded with rapper Snoop Dogg in a commercial without his permission. 

 Singer Charlie Wilson filed suit against Capitol Records, the American label of EMI, and the American division of Dutch brewer Heineken Inc. in federal court in Manhattan for using the song "Beautiful" in an advertising campaign for Heineken Premium Light Beer. Portions of the recording of "Beautiful" featuring vocal performances by Wilson and rapper Pharrell Williams were licensed by Capitol Records for the commercial without permission, the suit said. The advertisement had been shown on American television and on the website www.heinekenlight.com, the suit said. Wilson also charged EMI had not paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in profits gained for "Beautiful" and for another song "You've Got What I Want," which Wilson recorded with rappers Snoop Dogg, Jelly Roll, Ludacris and Goldie Loc.
