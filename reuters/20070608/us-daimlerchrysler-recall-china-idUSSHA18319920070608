 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - German luxury car maker DaimlerChrysler A.G. DCXGn.DE is recalling 1,443 Chinese-made Chrysler 300C sedans to fix defective transmission cooling systems, China's quality watchdog said on Friday. 

 The cars were produced between March 21 and May 29, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said on its Web site. Imported Chrysler 300C cars were not affected, it added. It did not say whether any accidents or personal injuries had been linked to the defect. DaimlerChrysler's Chinese joint venture in Beijing began limited production of the 300C in 2005.
