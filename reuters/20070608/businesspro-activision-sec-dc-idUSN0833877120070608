 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have begun a formal 
probe into stock option practices at Activision Inc. ( ATVI.O ), 
the No. 2 U.S. video game publisher, according to a company 
filing. 

  Activision, whose hit titles includes "Guitar Hero 2" and 
"Spider-Man 3," learned this month that the Securities and 
Exchange Commission had issued a formal order of nonpublic 
investigation, which allows the agency to subpoena witnesses 
and require the production of documents, according to the 
filing on Thursday.  The Santa Monica, California-based company said it was 
cooperating with the investigation, and its representatives had 
met with SEC staff on several occasions.  A representative of the U.S. Department of Justice has 
attended some of these meetings and requested copies of 
documents, Activision said.  Activision shares were up 14 cents at $18.60 in early trade 
on Nasdaq.  Last month, Activision posted a loss for the fourth quarter 
ended on March 31 and gave a first-quarter profit forecast that 
lagged expectations due mainly to acquisition costs and legal 
fees from its investigation into stock option accounting 
practices.  In March, Activision said an internal review of its stock 
options grant practices had cleared Chief Executive Robert 
Kotick and three other top executives and board members of 
intentional wrongdoing.  Activision is among more than 170 companies involved in 
internal or federal regulatory or criminal investigations into 
manipulations of stock option grants to lock in gains.
