 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Norilsk Nickel, the world's largest nickel and palladium miner, said on Friday 2006 net profit more than doubled on record prices and the sale of a stake in South African miner Gold Fields Ltd.. 

 Norilsk, owned by Russian billionaires Vladimir Potanin and Mikhail Prokhorov, said net profit rose 154 percent last year to $5.965 billion, beating analysts' forecasts. Analysts said they expected the Russian miner to post strong results in 2007, despite a possible decline in nickel prices, as its newly acquired refinery in Finland will add to production. "Nickel prices have started declining, which may have a negative effect on the company's results, but 2007 will be a good year for Norilsk after it consolidates its Finnish assets," Metropol Group metals analyst Denis Nushtayev said. Norilsk earned $993 million from the sale of its stake in Gold Fields, the world's fourth-largest gold miner, last year. Excluding this gain, net profit was $4.972 billion -- still more than double the previous year's $2.352 billion. Eleven analysts polled by Reuters had forecast net profit of $5.118 billion. The three who excluded the Gold Fields sale forecast an average $4.815 billion, still below actual results. Revenues rose 61 percent to $11.550 billion in 2006, above the $11.048 billion forecast in the analyst poll. Norilsk, which mines a fifth of the world's nickel, said its sales of the metal yielded an average $24,081 per tonne in 2006, up 65 percent from 2005. Nickel, used to make stainless steel, has been the best performer on the London Metal Exchange this year due to a China-led boom in global demand. It hit a record $51,800 a tonne on May 9 but has retreated to close on Thursday at $42,900. COPPER, PGMS Norilsk, Russia's biggest copper and platinum producer, also profited from an 83 percent rose in its average copper price to $6,689 per tonne. The price of palladium, used in jewelry and car exhausts, rose 57 percent and platinum 26 percent. Norilsk's physical sales of nickel rose 5 percent last year to 257,000 tonnes. Palladium sales were practically unchanged at 3.22 million ounces, while sales of copper declined by 6 percent to 424,000 tonnes and platinum by 1 percent to 750,000 ounces. Norilsk sold slightly more nickel and palladium than it produced last year and all of its copper and platinum. It also kept operating expenses low compared with those of domestic and international peers. Cash operating costs in 2006 rose 5 percent to $2.538 billion, production costs 7 percent to $3.106 billion and sales costs 5 percent to $3.158 billion. "The company continues to show convincing control of expenses, which separates it from other producers both in Russia and abroad, where operating expenses are rising substantially," said Sergei Donskoy, metals analyst with Troika Dialog. Norilsk produced 244,000 tonnes of nickel in 2006. Its purchase this year of the nickel assets of U.S.-based OM Group, including the Harjavalta refinery in Finland, is expected to boost 2007 output to 270,000-275,000 tonnes. Norilsk did not publish its earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) but analysts said it slightly exceeded the consensus of $7.499 billion. EDITDA margin was slightly lower than the 69.2 percent forecast. Norilsk is also expected to gain control of LionOre Mining International Ltd., the world's 10th-largest nickel producer, after the Canadian miner advised shareholders to accept the Russian firm's $6.4 billion bid. Potanin, president of industrial and banking group Interros, and Prokhorov -- the company's chief executive until earlier this year -- together own more than half of Norilsk's stock. Prokhorov is expected this year to sell his stake to Potanin. (Additional reporting by Anastasia Teterevleva)
