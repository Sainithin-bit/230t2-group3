 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) is aiming to file on Monday or Tuesday for an emergency stay of a U.S government ban on importing certain phones containing its chips, general counsel Lou Lupin said on Friday. 

 Lupin said Qualcomm would file as soon as possible for an emergency stay of the ban at the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which specializes in patent cases. "I would expect we'd file Monday or Tuesday, early next week at the latest," he said in an interview with Reuters. Lupin also said that U.S. Customs officials could take as much as two weeks to implement the ban. "As a practical matter customs isn't likely to be ready to enforce this order for a week or two weeks," he said. "That's what I'm told is the typical experience," The U.S. International Trade Commission said late Thursday it was banning the U.S. sale of some new high-speed cell phones that include Qualcomm chips it said infringed a patent owned by Broadcom Corp ( BRCM.O ).
