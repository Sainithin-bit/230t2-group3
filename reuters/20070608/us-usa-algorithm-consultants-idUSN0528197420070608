 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge funds are relying more and more on attorneys and accountants -- for advice on whether to buy or sell securities. 

 They are increasingly likely to hire lawyers and other experts to instantly interpret a decision in a court case or government hearing, or even just the direction of a hearing. In a world where financial information is available instantaneously and where algorithmic trading systems automatically weigh and make buy and sell decisions in milliseconds, they don't just want to know what has been said or decided in a court or legislative body. To get a trading edge, they want an immediate call on how a decision or hearing affects the company or businesses involved. Law firms and other consultants are happy to help. The booming alternative investment community has fragmented, creating demand for services that may once have been handled in-house at larger investment houses. "Our clients utilize services that range from having a patent litigator sitting through an intellectual property trial to providing insight about a particular legislative matter on Capitol Hill," said Drew Chapman, who chairs the fund services group at Sonnenschein Nath & Rosenthal LLP. "Many, if not a majority, of large high-end funds are utilizing some kinds of these services." The move comes as hedge funds crowd into markets in record numbers. Assets under management topped $1.5 trillion in the first quarter of 2007, with $60 billion of new inflows, up from $16 billion during the same period last year, according to Hedge Fund Research, Inc. Hedge funds, which now number over 9,500, according to HFR, have growing access to comprehensive market or company data -- whether compiled by vendors or available for free online. "All these tools are so widely available that it is harder and harder to differentiate yourself using traditional financial data," said David Teten, who founded the Nitron Circle of Experts to connect funds, banks and others with industry experts. Reuters Plc RTR.L RTRSY.O is building a similar service through its Anian research unit. "CAN'T GET ELSEWHERE" "The No. 1 reason is the increasing commoditization of traditional financial analysis," said Teten, whose firm was recently acquired by consultant Evalueserve, describing growth in demand from hedge funds. "We are providing information that they can't get elsewhere." Mike McNamara, who chairs the public law and policy strategies practice at Sonnenschein, said: "Information is so widely available now that someone in North Dakota has as much access as someone on Wall or K Street," the Washington area famously associated with insiders like lobbyists and advocacy groups. "With this level of access it's important to have someone on the ground to filter that information and lend a seasoned perspective about what it all really means," he said. Asbestos litigation or bankruptcy in the airline sector are the types of regulatory and legislative matters that clients have an interest in, said McNamara. Hedge funds are also using accountants and lawyers for forensic analyses of company accounts. They want a professional assessment of whether a business may be hiding potential problems through accounting legerdemain. But using lawyers and other professionals as consultants raises concerns. "One service we provide is information about the status of a lawsuit," said Edward Black, co-head of the intellectual property group at Ropes & Gray LLP. "But we only do this work if we clear conflicts against both parties in the litigation." Conflicts often preclude a firm from the work, said Black, causing the business to be spread out among multiple firms. RISK Material nonpublic information is also a risk when industry professionals act as consultants, says Sonnenschein's Chapman. "There is a question as to how far you can actually go and what information you can actually get," he said. "Obviously we are very careful to counsel clients to keep away from that line and out of any gray area." In January the Wall Street Journal reported that the New York Attorney General's office had subpoenaed firms Vista Research and Gerson Lehrman Group in an investigation over whether consultants discussed material nonpublic information with investors. A spokesman for Vista, a unit of McGraw-Hill Cos. MHP.N, confirmed his firm was complying with the subpoena. A spokesman for Gerson Lehrman declined to comment and the attorney general's office did not return calls for comment. Still, Black of Ropes & Gray says the volume of consulting at his firm has grown from "negligible to being a routine part of the practice." And, he added, it's not cheap. "The most effective provider of these services is someone with established knowledge and expertise who can hear the ruling, read the order and assimilate it and report on it extremely quickly," Black said. "Those are our top people." Nitron's Teten says compensation for experts, ranging from scientists and academics to accountants and lawyers, is typically between $100 and $500 an hour when consulting for clients like hedge funds -- but can be as high as $1,000 an hour. The funds are happy to pay the price. "The market is only getting more efficient," said Teten. "More and more players are under tremendous financial pressure to go out there and find this data."
