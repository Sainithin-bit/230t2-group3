 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury debt prices rose on Friday on bargain-hunting and short-covering after benchmark yields briefly advanced to five-year highs amid worries about tightening credit conditions globally. 

 The market's mild recovery followed a plunge on Thursday, but analysts and traders said a cross-section of players including fund managers, central banks and mortgage companies continued to liquidate long positions and rebalance their books. "For now, the sell-off has abated. People are taking a shot at (getting) long," said Michael Pond, Treasury strategist at Barclays Capital in New York. Benchmark 10-year notes were traded up 4/32 in price for a yield of 5.12 percent, down 2 basis points from late Thursday. The 10-year yield peaked at 5.25 percent, matching the Federal Reserve's overnight lending target. The benchmark yield posted its biggest one-week rise since March 2005. Shorter-dated debt fared better than their longer-dated counterparts. Two-year notes were up 1/32 for a 5.01 percent yield, down 3 basis points from late Thursday but up 3 basis points from a week ago. "The market has been completely overdone it. It's like catching a falling knife," said Carley Garner, an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. INFLATION VS GROWTH DEBATE Two opposing views have emerged in the wake of Thursday's market collapse. One group of traders and analysts blamed rising price pressure in forcing central banks to raise interest rates and changing expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut rates later this year. "The Fed is not going to lower rates until we defeat inflation," said Scott Armiger, portfolio manager at Christiana Bank & Trust Co. in Greenville, Delaware. Chicago Fed President Michael Moskow underscored central bankers' inflation concerns. Moskow told CNBC television on Friday that while the Fed's 5.25 percent interest rate is "appropriate" for now, he would like to see inflation lower. According to another camp, bond yields are simply adjusting to higher levels in the face of faster-than-expected growth, rather than an acceleration in inflation. "I don't see where inflation is coming from," said Lou Brien, market strategist at DRW Trading in Chicago. All over Wall Street analysts appeared to be having a change of heart, with HSBC the latest major bank to reverse its call for the Fed to cut interest rates this year. Some of them also bumped up their U.S. growth forecast by a quarter to half a percentage point from earlier estimates. Much of the recent U.S. data have beat Wall Street forecasts such as the smaller-than-expected $58.5 billion trade deficit in April reported on Friday. In addition to strong data, heavy selling by mortgage players, spotty Treasuries buying by Asian central banks and stock market that until recently was booming have contributed to the weakness in bonds, analysts said. Regardless of whether it is due to faster growth or higher inflation, the Treasury market is still vulnerable after it broke a series of major long-term chart supports. "Technically, there's not a lot to hold this market up," said Alaron's Garner. Next week's economic calendar, which includes retail sales and the Consumer Price Index, offers critical evidence in dictating Treasuries' near-term fortunes, analysts said. In other cash trading, five-year notes were up 4/32 in price for a yield of 5.06 percent, down 3 basis points from late Thursday but up 13 basis points on the week. The long bond ended up 5/32 in price for a 5.22 percent yield, off 1 basis point from late Thursday but up 16 basis points from a week earlier. In derivatives trading, swap spreads widened despite lower yields with 10-year spreads growing to 60.75 basis points, out 3.25 basis points on the week.
