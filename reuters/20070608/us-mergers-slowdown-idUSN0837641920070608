 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - Higher interest rates in Europe and growing uncertainty over the cost of borrowing in the United States could slow down parts of the global mergers and acquisitions boom, experts say. 

 Accommodating debt markets helped spur M&A to record levels in the past year, with more than $4 trillion of deals in 2006 alone. Any increase in the cost of borrowing can make some deals, especially leveraged buyouts (LBOs) led by private equity firms, less affordable. Low interest rates around the world led to an explosion in buyouts by private equity firms such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Blackstone Group in recent years. So far in 2007, LBOs have accounted for more than a third of all deals in the United States -- but higher borrowing costs would test the strength of that buyout boom. "The private equity-led part of the corporate activity cycle will find it more difficult," said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments, which manages assets of $270 billion. Borrowing costs are already rising in the junk bond market. Average yields have risen by about 0.25 percentage point since the middle of May, to about 7.66 percent, according to Merrill Lynch data. That means it costs an additional $2.5 million in annual interest payments for every $1 billion borrowed. Hub International Holdings trimmed the size of a two-part junk bond sale on Friday and boosted yields to attract buyers. Originally expected to be a $790 million issue, it was cut to $700 million, according to a market source familiar with the sale. The European Central Bank raised interest rates by a quarter point to 4.0 percent on Wednesday, marking a doubling of euro-zone borrowing costs in the past 18 months. Global bond and share prices have wobbled since the ECB move, as markets fear tighter monetary policy worldwide. With hopes of any U.S. interest-rate cuts fading and the Federal Reserve focusing on inflation, government bond yields have surged higher, pushing up funding costs for buyers. On Thursday, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield broke the psychological 5 percent barrier for the first time since August 2006. The turmoil that followed forced retailer Edgars Consolidated Stores, bought by Bain Capital in South Africa's largest ever LBO, to pay 1.25 percentage points more than initially planned on one segment of its bond financing and to scrap a fixed-rate bond sale. DON'T PANIC Announced global M&A volume slowed to roughly $75 billion this week, from between $100 billion and $285 billion for most of April and May, according to research firm Dealogic. However, experts were quick to point out that M&A is not about to grind to a halt. Many deals, big and small, will still be done. For the year to date, global leveraged buyout volume is $499.5 billion, more than double the volume of a year earlier, according to Dealogic. Private equity deals make up about 20 percent of global M&A, up from 11 percent four years ago. In the United States, LBOs make up 35 percent of deal volume so far this year. "My view is that rates are much less important than the magnitude of leverage that can be brought to bear," said Glenn Gurtcheff, managing director with M&A advisory firm Harris Williams & Co. But Gurtcheff added, "Over time, certainly if there is a sharp move either upward or downward in rates, it has an effect. It makes transactions either more affordable or less affordable." Standard Life Investments' Milligan, too, stressed that interest rates are just one part of the equation for M&A. He said higher rates would be seen as a positive signal for some companies, a negative signal for others, and irrelevant for some. "It will be positive for some corporates because they are saying the fact that bond yields are rising means the world is getting better," Milligan said. "It will be more difficult for some who will be saying the cost of funding has just made that deal not worthwhile. And for some people, they are going to be saying that from a structural viewpoint we need to take the following positions ... and the cost of debt is completely irrelevant." Another significant factor is the need for private equity firms to put money to work. They are expected by analysts to raise another $500 billion of funds this year. "We can't get panicked by a particularly bad or good day in the stock or bond markets," said Steven Rattner, the head of Credit Suisse affiliate and private equity firm, DLJ Merchant Banking Partners. "We have been talking about a correction in the markets and it's something we've factored into our models and to the companies we own."
