 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc. MAR.N said on Friday it agreed to pay the U.S. government and unidentified states $220 million to settle a dispute related to the hotel company's leveraged employee stock ownership plan. 

 The payments, which reflect taxes and interest charges, will result in an after-tax charge totaling about $54 million, or 13 cents per share. The charge was not included in Marriott's second-quarter earnings guidance, the company said. In April, the top U.S. hotel company had forecast second-quarter earnings, excluding its synthetic fuel operations, of 51 cents to 55 cents per share. No penalties were assessed in connection with settlement, the company said. In addition, Marriott said it had fully resolved all issues pertaining to the audits of the company's 2000, 2001, and 2002 federal tax returns. The company said in March it received a notice from the Internal Revenue Service challenging most of the company's income tax deductions related to its employee stock ownership plan. "We are pleased to reach this compromise, bringing this dispute to a swift and final resolution," Chief Financial Officer Arne Sorenson said in a statement.
