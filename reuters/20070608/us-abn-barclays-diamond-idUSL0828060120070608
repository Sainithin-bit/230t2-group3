 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays ( BARC.L ) is confident of winning the takeover battle for ABN AMRO AAH.AS and expects the Dutch bank's contested sale of its U.S. business to be allowed, its president said on Friday. 

 "We went into this transaction expecting to be able to execute and we are still quite confident that we can," said Bob Diamond, head of Barclays's investment bank arm and president of the group. Barclays has agreed an all-share takeover of ABN worth about 63 billion euros ($84.6 billion), but a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) has made a mostly cash offer worth 71 billion euros. Either deal would rank as the biggest ever bank takeover. But the consortium's rival offer is conditional on it also buying ABN's U.S. arm LaSalle Bank, which ABN has agreed to sell to Bank of America ( BAC.N ). A Dutch court is due to rule in early July on whether that deal should be allowed, which Diamond said clarify the situation. He said he expected the deal to be allowed. "Looking from the outside it is a bid of $21 billion in cash. That is about 20 times earnings, so it looks like a pretty viable transaction to us," he said in an interview on CNBC. Diamond said Barclays management continue to meet ABN shareholders and unions to promote their offer and had a good response to its plans to create the world's fifth biggest bank. But he added: "We also went into this transaction coming off four years of record earnings ... and we have a great management team and great organic growth plan so if for some reason we were not able to execute we'd go back to business."
