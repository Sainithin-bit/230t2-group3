 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Manhattan federal judge has ordered Visa USA to stop charging a special fee that penalized debit card issuers for jumping to smaller rival MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ), sending the latter's shares higher. 

 Judge Barbara Jones agreed with a special master that the fee, which related to a 2003 class-action settlement of antitrust claims against the card associations by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and other retailers, was anti-competitive. "It appears to be a major win for MasterCard's domestic debit business, which trails Visa by a significant margin, but has now been presented with a golden opportunity to capture some of Visa's top customers," wrote Calyon Securities analyst Craig Maurer. He rates MasterCard "add." Visa had been charging "settlement service fee" to any of its 100 largest debit issuers that moved its portfolio to MasterCard. The fee was to represent the issuer's share of Visa's remaining obligations under the settlement. Visa had settled for $2 billion and MasterCard for $1 billion. "Because banks make the brand-switching decision 'at the margin,' the settlement service fee is large enough in relation to MasterCard's incentive package to effectively prevent a bank from switching," Jones wrote. The judge also required Visa to allow any issuer that agreed to the fee to terminate its agreement, so long as the issuer entered into an agreement to issue MasterCard debit cards. "This is a significant win," MasterCard General Counsel Noah Hanft said in a statement. "With this roadblock out of the way, financial institutions (can) make decisions based on their best judgment about quality of service, strength of brand and other competitive factors." Visa Vice President Rosetta Jones said her card association is studying the ruling and may appeal. The 2003 settlement related to claims that retailers incurred billions of dollars of processing costs to meet card association requirements that they accept signature-verified debit cards. MasterCard is based in Purchase, New York, and Visa in San Francisco. MasterCard conducted its initial public offering in May 2006. Visa last October said it planned to go public within 12 to 18 months. Shares of MasterCard, which had been up 2 percent, rose an additional 3.5 percent after the company issued an afternoon statement about the ruling. They closed up $4.17, or 3 percent, at $143.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.
