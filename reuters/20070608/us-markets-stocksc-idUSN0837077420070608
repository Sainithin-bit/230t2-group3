 (Corrects to April instead of May in the first paragraph) 

 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher at the opening on Friday as data showing the U.S. trade gap narrowed more than expected in April offset concerns about rising interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 27.23 points, or 0.21 percent, at 13,293.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 1.67 points, or 0.11 percent, at 1,492.39. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 4.56 points, or 0.18 percent, at 2,545.94.
