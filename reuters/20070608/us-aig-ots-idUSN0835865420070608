 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), the world's largest insurer, will pay up to $163 million to help its subprime borrowers stay in their homes, according to an agreement with U.S. regulators announced on Friday. 

 Most of the money will be used to provide affordable loans to these borrowers, who face a high risk of foreclosure. Subprime borrowers are facing defaults because they generally have weaker credit, and rates on their adjustable mortgages are climbing. AIG's agreement with the Office of Thrift Supervision covers mortgages made by one of its units -- Wilmington Finance Inc. -- between July 2003 and May 2006. The OTS said the AIG unit responsible for Wilmington Finance "failed to manage and control the mortgage lending activities outsourced to WFI in a safe and sound manner," but had taken steps to improve. OTS officials were not immediately available for comment. In total, AIG has a portfolio of more than $24 billion in loans, mostly subprime, but it represents only a small part of the insurer's nearly $1 trillion in assets. The agreement with the OTS did not take the market by surprise. AIG took a reserve of $128 million in the first quarter to pay for the cost of implementing this program. In its latest statement, the company said it would take an additional reserve of up to $50 million, including a $15 million donation to educate and counsel borrowers. AIG shares were down 32 cents at $71.06 in midday New York Stock Exchange trade. AIG is not the only lender to agree to help subprime borrowers in trouble. Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ), the largest U.S. savings and loan, has said it would refinance up to $2 billion of subprime loans at below-market rates.
