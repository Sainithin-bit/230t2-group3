 DES MOINES, Iowa  (Reuters) - A record 3-1/2 year stretch of profits for hog producers appears to be coming to an end this year due to high corn costs, but a growing export market could again bolster profits in coming years, a leading agriculture economist said. 

 "The cost of corn comes in as the number one concern among big producers," said University of Missouri agricultural economist Glenn Grimes, who was on the sidelines at the World Pork Expo industry gathering this week. "The odds are about 90 percent that we will see some red ink for at least one or two or three months this fall." Surging demand for corn from ethanol producers helped drive corn prices to the highest level in a decade in February. The cost of producing hogs was currently about $7 to $9 per hundredweight higher than a year ago, Grimes said. Strong export demand has helped soften the blow for hog producers since the spike in corn prices, but export growth appears to have flattened out in recent months, he said. The decline is partly due to much lower sales to Mexico, Grimes said. Consumers in Mexico may be buying less pork and beef due to high corn prices driving up the cost of tortillas, a regional staple, and squeezing consumers' budgets. Pending free trade agreements with South Korea and some Central and South American countries could build up export markets in the future. "We've had 15 consecutive years of record exports, but this may be the year that we break that. In practically any trend, you have to pause and take a breath occasionally so I don't see this as too serious at this point in time," Grimes said. "But with these trade agreements we have, I think we can get a new wind and start that trend again," he said. The average live hog price in Iowa and southern Minnesota was forecast to be between $48 and $51 per cwt in the second quarter of 2007, then slip to $44 to $47 in the third quarter before recovering slightly in the last three months of the year to $46 to $48 on average, Grimes said. Hog slaughter weights typically rise year over year due to increased production efficiency, but weights this spring were close to year ago levels because producers have been marketing hogs at lighter weights due to high feed costs. That has kept a lid on pork supplies and helped prop up prices. In the week ended June 2, the average weight of barrows and gilts in Iowa and southern Minnesota was 266.8 lbs, compared with 265.8 lbs the previous week and 266.5 in the same week a year ago, according to U.S. Agriculture Department data. Circovirus disease likely tightened the hog supply somewhat over the past year, although exact figures were not available. Some producers have lost up to 30 percent of their herds due to the disease, but industry-wide losses likely total between 1 and 3 percent, Grimes said. "All we have there is trade rumors. We don't have any trade statistics of what circovirus is really doing to our supply, but we know that it's reducing the supply some. It's going to keep on reducing our supply for some time," he said. However, increasing availability and effectiveness of vaccines could soften the impact in the future, he added. U.S. meat company Smithfield Foods Inc. SFD.N said this week that its hog unit was hurt by high feed costs and reduced hog numbers due to circovirus, which caused a 6 percent drop in the number of hogs marketed in the latest quarter.
