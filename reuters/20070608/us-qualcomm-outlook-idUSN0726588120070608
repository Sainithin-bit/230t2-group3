 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Current-quarter demand for Qualcomm Inc's ( QCOM.O ) wireless chips and technology licenses is looking better than the company previously expected, Chief Financial Officer Bill Keitel said on Thursday. 

 "The underlying business in this quarter is going very well, a bit stronger than I had expected at the outset," Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer Bill Keitel said on an analyst call set up to discuss a U.S. government ban on the U.S. sale of some high-speed wireless phones with Qualcomm chips. Keitel said that while the quarter was not yet over, firm orders and reports from licensees were very strong. Qualcomm's fiscal third quarter ends this month. Banc of America analyst Tim Long said in a note to clients that the company could issue a statement increasing its guidance for the quarter in the next two weeks. On April 25, Qualcomm forecast third-quarter net earnings per share of 43 cents to 45 cents on revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. Qualcomm is the dominant maker of chips for phones based on CDMA, the mostly widely used mobile phone technology in the United States. It also makes chips and sells technology licenses for phones based on W-CDMA, a wireless standard popular in Europe and other parts of the world.
