 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen clothing retailer Aeropostale Inc. ( ARO.N ) said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a year rose 7 percent in February, helped by the launch of spring merchandise. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected a same-store sales increase of 4.8 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales rose 18.6 percent for the four weeks that ended March 1 to $89.7 million. (Reporting by Jennifer Coogan, editing by Maureen Bavdek)
