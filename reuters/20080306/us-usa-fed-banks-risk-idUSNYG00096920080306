 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Financial regulators from five countries and industry representatives held talks on February 19 to discuss risk management against the backdrop of market turmoil, the New York Federal Reserve said on Thursday. 

 The regulators, from France, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States, also issued a report on risk management practices on Thursday. The report summarizes both a joint review done late last year and the results of the roundtable, the New York Federal Reserve said on its Web site. Regulators' findings were that banks' losses during 2007 were incurred by "concentrated exposure to securitizations of U.S. subprime mortgage-related credit," the New York Fed wrote in a letter to the Bank for International Settlements.
