 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates at 4.0 percent on Thursday for the ninth month running. 

 Below are key points from the ECB's last three policy statements. Capitals have been added by Reuters for emphasis. OPENING PARAGRAPH: -- FEB.7 2008 -- "The current short-term upward pressure on inflation MUST NOT SPILL OVER TO THE MEDIUM TERM. The firm anchoring of inflation expectations over the medium and long term is OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY to the Governing Council." "As the reappraisal of risk in financial markets continues,  THERE REMAINS UNUSUALLY HIGH UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ITS OVERALL IMPACT ON THE REAL ECONOMY. While the economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound, incoming data have confirmed that the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity LIE ON THE DOWNSIDE. We will continue to monitor VERY CLOSELY all developments over the coming weeks." -- JAN. 10 2008 -- "The Governing Council remains PREPARED TO ACT PRE-EMPTIVELY so that second-round effects and upside risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize and, consequently, medium and long-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored in line with price stability. Reflecting its mandate, such anchoring IS OF THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TO THE GOVERNING  COUNCIL." "The economic fundamentals of the euro area are sound. However, the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still accompanied by UNCERTAINTY ABOUT ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT ON  THE REAL ECONOMY AND THE RISKS SURROUNDING THE OUTLOOK FOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY ARE ON THE DOWNSIDE. We will continue to monitor very closely all developments over the coming weeks." -- DEC. 6 2007 -- "The latest information has ... fully confirmed our assessment that there are UPSIDE RISKS TO PRICE STABILITY over the medium term ... the Governing Council stands ready to counter upside risks to price stability." "The reappraisal of risk in financial markets is still evolving and is accompanied by CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE REAL ECONOMY. We will therefore MONITOR  VERY CLOSELY ALL DEVELOPMENTS." ----------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: GROWTH -- FEB. 7 2008 -- "The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound." "Uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth IS UNUSUALLY HIGH and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity have been confirmed TO LIE ON THE DOWNSIDE. Risks relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with negative effects on world and euro area growth. Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional oil and other commodity price rises, concerns about protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments due to global imbalances." -- JAN. 10 2008 -- "Our main scenario remains that of real GDP growth BROADLY IN LINE WITH TREND POTENTIAL. The fundamentals of the euro area economy ARE SOUND." "Uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains high and the risks surrounding the outlook for economic activity LIE ON THE DOWNSIDE. The latter relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on financing conditions and economic sentiment, with a negative impact on world and euro area growth." -- DEC. 6 2007 -- "Overall, the fundamentals of the euro area REMAIN SOUND. Profitability has been sustained, employment growth has been robust and the unemployment rate has fallen to levels not seen for 25 years." "The risks surrounding this outlook for economic growth LIE ON THE DOWNSIDE. They relate mainly to the potential for a broader impact from the ongoing REAPPRAISAL OF RISK IN FINANCIAL  MARKETS ON FINANCING CONDITIONS AND CONFIDENCE AND ON WORLD AND EURO AREA GROWTH, possible further oil and commodity price rises, as well as concerns about protectionist pressures and  POSSIBLE DISORDERLY DEVELOPMENTS OWING TO GLOBAL IMBALANCES." ----------------------------------------------------------- ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: INFLATION -- FEB. 7 2008 -- "The annual HICP inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2 percent in the coming months and moderate only gradually in the further course of 2008. This confirms our expectation of a PROTRACTED PERIOD OF TEMPORARILY HIGH RATES OF  INFLATION." "Risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are confirmed TO LIE ON THE UPSIDE." "It is ... imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided." -- JAN. 10 2008 -- "The period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat MORE PROTRACTED THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED." "Risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments  ARE FULLY CONFIRMED TO LIE ON THE UPSIDE." "It is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from current inflation rates be avoided." -- DEC. 6 2007 -- "The period of temporarily high rates of inflation would be somewhat MORE PROTRACTED THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED." "Risks to this medium-term outlook for price developments are fully confirmed TO LIE ON THE UPSIDE." "It is therefore crucial that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on wage and price-setting stemming from recent commodity price rises be avoided." ------------------------------------------------------- MONETARY ANALYSIS -- FEB.7 2008 -- "The monetary analysis confirms the PREVAILING UPSIDE RISKS TO PRICE STABILITY at medium to longer-term horizons." -- JAN. 10 2008 -- "The monetary analysis confirms the PREVAILING UPSIDE RISKS TO PRICE STABILITY at medium to longer-term horizons." "Monetary developments continue to require VERY CAREFUL MONITORING, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to form a better understanding of shorter-term monetary dynamics." -- DEC. 6 2007 -- "The monetary analysis confirms the PREVAILING UPSIDE RISKS to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons." "Monetary developments therefore continue to require VERY CAREFUL MONITORING, both to detect underlying trends associated with inflationary pressures at longer horizons and to better understand shorter-term dynamics." ----------------------------------------------------------- MARKET CONDITIONS -- FEB. 7 2008 -- "The impact of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets on the real economy is still surrounded by UNUSUALLY  HIGH UNCERTAINTY." -- JAN. 10 2008 -- "The potential impact on the real economy of the ongoing reappraisal of risk in financial markets remains uncertain. Consequently, we will monitor very closely all developments." -- DEC. 6 2007 -- "As regards the financial markets, we will continue to pay great attention to developments over the coming weeks."
