 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is expected to leave interest rates at 4.0 percent at its March policy meeting on Thursday. Following is a summary of remarks made by members of the ECB's Governing Council since their February 7 meeting at which they also left interest rates unchanged.  

 ATHANASIOS ORPHANIDES (CYPRUS), MARCH 4 "We expect some slowdown in the economy compared to the growth rate of last year." "Growth in the euro zone last year was higher than the growth potential of the economy, so some relaxation helps to contain the inflationary trends we have."  GUY QUADEN (BELGIUM), MARCH 4 "Inflation is a big concern...It is a concern that is shared by the population."  * ON EURO: "Things are becoming exaggerated ... It's up to the relevant authorities to assume their responsibilities and particularly for U.S. authorities, who repeat that they are in favor of a strong dollar but who should reaffirm their words."  JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), MARCH 3 "In the present circumstances, I consider it very important what has been affirmed and reaffirmed by the U.S. authorities including the secretary of the Treasury and the president of the United States, according to whom the strong-dollar policy is in the interests of the United States of America."  JOSE MANUEL GONALEZ-PARAMO (EXECUTIVE BOARD), FEB. 29 "Liquidity tensions have yet to completely disappear and could take some time to be absorbed."  JOHN HURLEY (IRELAND), FEB. 28 "It is clear that the risks to the outlook for economic activity in the euro area lie on the downside; however, risks to price stability over the medium-term are on the upside." "The latest data have tended to confirm this assessment of risks." "It is apparent, however, that growth (in the United States) will slow substantially."  LORENZO BINI SMAGHI (EXECUTIVE BOARD), FEB. 27 "There will be novelties. It is difficult to keep the projections the ECB published in December," he told reporters. "The assessment is that growth risks are to the downside but inflation risks are on the upside." "It is difficult to draw a trend, especially for Europe, while a slowdown in the U.S. is much more evident."  NOUT WELLINK (NETHERLANDS), FEB. 27 "We thought $1.40-$1.45 would be a real hurdle for the economy to remain on track. That proved not to be the case," he told reporters. "Exports are doing quite well.  "We don't see any second-round effects from inflation pressures," he told Reuters. "If the world economy slows down, then pressures on inflation should also come down."  AXEL WEBER (GERMANY), FEB. 27 "The current dominant market consensus on interest rate expectations clearly underestimates the inflation risks. These expectations do not drive the monetary policy view of a central bank which is committed to price stability."  LUCAS PAPADEMOS (VICE-PRESIDENT), FEB. 26 "The figure is encouraging and supports the view that economic expansion in the euro region will grow at not far below the potential ... growth rate," he told Reuters.  "With regard to the prospects for price stability, the short-term inflation outlook is not satisfactory," he said in a speech. "The ECB remains committed to preventing second-round effects and the materialization of upside risks to price stability over the medium term. This commitment will guide the determination of the monetary policy stance." "At the same time, the ECB stands ready to respond flexibly, effectively and in a timely manner ... in order to support its monetary policy objective." ATHANASIOS ORPHANIDES (CYPRUS), FEB. 25 "The euro area economy is doing quite well ... (it) has not experienced the severity of the slowdown that has been seen in the United States," Orphanides told reporters.  JEAN-CLAUDE TRICHET (PRESIDENT), FEB. 25 "The world economy might be better able to rely on the dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region should growth in other regions lose momentum. This is particularly important at the current juncture." "Since we are all interdependent, the key question therefore is to assess how, and to what extent, a possible slowing down in some mature economies might be partially offset by stronger growth in other regions, notably in emerging Asia."  MICHAEL BONELLO (MALTA), FEB. 25 Setting interest rates had become "a very difficult call, so it's best at the moment to sit it out and wait at least for the ECB's next (staff projections in March)," he said in an interview.  LORENZO BINI SMAGHI (EXECUTIVE BOARD), FEB. 25 Europe is not showing "signals of a real recession as those seen in America. But it's pointless to deny it, in the euro zone we are at a scenario of lower growth and higher inflation," he said in an interview.  JUERGEN STARK (EXECUTIVE BOARD), FEB. 23 "We are highly dissatisfied with the current inflation rate. But it is a temporary phenomenon, caused by a strong rise in food and energy prices," he said in an interview.  JOSE MANUEL GONZALEZ-PARAMO (EXECUTIVE BOARD), FEB. 22 "There are a number of risks to the downside as regards growth and also a number of upside risks in connection to inflation and we are very much focused on those," he told Reuters. "All in all the fundamentals of the euro zone economy remain sound. We have seen mixed data, some to the downside but some other to the upside including Ifo and today's PMI data; profits of companies, external accounts, levels of employment, those indications underscore the fact that the fundamentals remain sound at the moment."  ATHANASIOS ORPHANIDES (CYPRUS), FEB. 22 "It would be folly to try to proclaim with any confidence what the interest rate path should be over the next months," Orphanides said in an interview. "We clearly do not have enough information about how the economy will evolve to determine whether it will be necessary to hike rates or to cut rates."  NICHOLAS GARGANAS (GREECE), FEB. 20 "In the euro zone, GDP growth this year is seen decelerating but remaining close to potential. Based on the Eurosystem's projections, average annual inflation in 2008 will significantly exceed 2 percent," he said in a report. "The impact on lending conditions and on the economic climate from credit market developments may be larger than expected. For this reason the ECB continues to monitor all developments with great attention."
