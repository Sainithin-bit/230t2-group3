 (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Sunday suspended peace negotiations with Israel, demanding it end the Gaza offensive that has killed more than 100 Palestinians, many of them civilians. 

 U.S. officials and presidential candidates called for an end to the violence. Here are some of their comments: WHITE HOUSE SPOKESMAN GORDON JOHNDROE "The violence needs to stop and the talks need to resume." STATE DEPARTMENT SPOKESMAN ROB MCINTURFF "Her (Secretary of State Condoleezza) plans remain intact. We're encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life." (Rice is scheduled to meet this week with Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.) ILLINOIS SEN. BARACK OBAMA, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE "The violence in Gaza is the result of Hamas' decision to launch rocket attacks on Israeli civilians and Israel has a right to defend itself. "I remain very concerned about the fate of civilians and urge Israel to do all it can to avoid civilian deaths and to keep its focus on Hamas, which bears responsibility for these events." NEW YORK SEN. HILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL  CANDIDATE "I deplore and condemn the Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel, including the city of Ashkelon. Israel has the right to defend its citizens. "I regret the civilian loss of life and casualties on both sides that this provocative action has caused. "I call on Hamas to stop this irresponsible aggression immediately, which would enable Israeli and Palestinian civilians to return to normal life ... I regret the Palestinian Authority's decision to suspend the talks. "The Bush Administration should have been taking a more active role in bringing international pressure on Hamas to stop its attacks." (Arizona Sen. John McCain, the likely Republican presidential nominee, had no public schedule on Sunday and did not issue an immediate comment) (Compiled by JoAnne Allen in Washington; editing by  Sandra Maler )
