 PARIS  (Reuters) - The French defence market is open to 
American products, a defence ministry spokesman said on 
Thursday. 

  "Of course our markets are open to American products," 
Laurent Teisseire told a news conference.  "I am thinking about AWACS and HAWKEYE (aircrafts) and the 
important flow of equipment goods purchases, products and 
components coming from the United States," he added.  The comments come after Europe's EADS ( EAD.PA ) unexpectedly 
won a $35 billion contract for 179 tankers together with its 
U.S. partner Northrop Grumman ( NOC.N ), sparking a political 
backlash in Washington over the defeat for rival Boeing Co  ( BA.N ).  (Reporting by  Brian Rohan , Dominique Vidalon)
