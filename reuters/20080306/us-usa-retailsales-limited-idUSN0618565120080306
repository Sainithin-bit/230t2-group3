 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc ( LTD.N ) said on Thursday sales at established stores fell 9 percent in February and forecast a drop for March, citing a continuing slump in mall traffic. 

 Analysts on average had been expecting a decline of 10.7 percent for same-store sales. The operator of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works chains said total sales fell to $614.4 million for the four weeks ended March 1 from $730.5 million a year earlier. Sales at Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works stores open at least a year both fell 10 percent in February while La Senza stores posted a same-store sales increase of 1 percent. The company said it expects a high-single-digit drop in sales at established stores in March. (Reporting by Jennifer Coogan; editing by  Mark Porter  and John Wallace)
