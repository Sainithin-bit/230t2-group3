 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government is aggressively challenging Airbus subsidies at the World Trade Organization, despite a U.S. Air Force decision awarding a $35 billion aerial tanker contract to Airbus parent, EADS ( EAD.PA ), the top U.S. trade official said on Thursday. 

 EADS and prime contractor Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) beat Boeing Co ( BA.N ) to win the tanker contract from the Air Force last week. The decision has enraged lawmakers from Kansas and Washington state, where Boeing has large operations, as well as U.S. labor unions. "We're still pursuing it as actively as ever," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab told a Senate Finance Committee hearing, when asked about the existing U.S. trade case against the European airplane manufacturer. Schwab told Sen. Pat Roberts, a Kansas Republican, that the USTR had briefed the Air Force some time ago about the pending U.S. trade case against Airbus at the WTO. But she said her agency had no role in the decision to award the contract to Northrop and Airbus. "This is a decision done solely by the Air Force," Schwab told lawmakers. The European Union and United States are pursuing competing complaints with the WTO over tens of billions of euros and dollars in state support provided to Boeing and Airbus. The United States accuses Airbus of getting grants and loans at unfairly favorable rates in the form of "launch aid." Europe's trade case against Boeing hinges on the provision of research and development assistance from NASA and the U.S. Department of Defense. Roberts, whose state is home to Boeing production facilities, said it defied common sense for one branch of the U.S. government to challenge Airbus subsidies at the WTO while another branch awards the company a huge contract that would cost American jobs. "This is an outrage," Roberts said. "It truly makes me question our trade agenda." Boeing plans to meet with Air Force officials on Friday for a briefing about why it lost the contract. Following that, Boeing has 10 calendar days to file a formal protest. The Air Force maintains that it carefully followed federal contracting procedures and chose the plane that best met the requirements to replace an aging aerial tanker fleet.
