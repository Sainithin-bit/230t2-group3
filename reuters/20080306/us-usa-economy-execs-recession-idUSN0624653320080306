 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The majority of top U.S. business executives think the country is either already in recession or heading for one in the next six months, according to a survey conducted by the Boston Consulting Group. 

 After interviewing 101 senior managers at U.S. firms with at least $500 million in annual revenues, BCG found that 53.4 percent believe a recession is inevitable. This sentiment was not purely based on observations surrounding worsening economic data, with many saying slower growth was already pinching their bottom line. "They're also feeling the effects in their business," the survey said, showing that more than 55 percent based their views in their own company's weaker sales. Nearly three-quarters of respondents said their companies have taken steps to brace for the economic slump, although BCG said many could be deceiving themselves. "Many of these companies are probably less prepared than they believe, and headed for a recession trap," said Hal Sirkin, head of BCG's Operations practice, which conducted the research.
