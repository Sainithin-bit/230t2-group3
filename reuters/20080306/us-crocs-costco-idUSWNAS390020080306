 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Crocs Inc ( CROX.O ), known for its colorful, plastic shoes, said on Thursday that it does not sell its shoes at Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) stores and has no plans to do so. 

 The company said it discovered instances where it believes its shoes were being sold indirectly to Costco and terminated relationships with those it believes responsible. "I want to reiterate that Costco is not an authorized dealer of Crocs products," said Ron Snyder, chief executive of Crocs. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller , editing by Leslie Gevirtz)
