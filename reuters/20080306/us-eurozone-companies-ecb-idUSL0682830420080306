 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European companies would welcome an interest rate cut from the ECB but are worried about high inflation and understand the bank is taking its time about such a move, Europe's biggest business organization said. 

 The European Central Bank meets on interest rates on Thursday amid market expectations of no change in borrowing costs from the current 4.0 percent because of record high inflation, despite prospects of an economic slowdown. "If they (interest rates) are lowered, it would be positive and that is obvious," BusinessEurope President Ernest-Antoine Sillier told a news conference. "Do companies ask for a rate cut? That is not evident," he said. "Members are concerned with inflation. If we see inflation progressing, there will be big pressure on wages and this will hurt the general competitiveness," he said.
