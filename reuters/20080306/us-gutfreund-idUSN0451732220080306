 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - John Gutfreund, a Wall Street eminence grise who built the former Salomon Brothers into the world's biggest bond trading house, claims he has no money these days. 

 But he still has strong opinions about the state of the financial world he once helped lead. The 78-year-old financier, under whose tutelage emerged future New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, asset-backed securities pioneer Lewis Ranieri and Long-Term Capital founder John Meriwether, disparaged government efforts to reverse a ballooning credit crisis through multiple rate cuts, homeowner bailouts and "incentive packages." "The government is a day late and a dollar short," said Gutfreund in an interview this week, blaming "the ineptitude of the politicians and the fact that they are owned by the lobbies." Gutfreund, whose legendary career at Salomon ended abruptly in 1992 after his firm was accused of illegally manipulating the prices of government bonds, chastised both former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and current U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, calling them "political animals" for supporting short-term solutions to the mortgage crisis. But, he said, "the Bushies need all the loyalists they can get." Gutfreund is not optimistic that any of the current presidential candidates will be able to sort out the credit mess, although he praised Bloomberg, a former protege who is no longer running. "If we get lucky maybe one of them will turn out to be decent. I don't think any of them have the capacity to manage this incredibly complex problem." Gutfreund offered no prescription to reverse the credit crisis that has sent security prices plummeting and bond defaults rising, even though his former firm helped create the first iteration of the mortgage-backed securities that are now fueling widespread losses. Gutfreund, who continues working as a senior adviser to mid-size broker Collins Stewart and serving on various corporate and nonprofit boards, offers simple advice for investors in the next Wall Street innovation after packaged mortgage bonds began imploding last year, leading to billions of dollars in losses by banks and institutional investors. "If I were giving advice, I would say don't invest in something unless you understand it," he said. While such advice seems obvious in hindsight, Gutfreund said broker and investor greed will drive countless future Wall Street innovations. He called some mortgage-backed securities "flawed vehicles," in that "you never really know who is on the other side of your trade." "They will get screwed because they don't know what they are investing in," said Gutfreund. "It always occurs. There will be another innovation and people will get burned." Gutfreund, who oversaw bond trading star Meriwether before he helped form Long-term Capital Management, the pioneering hedge fund that spectacularly imploded in 1998, said hedge funds aren't much different from ordinary investors in that regard. "Hedge funds are just taking a shot to get a little extra money. Some got carried away and some will get carried out," he said. (Reporting by Dane Hamilton, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
