 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bond insurer Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N said on Wednesday it plans to sell at least $1.5 billion of stock and convertible securities, to help preserve the top-tier credit ratings critical for its main insurance business. 

 New capital would give the second-largest U.S. bond insurer more funds to cover billions of dollars of claims it could face after insuring subprime mortgage bonds and other risky debt. Shares of Ambac nevertheless fell $2.02, or 19 percent, to $8.70, reflecting investor disappointment that banks were not committing their own funds to help rescue Ambac after talking to the company, New York's insurance superintendent and others for weeks. "It looks like (banks) had a close look at what was going on at Ambac, and they backed away. Things may be bad there," said Peter Kovalski, portfolio manager at Alpine Woods Capital Investors, which owns Ambac shares. Ambac had looked at obtaining funding from banks, and was willing to go with one of those options until rating agencies rejected it, a person familiar with the matter said. Following that rejection, selling securities was the simplest way to raise capital, the person said. Ambac has launched offerings of at least $1 billion of common stock and at least $500 million of mandatory convertibles known as "equity units." So far, it has found about $1 billion of demand for the stock, and may increase the offering if more investors are interested, a person briefed on the matter. Ambac is making other moves to strengthen capital, including slashing its dividend and suspending selling new insurance on repackaged debt known as "structured finance." "We expect to be better positioned to take advantage of the current favorable market environment for credit enhancement," Chief Executive Michael Callen said in a statement. STAYING TRIPLE-A Boosting capital levels is meant to help Ambac's main unit, Ambac Assurance, retain its top credit ratings. Fitch Ratings has already stripped that unit of its "AAA" ratings, and said raising another $1.5 billion would help Ambac Assurance remain at "AA." Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's said if Ambac raises the additional capital, they would likely affirm Ambac Assurance's "triple-A" ratings. Though S&P did not change its top ratings for Ambac Assurance, the agency said it might leave the company on "negative" outlook, reflecting the potential for more mortgage market deterioration. Investors fear that ratings downgrades at bond insurers would force portfolio managers to sell their securities, because many managers can only hold top-rated debt. Forced sales could result in lower bond prices and higher borrowing rates for consumers, as well as state and local governments. Downgrades would also make it much harder for Ambac to win new business. Fears of a possible Ambac downgrade have weighed on the U.S. stock market for weeks. The company said in its annual report last week that the threat of downgrades and general market difficulty have translated to its winning a limited amount of new financial guarantee business since November. Meanwhile, billionaires Warren Buffett and Wilbur Ross are using fears about players like Ambac to win new bond insurance and reinsurance business. Ambac had guaranteed about $524 billion of outstanding debt as of the end of December. CUTTING DIVIDEND, SCALING BACK Ambac on Friday slashed its quarterly dividend to a penny a share from 7 cents. In January, the company had cut the dividend from 21 cents a share. The company last week also said it would no longer write business in the riskiest segments of structured finance, and would no longer use credit default swaps to write insurance. Credit default swaps must be written down as their market value declines. Those write-downs may or may not foretell actual losses. MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ), the world's largest bond insurer, has similarly said it plans to scale back, after having raised more than $2.6 billion of debt and equity from investors this year. The convertible securities are expected to be sold on Thursday, carry an 8 percent to 8.5 percent dividend, and an 18 percent to 22 percent conversion premium. Investors must convert the securities into Ambac shares in 2011. Banc of America Securities, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, and UBS are acting as joint book-running managers on the stock and mandatory convertible offerings. (Editing by  Jan Paschal , Gerald E.
