 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store operator Macy's Inc ( M.N ) will not be among the U.S. retailers reporting February same-store sales figures on Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Wednesday. 

 Macy's plans to join other retailers such as Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) and Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) in abandoning monthly sales numbers, the Journal reported. A Macy's representative could not be reached for comment. The department store operator was expected to post same-store February sales ranging from a decline of 5.0 percent to a rise of 1.0 percent, according to a poll conducted by Reuters Estimates.
