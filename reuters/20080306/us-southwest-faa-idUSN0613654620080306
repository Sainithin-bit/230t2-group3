 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. aviation regulators are seeking a penalty of at least $3 million from Southwest Airlines Co ( LUV.N ) for failing properly to inspect more than 40 older planes for structural cracks, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the details. 

 The paper reported that the U.S. Department of Transportation and a congressional committee are examining why the Federal Aviation Administration did not ground the planes last March after learning of the missing inspections. A Southwest spokeswoman said the airline had not been contacted by the Federal Aviation Administration. "We're very surprised by this report, we've not been issued a fine and believed the case was closed." (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke ; Editing by David Cowell)
