 PARIS  (Reuters) - The executive chairman of French bank Natixis ( CNAT.PA ) said on Thursday he could not predict when the credit crisis would end. 

 Asked whether current problems at Carlyle Capital Corporation CARC.AS meant the financial crisis was worsening, Natixis chairman Philippe Dupont replied to reporters: "I cannot say when this crisis will be over .... We are not out of the crisis yet." Carlyle Capital Corporation, an affiliate of private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL, said on Thursday it had not been able to meet some margin calls and had received a notice of default.
