 (Reuters) - International negotiations are under way on reopening Egypt's border crossing with the Gaza Strip at Rafah to ensure supplies to Palestinians living under the rule of Hamas, which is shunned by its neighbors and world powers. 

 Here are key factors for the various parties involved: ISRAEL: - A 2005 accord gives it effective veto over access to Gaza through Rafah. It controls other land, sea and air borders - Angry at Hamas rocket fire, wants to "disconnect" from Gaza while stemming international criticism of blockade strategy - Wants to maintain security checks on movements into Gaza HAMAS: - Seeks supplies to stem discontent since it seized control in June from forces loyal to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas - Israel accuses Hamas of smuggling in weapons from Egypt EGYPT: - In a 30-year-old "cold peace" with Israel, wants to avoid public and Arab anger at its role in hardships for Gaza's people - Anxious to restrict Hamas contacts and mutual aid with Egypt's own Islamist opposition, the banned Muslim Brotherhood - Unwilling to be drawn into shouldering economic burden in territory it controlled between 1948 and 1967 PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY: - Abbas's Fatah faction sees restoring Palestinian Authority border personnel as foothold to regain authority in Gaza after defeat by Hamas in June - Seeks credit with voters in Gaza and West Bank for easing hardships of the 1.5 million Gazans - Suspects Israel aims to undermine plans for Palestinian state in both territories by pushing Gaza into Egyptian control INTERNATIONAL POWERS: - United States and European Union say they want to ease the hardships for Gazans on humanitarian grounds - Also keen to bolster Abbas and start restoring authority in Gaza at expense of Hamas, which they label a terrorist group - EU willing to return border monitors to Rafah GAZA'S PEOPLE: - Keen not just to ensure regular supplies of energy, food and other goods but to resume exports and foreign travel
