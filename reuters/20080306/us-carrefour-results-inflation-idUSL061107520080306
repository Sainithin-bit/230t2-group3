 PARIS  (Reuters) - Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) Chief Executive Jose Luis Duran said on Thursday food inflation in the group's stores was running at 3.5 percent and he expected the trend to continue. 

 "My best estimate is that the inflation rate will remain at 3 to 4 percent in the months to come," Duran told reporters on a conference call. "It's a global phenomenon. We see rates of inflation that are much higher than that in Asian countries, in Latin American countries. It's an issue in all our European countries, where average inflation for example in Spain, in Belgium, have registered rates higher than this 3 to 4 percent," he said. (Reporting by Nick Antonovics)
