 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co ( GE.N ) said on Thursday that it had obtained a $1 billion contract to supply electricity-generating wind turbines to Invenergy Wind LLC, its second billion-dollar contract with that company this year. 

 GE, the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, said it would supply Chicago-based Invenergy with 750 megawatts of wind turbines for North American projects to be built in 2010. The turbines would generate enough energy to meet the needs of about 200,000 households. The prior $1 billion order had been for European wind farms to be built in 2009. GE, which competes with Denmark's Vestas Wind Systems A/S ( VWS.CO ) and Germany's Siemens AG ( SIEGn.DE ) in the wind business, has forecast $6 billion in 2008 wind revenue, up from about $4 billion last year.
