 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union trade unions urged the European Central Bank to cut interest rates on Thursday to stem what both they and employers called the euro's "alarming" rise against the dollar. 

 The European Trade Union Confederation appealed to the Governing Council of the ECB, meeting in Frankfurt on Thursday, "to recognize at last that the balance of risks has shifted and that the threat to growth is now so serious that an urgent cut in interest rates is required". "The euro's continuing appreciation is becoming alarming," the umbrella group representing 82 trade union organizations in 36 countries said in a statement as the single European currency hit a new lifetime high above $1.53. However, market expectations were that the ECB would keep rates on hold at 4.0 percent because of record high inflation. Separately, BusinessEurope, the body representing companies in the EU, said firms would welcome a cut in borrowing costs but were worried about inflation and understood the ECB's caution. "If they (interest rates) are lowered, it would be positive and that is obvious," BusinessEurope President Ernest-Antoine Seilliere told a news conference. "Do companies ask for a rate cut? That is not evident," he said. "Members are concerned with inflation. If we see inflation progressing, there will be big pressure on wages and this will hurt the general competitiveness." Seilliere too called the euro's strength "alarming" but said it was not the main obstacle to EU competitiveness. Reiner Hoffmann, deputy general secretary of the ETUC, said: "It is not credible for European policy makers to ask the United States to do something about the value of the dollar if, back home, the ECB is actually promoting a weak dollar by stubbornly keeping European interest rates much higher than U.S. rates." ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said this week it was very important that the U.S. government had reaffirmed that a strong dollar was in the interest of the United States. That verbal intervention, echoed by euro zone and EU finance ministers on Monday and Tuesday, braked the euro's rise for less than 48 hours.
