 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Action sports apparel maker Quiksilver Inc ( ZQK.N ) on Thursday posted a fiscal first quarter net loss, as delayed reorders of winter sports merchandise and weak consumer spending hurt results. 

 The net loss was $21.9 million, or 18 cents per share, compared with a year-ago net profit of $2.5 million, or 2 cents per share. The loss from continuing operations was 12 cents a share, Quiksilver said. Total sales rose 14 percent to $605.3 million from $528.7 million, Quiksilver said. In January, Quiksilver widened its projected loss due to weakness at its company-owned stores and retailers that were selling last season's ski merchandise before placing new orders. The Rossignol ski equipment business has been a thorn in Quiksilver's side since it acquired the French brand in 2005 to widespread skepticism on Wall Street. Now, Quiksilver is looking to unload the hard-goods brand. Quiksilver President Bernard Mariette, widely believed to have been responsible for the Rossignol acquisition, resigned his post last month and said he might try to acquire Rossignol from Quiksilver. On Thursday, the Huntington Beach, California company said it was still resolved to reduce or eliminate its exposure to the winter sports business. Quiksilver shares closed at $8.06 on the New York Stock Exchange after dropping 93 cents, or more than 10 percent, during Thursday's session. (Reporting by  Nichola Groom ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
