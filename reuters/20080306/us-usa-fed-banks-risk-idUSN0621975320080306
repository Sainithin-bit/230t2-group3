 NEW YORK/ZURICH  (Reuters) - Senior banking supervisors proposed tougher international rules on Thursday that could see regulators taking a heavier hand in day-to-day management and make some complex investments more expensive. 

 Regulators said lessons from the credit crisis pointed to the need for heavier controls on risk management and valuation practices to prevent financial crises like the ongoing credit crunch that threatens to stall global economic growth. "Individual national supervisors will review and strengthen, as appropriate, existing guidance on risk management practices, valuation practices, and the controls over both," said William Rutledge of the New York Federal Reserve, head of a five-nation group charged with reviewing the crisis. The five nations are France, Germany, Switzerland, Britain and the United States. Rutledge said supervisors were ensuring that banks reformed risk practices that included deficiencies in senior management, emergency funding planning, and risk measurement. In a letter to Mario Draghi, head of the Financial Stability Forum (FSF) -- the global grouping of banking, insurance and markets regulators -- Rutledge said supervisors wanted to strengthen the global banking rulebook known as the Basel Accord. The accord should assure that financial firms are not able to pass risky investments to one another without more accountability and that they take better account of off-balance sheet risks that could prove costly in times of stress. FAIL TO UNDERSTAND Rutledge said some major banks and securities firms that have suffered huge credit losses failed to understand the inherent risks of securities they bought. Amid the growing market upheaval, regulators met on February 19 and released a report on Thursday compiled from late 2007 that assesses damage to the financial system from subprime mortgage debt's meltdown, the New York Federal Reserve said. "In particular, some firms made strategic decisions to retain large exposures to super-senior tranches of collateralized debt obligations that far exceeded the firms' understanding of the risks inherent in such instruments," the letter stated. "Some firms failed to price properly the risk that exposures to certain off-balance-sheet vehicles might need to be funded on the balance sheet," the letter stated. The FSF and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are housed at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. The BIS is the global bank that is controlled by and serves the world's largest central banks.
