 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England held interest rates at 5.25 percent on Thursday, but is widely expected to cut them again by the middle of the year to shore up an economy buffeted by the global credit crunch. 

 All but one of 65 economists polled last week forecast the Bank would leave British rates on hold after cutting them twice in the past three months. Surveys this week showing prices accelerating at record rates only cemented those expectations. Inflation worries aside, most experts say the central bank will have to cut again soon to prevent a sharp slowdown in the economy. Finance minister Alistair Darling is expected to revise down the Treasury's growth outlook in his first budget next week. "We expect the next (BoE rate) move to come in May ... falling to a low of 4.5 percent by the end of this year," said George Buckley, chief UK economist at Deutsche Bank. Sterling edged up versus the dollar and euro, while interest rate futures slipped as some dealers had prepared themselves for the kind of surprise cut that the BoE has made in the past. DILEMMA The BoE made no statement to accompany its decision but Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) members have been out in force in recent weeks to say they have to balance the competing demands of slowing growth and rising inflation. Oil costing over $100 a barrel and soaring food prices are putting huge upward pressure on inflation around the world, just when the beneficial effect of cheap goods from China is beginning to fade. The European Central Bank also held its main interest rate steady on Thursday, precisely because it is worried about rising price pressures. Inflation in Britain is expected to rise sharply above the BoE's 2 percent target in the next months and could even top 3 percent, which would force BoE Governor Meryn King to explain himself to the government. Against that the credit crunch -- which started with a blowout of risky mortgage lending in the United States and has prompted savage monetary easing by the Federal Reserve -- is already having an effect on the real economy. House prices fell another 0.3 percent in February, according to Halifax, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, and many people are worried about a sharp slowdown as cash-strapped banks curb the easy lending practices of the last seven years. "Inflation fears mean that the MPC will continue to cut interest rates only gradually. I think that they will be left on hold in April before falling to 5 percent in May," said Roger Bootle, economic adviser to Deloitte. "Such a slow pace of policy loosening will exacerbate the economic downturn. I think that GDP growth will slow to around 1.7 percent this year and about 1.5 percent next year, condemning the UK to its weakest period of growth in 15 years." Policymakers, however, are predicting a quicker economic upturn after a slowdown this year. Many believe the current problems stem from interest rates staying too low around the world for too long -- the Fed kept U.S. rates at 1 percent for a year after the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. Britain escaped recession then but this time the government can't rely on a massive fiscal injection to bolster growth as borrowing is already high. Finance minister Darling must hope that tighter credit won't hurt the housing market too much and won't prevent an economic upturn which his Labor Party will need as it prepares for an election expected some time next year.
