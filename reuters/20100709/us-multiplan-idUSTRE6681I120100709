 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firms BC Partners BCPRT.UL and Silver Lake Partners SILAK.UL are set to buy U.S. healthcare services firm MultiPlan from two other buyout shops, the companies announced on Friday, in a deal worth about $3.1 billion. 

 BC Partners and Silver Lake are buying MultiPlan, which provides systems to reduce the cost of healthcare claims, from rival buyout firms Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe. It is another example of private equity firms buying companies from each other as they look to deploy hundreds of billions of dollars of unspent funds. BC Partners' Raymond Svider said in a telephone interview that BC and Silver Lake are investing about 40 percent of the $3.1 billion deal value -- over $1 billion -- in equity. The remainder is being financed by debt, he said. The two private equity firms will own equal stakes in the company. "It's an incredibly favorable time to invest," said Svider, who is co-chairman and a managing partner of BC Partners, as well as the head of the New York office. A source familiar with the deal also said it is expected to include about $2 billion in debt. It would be the biggest deal this year in which private equity firms have bought from rival firms -- known as a secondary buyout. Carlyle invested in MultiPlan in 2006 and Welsh Carson, which specializes in healthcare and information services investments, invested in 2007, according to the companies' websites. MultiPlan is the leading provider of healthcare cost management services to insurers and health plan administrators in the U.S., processing more than 100 million medical claims a year. The healthcare industry has been a hot spot for private equity deals as firms target a sector that has proved resilient during the financial crisis. U.S. buyout firm TPG Capital LP TPG.UL and Canada Pension Plan last November led the $4 billion buyout of prescription drug sales data provider IMS Health, the largest leveraged buyout deal of 2009. BC and Silver Lake together own a majority of satellite services group Intelsat INTSAT.UL and previously partnered in Unitymedia UNTMDA.UL, the German cable television provider. The deal marks BC's 15th acquisition out of its current 5.8 billion euro ($7.36 billion) fund, raised in 2005 before the peak of the leveraged buyout (LBO) boom. It has spent about 85 percent of the capital and aims to start a new fund-raising drive later this year.
