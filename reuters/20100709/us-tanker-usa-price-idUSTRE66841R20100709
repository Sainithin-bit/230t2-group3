 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said it offered to build 179 U.S. Air Force tankers at a lower price than in its previous competition for the deal against EADS ( EAD.PA ), then partnered with Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ). 

 "We have been able to develop an offer that meets or beats the Air Force's 372 requirements at a price that is less than our previous offer," Jean Chamberlin, general manager of the Boeing bid, told Reuters Friday in a telephone interview. (Reporting by  Jim Wolf ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
