 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. drug reviewers are deeply divided over the heart risks of GlaxoSmithKline Plc's diabetes drug Avandia, leaving it to an expert panel to recommend next week if the drug is too dangerous to stay on the market. 

 More than 700 pages of internal documents, released on Friday, showed some staff at the Food and Drug Administration believe Avandia may increase the chances of a heart attack but other officials back its safety. Glaxo shares were down 1 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $34.56 during mid-morning trading. Glaxo has said a clinical trial called Record shows the drug is safe for the heart, but an FDA cardiology expert sharply criticized the study. The trial "was inadequately designed and conducted to provide any reassurance about" the cardiovascular risks of Avandia, said Dr. Thomas Marciniak, a medical team leader in the FDA division that reviews heart drugs. He said the findings suggested Avandia increased the chances of a heart attack and "biases in the study suggest that the true risk could be higher." But Dr. Ellis Unger, a deputy director in FDA's drugs center, said "aside from the known risk of heart failure, the study does not appear to demonstrate harm" from Avandia. The drug's warning label already warns of the heart failure risk. Other FDA staff compared the risks of Avandia and a competitor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's Actos. An analysis of several clinical trials found major problems such as heart attacks, strokes or related deaths were lower for Actos compared with other diabetes drugs or a placebo. They said, however, that differences in the design of the studies limited the ability to directly compare Avandia and Actos. At the panel meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, the FDA advisers will consider a range of options for Avandia, including if the medicine should be pulled from the market over heart risks. They also will weigh other possibilities that would allow Avandia sales to continue. They include restricting the drug's use, beefing up warnings or removing a strong heart-attack warning added in 2007. European regulators said on Friday they were launching a new probe into the safety of Avandia, adding to pressure on the medicine. The FDA and its expert panel must pore over a mass of studies that have various strengths and weaknesses and provide conflicting findings about the heart risk. Some FDA staff have pushed for the drug to come off the market. "There is not complete unanimity within the FDA about the interpretation of these data," Dr. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA's drugs center, told reporters on Thursday. The FDA usually follows the advice of its expert panels. Avandia remains widely used but its 2009 U.S. sales of $663 million made up just 1.5 percent of Glaxo's total revenue. Investors are more concerned about potential liability for the British drug giant if Avandia comes off the market rather than reduced sales. Controversy has dogged the drug since 2007 when Cleveland Clinic researchers linked the pill to a higher heart-attack risk. An advisory panel that year agreed the data suggested Avandia may increase the chances of a heart attack for some patients but said the medicine should remain an option. Glaxo says the overall data shows Avandia does not increase the overall risk of heart attack, stroke or death and it is the only oral anti-diabetes drug that has been shown to control blood sugar for up to five years. "We look forward to presenting these data and participating in a rigorous scientific discussion" at the panel meeting, GlaxoSmithKline Vice President Murray Stewart said in a statement.
