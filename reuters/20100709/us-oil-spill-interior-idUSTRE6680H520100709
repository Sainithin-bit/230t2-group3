 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department on Thursday reiterated it will issue a new ban on deepwater oil drilling in response to a U.S. Appeals Court ruling against the moratorium. 

 The department did not say when the new drilling ban would be issued. "Based on what we have learned since the BP oil spill it has become increasingly clear that companies may not have adequate containment and response capabilities to respond to a spill and therefore as the secretary has said previously, he will be issuing a new moratorium," Interior Department spokeswoman Kendra Barkoff said.
