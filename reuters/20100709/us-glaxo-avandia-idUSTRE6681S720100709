 LONDON/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline Plc's diabetes pill Avandia came under intense scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic on Friday, leaving the drug's future uncertain as its maker battles a wave of lawsuits. 

 In London, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) launched a new review into Avandia's risks and benefits, adding to pressure on a product that faces a grilling from U.S. experts next week over its cardiovascular safety. Scientists within the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are deeply divided over Avandia's heart risks amid conflicting data, according to more than 700 pages of documents prepared for the July 13-14 advisory panel meeting. The FDA and EMA will consider a range of options, including whether the medicine should be pulled from the market. Some doctors want to keep Avandia as a possible treatment for lowering blood sugar for people who are not helped by other medicines for diabetes, a disease that causes heart disease, blindness and other complications. But critics, including some FDA staff, say diabetics have plenty of alternatives and Avandia should be banned. The pill was once Glaxo's second-biggest drug but its sales have plunged since safety fears erupted three years ago. Revenues totaled 771 million pounds ($1.17 billion) in 2009, equivalent to 2.7 percent of Glaxo's group sales. The big worry for investors, though, is litigation. Concerns about the medicine's adverse impact on the heart have triggered a slew of lawsuits in the United States and fresh criticism of the drug from regulators is likely to make matters worse by playing into the hands of plaintiff lawyers. Glaxo has vigorously defended the medicine, based in part on a study called Record that the British drugmaker said found no higher rates of heart-related hospitalizations or deaths. An FDA cardiology expert sharply criticized the study in a memo prepared for the advisory panel. The trial "was inadequately designed and conducted to provide any reassurance about" the cardiovascular risks of Avandia, wrote Dr. Thomas Marciniak, a medical team leader in the FDA division that reviews heart drugs. But Dr. Ellis Unger, a deputy director in FDA's drugs center, said "aside from the known risk of heart failure, the study does not appear to demonstrate harm" from Avandia. The drug's warning label already warns about heart failure risk. Glaxo's European medical director, Tony Hoos, said Avandia was "an important treatment option for appropriate Type 2 diabetes patients." The company said overall data, including six clinical trials, showed Avandia does not increase the risk of heart attack, stroke or death. The medicine also is the only oral anti-diabetes drug that has been shown to control blood sugar for up to five years, Glaxo said. The FDA usually follows recommendations from its advisory panels but is not required to. Glaxo shares closed Friday just 0.2 percent lower on the New York Stock Exchange after closing unchanged in London, where they recovered from being down as much as 2.6 percent. OUTSPOKEN CRITICS Persuading doctors and patients of the drug's benefits is becoming an uphill battle, with two recent negative studies. In one study, Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at Ohio's Cleveland Clinic and an outspoken Avandia critic, offered more ammunition to his 2007 analysis that first suggested Avandia raises heart risks. In the second, FDA reviewer David Graham found Avandia was more dangerous to the heart than a competitor, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co's Actos. Both Graham and Nissen believe the drug is too risky to stay on the market and will speak to the panel. Ambrian Partners analyst Mike Ward said "the ultimate downside would be a panel recommendation for Avandia's withdrawal, which FDA would not have to act upon but probably would, given the politics of the situation." "More likely, is yet further tightening of Avandia's label or maybe a restriction on its use to patients failing on Actos therapy," Ward said. FDA staff will present results of an analysis comparing Avandia with Actos at next week's meeting. A review of several clinical trials found heart attacks, strokes or related deaths were lower for Actos compared with other diabetes drugs or a placebo. FDA staff added, however, that differences in study design limited their ability to directly compare the drugs. The FDA is turning to the advisory panel to help sort out the mixed data. "There is not complete unanimity within the FDA about the interpretation of these data," Dr. Janet Woodcock, head of the FDA's drugs center, told reporters. A current trial called Tide was designed to test Avandia directly against Actos. Critics who see Actos as safer have called the study unethical. The FDA will ask the advisory panel if the study should continue. TEST OF FDA The Avandia controversy is seen as a test for the FDA under Democratic President Barack Obama and his chosen leader, Commissioner Margaret Hamburg. Doctors, drugmakers, investors and patient advocates are closely watching the decision as a sign of how the agency will handle future medicines. Concerns have dogged Avandia since 2007 when Cleveland Clinic researchers linked the pill to a higher heart-attack risk. An advisory panel that year agreed the data suggested Avandia may increase the chances of a heart attack for some patients but said the medicine should remain an option. European regulators have also concluded in a number of previous reviews -- the last of which was early this year -- that the overall risk-to-benefit balance was favorable. But that verdict may not last and the EMA said it would decide once relevant data was analyzed if Avandia's marketing authorization should be revoked, suspended or changed. Experts from the agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use will discuss the issue at their next plenary meeting in London on July 19-22.
