 (Reuters) - Wachovia Bank, owned by Wells Fargo & Co, agreed to pay $148 million in a settlement with federal and state authorities over allegations of bid-rigging and other abuses in the municipal bond derivatives market. 
 Wachovia rigged at least 48 municipal bond reinvestment transactions in 25 states and Puerto Rico, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement announcing the pact on Thursday. The SEC said Wachovia agreed to the settlement without admitting or denying the allegations. Wells Fargo joins JPMorgan Chase & Co UBS AG and Bank of America Corp in settling with the government in a wide-ranging investigation that has netted $673 million in penalties and restitution. Municipal bond derivatives are contracts used to reinvest proceeds of bond sales until the funds are needed or to hedge interest-rate risk. Wachovia engaged in fraudulent bidding for these contracts from at least 1997 to 2005, according to the SEC's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey. The settlement requires court approval. The settlement includes a pact reached with 26 state attorneys general. Wachovia agreed to pay $54.5 million to state agencies, municipalities, school districts and nonprofits that entered into municipal bond derivative contracts with the bank between 1998 and 2004. The bank also agreed to pay the states a $1.25 million civil penalty and $3 million in fees and costs related to the probe. "My office has zero tolerance for such financial misconduct and will continue to work to hold those at fault responsible," New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement. Wells Fargo said in a statement the underlying transactions involved employees who are no longer with the firm. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo acquired Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia in 2008 at the peak of the financial crisis. The SEC said the bank won these contracts by obtaining information from bidding agents about competing bids and through "set-ups" in which bidding agents deliberately obtained non-winning bids, the SEC said. Wachovia also helped other bidders by deliberately submitting low bids, the agency said. "Wachovia won bids by playing an elaborate game of 'you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours,' rather than engaging in legitimate competition to win municipalities' business," Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC's enforcement division, said in a statement. The SEC did not file any charges against individuals associated with Wachovia. Wachovia also reached agreements with the U.S. Justice Department, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Internal Revenue Service. In November, Wells Fargo disclosed that it had also agreed to pay $37 million to resolve civil lawsuits brought by municipalities. Separately, the SEC said on Thursday that former Bank of America vice president Dean Pinard had agreed to pay $40,000 to settle charges of improper bid-rigging practices. He neither admitted nor denied the SEC's findings.
