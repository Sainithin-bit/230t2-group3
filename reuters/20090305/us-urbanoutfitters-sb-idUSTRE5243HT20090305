 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Urban Outfitters Inc ( URBN.O ) on Thursday posted a profit that missed Wall Street expectations after markdowns crimped earnings during the holiday shopping season, and shares fell as much as 12.7 percent. 

 Stock in the company known for its Urban Outfitters and Anthropologie stores and its Free People apparel line fell to $13.94 before rebounding to $14.89, down $1.08, in afternoon Nasdaq trading. Most apparel retailers have been forced to discount aggressively over the past few months to lure customers, who have cut slashed discretionary spending amid a tough recession that has whacked home and investment values and sent unemployment higher. During the fourth quarter ended January 31, the Philadelphia-based company said it was able to cut comparable inventory levels by 13 percent. It also reduced selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of sales by 73 basis points. However, it was unable to offset the impact of the markdowns, as gross profit margin fell 555 basis points from the year-earlier period. "The margin weakness was driven by higher markdowns to clear seasonal inventory and adjustments to the carrying value of spring product for anticipated markdowns," Thomas Weisel Partners analyst Liz Dunn said in a client note. Net income fell to $40.5 million, or 24 cents per share, from $53.6 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9 percent to $508.1 million. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the company to report earnings of 28 cents a share on revenue of $518.3 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Comparable retail segment sales, which include the company's direct-to-consumer channels, increased 3 percent for the quarter. Sales at established stores rose 3 percent at Urban Outfitters and fell 6 percent and 13 percent at Anthropologie and Free People, respectively, for a combined total company comparable store sales decrease of 1 percent. Direct-to-consumer sales surged 20 percent on strength from all of its brands, while Free People wholesale sales declined 3 percent for the quarter. The company, whose rivals include Aeropostale Inc ( ARO.N ) and American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ), also cut back on its store expansion plans for the fiscal year ending January 2010. It now expects to open 42 to 45 new stores, against earlier plans to open 52 stores. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares in Aeropostale were up 0.1 percent to $23.14 and American Eagle's stock was down 4.8 percent to $9.46.
