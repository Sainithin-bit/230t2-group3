 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones Indexes, creator of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI , said it was watching the Citigroup ( C.N ) situation "closely", when asked about its future inclusion in the 30-stock benchmark. 

 Citigroup, once the world's most valuable bank, briefly fell below $1 on Thursday, dropping as much as 14.2 percent to an intraday low of $0.97. "We are watching the situation closely and we continue to do so," said Naomi Kim, Dow Jones spokeswomen on Thursday, when asked if Citigroup would be removed from the blue-chip index.
