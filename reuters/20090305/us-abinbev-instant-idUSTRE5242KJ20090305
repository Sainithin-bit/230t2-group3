 LONDON  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch InBev INTB.BR, the world's largest brewer, is cutting back hard on costs in the deepest recession for a generation, but it has plenty to cut and a resilient United States beer market for support. 

 Many world brewers are cutting costs as economic growth slows but ABInBev, fresh from its $52 billion Anheuser-Busch (AB) takeover last November, has the bloated cost structure of the U.S.'s biggest brewer to slice into and its fearsome reputation for cost cutting to ensure its tough targets are met. The brewer of Stella Artois, Budweiser and Beck's hiked its three-year cost savings target to $2.25 billion from $1.5 billion with its 2008 results on Thursday to drive earnings growth, helping to push its already highly-rated shares up. "By our estimates, every incremental $100 million in savings adds 2 percent to ABI EPS," said UBS analyst Melissa Earlam. Last month, the world's third and fourth largest brewers Heineken ( HEIN.AS ) and Carlsberg ( CARLb.CO ) said they would be cutting costs and debts after the two bought and split up Britain's Scottish & Newcastle last year, while SABMiller ( SAB.L ), the world's second biggest brewer, is revising its future capital expenditure. The Belgium-based ABInBev moved quickly into cost savings mode with job cuts already announced in the United States and Britain, and it now says $250 million of cuts were made in 2008, $1 billion are due in 2009 and the rest in 2010 and 2011. ABInBev's share price has doubled since its nadir in November, driven by the potential earnings boost from the AB deal, and analysts say the higher target supports its highly rated shares. Philip Morrisey at Citi says the higher target underpins the group's earnings growth while relatively resilient beer volumes in the group's key markets of the United States and Brazil suggest that investors should buy the shares on any weakness. After completing the world's biggest cash takeover in November ABInBev moved quickly to announce 1,400 job cuts in the United States in December and by January said AB's London brewery would close next year with the loss of 182 jobs. "InBev was always a ruthless cost cutter but it is the early timing of the cuts that came as some surprise and shows it is determined to get to grip with costs at the old Anheuser Busch empire," said one industry analyst. Originally AB had looked to cut costs by $1 billion under its own 'Blue Ocean' plan, but that was quickly raised to $1.5 billion after the InBev takeover and it is now up to $2.25 billion with half those costs made by the end of this year. Analysts point out the most important drivers for ABInBev's short and medium term earnings growth will come from cost cutting from the AB acquisition and the performance of the key U.S. beer market, rather than the performance of the old InBev. ABInBev shares, which tumbled to a low of 9.96 euros in November, were up 2.4 percent at 19.94 euros by 1203 GMT on Thursday, when Heineken up 1.2 percent at 20.5 euros and SABMiller was ahead 0.3 percent at 958 pence. ABInBev shares trade at 12.5 times 2009 forecast earnings while Heineken is on 9.8 and Carlsberg on 7.9 times, according to Reuters data. SABMiller trades at 9.5 times for the year to March 2010. ABInBev also said it expected to cut its 2009 capital expenditure by at least $1 billion and to release at least $500 million from working capital efficiencies in the U.S. Analysts say once AB is fully included in ABInBev's results the United States will be the group's biggest profits center, earning around 40 percent of group profits, while Latin America's share will drop to a third from around a half before the acquisition. Therefore the U.S. beer market is key for ABInBev and JP Morgan analyst Mike Gibbs describes AB's domestic shipments as up a "very strong" 4.9 percent in the last 1-1/2 months of 2008 after the takeover was completed. Chief Financial Officer Felipe Dutra said the U.S. beer market, where the group has a share of around 50 percent, was resilient with profit margins set to expand this year due to price rises while volumes were currently stable.
