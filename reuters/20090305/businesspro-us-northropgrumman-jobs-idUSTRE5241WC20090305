 (Reuters) - Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) is planning to lay off as many as 750 workers, most of them in Southern California, as it consolidates administrative staffs at its El Segundo and Redondo Beach units, the Los Angeles Times said. 

 However, as the units, which were combined in January, still have more than 850 open positions for skilled, technical jobs in engineering and manufacturing, the company's workforce in the region could actually grow this year, Northrop spokesman Dan McClain told the paper. "We're anticipating that we will grow if we can fill all the positions," McClain was quoted as saying. The company develops aircraft and builds the fuselage for the F-18 E/F Super Hornet fighter jets in El Segundo, the paper said. In Redondo Beach, Northrop develops satellites and spacecraft, it added. (Reporting by Ratul Ray Chaudhuri in Bangalore; editing by Simon Jessop)
