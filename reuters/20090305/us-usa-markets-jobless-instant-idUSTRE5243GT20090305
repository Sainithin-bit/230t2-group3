 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, a government report showed on Thursday, but remained at high levels consistent with a severe recession. 

 U.S. non-farm productivity was much weaker than initially estimated in the fourth quarter as output contracted at its steepest pace since 1982, according to a government report on Thursday that underscored the deteriorating economic climate. KEY POINTS: JOBLESS CLAIMS * The Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell by 31,000 to a seasonally adjusted 639,000 in the week ended February 28 from an upwardly revised 670,000 the prior week. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast 650,000 new claims versus a previously reported 667,000 the previous week. * The number of people staying on the benefits roll after drawing an initial week of aid eased by 14,000 to 5.11 million in the week ended February 21, the latest week for which the data is available, from 5.12 million the previous week. PRODUCTIVITY REVISION * The Labor Department said non-farm productivity fell at a revised 0.4 percent annual rate, sharply below initial estimates of a 3.2 percent advance published last month and 2.2 percent rise in the third quarter. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast productivity increasing at a 1.5 percent rate. * Output was revised to show a steep 8.7 percent decline in the fourth quarter, the sharpest decline since the first quarter of 1982. It was initially estimated as a 5.5 percent fall. COMMENTS: TERRY MORRIS, SENIOR EQUITY MANAGER, NATIONAL PENN INVESTORS TRUST COMPANY, READING, PENNSYLVANIA: JOBLESS CLAIMS: "I would say it's positive news but it could just be an anomaly. What we really want to see is a trend. Certainly this is a sign of stability, maybe things have stopped getting worse at least on that side of things. But unemployment and employment is not really a leading indicator anyway. It's more like a coincident indicator or lagging indicator. The market will start to rally before there is any signs of employment." IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: PRODUCTIVITY: "The revisions to productivity and unit labor costs were worse than expected. Productivity was pulled down to -0.4 percent from +3.2 percent, while unit labor costs were revised up to 5.7 percent from 1.8 percent. So much for the surprising strength in productivity late last year; the only bit of good news from Q4 is gone." JOBLESS CLAIMS: "The leap in new jobless claims last week always looked suspiciously large, so no big surprise to see the drop this week. The underlying trend in claims, though, is still rapidly upwards. A leveling off in claims is usually one of the very first indicators of impending economic upturns, but there is no sign at all of that yet nor do we expect any until the summer at the earliest." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "The (jobless claims) downtick was pretty much meaningful... it's too early to say the bloodletting is over. Having said that, we are nearing an end to the layoffs in part because it is typical during late cycle activity. The big effect today is the ECB and Bank of England, which both lowered rates today." DAVID COARD, HEAD OF FIXED-INCOME SALES AND TRADING, WILLIAMS CAPITAL GROUP, NEW YORK: "It looks like Treasuries are responding favorably to the data. The claims data suggests we will continue to see weakness in the labor market." DAVID WYSS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, STANDARD & POOR'S, NEW YORK: "We had a bit of a drop, but a drop from a high level, so the numbers remain very high. The four-week average is up. "This continues to be a very weak labor market. We did get a drop in the number of people receiving benefits, but that was a drop from what was a record high, so there's not much relief in that statement. Generally it shows a very weak labor market. "Wal-Mart sales came in better than expected, and same-store sales in January were strong, so perhaps the death of the consumer is overstated. However, there is very much a tie between the labor market and retail sales. If you're afraid of losing your job you don't spend money, and if you lose your job you don't have any money to spend." PRODUCTIVITY REVISION: "That reflects likely more hours people worked, which means they are getting more pay which is a perverse economic benefit in this environment. One quarter is not a trend. It's not going to be major inflation concern." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures pare losses slightly. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains.
