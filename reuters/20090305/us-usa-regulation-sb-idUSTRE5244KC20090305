 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wall Street said the United States needed one regulator to oversee all risk in the financial system, but the hedge fund industry cautioned against revealing confidential information to the public. 

 At a House hearing on Thursday to examine systemic risk, the largest financial services companies and Congressional investigators said one regulator was needed to look across the entire financial system, collect information and use that data to take corrective action across financial institutions. Their comments come as Congress gets ready to overhaul the country's financial regulatory system amid the fallout of investment bank Lehman Brothers' collapse and the multibillion-dollar bailouts of insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ), whose hefty book of complex derivatives has endangered the global financial system. "Regardless of the ultimate structure of the financial regulatory system, a systemwide focus is vitally important," the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in prepared remarks to the House Financial Services subcommittee on capital markets. "Any regulator tasked with a systemwide focus would need broad authority to gather and disclose appropriate information ... and to take corrective action when necessary," the GAO said. The Managed Funds Association, a hedge fund lobbying group, said it recognized that a systemic risk regulator needs access to information to be able to adequately assess potential risks to the financial system. However the hedge fund industry said it was critical for such information to be kept confidential. The group said public disclosure of such information could be misleading. "Public investors may be inclined to take action based on this data without fully understanding the information, which could lead to adverse consequences for those investors," the MFA said in prepared remarks to the Congressional panel.
