 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of battered automaker General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) plunged more than 14 percent to $1.88 on Thursday after auditors raised "substantial doubt" about its viability. 

 Fellow Dow component General Electric ( GE.N ) briefly dipped 1 percent on worries about the U.S. conglomerate's outlook. But the stock quickly rebounded and rose 5 percent to $7.03. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
