 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks and oil fell on Thursday after General Motors ( GM.N ) warned of possible bankruptcy, while European currencies and yields stayed weak after the euro zone and UK central banks cut interest rates. 

 U.S. automaker GM said it had substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern if it fails to stem its losses and generate cash, and it may be forced to file for bankruptcy. The euro and sterling were down about 0.7 percent against the dollar after the European Central Bank and Bank of England cut interest rates to all-time lows. The BoE, after cutting the cost of borrowing to 0.5 percent, said it would buy assets worth 75 billion pounds in order to expand money supply. Euro zone rates now stand at 1.5 percent. "The Bank of England has been cutting rates aggressively now for several months, but it hasn't sparked life into the economy so it's high time for new medicine, namely quantitative easing," said Manoj Ladwa, senior trader at ETX Capital. "But it will only work if banks loosen their lending criteria and a measure of business confidence returns. The policy also needs to be monitored closely as increased money supply coupled with falling production could lead to demand outstripping supply and hyperinflation." The euro fell to at $1.2562 while sterling was down at $1.4092. The dollar rose 0.6 percent .DXY against a basket of major currencies. GM WARNING The MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS fell half a percent, approaching a six-year low hit on Wednesday. The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  fell 2.2 percent while U.S. stock futures were down about 1.5 percent. GM said if it was unable to successfully reorganize and if debtor-in-possession financing was unavailable, it would be forced to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. "When people hear the word bankruptcy it immediately brings up negative connotations," said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in New Brunswick, New Jersey. "It appears that the battle is being lost. It doesn't add confidence." Asian stocks .MIAPJ0000PUS lost 0.3 percent. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao disappointed investors as he did not announce an increase in the country's two-year economic stimulus plan, unveiled in November. Wen did say China would ramp up deficit spending this year to hits is 8-percent growth target. U.S. crude oil fell 3.1 percent to $43.95 a barrel after a nine-percent jump on Wednesday. The March Bund future rose 95 ticks. Two-year euro zone bond yield hit a record low of 1.148 percent. The June UK gilt future leapt three full points after the BoE said it would buy assets worth 75 billion sterling, focusing on medium- to long-term gilts, in a drive to help the economy by expanding money supply. Gold, a safe-haven asset which investors prefer in times of financial stress, rose to $913.55 an ounce. (Editing by Mike Peacock)
