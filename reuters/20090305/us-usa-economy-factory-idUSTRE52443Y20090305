 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders received by U.S. factories fell for a sixth straight month in January, official data showed on Thursday, further evidence the economy's downward spiral was gathering momentum. 

 The Commerce Department said factory orders fell 1.9 percent in January from a revised 4.9 percent decline in December, previously reported as a 3.9 percent drop. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting orders to drop 3.5 percent. The successive decline in orders is the longest streak since the series started in 1992, the department said. New orders for manufactured durable goods were revised to show a 4.5 percent drop, which was previously reported as a 5.2 percent decrease. An indicator of business confidence fell, as non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft slipped by 5.7 percent. Inventories of manufactured goods eased 0.8 percent, the biggest drop since September 2003, when the stock of unsold goods fell by a similar margin, the department said. Inventories have been falling for five consecutive months, which is the longest streak of straight monthly declines since the period from March 2003 to January 2004.
