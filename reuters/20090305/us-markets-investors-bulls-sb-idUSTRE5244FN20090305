 LONDON  (Reuters) - It is often said that a market reaches bottom when the last bull becomes a bear. But what about when the first bear becomes a bull? 

 Societe Generale's James Montier, one of a notoriously bearish team that moved to the French company from Dresdner Kleinwort in 2007, is now telling his clients that they have some "truly incredible" stock opportunities before them. It is not just, he says, that from a top-down perspective stocks have become cheap. From the bottom-up, a number of quality stocks are also passing muster for deep value based on earnings yield, dividend yield, price-to-earnings ratio etc. "Microsoft is appearing in the U.S. screen, BP in the UK, Novartis in the European screen, Sony in Japan and SK Telecom in the Asian version," he says. The significance of Montier's nascent love affair with equities is that he has been warning for years that trouble lay ahead. But he is not alone at the moment in seeing value in markets that have more than halved in value. Data from the World Federation of Exchanges shows global stock market valuation at $31 trillion at the end of January. That's down from $63 trillion 15 months earlier. Plenty of major institutional investors have been opining recently that the time is near for at least a temporary bounce. Giant U.S. investment house BlackRock noted that market falls have been so great that a "near-term and significant" rally could be in the offing. JPMorgan Asset Management's multi-asset group, meanwhile, has just added to its stock holdings. "Markets look massively oversold while money market mutual fund holdings are extremely bloated, indicating that any improvement in risk tolerance could bring a sizeable rally in risk assets," it said. CHEAP CAN GET CHEAPER There are certainly some conditions out there at the moment that are conducive to, at the very least, another bear market rally. Sharp falls last September and October, after all, did lead to a jump of more than 25 percent in world stocks. Globally, stocks have lost all of that gain since then. Reuters' latest asset allocation polls show the highly risk averse mood among investors to have stabilized while State Street's February take on institutional investor confidence hit a five-month high. Investors are also loaded with cash, with Europeans holding more than twice the typical weight in their portfolios. Some investors are also noting that markets are have thoroughly downgraded their view of the global economic climate and may now even see some signs of a bottoming out of the cycle of industrial decline. "We continue to look for a further rise in leading indicators as the inventory draw down comes to an end and the massive stimuli worldwide starts to kick in," says Danske Bank. With cash and, arguably, government bonds also offering little in the way of attractive returns, this could presage a shift. But none of these conditions appear to be enough to build an overwhelming conviction among investors that it is time to throw themselves wholeheartedly back into stocks. The move by JPMorgan, for example, was a baby step -- a mild raising of exposure. And BlackRock's thoughts about a rally were couched throughout with concerns about troubling downside risks. At the same time, there are plenty of other market players who maintain that the unwinding of stock markets that began in 2007 is nowhere near done. For example some chartists, who study patterns in graphs or indexes, reckon individual European indexes could still fall 15 percent to 30 percent before it is all over. And even SocGen's Montier is possibly more of a calf than the new bull on the block. "Cheap markets can always get cheaper," he says. (Editing by  Patrick Graham )
