 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from a Senate Banking Committee hearing on AIG ( AIG.N ) and the implications of its collapse on regulatory reform with Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, Acting Office of Thrift Supervision Director Scott Polakoff, and New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo. 

 FED'S KOHN ON POSSIBLE LOSSES FROM AIG BAILOUT: "I think ... the credit that the Federal Reserve has given is fully securitized and we do not expect a net loss from that. "I think the open question is how much of the equity that the Treasury has put in, a part of which went to pay off the Federal Reserve in November, will come back to the taxpayers." SEN. BOB CORKER ON WHY FED PAID, RATHER THAN GUARANTEED, AIG'S CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS: "Couldn't you have just said, this product was written up in an inane way. It's a ridiculous concept to have created an insurance product like this. We're not going to put up the collateral. I'm sorry. The company is bankrupt. But what we will do as the Fed is we will stand behind the obligation so that in the event there's ever a credit issue, we'll stand behind it. Wouldn't that have been a more intelligent thing to do?" FED'S KOHN ON AIG'S CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS: "Our authority under the Federal Reserve Act is to make loans. We thought it was a short-term liquidity situation -- in mid-September this is what we thought -- and that if we could bridge this situation with liquidity, then the company could make the adjustments to keep itself a going concern." "It turned out that the problems were deeper, the financial markets were a lot worse, became a lot worse, and the whole situation deteriorated badly. KOHN ON AIG BAILOUT, COUNTERPARTIES: "I wish with every fiber in my body that we didn't have to come in and do what we did... "I wasn't worried so much about counterparties, I'm worried about other U.S. institutions operating in the financial markets." FED'S KOHN ON NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY: "I agree that the Federal Reserve needs to do things very carefully about what it's revealing in the transparency of its operations, across a broad range of our operations today. We're in a new world and new types of transparency are required." KOHN ON NAMING AIG COUNTERPARTIES: "I would be very concerned that if we started revealing lists of names of people who did transactions with companies who later came in under government protection, got capital, that sort of thing, that people just would not want to do transactions with (these) companies. ... As you said Mr. Chairman, insurance companies are essential to keep credit flowing. We need AIG to be stable and continue in a stable condition. And I would be very concerned that if we started giving out the names of counterparties here people would not want to do business with AIG." KOHN ON LACK OF AIG OVERSIGHT: No one was minding the whole company and looking at how things interacted, and whether the whole company would, under some circumstances, put the financial system at risk. OTS'S POLAKOFF ON OTS'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR AIG: "It's time for OTS to raise their hand and say we have some responsibility and accountability here. This entity was deemed a savings and loan holding company. We were deemed an acceptable regulator for both U.S. domestic and international operations. The segment -- this AIG Financial Products -- was an unregulated ... subsidiary of AIG, but part of the overall consolidated regulatory responsibilities of OTS." SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN CHRISTOPHER DODD ON GOVERNMENT MANAGEMENT OF AIG BAILOUT: "That we find ourselves in this situation at all, is in my mind, and in the minds of many of my constituents, quite frankly, sickening. ... "The lack of transparency and accountability in this process has been rather stunning. Throughout the entire fourth quarter last year, it was frankly never clear, who owned AIG, or who was in charge." DODD ON PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR AIG BAILOUT: "Public confidence in what we're doing is at stake and that right now the public is deeply, deeply troubled by all this and it is their money that is being poured to these operations. And they frankly don't understand, nor do we understand these legal arguments you're giving at a time we need to engender public trust and confidence in these very difficult steps." DINALLO ON AIG FAILURE: "I fundamentally believe that the problems at AIG had absolutely nothing to do ... with the operating companies."
