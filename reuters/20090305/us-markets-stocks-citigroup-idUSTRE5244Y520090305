 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Citigroup ( C.N ), once the world's most valuable bank, tumbled below $1 on Thursday, taking its year-to-date drop to 85 percent. 

 Citigroup, a Dow component, fell more than 13 percent to an intraday low of $0.98, hammered by continued fears over the bank's health and ability to avert nationalization. About two years ago, Citi's market value was above $270 billion. Today its market cap is a little over $5.4 billion. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
