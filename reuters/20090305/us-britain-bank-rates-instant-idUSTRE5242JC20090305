 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England cut interest rates by 50 basis points as expected on Thursday to a record low of 0.5 percent and announced it would spend 75 billion sterling on asset purchases to pump more money into the economy and kickstart commercial lending, a process known as quantitative easing. 

 Following are reactions from business groups and economists to the decision. TREVOR WILLIAMS, GROUP HEAD OF ECONOMIC RESEARCH, LLOYDS TSB FINANCIAL MARKETS "This was no surprise to markets - the market was expecting the cut and has expected an announcement on quantitative easing. "The surprise, if anything, came in the fact that the BoE announced an amount, which is probably what led sterling to weaken. "But there isn't any particular worry about the announcement as the amount was within what markets were speculating." ROB CARNELL, ING FINANCIAL MARKETS "At 75 billion sterling, the amount earmarked for the expanded asset purchase facility is at the lower end of expectations of 50-150 billion. But it looks as if the governor of the Bank of England had asked for the facility to be 150 billion. It is unclear at this stage whether there is a further 75 billion waiting in the wings and that might be only a first installment. This policy should result in falls in yields in the UK Gilts market, and could help depress yields across a broad range of credit and mortgage markets. "...this puts the Bank of England ahead of the US Fed in terms of the scope of its unconventional easing." ROSS WALKER, UK ECONOMIST, RBS FINANCIAL MARKETS "The sort of numbers they are talking about (for the asset purchase scheme)...are sort of the ballpark you would have expected. "The fact that they are saying over three months, (which is) maybe slightly quicker than would have been expected. The statement is fairly dovish, you know they are still talking about a substantial undershoot in inflation. "Interest rate move was pretty much as expected. The risks were that they didn't do anything more, economists were largely lined up behind half a point, that's what the market price did, why do anything else?" AMIT KARA, UK ECONOMIST, UBS "It is in line with expectations. The decision to embark on an asset purchase of 75 billion is obviously the right move. We think it is a start and will probably end up double the size, probably over the course of the year." DAVID PAGE, ECONOMIST, INVESTEC, LONDON "The rate cut came as expected but the start of quantitative easing was bolder than expected. "The move to buy 75 billion pounds in assets, we think that by default will be conducted in mid- to long-term government securities, and this suggests that we will see more buying activity in Gilts. "Basically, it was a bigger monetary policy stimulus that expected, and so bonds are rising." HOWARD ARCHER, GLOBAL INSIGHT "On the rate cut, it's what we expected. They've obviously taken the view that another cut will have overall beneficial effects on the economy, despite the hit to savers. "QE is going to come to the forefront of the BoE's measures now... I suspect the BoE will want to tread fairly carefully to begin with. I suspect as a starting point it's (the 75 billion pound initial asset purchase level) roughly around what people were expecting." LEE HOPLEY, HEAD OF ECONOMIC POLICY, ENGINEERING EMPLOYERS' FEDERATION "Whilst today's cut is welcome it will pass many companies by given how low rates are already. Manufacturers are far more concerned with the health of the economy, the financial system and greater access to cheaper credit. While it may be a bold step into the unknown, swift and steady implementation of unconventional measures from the Bank is now the right move." IAN MCCAFFERTY, CBI CHIEF ECONOMIC ADVISOR "With interest rates already at historic lows, the conventional rate cutting tool is becoming less and less effective as a means of stimulating the economy. "Though this latest cut will help support business and consumer confidence, it is unlikely to have a dramatic impact on the cost or availability of credit. "A swift move toward quantitative easing as a way of boosting money supply and lending directly is now the MPC's best bet for supporting the economy and getting credit flowing again. "In the current economic circumstances, the risks of higher inflation from such an action would be low." DAVID KERN, ECONOMIC ADVISER, BRITISH CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE "With rates close to zero we are now entering a new and more uncertain phase. In the face of a severe recession, we must be reassured that monetary policy will remain expansionary. "To be effective, the quantitative easing measures will have to be forceful as well as transparent to help calm the markets and lessen speculation against sterling. "The authorities must also spell out the roles played by the Bank of England, MPC and the Treasury, otherwise these measures will not work effectively."
