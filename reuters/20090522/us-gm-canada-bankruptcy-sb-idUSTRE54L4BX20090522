 TORONTO  (Reuters) - It is very likely that General Motors Corp will file for bankruptcy protection in the United States but the company is "trying to pull out all stops" to avoid doing the same in Canada, the Canadian Auto Workers union said on Friday. 

 CAW President Ken Lewenza said after announcing a tentative labor deal with GM that, as of Thursday night, it was not 100 percent certain that the company would have to file under Canada's Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA). But he said that if GM Canada does go into CCAA, the collective agreement just reached would be protected. (Reporting by  John McCrank , writing by Randall Palmer; editing by Rob Wilson)
