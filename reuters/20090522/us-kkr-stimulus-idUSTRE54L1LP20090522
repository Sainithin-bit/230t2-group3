 (Reuters) - Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL may take advantage of the U.S. government's infrastructure stimulus plan but is not as keen on buying banks or their troubled assets, the private equity firm's co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts told the Financial Times. 

 Kravis told the paper that there may be some programs where it will be appropriate for the firm to partner with the U.S. government. "I think one area in particular that I think is a very big need and where we will have opportunities to participate is in infrastructure." Kravis told the paper that the firm was looking at the public-private investment partnership and other initiatives, but the partners expressed caution about an overly opportunistic approach. "Simply buying a pool of assets through a highly levered vehicle because a government is willing to give you more leverage than the markets and just sitting there and running off the assets and giving the money back to your partners is not what we do," Roberts told the paper.
