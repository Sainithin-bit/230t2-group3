 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian carmaker GAZ ( GAZA.RTS ) is not looking to acquire a stake in Opel if Canada's Magna MGa.TO wins the race for Germany's carmaker, the firm said on Friday. 

 Magna is bidding for Opel in alliance with GAZ and Russia's largest bank, Sberbank SBER03.MM. Magna said on Friday its Opel takeover concept foresees GM ( GM.N ) holding 35 percent, Russian partners another 35 percent, Magna itself 20 percent and employees 10 percent. "We are not acquiring a stake. Our role is that of technological partner," said GAZ deputy head Yelena Matveyeva. She declined to comment when asked whether it meant that Sberbank would acquire 35 percent of Opel. (Reporting by Anton Doroshev, writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; editing by Robin Paxton)
