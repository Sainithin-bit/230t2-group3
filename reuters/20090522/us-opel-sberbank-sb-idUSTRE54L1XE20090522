 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Sberbank SBER03.MM, Russia's largest lender, is considering providing a financial guarantee as part of Canadian auto parts maker Magna's MGa.TO bid for German carmaker Opel, a bank shareholder said on Friday. 

 "Sberbank officials said the bank was looking at financial guarantees for Magna. We made an official request for additional clarification," Sberbank minority shareholder Alexei Navalny told Reuters by telephone. "For now we are talking neither about money nor loans, but guarantees," another source told Reuters on condition of anonymity. No further details were available. Sberbank was not immediately available for comment. Earlier on Friday the head of the German state where Opel is based said Magna's bid was the most attractive. Three groups, Magna, Fiat and industrial holding company RHJ International submitted offers for Opel, a unit of struggling U.S. carmaker General Motors ( GM.N ), by a Wednesday deadline. Top German government officials, including Chancellor Angela Merkel and Hesse leader Roland Koch, are due to meet later on Friday in Berlin to discuss the bids. Magna's bid includes Russian carmaker GAZ ( GAZA.RTS ) as an industrial partner. Sberbank's chief executive, German Gref, last week expressed lukewarm interest in a role in a bid for Opel. "For Sberbank to be a guarantor is better than to provide loans or give cash. But fundamentally financial guarantees are pretty much the same (as loans)," Rustam Botashev, analyst at Unicredit Securities said. Analysts say Sberbank and GAZ, owned by indebted aluminum tycoon Oleg Deripaska, are likely being nudged toward the deal by the government of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, which tacitly promotes Russian investment abroad to boost influence.
