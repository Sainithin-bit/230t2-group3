 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Senate on Thursday rejected a measure that would steer troubled financial giants toward bankruptcy, rather than a new process that would allow the government to seize and dismantle distressed firms. 

 By a vote of 42 to 58, the Senate rejected the proposal by Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who argued that the process contained in a sweeping rewrite of financial regulations would be open to political or legal manipulation. Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd, who is overseeing the Wall Street overhaul, argued that regulators need a quicker method than bankruptcy to avoid a repeat of the chaos that followed the 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Bros.
