 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors in New York are conducting a broad criminal investigation into whether major Wall Street financial firms misled investors, a person familiar with the matter said on Thursday. 

 The person said the preliminary criminal probe is being conducted with U.S. securities regulators and involves JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, UBS, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The person said the investigation included mortgage-bond deals, that it was in an early stage and that it might not necessarily lead to criminal charges against all of the  firms. The person spoke anonymously because the probe is ongoing. (Reporting by  James Vicini , Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
