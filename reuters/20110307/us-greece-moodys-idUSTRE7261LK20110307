 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Moody's slashed Greece's credit rating on Monday on fears the country's efforts to cut its debt will not be enough, heaping further pressure on EU leaders to ease the repayment terms of its bailout loans or risk a default. 

 Moody's cut the country's rating by three notches to B1 with a negative outlook, citing significant risks to the country's fiscal consolidation plan and risks of a debt restructuring. Following are analyst comments on the Moody's action. CHRISTOPH WEIL, ECONOMIST AT COMMERZBANK "This is not going to be the last downgrade for Greece. The market has already discounted that Greece will need to restructure its debt, so the rating agencies are just running behind the market. "This will not affect the ongoing negotiations with the EU. The ECB has already said it is accepting all kinds of euro zone government bonds as collateral." JUERGEN MICHELS, ECONOMIST AT CITIGROUP "This is a sign that measures proposed by (EU Monetary Affairs) Commissioner Rehn in his Handelsblatt interview, such as privatizations and lowering the interest on Greek bailout loans, will not eliminate the problem." "Greek debt remains high and there is always the risk of a haircut. We expect, not immediately but in the coming years, that more measures will be needed, maybe even a haircut." SARAH CARLSON, LEAD ANALYST ON GREECE, MOODY'S "Our central case remains that the Greek government is going to achieve its objectives without needing to impose losses on creditors."
