 PARIS  (Reuters) - Bernard Arnault, the undisputed king of luxury, is a very patient man. 

 Arnault has shown he can remain quietly in the background for a long time before pouncing on a target. And he did it again on Monday when his luxury group, LVMH, snapped up Roman jeweler Bulgari BULG.MI for 3.7 billion euros ($5.18 billion). Arnault, a friend of French president Nicolas Sarkozy, had been courting Bulgari's Trapani family for nearly decade, people close to the talks said on Monday. But Arnault waited for Bulgari to dip into loss, hit by the financial crisis and struggle to recover, before making his final move. "He is remarkably patient," says Vogue editor Anna Wintour, with whom Arnault lunches at least twice a year. Arnault also found the right arguments to convince Bulgari's controlling shareholder, the Trapani family, which was still saying a year ago the company was not for sale. He offered them 3.5 percent of LVMH, an unprecedented move for that company, which has made most of its acquisitions in cash. "They (Trapani family) would not have accepted a cash offer," one of the people involved in the talks said. Arnault also elevated Bulgari Chief Executive Francesco Trapani to head all of LVMH's watch and jewelry division, which includes the Chaumet and Fred brands as well as Tag Heuer and Hublot watches. The deal will double LVMH's watch and jewelry sales to about 10 percent of total turnover. Arnault also offered Bulgari two seats on the LVMH board. The package was attractive enough to best rivals such as retailer PPR ( PRTP.PA ) and Switzerland's Richemont ( CFR.VX ), which both tried to woo Bulgari, people close to the groups said. "I have been at Bulgari for 27 years," Trapani said on Monday in a conference call. "I have met everybody in the luxury industry, so I had possibilities with all these people." Asked why he chose LVMH Trapani said: "LVMH was the ideal partner. I like being the future head of the group's watch and jewelry (division), but also (LVMH shares) it is a good investment." Arnault, schooled at the prestigious Ecole Polytechnique, joined his father's construction company at the age of 25. He earned the reputation of a ruthless corporate raider after pushing out shareholder rivals when he started building the LVMH group in the 1990s with the Louis Vuitton, Moet and Hennessy brands. His image as a predator stuck to him afterward when he fought in vain to acquire Gucci in 1999 and 2000. Monday's friendly deal with Bulgari enables Arnault to shed some of his darker image and send a positive message to Hermes ( HRMS.PA ), another family-controlled business he has been chasing for some time. The Hermes family, who regard LVMH's 20.2 percent stake in their company as hostile, have fought back by creating a controlling family holding. Arnault shocked the luxury world in October by announcing he had discretely built up a 17.1 percent stake in Hermes since 2008, mainly through derivatives. Referring to LVMH, Hermes Chief Executive Patrick Thomas said last week at his annual results presentation: "When you want to seduce a beauty, you don't start by raping her from behind." Thomas said Hermes did not have any contact with Arnault and did not want any. But Arnault is a very patient man. (Reporting by Astrid Wendlandt; editing by  Andre Grenon )
