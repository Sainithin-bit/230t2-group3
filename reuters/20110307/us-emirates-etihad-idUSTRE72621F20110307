 ABU DHABI  (Reuters) - Etihad Airways inked a $1.5 billion deal with Engine Alliance, owned by General Electric ( GE.N ) and United Technologies ( UTX.N ) unit Pratt & Whitney, to provide engines for its planned fleet of Airbus A380 aircraft. 

 The Abu Dhabi-based carrier said on Monday the GP7200 engines would be used to power a first batch of 10 A380s set to enter its fleet from 2014. The contract includes long-term fleet management for the maintenance, repair and overhaul of the engines. Emirates EMIRA.UL and Air France ( AIRF.PA ) currently operate GP7200-powered A380s. Etihad said in January its revenue grew 29 percent to $2.95 billion in 2010 and it was on track to break even this year and earn a profit in 2012. (Reporting by  Praveen Menon ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
