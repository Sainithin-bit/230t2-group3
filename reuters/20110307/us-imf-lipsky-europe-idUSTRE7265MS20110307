 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund stands willing to partner with Europe to help indebted nations on a case-by-case basis, a top IMF official told Reuters on Monday. 

 In an interview with Reuters Insider, IMF first deputy managing director John Lipsky said European officials have said they will present a comprehensive mechanism for dealing with financial and economic strains in the euro area. "We'll have to see the specifics," Lipsky said. "Certainly everyone -- markets, investors, citizens -- are expecting to see some concrete progress."
