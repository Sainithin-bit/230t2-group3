 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's purchases of European government bonds should not be met with suspicion, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi said Monday. 

 China and Europe have common interests, and China has supported Europe in its efforts to stabilize its finances, Yang told a news conference held during China's annual national parliament session. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; Editing by  Ken Wills )
