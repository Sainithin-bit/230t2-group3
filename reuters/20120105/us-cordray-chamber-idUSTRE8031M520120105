 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An official at the Chamber of Commerce told Reuters on Wednesday that the group would not dismiss the option of a suit challenging President Obama's recess appointment of Richard Cordray to head the new consumer agency. 
 "We have made no decisions," said David Hirschmann, President of the Chamber's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness. "We are certainly not taking the option off the table." (Reporting By Alexandra Alper)
