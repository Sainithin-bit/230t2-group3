 ZURICH  (Reuters) - The following are comments by Swiss National Bank Chairman Philipp Hildebrand, his first public remarks over a controversial currency trade made by his wife three weeks before he oversaw moves to impose a cap on the Swiss franc. 
 Switzerland's top central banker is battling for his future and has faced calls from some right-wing politicians for his resignation. NOT RESIGNING "So long as I have the confidence of the government and the bank council, stepping down is not an issue for me." NO BREACH OF THE LAW "I have at all times time conducted myself not only as the regulations require but also correctly. I am not aware of any legal breaches. But I understand that the public also asks moral questions. "The rules of the SNB on own trading is equal to the European standards." SECRECY BREACHED FOR POLITICAL GOALS "I'm sorry that circles, which for years have been vehement proponents of Swiss bank secrecy, are willing to accept gross breaches of banking secrecy in their pursuit of political goals."
