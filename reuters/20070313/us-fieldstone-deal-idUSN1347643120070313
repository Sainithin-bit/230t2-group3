 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A deal to buy subprime mortgage lender Fieldstone Investment Corp. FICC.O for $5.53 per share may be in doubt as Fieldstone's share price fell about 23 percent to about $2.66 on Tuesday amid mounting troubles in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector, traders said. 


 "The market is telling you that the deal is not going to happen," said one arbitrageur, who declined to be named. On February 16, Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC (C-BASS), an affiliate of MGIC Investment Corp. ( MTG.N ) and Radian Group Inc. ( RDN.N ), said they planned to buy Fieldstone for $5.53 a share in cash. C-BASS, Radian and Fieldstone were not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. C-BASS buys whole loans and packages them into securities for sale to investors. The February 16 offer by C-BASS -- totaling about $259 million, according to Reuters data -- was more than twice Fieldstone's closing stock price of $2.60 per share on February 15. The meltdown among subprime mortgage lenders broadened on Tuesday, as shares of Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. lost about two-thirds of their value and New Century Financial Corp. sank, with investors fearing both would run out of cash. Accredited LEND.O said it needed to raise money after paying $190 million demanded by its lenders, is cutting an unspecified number of jobs, and is exploring "strategic options," including raising new capital. New Century ( NEWC.PK ) had trading in its shares suspended by the New York Stock Exchange prior to delisting and received a grand jury subpoena in a federal criminal probe. On Monday, the real estate investment trust had said it did not have enough cash to repay its own lenders. Tuesday's disclosures are the latest blows in the subprime area, where lenders make loans to people with poor credit histories. Data released on Tuesday show late payments on U.S. mortgages at a 3-1/2 year high. Investors are worried that more lenders might restructure or seek bankruptcy protection.
