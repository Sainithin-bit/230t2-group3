 PARIS  (Reuters) - Further interest rate tightening may be needed at some stage in the euro zone but inflation is "well under control", OECD Chief Economist Jean-Philippe Cotis told Reuters in an interview. 


 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development would review its stance on monetary policy by May, when it publishes a twice-yearly report on all member economies. But, Cotis said, for now it was sticking with what it said in November -- that the key ECB rate was expected to reach 4 percent by early 2008. The European Central Bank raised its key rate last week to 3.75 percent from 3.50. Cotis stressed the extent to which the OECD believed inflation prospects were benign. "The inflation outlook remains very peaceful," he said. Headline inflation was converging with core inflation at around 1.5 percent or thereabouts, he said, although such an outlook did not preclude a rate rise further down the road if the strength of growth justified such a move. "There may be a need for some tightening later," he said of rates. "The timing is open." The OECD has in the past urged the ECB to proceed cautiously with rate rises, especially when it began its monetary tightening campaign back in December 2005, when the key rate stood at a historic low of 2.0 percent. The series of rate rises since then appear to have done little damage to economic growth in the euro zone, which hit 2.7 percent in 2006, its best since 2000 and close to double the rate of growth of 2005. "It looks like a good recovery, not massive but good, with fairly limited upward (price) pressure so far," Cotis said.
