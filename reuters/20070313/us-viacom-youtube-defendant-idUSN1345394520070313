 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google is confident it respects the legal rights of copyright holders and will not let a $1 billion (517 million pound) lawsuit filed against by Viacom distract the company and its YouTube video-sharing unit from delivering videos, the Web search leader said on Tuesday. 


 Google spokesman Ricardo Reyes said in a statement via e-mail that: "We have not received the lawsuit but are confident that YouTube has respected the legal rights of copyright holders and believe the courts will agree". "We will certainly not let this suit become a distraction to the continuing growth and strong performance of YouTube," the statement said.
