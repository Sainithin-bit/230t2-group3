 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Retail sales rose just 0.1 percent in February and a growing number of Americans fell behind on their mortgages late last year, according to data on Tuesday that raised concerns about the economy. 


 Economists said unusually cold weather likely kept some shoppers at home last month, but others said the retail sales data probably reflected soft economic conditions as well. The midday report on mortgage delinquencies helped push the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  down more than 240 points, nearly 2 percent, in its second-biggest sell-off of the year. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  closed 2.15 percent lower. The dollar, meanwhile, slipped and prices for government bonds rose as traders saw the data increasing chances of a Federal Reserve rate cut later this year. The Commerce Department said auto sales rose 0.9 percent in February, rebounding after a similar-sized January slide. Excluding the car sales, retail sales fell 0.1 percent. Economists on Wall Street had expected sales, both overall and excluding autos, to rise 0.3 percent. "There's expectations of a rate cut in September that's fully priced in," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. The U.S. Federal Reserve meets next week to set rates and it is widely expected to leave benchmark overnight rates unchanged, with the market debate focusing on a June meeting. Futures markets were pricing in about a 54 percent chance of a quarter-percentage point cut in rates by the end of June, up from a 38 percent chance on Monday. ALL EYES ON HOUSING Attention is increasing on the growing risk of mortgage defaults at the riskier end of that credit market with its consequent effects on consumers, and as evidence of a slowing economy. Late payments and foreclosures on U.S. homes rose in the fourth quarter, driven by subprime borrowers with weak credit and adjustable-rate mortgages that reset at higher interest rates, the Mortgage Bankers Association said. The MBA predicts U.S. housing will not regain its footing until near the end of 2007. The overall mortgage delinquency rate increased to a seasonally adjusted 4.95 percent in the fourth quarter, up from 4.67 percent in the prior quarter and from 4.70 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005. While a legitimate concern, the jury is still out on the U.S. economy's vulnerability to the subprime market. "Some argue the economy is robust and consumers are hanging in there and others say the housing market's going to hit consumers," said Ruskin, who noted sales were flat in January. "In my mind, the March data becomes that much more important, assuming weather remains average," he added. HOUSING STILL HURTING Sales of building materials dropped 1.4 percent in February after a 0.2 percent dip the month before as cold weather curbed construction across much of the continental United States and concerns grew over the health of the U.S. housing market. The National Association of Realtors, a leading trade group, warned on Tuesday that unusual weather had created "ambiguity" in how the U.S. housing market may recover. "Underlying trends point to a housing recovery in 2007," NAR Chief Economist David Lereah said. However, he trimmed his forecast of existing home sales to 6.42 million units this year from 6.44 million. Meanwhile, a long-sputtering engine of the U.S. economy showed signs of life as motor vehicle sales increased 0.9 percent in February after a 0.9 percent January decline. In addition, gasoline station sales jumped 1.2 percent last month after a 0.5 percent drop in January, as prices at the pump began a steep ascent. Redbook Research said its index of U.S. chain store sales showed sales up 3.4 percent last week from year-ago levels, up from 2.9 percent the week before. A report from the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities put the year-on-year increase at 2.1 percent, up from 1.5 percent the week before. "Typically, February has the second lowest monthly sales volume of the year followed behind January and often can be affected by adverse weather conditions, which was the case this year," said Michael Niemira, ICSC's chief economist who forecast same-store sales to rise about 4 percent in March. A separate government report showing a 0.2 percent rise in business inventories in January, just above expectations, had little appreciable affect on markets.
