 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Tuesday a decline in U.S. housing activity has caused some damage in subprime mortgage markets but was not hurting the overall economy. 


 "I continue to believe the U.S. economy is healthy," Paulson said in an interview on CNBC Television when he was asked about a big drop in stock market. "We have had a significant housing correction in the U.S.," Paulson added. "You can't have a correction like that without causing some dislocations. It's too early to tell whether it's bottomed, I believe it has." The U.S. Treasury chief said it "shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that there's some fallout in the subprime mortgage market ... but it's largely contained."
