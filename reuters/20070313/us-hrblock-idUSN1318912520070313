 (Corrects third paragraph to reflect that write-down will affect previously reported earnings) 
   NEW YORK (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc., ( HRB.N ) the largest U.S. income tax preparer, said on Tuesday it was delaying filing its quarterly results with regulators after turmoil in the subprime mortgage market forced it to write down assets at its Option One Mortgage Corp. unit. 


 H&R Block said in a regulatory filing it had to write down $29 million of assets, before taxes, at the unit. H&R Block is trying to sell Option One, its subprime mortgage lending unit. The company previously recorded a $44.7 million, or 14 cents per share, loss for its fiscal third quarter ending January 31.
