 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Real estate investment trust Spirit 
Finance Corp. SFC.N said on Tuesday it would be acquired by a 
consortium led by Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX for 
about $1.6 billion. 


  The group offered $14.50 per share in cash, a premium of 
about 11 percent over Spirit Finance's closing price of $13.05 
on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.  The deal is expected to close by the end of the third 
quarter, Spirit Finance said in a statement.  The Macquarie consortium includes Iceland's Kaupthing Bank 
hf. KAUP.IC and other independent equity participants, it 
said.  The buyers also agreed to purchase 6.15 million newly 
issued shares of Spirit Finance common stock at $12.99 per 
share. Spirit Finance will use the $80 million of proceeds from 
the private placement to fund real estate-related activities.  Under the acquisition agreement, Spirit Finance may solicit 
superior proposals through April 9.  Citigroup and Wachovia Securities are serving as financial 
advisers to Spirit Finance. The consortium's debt financing is 
being provided by Credit Suisse.
