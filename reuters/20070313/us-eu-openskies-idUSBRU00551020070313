 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union has a lever to force the United States to open its domestic aviation market, the EU's transport chief said on Tuesday in a bid to convince skeptics to back a transatlantic air travel pact. 


 Britain has voiced doubts over the "open skies" agreement to liberalize transatlantic air travel negotiated this month because European airlines will still be excluded from buying control of U.S. carriers or flying on domestic U.S. routes. Two UK airlines that reap big profits on transatlantic routes from London's Heathrow Airport, British Airways BAY.L and Virgin Atlantic VA.UL, have attacked the deal, putting pressure on the British government to block it in Brussels. But EU Transport Commissioner Jacques Barrot told the European Parliament this first-stage accord provided the key to unlock the U.S. market, kept closed by Congress. "Some people who don't like the agreement, some naysayers, say we'll never actually get to this second stage, because the U.S. would have won out on the first stage. But that's not right," he said in a debate in the EU assembly in Strasbourg. "People are right when they call for a mechanism that will inevitably lead to a second stage and I've got that. "We're going to start negotiations for phase 2 in January next year. If there's no second-stage agreement between now and mid-2010, then we can suspend our side of the agreement," Barrot said. The 27-member bloc and the United States agreed two weeks ago on the outlines of an unprecedented pact to liberalize transatlantic aviation markets and replace a system based on national carriers dating to World War Two. But Britain is lukewarm, concerned that UK carriers will not get enough access to U.S. markets in return for opening up its lucrative Heathrow airport, which analysts have said could slash British Airways' profits. Ireland had said it would seek a bilateral air transport agreement with the United States if the EU failed to agree on the deal. EU transport ministers are due to discuss the pact on March 22. Barrot has said if they fail to back it, he would be forced to take nations to the European Court of Justice for refusing to give up bilateral aviation pacts with the United States, which the court has declared illegal.
