 PARIS  (Reuters) - The OECD said on Tuesday it saw no case for raising Japanese interest rates at the moment or for renewing U.S. rate increases. 


 It said the inflation outlook in the euro zone looked benign but it stopped short of offering a clear rate recommendation. In an update to its November forecasts, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development predicted euro zone growth of 0.6 percent quarter-on-quarter in both the first and second quarters of 2007, Japanese growth of 0.5 percent in both and U.S. growth of 0.5 and 0.6 percent respectively. Those forecasts follow growth last year which it estimates to have been 3.3 percent in the United States, 2.8 percent in the euro zone and 2.2 percent in Japan, the latter ending far short of a previous OECD prediction of 2.8 percent. On U.S. rates, now at 5.25 percent, the OECD said in a statement: "The U.S. Federal Reserve has kept its policy rate on hold since mid-2006. Headline inflation has eased as energy prices changed course, but core inflation is still a bit too high for comfort. "However, with growth set to remain subdued in the near term, there is no compelling case for the time being to resume tightening," it said. "In the euro area, accommodation has been largely withdrawn over the past few months, consistent with higher-than-expected growth," it said. The ECB raised rates last week, to 3.75 percent from 3.5. "With inflation having recently surprised on the downside, the outlook for price stability looks fairly benign," it said. "In Japan, deflation is lingering on and the policy rate should not be raised before inflation is firmly positive," the OECD said. The Bank of Japan recently raised its key rate to 0.5 from 0.25 percent. The OECD predicted UK growth of 0.6 percent in Q1, quarter-on-quarter, and 0.7 percent in the second quarter of this year, after 2006 growth estimated at 2.7 percent. For Canada, also a member of the G7 club of industrialized economies, the OECD predicted first quarter growth of 1.0 percent, followed by 0.9 in the second quarter, after 2006 growth it put at 2.7 percent. The OECD said the "global rebalancing" of economic growth was proceeding as it had expected, with the United States shifting into a lower gear, confirmation of a solid European recovery and much of Asia holding up well. "Oil prices remain jittery but are much lower than half a year ago, contributing to easing inflationary pressures," it said. In the United States, growth was expected to remain sub-par in the near term because of what it described as an adjustment in the housing sector, a problem offset to an extent by solid job creation and exports. Turning to the recent nervousness in financial markets, the OECD said: "Equity prices have been volatile in recent weeks, as was the case last Spring, but to some extent this may reflect a measure of normalization in the pricing of risk. On the whole, financial conditions are still favorable."
