 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on Tuesday he would launch a tender offer for WCI Communities Inc. WCI.N, a Florida upscale home and condominium builder, in which he already has about a 14.6 percent stake, at $22 per share. 


 The news pushed up WCI shares as high as $22.50 before closing at $21.80, up 15 percent, on the New York Stock Exchange. Based on Monday's close of $18.97 and 46.6 million shares outstanding, the bid would be worth roughly $1.02 billion. Icahn said in February he and nine others wanted seats on the WCI board after he increased his stake in January. He said he wanted discussions with the Florida-based company about how to "unlock the inherent value" of its shares. In a research note, Bank of America analyst Daniel Oppenheim wrote he believes the offer reflects the value of WCI's coastal land holdings and the likelihood a high percentage of its tower condominium sales would close. "We do not think this will lead to wider M&A (merger and acquisition), or private equity activity in the sector, but view this as a unique situation," he wrote. On Tuesday, Icahn said the company's board and top executive have not enabled WCI to maximize the potential of its assets, which he said trade at a discount to their book value. He would ensure the assets are properly managed through the current housing industry downturn. Icahn has agitated for change at many companies and is currently also seeking board seats at Motorola Inc. MOT.N and Temple-Inland Inc.TIN.N. Later on Tuesday, Bonita Springs, Florida-based WCI said its board would review Icahn's offer, but would continue to review its options with advisor Goldman Sachs. Last month, WCI said it hired the investment banker to explore options, including the possible sale of part or all of the company. The tender offer for WCI is not subject to any minimum share condition. Closing of the offer would be subject to the redemption of the company's recently adopted poison pill, a tactic used to fend off hostile takeovers. (Additional reporting by  Caroline Humer )
