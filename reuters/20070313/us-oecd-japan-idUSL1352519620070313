 PARIS  (Reuters) - Japan's main economic challenge is to secure stronger household spending, OECD Chief Economist Jean-Philippe Cotis said in an interview. 


 This would provide more balanced growth in an economy overly dependent on exports, he told Reuters, saying: "This requires patience". The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development issued updated forecasts on Tuesday, predicting growth in Japan of 0.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in both the first and second quarters of 2007. It also said deflation was still lingering and the Bank of Japan should wait until inflation was "firmly positive" before proceeding with any further rise in official interest rates. Cotis said getting the balance right on this front took precedence over other matters, such as "carry trades" -- investment strategies based on exploiting the yen's relatively weak exchange rate to borrow in that currency and invest in higher-yielding assets. "There is all this talk about the carry trade but before that, first they must think about themselves," said Cotis. Japan's official interest rate, now at 0.5 percent, is way below the euro zone rate of 3.75 percent or rates of 5.25 in the United States and Britain. Cotis highlighted what he described as the somewhat volatile nature of economic growth in Japan. Japanese gross domestic product increased 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006, which was the best rate among the Group of Seven long-industrialized economies, according to government data. But that followed GDP growth of merely 0.1 percent in the preceding quarter. "Growth remains solid but not well balanced," said Cotis. "It's a bit of a problem."
