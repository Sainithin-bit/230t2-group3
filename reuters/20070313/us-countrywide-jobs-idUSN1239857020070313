 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N, the largest U.S. mortgage lender and fourth-largest subprime lender, on Monday said it eliminated 108 jobs in its wholesale lending unit's subprime division. 


 Countrywide said the cuts "align the company's workforce with the recent changes in the mortgage market." It disclosed the cuts in an e-mail. It wasn't immediately clear how many workers are in the subprime unit. The entire company employed 55,311 people at the end of February. Subprime loans represent less than 10 percent of Countrywide's overall lending.
