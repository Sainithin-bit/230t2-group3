 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor Co. ( 005380.KS ), South 
Korea's top auto maker, said on Tuesday it plans to invest $270 
million to build an engine plant at its U.S. car making unit in 
Alabama to serve growing demand in the world's No.1 auto 
market. 


  The engine plant, estimated to create about 520 jobs, will 
begin mass output from September 2008 and supply engines to the 
Alabama plant and a Georgia plant being built by its affiliate, 
Kia Motors Corp. ( 000270.KS ), Hyundai said in a statement.  The Alabama facility currently produces Hyundai's Sonata 
sedan and its Santa Fe sports utility vehicle.  Hyundai and Kia, which sell about three quarters of their 
cars abroad, are expanding overseas production to shield 
themselves from a strong won and frequent labor disputes.  Separately, Hyundai also said it would begin mass 
production of fuel-efficient environmentally friendly hybrid 
cars from 2009, with a production target of 300,000 in 2015.  Hyundai and Kia started test-producing the Accent and Pride 
sedans with hybrid technology in 2004 for South Korea's 
government.  U.S. sales of hybrid cars rose 28 percent in 2006 but 
growth in the segment, dominated by Toyota Motor Corp.'s 
( 7203.T ) Prius, is starting to slow, according to industrial 
data released last month.  Shares in Hyundai fell 0.29 percent to at 68,500 won as of 
0509 GMT, compared to the wider market's  .KS11  0.25 percent 
decline.
