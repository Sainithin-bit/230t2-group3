 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Worries about mortgage foreclosures whacked the giants of Wall Street on Tuesday -- from Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- as investors disregarded analysts' views that the concerns are overblown. 


 The question now is how much the U.S. stock market will suffer because mortgage lenders had provided loans without requiring income documentation, downpayments or collateral to people with poor credit histories, known as the subprime market. The initiation of foreclosures on U.S. homeowner loans accelerated in the fourth quarter to a faster pace than any other time since the Mortgage Bankers Association began its survey 37 years ago. Tuesday's nearly 3 percent drop by the S&P Financials index .GSPF, which includes 88 companies, erased about $13 billion in investor wealth. The subprime industry lubricates Wall Street's cash machine as investment banks package all types of loans into securities backed by mortgage payments and then sell them to pension funds and other institutional investors. Over the past 18 months, virtually all mortgage lenders loosened standards for making loans, Morgan Stanley analyst Kenneth Posner said in a research note. Last year Bear Stearns BSC.N cut subprime originations in half, but its shares tumbled 6.3 percent in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange, leading a pack of Wall Street firms whose shares took a hit. INVESTORS CONCERNED Merrill Lynch analyst Guy Moszkowski said in a research note earlier in the day that Bear Stearns executives, Chief Financial Officer Sam Molinaro and Chief Operating Officer Warren Spector, were relaxed on the subject of subprime lending during a recent meeting. "Both managers showed little concern with the subprime meltdown, although we met with them before the market grew considerably worse," Moszkowski said in a research note. Investors are plenty concerned, though. Even Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) fell 1.3 percent after the investment bank blew the lid off analysts' estimates with record fiscal first-quarter profits of $3.2 billion. The third largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), fell 4 percent. In a move reminiscent of the dot-com bust, Massachusetts' top securities regulator issued subpoenas for documents from UBS Securities LLC ( UBSN.VX ) and Bear Stearns over research analysis of subprime lenders. Separately, Rep. Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he planned to introduce legislation that would restrict the riskiest mortgages from being made amid the current turmoil in the subprime market. Shares of Friedman Billings Ramsey Group Inc. ( FBR.N ), a small investment bank, fell 14 percent to $4.77, and Washington Mutual ( WM.N ), one of the largest U.S. mortgage lenders, fell 5 percent.
