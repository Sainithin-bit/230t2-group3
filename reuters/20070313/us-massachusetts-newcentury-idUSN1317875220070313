 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Massachusetts on Tuesday ordered New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ) to fulfill its promises on loans in progress and stop taking new loan applications to protect state residents from any further harm. 


 Massachusetts said it was coordinating its "cease and desist" order with several other states, including New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire. "There probably will be others either today or tomorrow," Massachusetts Banking Commissioner Steven Antonakes told Reuters. The order applies to three New Century subsidiaries -- New Century Mortgage Corporation, Home 123 Corporation and New Century Credit Corporation. Antonakes said in a statement the action was prompted by serious concerns about New Century's finances after the Irvine, California-based firm on Monday said that all its lenders had canceled their lines of credit and it does not have enough cash to repay its own creditors. Last week, it also said that it would stop taking loan applications. Many analysts say New Century is on the brink of bankruptcy. New Century is the No. 2 lender in the U.S. subprime mortgage market where loose underwriting standards have caused soaring delinquencies as the housing downturn steepens. Antonakes said that based on New Century's last report, there were about 400 loans in the pipeline in Massachusetts, but the actual number was likely to be smaller. He required the company to place any open loan applications with another qualified lender or fund them immediately. Antonakes said the banking commission has been working with the mortgage industry to identify other lenders and brokers willing to take over New Century's customers. Trading in shares of New Century was suspended by the New York Stock Exchange prior to delisting. The company also received a grand jury subpoena in a federal criminal probe. The banking commission also issued a cease and desist order against Brandon, Florida-based Apex Financial Group Inc. after it failed to disclose three enforcement actions by other states. It issued the same order against Garden City, New York-based Old Commonwealth Mortgage LLC after its owner pled guilty to a felony charge.
