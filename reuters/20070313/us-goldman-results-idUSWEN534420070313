 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) on Tuesday posted its best quarterly earnings ever on record trading and banking results, trouncing expectations that were recently lowered amid fears that mortgage market woes and volatile stocks would hurt results. 


 The largest investment bank by market value said net earnings increased to a record $3.20 billion, or $6.67 a share, in the fiscal first quarter ended February 23, up from $2.48 billion, or $5.08 a share, in the year-ago period. Net revenue rose 22 percent to a record $12.73 billion, fueled by gains in nearly every business. The results exceeded the average analyst forecast of $4.97 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Goldman stock rose $5.40, or 2.7 percent, to $208 in morning trade. "It was clearly an exceptional first quarter," Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said. After Wall Street firms delivered a third year of record profit in 2006, analysts and bank executives cautioned that the industry faced a more difficult environment marked by worries about economic growth. Those fears were fanned last month when a slump in Chinese stocks triggered a sell off worldwide. Meanwhile subprime lenders have been going under as defaults on loans to people with weak credit rise and as financiers, including Goldman, cut off funds. Yet instead of reporting a decline in profit, following weeks of uncertainty about the outlook for financial markets, Goldman kicked off the quarterly reporting period for investment banks with a 38 percent return on equity. "It puts people's minds at ease," with regard to recent worries, said Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte, who has a "buy" rating on Goldman shares. The bank remains the most successful trading house and the most active merger adviser worldwide and has reaped big profits from investing its own money. Fixed-income currency and commodity trading generated a record $4.6 billion in net revenue, with strong performance across all major businesses. Goldman also reported $1.73 billion from its investments such as stakes in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. ( 1398.HK ), Japan's Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group ( 8316.T ) and $500 million in gains related to the adoption of a new accounting policy. "While upside surprises have been the norm for Goldman, we believe the magnitude was probably better than the market expected," Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone said in a client note. Viniar told reporters that recent market concerns that subprime woes would hurt Goldman's results were overblown. Indeed, Goldman's fixed income trading was up across the board compared with the fourth quarter. "Even our mortgage business was up despite the obviously more challenging subprime market," Viniar said. "Mortgage is a strategically important business to Goldman Sachs, but it's still modest in size compared with the overall firm." Equities trading also posted record revenue of $3.09 billion, up 26 percent amid rising stocks, active clients and gains by the firm's proprietary trades. Investment banking revenue rose 17 percent to $1.72 billion, including record M&A and debt underwriting fees. Goldman this year leads the industry in announced M&A transactions worldwide. Goldman's asset management and securities services arm likewise generated revenue of $1.6 billion. And while managed assets grew 26 percent to a record $719 billion, asset management revenue fell 28 percent to $1.07 billion after poor performance in Goldman's Global Alpha hedge fund last year. Sandler analyst Harte noted that after the recent pullback, Goldman shares are "actually kind of cheap, given the earnings they're posting." Goldman shares trade at 2.7 times its book value, which rose 6 percent in the quarter, near the upper end of its historic range. (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb )
