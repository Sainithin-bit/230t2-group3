 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. advertising spending rose a disappointing 4.1 percent last year, hurt by cutbacks by carmakers General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE DCX.N, tracking firm TNS Media Intelligence said on Tuesday. 


 For 2007, a year without big cyclical contributions from elections and the Olympics, TNS Media maintained its forecast for a 2.6 percent rise in spending, though that will largely depend on the plans of automakers. The downturn in spending by the troubled U.S. auto industry is putting even more pressure on advertising than previously thought, taking a particular toll on expenditures at consumer magazines and local magazines. "The big story is Detroit and the bold headline is General Motors," said Jon Swallen, senior vice president of research at TNS Media. "Automotive is a key category to continue to track through the first half of 2007 and see if things stabilize and hopefully eventually begin to improve," he added. As it closed factories and cut jobs, GM also chopped its ad budget by nearly 24 percent, or about $715 million, last year, TNS Media said. Local dealerships were also forced to cut back spending. "We saw the market soften as the year progressed," said Swallen. "The third and fourth quarters were considerably softer than our projections." Another major automaker, DaimlerChrysler, cut its U.S. spending nearly 11 percent, reflecting the struggles at its Chrysler Group. Because of the cutbacks by the auto industry, Swallen said, U.S. ad spending, which totaled $150 billion in 2006, fell short of TNS Media predictions. Initially, it forecast a rise of 5.4 percent and later cut that to 4.9 percent. While automakers once represented the single largest ad category, the industry has now dropped behind telecommunications, where spending rose 10.3 percent last year amid heated competition. Pharmaceuticals also turned in strong growth at 13.8 percent. Overall, Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) was the biggest spender last year at about $3.3 billion, followed by GM, AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) and Verizon Communications ( VZ.N ), TNS Media said. Meanwhile, spending by marketers, particularly the smaller ones, continued to shift away from traditional media to the Internet. Display advertising on the Internet registered a 17 percent increase to $9.8 billion, although search advertising was not tracked by TNS Media. That far outpaced any other type of media. Television grew 5.3 percent, newspapers fell 2.4 percent and radio was essentially flat. "There's nothing to suggest that that trend is going to stop," Swallen said.
