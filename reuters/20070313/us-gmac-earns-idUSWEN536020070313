 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) will inject $1 billion into GMAC, its former finance arm said on Tuesday, a capital infusion needed to complete the sale of the automaker's majority stake in the face of escalating defaults in the U.S. mortgage market. 


 GMAC, which reported results on Tuesday, said that even after the equity injection from GM, "continuing pressures in the U.S. mortgage sector" would weigh on its future earnings. Under terms of its sale to a group led by Cerberus Capital Management, GM had guaranteed a minimum book value of $14.4 billion when the sale closed at the end of November. However, a recalculation of GMAC's book value revealed a shortfall caused by the mortgage losses that GM is now trying to address with the $1 billion cash injection this quarter. GM, which sold GMAC to raise cash for its own restructuring, will report fourth-quarter results on Wednesday after a delay caused by restatements and the closing of the GMAC sale. GMAC Chief Executive Eric Feldstein said in a statement the company was tightening its underwriting standards, becoming the latest lender to rethink lending policies in the face of a worsening market for riskier mortgages. Feldstein said GMAC was tightening its underwriting standards for mortgages to borrowers with weaker credit and taking more aggressive steps to address delinquent loans. RESCAP IN FOCUS GMAC's ResCap unit, which specializes in housing finance, reported $48 billion in subprime loans -- about 76 percent of its mortgage portfolio as of year end. ResCap increased its allowance for loan losses to 2.17 percent at year-end from 1.55 percent a year earlier and reported a spike in nonperforming loans to 10.5 percent of its mortgage portfolio. GMAC Chief Financial Officer Sanjiv Khattri said shoring up the financial position of ResCap was an immediate priority. "We will make sure ResCap has adequate capital and liquidity ... to manage through this hiccup," Khattri told analysts. "If that means it gets a significant portion of the $1 billion (from GM), so be it." Problems in the subprime mortgage sector, which involves loans to riskier borrowers, have emerged as a major risk factor for the U.S. financial markets in recent weeks. Late payments on U.S. mortgages increased in the fourth quarter to their highest level in 3-1/2 years and foreclosures rose, driven by subprime borrowers. "I would go out on a limb and say I feel more comfortable that GMAC understands their subprime exposure because they had to go through the due diligence in closing the sale," said Pete Hastings, a fixed-income analyst at Morgan Keegan & Co. "They have probably scrubbed the numbers as well as anyone out there, and I continue to favor the GMAC bonds." GMAC's 8-percent bond due 2031 fell 1.25 cents on the day to 109.75 cents on the dollar. Spreads of ResCap's 6-percent bond due 2011 widened to 1.84 percentage points over U.S. Treasuries from 1.70 percentage points on Friday, its last recorded trade, according to MarketAxess. Earlier this year, ResCap announced plans to cut 1,000 jobs -- or about 7 percent of its work force -- and GMAC on Tuesday said the housing finance unit would continue to restructure to respond to the weakening market. ResCap also said it would reduce its non-prime mortgage assets held for investment by $20 billion this year as it tightens its own credit standards. CAPITAL INJECTION FROM GM Wall Street analysts had largely expected the equity injection into GMAC by GM, which has delayed reporting its fourth-quarter results until Wednesday to restate earnings and close its books on the GMAC sale. Credit ratings agency Fitch Ratings affirmed GMAC's 'BB-plus' rating with a positive outlook, saying it believed that the firm's new owners were committed to improving its credit rating and diversifying its business. GM sold a 51-percent stake in GMAC for $14 billion in November, and a provision of the sale required that the book value of GMAC be above $14.4 billion at the time of the closing of the transaction. GMAC said it earned $1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2006, compared with $112 million a year earlier. The results included a $791 million tax benefit from its conversion to a limited liability company. The one-time gain more than offset a huge loss in GMAC's ResCap unit, which provides mortgage financing. ResCap posted a fourth-quarter loss of $651 million, compared with a profit of $118 million a year earlier. Separately, GMAC restated its earnings from 2001 to the third quarter of 2006 as it had said it would because of a problem with its accounting for financial hedges. GMAC said the restatement had no impact on cash flows. JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said "weak GMAC results" were likely to depress GM's fourth-quarter earnings per share, but said the market's focus could shift to the improved performance of GM's core automotive operations.
