 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese inflation rose in February on the back of higher food costs, but economists said they did not expect price pressures to get out of hand despite breakneck growth and plentiful cash in the banking system. 


 The consumer price index (CPI) was up 2.7 percent from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday. That was more than January's 2.2 percent increase but fell short of market forecasts of a 2.9 percent rise. Combining January and February to iron out calendar quirks caused by the timing of the Lunar New Year holidays, prices were up 2.4 percent from a year earlier. In the same two months of 2006, the CPI was up 1.4 percent. "It seems a little too fast in recent months," Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), told reporters when asked about inflation. Zhou said the central bank was studying the figures. Although inflation remains below the PBOC's 3 percent target for the year, economists expect the central bank will soon tighten monetary policy again after figures on Monday showed a near-record trade surplus and surging credit growth in February. "This CPI figure alone is unlikely to trigger a policy change. But Jan-Feb new loan figures are well above expectations, implying the PBOC will have to respond to this by lifting reserve ratios and even a 27 basis point hike in both lending and deposit rates in the coming weeks," Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, said in a note to clients. The central bank has raised benchmark interest rates twice since last April and increased on five occasions since June the proportion of deposits that banks must hold in reserve. Required reserves are now 10 percent, and Zhou flagged on Monday that more increases were in the pipeline. Huw McKay, an economist with Westpac in Sydney, said he now expects the required reserve ratio to reach 12.5 percent by the end of the year. He has also brought forward the expected timing of the next increase in interest rates by two months. GRAIN TO BLAME Higher food prices, which make up a third of the consumer price basket, have been largely responsible for the rising inflationary trend over the past year. They were up again in February, by 6.0 percent over the same month last year. Gao Shanwen, chief economist at Everbright Securities in Shanghai, said the CPI may climb a bit more but would then slow and average 2.1 percent or 2.2 percent for the whole year, compared with last year's average rate of 1.5 percent. That was because grain prices were unlikely to keep rising. "Grain demand and supply are in balance and will tend to remain balanced this year," Gao said. But Paul Cavey, an economist with Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong, said inflationary risks were greater than assumed. "We think food prices in China are being driven by global food prices, which China can't do anything about," Cavey said. Other prices were also climbing, Cavey said. Consumer goods cost 3.0 percent more in February than a year earlier, according to the statistics office. In July the inflation rate for this category was just 0.7 percent. "That's a trend we expect to pick up pace during the course of this year," Cavey said. At current inflation rates, after-tax bank deposit rates are negative in real terms, inviting depositors to withdraw their savings and pump it into property and stocks, raising the risk of asset price bubbles. "It doesn't leave the government with very much comfort," Cavey said of today's interest rate levels. But Gao said higher borrowing costs would not deter firms because their profits are so strong: "I think another interest rate rise to keep inflation in check is absolutely unwarranted." Increasing required reserves and letting the yuan rise faster would be a more effective way to steer the economy. Economists at Goldman Sachs said they expected price pressures to start easing after the first quarter. "However, if the trend of monetary expansion continues to accelerate at the current speed, it will likely post renewed inflationary pressures heading into the second half of the year," they said in a note to clients.
