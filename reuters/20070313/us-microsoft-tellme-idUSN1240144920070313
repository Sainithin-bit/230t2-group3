 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) is in talks to buy privately-held Tellme Networks, a maker of Web-based voice technology, for about $800 million, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. 


 Microsoft may sign a deal as early as this week, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter. Tellme's products would help Microsoft build voice-recognition capabilities into its products, the Journal said.
