 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of activity around a possible sale of DaimlerChrysler AG'S DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group is accelerating, after several potential buyers met with management before presenting preliminary offers by the end of the month, The Wall Street Journal reported. 


 DaimlerChrysler is hoping to narrow the list of serious buyers so its management team can give an update on a possible sale during DaimlerChrysler's general shareholders meeting in Berlin on April 4, according to people familiar with the matter, the Journal reported. The interested private-equity firms include Cerberus Capital Management LLC CBS.UL and a group led by Blackstone Group BG.UL and Centerbridge Partners LP, according to the Journal. All three met with Chrysler management last week and signed confidentiality agreements to pave the way to reviewing detailed financial and product-development information on the auto maker, people familiar with the matter said, the Journal reported. Canadian auto-parts maker Magna International Inc. MGa.TO is also interested in buying all or part of Chrysler, possibly in partnership with a private-equity firm, and has met with representatives of both the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers to discuss a deal, one of these people said, the Journal reported. General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) has also considered buying Chrysler, but a takeover of its cross-town rival is considered unlikely, people familiar with the matter said, the Journal said.
