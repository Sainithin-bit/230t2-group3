 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. said on Tuesday it will spend more than $750 million in 2007 to expand its global communications network for corporate customers, an 89 percent boost over last year, as customer companies increasingly do business abroad. 


 The top U.S. phone company said the investment for its enterprise business was part of previously announced capital spending plans for the overall company. AT&T has said capital spending would be in the mid-teens percentage of revenue. Tuesday's announcement comes amid increased demand for Internet-based telephone services and other communications services in China, India, and other emerging markets where many of AT&T's corporate customers have operations. The company said the global investment would focus on high-growth economies in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, as well as some developed markets in Europe. "What's really important here is business is ever more global in nature and so this investment is also concentrated on enhancing and expanding our capabilities globally to enable global multinational customers to operate in a common fashion in every region of the world," said Bill Archer, senior vice president of AT&T product management. "Increasingly, China and India will become important. But I'd also tell you that regions like the Middle East are developing as well," said Archer. AT&T also said it would invest in opening new Internet data centers in the United States and building new Internet, long-distance and mobile access in a greater number of countries. The corporate enterprise segment has been one of the weak points at AT&T, which has enjoyed strong earnings growth on the back of increased wireless and high-speed Internet subscriptions. The company says it expects enterprise revenue, which fell 3.7 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter, to return to growth in 2008. Verizon Business, a unit of rival Verizon Communications Inc., told Reuters in February that it planned to more than double its investment in Asia this year to meet growing demand. AT&T shares were up 28 cents at $37.34 in late afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Mark Porter )
