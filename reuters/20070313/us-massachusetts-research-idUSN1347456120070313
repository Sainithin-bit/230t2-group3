 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Massachusetts ordered two prominent Wall Street financial firms on Tuesday to provide information on their subprime research in the first probe by a U.S. state into possible conflicts of interest over the troubled mortgage lenders. 


 State authorities subpoenaed UBS AG's ( UBSN.VX ) UBS Securities LLC and Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N over their research analysis of lenders specializing in making loans to high-risk borrowers, including New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), one of the biggest U.S. subprime lenders. "We've got some serious questions based upon what we know of the facts relating to the recommendations, the coverage by UBS and Bear Stearns specifically," Secretary of State William Galvin told Reuters after announcing the subpoenas. U.S. financial markets have been hammered by a meltdown in the subprime sector as lenders teeter near bankruptcy. Galvin said UBS upgraded New Century 16 days after its February 7 earnings restatement, while Bear Stearns upgraded the lender on March 1, the day it said its annual report was delayed. "We want to know if there were any conflicts. Were there relationships, investment banking relationships? Did the brokerage company have a financial position in the company? Were there hedge fund clients that might have had those," Galvin said. The subpoenas, which require responses by March 27, seek all documents created by any subprime lending analyst at the two investment firms. They also seek information about the fees, commissions and other compensation earned by the firms relating to any subprime lender and any other documents sent between company personnel and hedge fund clients invested in a subprime lender. UBS declined to comment on the matter but a spokeswoman said: "We are proud of our track record in research." A Bear Stearns spokeswoman said the firm will fully cooperate with the inquiry and added that its research has been "mischaracterized" in the media. "The analyst had an 'underperform' rating on the stock in the prior six months and then on March 1 moved the stock to 'peer perform' and advised investors to stay on the sidelines until more information was available from the company about their liquidity situation and their pending financial restatements," she said. MOVING RAPIDLY Galvin said the upgrades show that the industry was not standing by the commitments made in 2003, when leading securities firms paid $1.4 billion to settle charges that they misled investors with tainted stock research. He said Massachusetts had been hurt by foreclosures on subprime lender mortgages and that the investigation had some urgency to it. "This is having an effect on the marketplace right now, so we want to make sure that we move on as rapidly as possible," he said. In Massachusetts, where housing prices notched double-digit growth between 1995 and 2004 in a red-hot market, foreclosure filings surged 70 percent to 19,487 homeowners last year, as single-family home prices fell for the first time since 1993. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston blames subprime loans, saying they accounted for more than two-thirds of the state's foreclosure filings in the third quarter of 2006, even though they made up just 12 percent of all mortgages.
