 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Troubled subprime lender New Century Financial said on Tuesday it had understated debt owed to Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital LLC by $500 million on Monday. 


 The company said the repurchase obligation of its subsidiaries to CSFBMC was about $1.4 billion as of March 9, not $900 million as published.
