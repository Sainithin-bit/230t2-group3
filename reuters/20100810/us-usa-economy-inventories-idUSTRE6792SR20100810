 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Wholesale inventories rose only slightly in June while sales unexpectedly slumped, a government report showed on Tuesday, adding to evidence of sluggish demand as the recovery loses some steam. 

 Total wholesale inventories rose 0.1 percent to $399.2 billion at the end of June after an unrevised 0.5 percent rise in May. Economists polled by Reuters had expected stocks of unsold goods at U.S. wholesalers to rise 0.4 percent in June. Sales at wholesalers fell 0.7 percent after a downwardly revised 0.5 percent decline in May. Economists had predicted that sales rose 0.5 percent in June. The biggest drags included sales of petroleum and apparel. Inventory rebuilding has been one of the main drivers of the economic recovery from the worst recession in 80 years. Business inventories added slightly more than one percentage point to gross domestic product in the second quarter, accounting for roughly 40 percent of the 2.4 percent growth rate. However, Tuesday's surprisingly small gain for June may mean that figure will be revised when the Commerce Department releases its updated GDP data later this month. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
