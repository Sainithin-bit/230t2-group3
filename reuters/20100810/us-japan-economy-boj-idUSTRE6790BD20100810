 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan kept interest rates steady and held off on new policy steps, saving its limited policy options for when yen rises accelerate enough to damage a fragile economic recovery. 

 ************************************************************* KEY POINTS: -- The central bank's board left interest rates at 0.1 percent, as widely expected, by a unanimous vote. -- It also kept its economic assessment unchanged. -- The BOJ said it needed to watch how fiscal problems in some European countries could, through developments in global financial markets, affect the Japanese and global economies. -- Governor Masaaki Shirakawa will hold an embargoed news conference, with his comments expected to come out sometime after 4:15 p.m. (3:15 a.m. EDT). COMMENTARY: TAKAHIDE KIUCHI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES "The BOJ decided to forgo easing policy this time because underlying economic conditions remain sound and financial markets aren't excessively unstable. "But if there is a heightening of prospects for further Fed monetary easing financial markets may destabilize and, for example, the yen may gain and stocks may fall. "The BOJ is seen easing monetary policy sooner or later, under pressure from markets and politicians. The most likely next step near-term is to expand its fund-supply tool. But if the economy worsens further and if the yen rises and stock price falls accelerate it may eventually consider increasing its government bond purchases." - - - - JUNKO NISHIOKA, CHIEF ECONOMIST JAPAN, RBS SECURITIES "The BOJ's view on the underlying economy is not so pessimistic that it feels a need to take further action ahead of the FOMC meeting later today. "But if the U.S. economy shows further signs of weakness and the dollar falls to near 84 yen in the coming weeks, the BOJ will come under pressure to take fresh steps. "The BOJ's next steps would most likely be expanding its fixed-rate operations, with the ultimate goal of easing upward pressures on the yen and downward pressures on prices." - - - - SIMON WONG, REGIONAL ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED, HONG KONG "The BOJ is comfortable with the level of the yen because they look at it in inflation-adjusted terms or the real effective exchange rate. The government, despite earlier rhetoric, seems comfortable too. "If you look at the statement, the BOJ is still cautiously optimistic on the economy. Unless the dollar falls below 80 yen, the BOJ may not be under pressure to adopt more easing measures. "We expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to ease policy by the end of the first quarter of next year. The BOJ won't necessarily follow suit. "If the dollar started falling after the Fed's meeting later today, I think Japan's first line of defense would be for government officials to step up verbal intervention." - - - - TAKAO HATTORI, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ MORGAN STANLEY, TOKYO "The decision was largely within expectations. The BOJ has been confident on the economic outlook, so I didn't think it would change its view on the economy. "The next board meeting is in September and there's a political vacuum now. I don't know what exactly he meant, but Finance Minister (Yoshihiko) Noda said earlier he wanted to work closely with the BOJ. So depending on what happens to the yen's levels from now on, the BOJ may end up holding an emergency meeting (before its September meeting). "The Federal Reserve will probably step up its tone on the need for monetary easing, and that will in turn put more pressure on the yen to rise. Thus there's a risk of a further appreciation in the yen. "Compared with how financial markets worry about downside risks, comments by BOJ Governor (Masaaki) Shirakawa after the last meeting suggested he was still quite laid back. I'll be interested to see if he revises his view this time, and what he has to say about the yen, which has risen a lot since their last meeting." - - - - NAOKI IIZUKA, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES, TOKYO "It wasn't a big surprise that the Bank of Japan took no new action, that was what the market expected. "But if the yen firms sharply following the Fed policy announcement later today and the risk of the yen rising toward 80 yen (vs the dollar) increases, then there is a possibility of the BOJ holding an emergency meeting. "In that case, the BOJ might increase the amount or extend the duration of its market operations. But even if the BOJ implements such steps, it's questionable how much impact it would have on the currency market." - - - - KYOHEI MORITA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL JAPAN "The current phase of the foreign exchange market is dollar selling and not yen buying, so it is not seriously problematic. But if the yen strengthens against all major currencies in the future it might prompt the BOJ and the government to take action. "But the BOJ's easing in December proved ineffective in changing the yen's uptrend, so even if the yen rises further against the dollar after the Federal Reserve's policy meeting on Tuesday, the BOJ may hold off on taking new measures immediately. "Still, the BOJ will likely come under stronger pressure from the government after the ruling Democratic Party's leadership election in September. Then the bank may need to respond." MARKETS: -- The yen was little moved by BOJ decision, with the dollar hovering near 85.75 yen just before and after the decision. The dollar was down 0.2 percent on the day at 85.75 yen.
