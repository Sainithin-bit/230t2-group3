 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc will begin selling its new tablet device called the Dell Streak to U.S. customers later this week for $299.99 with a two-year AT&T Inc contract, and for $549.99 without, it said on Tuesday. 

 Dell said it would begin taking orders online on Thursday. The company is hoping the five-inch tablet, which runs on Google Inc's Android operating system, will help it take on Apple Inc's iPad. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
