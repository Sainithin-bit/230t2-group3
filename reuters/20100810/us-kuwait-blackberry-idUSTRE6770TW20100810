 KUWAIT  (Reuters) - Kuwait has no intention of stopping BlackBerry services for the time being but is talking to the device's manufacturer about moral and security concerns, the communications minister said on Sunday. 

 "We in Kuwait have no intention to stop the BlackBerry services ... but at the same time we are following up on direct and indirect negotiations with the company and with fellow Gulf states," Mohammad al-Busairi told reporters. The minister said the Gulf Arab state has "moral and security" concerns about the use of BlackBerry and confirmed a report it had asked the maker, Research In Motion to block pornographic sites.
