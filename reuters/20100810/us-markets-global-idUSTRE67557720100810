 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks pared earlier steep losses and government debt rallied on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve signaled it would act as necessary to preserve the fading economic recovery. 

 The dollar lost luster as a haven from risk, shedding early gains versus the euro and declining against the yen, while crude oil prices pared losses. The Fed said it would begin funneling proceeds from its maturing mortgage bonds into longer-term government debt in an effort to support a sputtering economic recovery. The move marks an important policy shift for the Fed, which just months ago had been debating how to start winding up its various monetary stimulus programs. Fed officials also offered a more gloomy outlook on the U.S. economy. The Fed, which left benchmark overnight interest rates steady in a zero to 0.25 percent range, also renewed its pledge to keep them low for an extended period, as widely expected. "What this is telling the market is, 'We're going to do everything and anything we can to make sure we've put a backstop on any possible risk of a double dip'," said Burt White, managing director and chief investment officer at LPL Financial in Boston. "This is exactly what the market was hoping for." Stocks and commodity prices earlier had slumped after a report of weak Chinese imports triggered concern of slowing growth in China, which has been an engine of growth for the world economy. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 36.86 points, or 0.34 percent, at 10,661.89. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 4.45 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,123.34. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 21.69 points, or 0.94 percent, at 2,284.00. The S&P rebounded back above its 200-day moving average. All three major indexes had been down more than 1 percent before the Fed's decision and on evidence that China's rapid growth was easing. The S&P materials index .GSPM was down 0.9 percent and the energy index .GSPE was off 0.8 percent. In currency markets, the Fed's announcement weighed on the dollar. The downgrade to the economic outlook "is a problem for the dollar in general," said Brian Dolan, chief strategist at Forex.com in Bedminster, New Jersey, while the move to invest in long-dated Treasury debt has pushed down U.S. bond yields, making the dollar less attractive to global investors. The euro rose to $1.3223, flat on the day, after falling as low as $1.3075 earlier. The dollar was down 0.8 percent at 85.22 yen, not far from a 15-year low around 84.81 yen. The dollar got support against the yen earlier after the Bank of Japan held off on new steps to weaken the currency. FED MOVE STOKES BID FOR BONDS U.S. Treasuries prices rallied, extending earlier gains, after the Federal Reserve said it will deploy principal payments from its mortgage holdings to buy long-dated government debt. The price on the 30-year U.S. government bond jumped 1-13/32 in the cash market. Its yield hit a session low of 3.95 percent, compared with 4.02 percent late on Monday. U.S. crude oil futures ended with pared losses after the Fed's pledge to maintain its policy of low interest rates for an extended period. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, September crude settled down $1.23, or 1.51 percent, at $80.25 a barrel. Before the Fed announcement, crude prices were down about $1.80. Oil prices were stung by a slowdown in oil imports by China, the world's second largest energy consumer, which underlined investors' fears that the global economic recovery is losing momentum. Although China's trade surplus surged in July to an 18-month high as exports rose, a government-induced slowdown in investment took a tool on imports. "China is certainly the global growth engine for almost all parts of the world, especially to the United States. Their macro data is influencing the psychology of investors of all assets here," said Craig Peckham, equity trading strategist at Jefferies & Co in New York. World stocks measured by the MSCI All-Country World Index .MIWD00000PUS dropped 1.2 percent, and the Thomson Reuters global stock index  .TRXFLDGLPU  fell 1.2 percent. The MSCI emerging markets benchmark .MSCIEF was down 1.18, with China's Shanghai Composite Index down 3 percent after data showed Chinese import growth below expectations, pointing to slowing domestic demand and economic activity. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3  index closed 0.9 percent lower ahead of the Fed's policy statement, with miners falling heavily.
