 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. corn prices soared above $8 a bushel on Monday for the first time as concerns about flood-related crop losses in the U.S. Corn Belt swamped grain markets and caused knock-on effects through the food chain. 

 Corn, the main U.S. row crop and the feedstock for the burgeoning ethanol sector, livestock feed and dozens of other food and industrial products, set an all-time high for the eighth straight trading session. Chicago Board of Trade corn futures for delivery in July 2008 rallied to contract high of $7.60 a bushel for a gain of 28-1/4 cents, then slipped on profit-taking. July corn closed 3/4 cent up at $7.32-1/2 -- up 75 percent from June 2007. The new record high for corn was set in the July 2009 contract at $8.07 per bu, the last delivery contract against the 2008 harvest. "The market is being driven by water," said Glenn Hollander, a veteran grain merchant on the CBOT trading floor. "Estimates show 3 million acres of corn under water and probably 2 million didn't get planted. So that gets you up to 5 million or over 700 million bushels, and that takes out the entire carry-out," he said, referring to estimates for grain stocks carried over to the next crop year in September 2009. Weekend reports of more rains and flooding in central Iowa and western Illinois fed the speculative gains on Monday. The two states usually produce a third of U.S. corn and soybeans. Crop loss estimates have flown around the markets since Friday, when agronomist Palle Pedersen of Iowa State said about one-quarter of Iowa's soybean acres and at least 8 percent of the state's corn either have not been seeded or will need replanting due to flooding. Farm Futures magazine on Monday released an online poll result from June 6-13 pegging at least 3 million acres of corn lost. Replanting of corn and beans this late in the season is problematic because a the crop will have less time to develop strong root systems, stems, stalks, and leaf cover to withstand harsh heat of July and August, when plants mature. Corn prices have soared since the U.S. Agriculture Department last week trimmed its U.S. corn average yield projection by 5 bushels per acre and cut its season-ending stocks estimate for the 2008/09 marketing year to 673 million bushels -- the smallest in 13 years. That was before last week's flooding. "We've had a crummy start, lower acreage, an end user that's behind the eight ball in covering his needs because of the velocity of the price gains that have occurred just since the beginning of June," said Rich Feltes, senior vice president and director of MF Global Research. "There are no guarantees that this thing is over yet." Food inflation fears have been lit by corn's price gain and its central place in the food economy as the primary feedgrain for meat animals. Shares of U.S. chicken producer Pilgrim's Pride Corp PPC.N fell more than 10 percent on Monday after Credit Suisse downgraded shares, citing soaring corn prices. "We've already seen a substantial increase in the price of food at the consumer level, and that included double-digit gains in the price of vegoils and in the price of bread," said Bill Lapp, president of consultancy Advanced Economic Solutions. "Going forward in 2009, we should anticipate some adjustments in the livestock sector, because currently, beef pork and broilers all have significant margin pressure." CBOT soybeans surged with corn at the start but July soybeans turned down on profit-taking and worries about export demand as a 300-mile stretch of the Mississippi River, the main shipping artery for grains to Gulf export terminals, is closed due to high river levels. July soybeans SN8 ended 26 cents lower at $15.34. Chicago wheat tumbled late in tandem with soybeans, with  July WN8 down 5-1/2 cents at $8.76-1/2 a bushel. CBOT rice also rose with July RRN8 closing 36 cents higher at $20.66 per hundredweight.
