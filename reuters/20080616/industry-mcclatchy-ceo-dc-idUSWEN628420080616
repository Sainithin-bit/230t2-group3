 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. newspaper business still has 
not seen the bottom of a persistent deterioration in 
advertising revenue, and growing Internet revenue will not 
compensate for the declines, McClatchy Co Chief Executive Gary 
Pruitt said on Monday. 

  "I can't tell you where the bottom is," Pruitt told Reuters 
after the publisher of the Sacramento Bee and Miami Herald said 
it will cut about 1,400 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force.  "McClatchy will likely end up with online revenues around a 
couple hundred million dollars this year," Pruitt said. "But it 
will not equal print revenue in the foreseeable future."  The cuts announced Monday are McClatchy's largest in recent 
history, but Pruitt would not say it was the last round. "We're 
hopeful to avoid further rounds of work force reductions," he 
said.  Pruitt said McClatchy plans to remain publicly traded 
despite the bad news and the effect that falling ad revenue has 
had on its stock price.  (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan  and  Kenneth Li ; editing by
