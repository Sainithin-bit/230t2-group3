 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. and Chinese companies will sign business deals totaling several billion dollars on Monday, a U.S. industry official said on the eve of high-level trade and investment talks between the two countries. 

 "We expect over 30 deals" in sectors ranging from manufacturing to telecommunications to high technology, said Myron Brilliant, vice president for Asia at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which is hosting the signing ceremony. "Companies like GM, Ford, Oracle, IBM, Qualcomm are all involved in the ceremony today," Brilliant said. Top U.S. and Chinese officials are holding high-level trade and economic talks beginning on Tuesday at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. "It looks like at the end of the talks they'll announce the launching of bilateral investment treaty negotiations" and the restart of  U.S.-China initiative to promote protection of intellectual property rights, Brilliant said. U.S. business groups have been eager for the United States to negotiate investment pacts with Brazil, Russia, India and China, a fast-growing group of countries known collectively as the BRIC economies. A treaty would create a forum to resolve investment disputes between the two countries and -- depending on the scope of the negotiations -- could also tear down a number investment barriers on both sides, Brilliant said. Bush administration officials have said to expect a significant announcement on investment coming out of this week's talks, which will also focus on currency, energy issues and the struggling Doha round of world trade talks. A bid by China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) in June 2005 to buy American oil company Unocal Corp set off national security alarm bells in Congress and eventually prompted the state-owned oil company to withdraw its offer. FEW THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY In an interview on Friday, a senior Bush administration economic official argued very few Chinese investments in the United States pose any threat to national security. "If they want to come and invest in America and create good-paying jobs, that's something we want them to know we welcome," the official said, speaking about this week's talks on the condition he not be identified. To drive home that point, the U.S. Treasury Department is holding a one-day seminar on Monday to encourage more Chinese investment, he said. "We have a lot more investment in the United States from Japan, Korea and Southeast Asian nations than we do from China. That's not because we're closed to investment. The Chinese always cite CNOOC, but that's only one case," he said. Some of the business deals to be signed on Monday include investment transactions, while others involve exports, Brilliant said. That makes it difficult to come up with an overall tally, but it's expected to be several billion dollars, he said. China has a habit of announcing big business deals to create a positive mood for high-level talks. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce appreciates the deals and the positive effect they will have on U.S. employment, Brilliant said. But it's also important this week's discussions produce progress on long-standing market access barriers that still stymie U.S. companies doing business in China, he said.
