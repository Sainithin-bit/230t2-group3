 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ), the world's top truckmaker and second-biggest premium carmaker, sees no need for a blockbuster takeover, a company source said, pouring cold water on talk it could be readying a major deal. 

 Daimler -- already flush with cash after selling Chrysler -- has resumed debt issues and temporarily stopped share buybacks, but these should not be interpreted as signs that it is hoarding funds for a game-changing acquisition, a senior executive familiar with the company's acquisition plans. He dismissed prospects for a major strategic move such as splitting off its trucks business or buying premium Swedish car brand Volvo from Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). "We will do some things here and there to complement our business -- possibly via acquisitions as well -- but we don't see the need to do anything spectacular," the source said on condition he would not be identified. "Volvo certainly does not fit into the portfolio we imagine and would be more of a burden than a big leap forward," he said. The idea of splitting off the trucks business came up after Daimler sold an 80 percent stake in Chrysler last year, but was immediately shot down by top management, he added. Buying another mass-volume carmaker is definitely out after the Chrysler debacle, but Daimler is hunting for deals to boost its trucks business in fast-growing emerging markets. "Complementary acquisitions could include big deals, but there will be nothing along the lines of a mass carmaker that changes the form of the group..." the source said. A Daimler spokesman did not comment specifically on the executive's comments but said the company was looking primarily at organic growth in areas in which it already had a strong business such as trucks and premium cars. REGULATION HITS HOME Speculation that Daimler could bulk up via a major acquisition or alliance deal has been fuelled by the gargantuan costs that vehicle makers face in the years ahead. "The regulatory environment is changing far faster than any company's ability to adapt to it," Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said. "At some stage Daimler will need more scale to spread costs for electric vehicles, hybrids and carbon dioxide (emission cuts). The question is whether they get bigger through an alliance, joint venture or something deeper," Jonas said. Still, a major acquisition so soon after the Chrysler divorce would prove unpopular with investors. "Their shareholders would kill them," said one investment banker who follows the auto sector closely. Daimler shares reversed losses and edged 0.2 percent higher to 43.98 euros by 1048 GMT while the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP was up 0.4 percent. Daimler notes that even in the post-Chrysler age it has more than 100 billion euros ($153.6 billion) in annual sales and thus has the muscle to handle heavy spending on technologies. It also collaborates at times, such as its hybrid engine pact with Chrysler, BMW ( BMWG.DE ) and General Motors ( GM.N ). Daimler shrugs off suggestions it needs a bold stroke to jolt its share price out of the doldrums. The stock has drifted down from nearly 80 euros in October, reducing its market capitalization to around $72 billion. Its market cap used to exceed that of VW ( VOWG.DE ) and BMW combined, but now is smaller than VW's alone. Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche has won high marks for unloading Chrysler, whipping Mercedes into shape and steering its trucks business through an industry crash, but the stock has lagged the DJ Stoxx European car sector index .SXAP by around 13 percent -- and archrival BMW by 17 percent -- this year. Data compiled by Starmine, which weights estimates to reflect analysts' track records, show Daimler trades at 7.1 times 12-month forward earnings, a discount to 7.4 times for BMW, 13.6 for VW, and 8.5 times for Porsche. Daimler is still too big and credit is still too tight for it to have to worry about facing a hostile takeover, investment bankers say, but its unusually large 92.4 percent free float would probably make it welcome a friendly long-term investor. The Emirate of Kuwait holds 7.6 percent, but state-owned Dubai International Capital sold all its shares last year. Daimler insists it is not seeking another large shareholder. It has also said it plans to resume share buybacks this year and that new debt issues show it  returning to normal financing after an unusual pause to digest its cash pile.
