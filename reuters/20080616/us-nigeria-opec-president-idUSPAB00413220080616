 PARIS  (Reuters) - Nigerian President Umaru Yar'Adua said on Friday he expected world oil demand to keep rising, prompting OPEC to review its quotas, and Nigeria was in a good position to secure a bigger share of the group's output. 

 "As energy demand of the world increases, OPEC (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) will continue to review its quotas. And the more Nigeria increases its capacity, the more it will be in a position to get a bigger quota," Yar'Adua told a meeting of French businessmen. He reiterated that his target was to increase capacity to 4 million barrels per day by 2010. (Reporting by Estelle Shirbon; editing by  James Jukwey )
