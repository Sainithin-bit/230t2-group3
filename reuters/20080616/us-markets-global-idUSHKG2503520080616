 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares were steady on Monday after strong rallies on Asia's bourses, with the banking sector outperforming in a critical week, led by Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ) which was up 5.9 percent. 

 The yen hit a four-month low against the dollar but suffered against the euro as risk appetite improved on the news from Barclays and relief that the weekend meeting of Group of Eight finance ministers had passed off without major surprises. Wall Street looked set to open slightly firmer but results from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N, which is expected to post its first ever quarterly loss, are due at 8:15 a.m. EDT, well ahead of the opening bell. Barclays said it planned to sell stakes to outside investors and offer shares to existing shareholders to boost its balance sheet. Weekend press reports said it could secure almost $8 billion from sovereign wealth funds in the next two weeks. Its gains lifted banks across Europe in a important week for the sector which sees U.S. investment firms Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) report second-quarter earnings on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. Commerzbank ( CBKG.DE ) rose 1.75 percent. "The focus will be on the U.S. banks this week -- I expect Goldman to be solid and hope that all the bad news is out of the way on Lehman," said Heinz-Gerd Sonnenschein, strategist at Deutsche Postbank in Bonn. Brighter news from banks was balanced by losses in the food production sector. Unilever ( ULVR.L ) and Cadbury CBRY.L fell between 2 and 3.5 percent after investment bank UBS downgraded the sector to a "sell" rating. The FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was down 0.07 percent at 1,266.45 points, and Britain's FTSE 100 was 0.16 percent lower. Earlier, Asia stocks rallied as a U.S. dollar rebound boosted confidence in the region's exporters. Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  closed 2.7 percent higher with the yen near a four-month low against the dollar. BRIEF RELIEF ON OIL FRONT Oil prices eased after United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon said at the weekend that Saudi Arabia was set to increase output to 9.7 million barrels per day next month. But the relief to hard-pressed consumers was temporary and by 6:34 a.m. EDT, U.S. light sweet crude for July delivery CLc1 was up 41 cents to $135.27 a barrel. The dollar hit a four-month high at 108.85 yen and the euro hit a seven-month peak against the Japanese currency as it recovered losses sustained on Friday in the wake of an Irish referendum "No" to a European Union reform treaty. The euro was up 0.6 percent at $1.5476, more than a cent above Friday's low against the dollar, after the European Commission said inflation is its main concern and after the G8 meeting brought no joint statement on currencies. The G8 finance ministers said little new on the outlook for the U.S. currency, although U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson reiterated that the U.S. government favored a strong dollar as a matter of long-standing policy. "A softer yen sparked hopes for upward earnings revisions for some exporters," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities in Tokyo. "But we have to brace for an eventual dramatic slowdown in Japan, where the stock market and the economy depend on overseas demand, considering the recent declines in Asian shares and rising inflation worries in emerging countries." The yield curve for euro zone government bonds flattened with short dates continuing to sell off as markets priced in higher euro zone and U.S. interest rates ahead. The yield on the 2-year Schatz EU2YT=RR was up 2.7 basis points at 4.662 percent. (Additional reporting by  Kevin Plumberg  in Hong Kong and Sitaraman Shankar in London; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)
