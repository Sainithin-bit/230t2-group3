 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group Inc replaced CEO Martin Sullivan on Sunday after the world's biggest insurer suffered two quarters of record losses from risky mortgage bets. 

 Sullivan exit is the latest in a series of high-profile shake-ups at companies, including Wall Street's top banks and brokerages, during a credit crisis that has led to more than $400 billion in write-downs at financial institutions globally. * On June 15, AIG named veteran former Citigroup banker Robert Willumstad, who was already AIG chairman, as its new CEO, effective immediately. * On June 12, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc said it demoted Chief Financial Officer Erin Callan and Chief Operating Officer Joseph Gregory. Chief Administrative Officer Ian Lowitt was named the new CFO and Herbert (Bart) McDade, global head of equities, was promoted to chief operating officer and president. * On June 2, Washington Mutual Inc said it would strip Chief Executive Kerry Killinger of his title of chairman. The Seattle bank said independent director Stephen Frank would succeed Killinger as chairman on July 1. * On June 2, Wachovia Corp said it ousted Chief Executive Ken Thompson, who had presided over a 57 percent drop in its share price over the past year. Lanty Smith, who had replaced Thompson as chairman the previous month, was named interim chief executive. Ben Jenkins, the vice chairman and head of Wachovia's retail and business bank, was named interim chief operating officer. * On April 23, UBS AG Chairman Marcel Ospel left the Swiss bank and was replaced by the bank's chief lawyer, Peter Kurer. * On Jan 8, Bear Stearns Cos Inc said star investment banker Alan Schwartz would replace James Cayne as chief executive. * On Dec 11, Citigroup Inc named investment banking head Vikram Pandit as chief executive and acting CEO Win Bischoff as chairman. * On November 29, Zoe Cruz, co-president of Morgan Stanley and one of the highest-ranking women on Wall Street, resigned. Robert Scully, who had been co-president with Cruz, joined a newly created office of the chairman. Walid Chammah and James Gorman were named the new co-presidents of the company. * On Nov 14, Merrill Lynch named NYSE Euronext Chief Executive John Thain as its new CEO. Thain replaced Stan O'Neal, who was ousted as Merrill's CEO and chairman in late October after the company wrote down $8.4 billion of assets during the third quarter. * On November 4, Charles Prince resigned as chairman and chief executive of Citigroup. Robert Rubin, the former U.S. Treasury secretary, who had chaired Citigroup's executive committee, was named chairman, while Sir Win Bischoff, who ran Citigroup's European operations, was named acting chief executive. * On Oct 30, Merrill Lynch ousted Chairman and Chief Executive Stan O'Neal, just days after reporting the biggest quarterly loss in the company's history. * On Aug 5, Bear Stearns Co Inc fired co-President Warren Spector, a 24-year veteran, after two of its hedge funds collapsed due to bad bets on subprime loans. * On July 5, Swiss banking group UBS named Marcel Rohner as chief executive, replacing Peter Wuffli. The change followed growing calls among UBS critics to bolster results, and perhaps break up the company, focusing on wealth and investment management.
