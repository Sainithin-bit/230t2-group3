 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), the largest U.S. bank, said Frank Yeary will leave his position as head of global mergers and acquisitions in mid-July to assume a new vice chancellor post at the University of California at Berkeley. 

 Yeary, 44, led Citigroup's mergers and acquisitions team for five years. According to Thomson Financial, the New York-based bank ranked fourth in providing merger advice in 2006 and 2007 based on transaction size. So far in 2008, it has ranked third with $384.3 billion of transactions, trailing only Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Thomson said. Yeary joins a growing list of top Citigroup executives to leave the company since Vikram Pandit in December replaced Charles Prince as chief executive. Raymond McGuire, co-head of global investment banking at Citigroup, will oversee the mergers and acquisitions team until the bank replaces Yeary. Citigroup said it will name a replacement "in due course." The executives were not available for immediate comment. Citigroup said Yeary will at UC Berkeley develop partnerships with business, direct major initiatives, help oversee finances, and provide advice to Chancellor Robert Birgeneau. Yeary has served on the board of trustees of the UC Berkeley Foundation, and is a 1985 graduate, according to the university's website. Yeary began his investment banking career in 1984 at Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb. He joined Citigroup predecessor Salomon Brothers Inc in 1990, becoming a managing director in 1994. He left in 1998 to join The Carlyle Group, where he specialized in the communications industry. Citigroup in 2001 rehired Yeary, and he oversaw global telecommunications media and technology investment banking before heading the M&A team. The bank's recent transactions include advising Time Warner Inc ( TWX.N ) on the $45 billion separation of its Time Warner Cable Inc unit. It also advised Electronic Data Systems Corp EDS.N on its $13.9 billion purchase by Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ). McGuire also worked on both transactions, Citigroup said.
