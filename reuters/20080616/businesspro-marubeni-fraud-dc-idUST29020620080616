 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese police have arrested four men on 
suspicion of defrauding U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers 
LEH.N by using fake documents carrying trading firm Marubeni 
Corp's ( 8002.T ) letterhead, a police spokesman said. 

  The four are suspected of forging the documents to obtain 
over 9 billion yen ($83 million) in funds from the bank last 
October, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police said on Monday.  The arrests come after Lehman on March 31 filed a lawsuit 
against Marubeni to recoup some $352 million, blaming Marubeni 
staff for the swindle.  It seeks to recover loans made last year to finance a 
revamp of hospitals and lease medical equipment via Asclepius, 
a now bankrupt unit of drug firm LTT Bio-Pharma Co 4566.T, 
and arranged through Marubeni staff, a source with direct 
knowledge of the matter said in March.  Marubeni, Japan's fifth-biggest trading house, restated in 
a statement on Monday that it was not involved in the scam and 
had no obligation to pay Lehman.  The trading firm said it had fired on March 10 Shingo 
Yamaura, a former part-time worker at Marubeni.  The Tokyo Metropolitan Police said the four arrested were 
Yamaura, 35; Shigenori Saito, 46, former president of 
Asclepius; Yuzuru Yamanaka, 34, former president of LTT 
Bio-Pharma; and Fumihiro Takahashi, 61, president of a 
Tokyo-based building planning company,  A spokesman for Lehman Brothers in Tokyo said the company 
had no comment on the arrests.  In the scam, investors such as Lehman paid around 108 
billion yen between May 2006 and November 2007 in loans for 
what they were told were hospital revamp projects, the Nikkei 
business daily and other media outlets reported on Monday.  Some money had been returned to investors but nearly 50 
billion yen remains unreturned, according to the reports.  Shares of Marubeni rose 3 percent on Monday, against a 2.7 
percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei  .N225  average.  (Reporting by  Mariko Katsumura ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )  ($1=108.05 Yen)
