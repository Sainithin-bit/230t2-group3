 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two U.S. law firms filed lawsuits in 
U.S. federal court alleging insider trading in shares of EADS 
( EAD.PA ) and said that managers and shareholders misled 
investors, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

  The lawsuits, which were filed on Friday, contend that top 
EADS managers and shareholders Lagardere SCA ( LAGA.PA ) and 
Daimler AG ( DAIGn.DE ) knew in late 2005 and early 2006 that 
Airbus faced undisclosed problems with its A380 jetliner but 
that they hid the information so they could profit from selling 
EADS shares.  EADS did was not immediately available for comment on the 
report.  A spokesman for EADS told the newspaper the company would 
take a similar position as it had in lawsuits filed against it 
in France.  "We are confident we have been crystal clear in 
communicating with the market," the spokesman said.  EADS disclosed serious problems in building the A380 in 
June 2006, sending its shares down 26 percent in one day.  One of the lawsuits, filed by New York law firm Dreier LLP 
on behalf of European shareholder Danielle Bobin, alleges 
insider trading by Lagardere and Daimler. Both sold large 
blocks of EADS shares in April 2006, a month before the A380 
problems were announced.  The other lawsuit was filed by San Diego firm Coughlin 
Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP on behalf of an unnamed 
institutional investor.  (Reporting by  Matt Daily ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
