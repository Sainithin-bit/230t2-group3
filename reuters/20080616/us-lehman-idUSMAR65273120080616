 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's chief executive expressed confidence in the investment bank on Monday, sending its shares up as much as 9 percent, even as it posted its first quarterly loss as a public company. 

 CEO Dick Fuld said the company's franchise and capital position are strong as Lehman posted a $2.8 billion loss, in line with its forecast last week. "We've made a number of changes. It's now my job to make sure that we execute," Fuld said on a conference call with investors. The 62-year-old executive has been with Lehman since 1969 and has been CEO since 1993. He has been largely absent from public view during the recent weeks' turmoil at the bank, but told investors on Monday the quarterly loss "is my responsibility." Clouds remain at the bank. Lehman's shares have not recouped all of last week's declines, when the company forecast the quarterly loss and demoted its chief financial officer and chief operating officer amid a crisis in confidence. The shares, up $1.39 to close at $27.20 on Monday, are still below their book value, or net accounting value, of $32.95. Lehman's relatively low share price implies investors see more write-downs coming for the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, which recorded $3.7 billion of write-downs for the second quarter. "That's the $64,000 question for all the brokers: What is their actual book value?" said Jeff Harte, analyst at Sandler O'Neill in Chicago. "That's definitely what people are concerned about." Harte rates Lehman "hold." Lehman, for its part, sees its current valuations as reasonable. "We feel very good about where our balance sheet is marked, but we clearly have to convince the marketplace that that is the case," Chief Financial Officer Ian Lowitt said in an interview. Lowitt was named CFO last week. Lehman has more than $60 billion of mortgages and asset- backed securities on its books, an amount well in excess of the company's net worth. Some analysts project further write-downs for those assets. Lehman said its loss amounted to $5.14 a share for the fiscal second quarter ended May 31, compared with net income of $1.27 billion, or $2.21 a share, a year earlier. The loss was Lehman's first since it was spun off from American Express Co in 1994. Although write-downs have triggered big quarterly losses at rivals such as Morgan Stanley, Lehman had managed to avoid posting a net loss until Monday. Short sellers including David Einhorn, who profit if Lehman's shares decline, have said the investment bank has not taken the losses it ought to under accounting rules. As the smallest of the major U.S. investment banks wrestles with questions about its future, many analysts have speculated it could be a takeover candidate. In response to a question on the call, Fuld said: "I have said many times that I very much believe that, with this franchise's strength and power, we can go it alone." But he added that, if a potential buyer comes forward, he has an obligation to take it to the board of directors. GOLDMAN, MORGAN STANLEY The extent of possible future write-downs is a key consideration for investors as they prepare for quarterly results from Goldman Sachs Group Inc on Tuesday and Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. Rumors of trading losses at Goldman Sachs, long seen as a savvy risk taker, triggered drops in the company's shares last week. The widening subprime mortgage crisis has forced financial institutions globally to write down more than $400 billion of assets. Amid these massive drops in asset values, regulators and investors have been pushing banks to borrow less and hold more capital against their assets, in a process known as "deleveraging." Deleveraging should result in lower profitability for financial institutions. Lehman, which posted a return on equity above 20 percent last fiscal year, said on Monday it expects a return on equity in the mid-teens in the future, but that depends on its generating close to $5 billion of revenue a quarter, well above the $4.2 billion of the most recent quarter, excluding write-downs. There are some signs business is turning around. CFO Lowitt said on the conference call that the first two weeks of June have been strong for Lehman. Lowitt took the CFO post last week, succeeding Erin Callan, who is returning to investment banking, while Herbert "Bart" McDade, head of equities, became chief operating officer and president, succeeding Joseph Gregory, a longtime Fuld lieutenant. "Joe's been my partner for over 30 years and I must tell you, it was one of the most difficult decisions that he and I had to make together," Fuld said. Lehman does not plan to change its ratio of assets to common equity, but it may still reduce its proportion of mortgage assets. The company's net revenue, affected by the write-downs, was negative $668 million in the latest quarter, compared with revenue of $5.5 billion a year earlier. Through Monday's close, Lehman shares had fallen nearly 60 percent this year, compared with a roughly 20 percent decline for the U.S. brokerage sector as measured by the Amex Securities Broker Dealer index .XBD>.
