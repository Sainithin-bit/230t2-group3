 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc agreed on Wednesday to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge relating to promotion of its now-withdrawn Bextra pain medicine and will pay a record $2.3 billion to settle allegations it improperly marketed 13 medicines. 

 Since 2001, there have been more than 40 major U.S. criminal and civil resolutions against drug companies, according to the federal government. With Wednesday's settlement of $2.3 billion, the drug industry has paid the federal government $11.7 billion, $2.98 billion of that for criminal fines, the government said. Some other major drug industry settlements include: * Eli Lilly and Co in January 2009 said it would pay $1.42 billion to settle probes into selling its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug for unapproved uses, a practice known as "off-label" marketing. Lilly agreed to plead guilty to a federal misdemeanor. * Merck & Co in February 2008 reached an agreement to pay more than $650 million to resolve allegations that it failed to pay Medicaid and other government health care programs owed rebates for cholesterol drug Zocor and pain reliever Vioxx. The company also settled charges that it paid kickbacks to health care providers so they would prescribe its drugs. * Bristol-Myers Squibb agreed in September 2007 to pay more than $510 million to settle charges of illegal marketing and pricing for its products. That included allegations of paying and gifts to doctors and health care providers to entice them to buy their drugs as well as promoted certain medicines for uses that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. * Cephalon agreed in September 2008 to pay $425 million to settle allegations that it marketed three drugs for uses that were not approved. * Schering Plough in July 2004 agreed to pay $345 million to settle criminal and civil charges that it illegally marketed and priced its allergy medicine Claritin as well as paid kickbacks.
