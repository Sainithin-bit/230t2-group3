 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector shrank again in August, but an index measuring activity was at its highest in nearly a year, according to an industry report released on Thursday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its services index rose to 48.4 in August from 46.4 in July. That was slightly above the 48.0 median forecast of 70 economists surveyed by Reuters. * A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. The last time the index was at the 50 mark was September 2008. The index's business activity component rose to 51.3, up from 46.1 in July. The August reading was its first above 50 since last September. * The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity and includes businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants. COMMENTS: BILL CHENEY, CHIEF ECONOMIST, JOHN HANCOCK FINANCIAL, BOSTON: "It's clear that non-manufacturing is picking up. This is consistent with the good-news story that has been building. The jobs picture is getting better but it's not great since we still job losses. "Overall, it's so far up from the low back in November. It's hard not to view it as confirming a recovery. "A lot hinges on employment where no one really knows what will happen. Employers fired people so rapidly when things were going down. They should be hiring them back when things pick up; there is not a lot of slack. This would mean job growth could emerge before the end of the year, which would help consumer spending. The negative forces for consumer spending are abating." CARL BIRKELBACH, CHAIRMAN AND CEO, BIRKELBACH INVESTMENT SECURITIES, CHICAGO: "It appears there is just very little comment on it, it has very little effect. One of the interesting things is that the market now seems to be reacting negatively to positive news and that's a change that has to be noted. I'm not sure if tomorrow's employment number is going to matter whether they come out positively or negatively. The market's reaction is probably underwhelming because 1) there will be a lot of people gone and 2) from a momentum standpoint, the market has run out of steam here." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The composite index is the best guide because it incorporates not only the business activity index, but also direct readings on orders, employment and supplier deliveries. That composite index rose to 48.4 from 46.4. "The reading as a whole is in line with expectations. The non-manufacturing index will tend to be less dynamic than the manufacturing index because it's largely comprised of service industries. In contrast, the manufacturing index is heavily influenced by exports and so could be getting a boost from growth abroad. "The non-manufacturing index reading is still a sign of healing. The domestic economy, which was pretty heavily battered, is now coming back on stream. It's good news that order activity for the non-manufacturing activity is picking up. Employment is also becoming a bit less negative which could be a sign that managers think the improvement is for real." DAN FARETTA, SENIOR MARKET STRATEGIST, LIND-WALDOCK, CHICAGO: "The number was better than July's. It shows that we're still contracting, but moving in the right direction. Earlier this week we had some data that was in expansion mode. I think the number is going in the right direction, though part of that could be government incentives like cash for clunkers having a positive impact. If things keep going this way, I project that we could see the number above 50 (representing expansion) in the next three months." JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "Bit of a disappointment in the number, especially after the manufacturing ISM moved above the 50 expansion level. This should put a dampener on equities and will provide a slight drag on the dollar but not much." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes slipped. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were little changed. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar fell against the euro, and then rebounded. It rallied against the yen before falling back.
