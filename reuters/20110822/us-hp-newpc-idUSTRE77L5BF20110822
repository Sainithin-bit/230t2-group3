 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard launched a new desktop on Monday, days after the technology company revealed plans to spin off or sell its personal computer unit. 

 HP billed the new computer -- the HP Compaq 8200 Elite All-in-One Business Desktop -- as the "first all-in-one PC" aimed at corporate and public sector customers. The California company said on Thursday that it might spin off the world's largest PC business -- part of a wrenching series of moves away from the consumer market, including killing its new tablet. HP has has been struggling in the PC market -- a low-margin but high revenue business -- as niftier gadgets like Apple Inc's iPad have lured away consumers. Shares of HP, which fell 20 percent on Friday, were up 4.2 percent at $24.59 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange in a market that was broadly up.
