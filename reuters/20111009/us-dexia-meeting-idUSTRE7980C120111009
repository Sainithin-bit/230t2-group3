 PARIS  (Reuters) - Dexia's board will meet in Brussels at 1300 GMT to review plans to dismantle the collapsing Franco-Belgian bank. 
 "A board meeting will take place at 1500 local time in Brussels," said a spokeswoman at Dexia. Dexia, the first bank to fall victim to the euro zone sovereign debt crisis, was forced to seek government help this week after a liquidity crunch hobbled the lender and sent its shares into a tailspin.
