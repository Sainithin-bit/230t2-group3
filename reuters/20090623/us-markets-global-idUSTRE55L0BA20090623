 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks were weaker on Tuesday as U.S. housing data reinforced the view of a sluggish recovery, while the U.S. dollar fell on speculation the Federal Reserve may lessen expectations of an interest rate rise. 

 Oil prices rebounded as the dollar weakened and disruptions from Nigeria, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, stoked supply concerns. The dollar's losses supported commodities denominated in the greenback, pushing up the benchmark Reuters-Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodity futures .CRB 0.72 percent. U.S. Treasury debt prices rose, shrugging off a record $104 billion in U.S. debt issuance this week as investors await what Fed policy-makers say after a two-day meeting ends Wednesday. Euro zone government bond futures were little changed as investors also awaited the results of a European Central Bank tender of one-year funds. The euro jumped more than 1 percent to trade well above $1.40. With no move on rates expected, investors will focus on the Fed's statement for clues about the economic outlook and its debt-buying program. "There is (some) concern about the Fed," said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. The U.S. central bank also is expected to push back against speculation that it will raise rates before the end of the year. "People are starting to look at whether the Fed is going to indicate that they'll leave rates on hold for an extended period of time," Watt said. Another delay by Boeing Co ( BA.N ) for the first test flight of its Dreamliner aircraft weighed on U.S. stocks and made the company's stock the biggest drag on the Dow. Boeing said the inaugural flight of its long-delayed 787 Dreamliner will be postponed so it can reinforce a section of the aircraft. Boeing slid 9 percent to $42.72. A slower-than-expected rise in sales of previously owned U.S. homes in May also pointed to a tepid economic recovery. "The housing number suggests that things are bottoming, but that's a far cry from improving," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. "The markets are focused on how fast the recovery is going to be, and I think it won't be as fast as people are thinking." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  dropped 6.20 points, or 0.07 percent, to 8,332.81. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 2.27 points, or 0.25 percent, to 895.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  edged up 1.09 points, or 0.06 percent, to 1,767.28. European shares fell to their lowest close in nearly six weeks, with financials suffering most, on renewed pessimism about the economy. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares fell 0.4 percent to 833.67 points, the lowest close since May 13. "Markets were discounting too sharp an economic recovery. The pace of the recovery is going to be mediocre," said Bob Parker, vice chairman of asset management at Credit Suisse. Italian oil firm ENI declared force majeure on shipments of Brass River crude oil from Nigeria. Persistent militant attacks over the past three years have cut oil output in Nigeria, the world's eighth-biggest crude oil exporter, to less than two thirds of its installed capacity of 3 million barrels per day. "The weaker dollar is supportive and you have the supply disruptions in Nigeria and the turmoil in Iran," said Joseph Arsenio, managing director at Arsenio Capital Management in Larkspur, California. U.S. light sweet crude oil rose $1.04 to $68.54 a barrel. Spot gold prices rose $3.75 to $925.65 an ounce. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 9/32 in price to yield 3.65 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note was unchanged in price to yield 1.13 percent. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 1.31 percent at 79.784. The euro was up 1.66 percent at $1.409, and against the yen, the dollar was down 1.00 percent at 94.97 Asian stocks tumbled overnight as confidence in the recovery ebbed. Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  fell 2.8 percent, and the MSCI index of Asia Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS dropped 2.8 percent.
