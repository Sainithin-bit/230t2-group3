 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co, lead contractor for the U.S. Army's canceled Future Combat Systems modernization program, is to face competition to manage successor programs, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. 

 "Boeing will have an opportunity to participate in all those pieces," Ashton Carter, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer, told reporters in announcing a restructuring of the projected $160 billion modernization. Asked if that meant the programs would be open to competition, he replied: "Yes, they will be." In formally killing the old effort, Carter directed the Army to put together "separate but integrated programs" that would meet goals laid out by Defense Secretary Robert Gates in the Pentagon's fiscal 2010 budget request. Gates had said the old effort failed to reflect adequately the lessons of counterinsurgency and close-quarters combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. "He was further troubled by the terms of the single contract covering the whole FCS effort," the Defense Department added in a statement. Boeing was the senior partner in managing the project, the world's largest land warfare weapons program. Science Applications International Corp was the junior partner in the old "lead systems integrator" role. Representatives for Boeing and SAIC did not immediately return requests for comment. Boeing shares fell $3.03 or 6.5 percent to close at $43.87 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. (Reporting by  Andrew Gray , editing by Gerald E. McCormick and  Matthew Lewis )
