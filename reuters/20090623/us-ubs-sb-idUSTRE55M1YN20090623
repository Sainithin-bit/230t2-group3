 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department may drop a legal case aimed at forcing UBS AG to reveal the names of 52,000 wealthy American clients suspected of offshore tax evasion, the New York Times reported on Tuesday. 

 Following is a summary of major events leading up to the settlement: 2008 June 19 -- A former UBS banker who once smuggled a client's diamonds into the U.S. in a toothpaste tube pleads guilty to helping a billionaire hide $200 million in assets from U.S. tax authorities, part of a broader tax evasion probe of UBS. November 12 -- Raoul Weil, head of UBS's wealth management business, charged with conspiring to help thousands of wealthy Americans hide $20 billion of assets from U.S. tax authorities in Swiss bank accounts. 2009 February 18 -- UBS agrees to pay $780 million and identify certain U.S. clients to settle criminal fraud charges that it assisted rich Americans to evade taxes. February 19 - U.S. tax authorities say they are still pursuing a civil lawsuit seeking to access details on 52,000 UBS clients. March 13 - Switzerland agrees to make concessions on bank secrecy amid global crackdown on tax evasion. April 5 - UBS announces a worldwide travel ban for wealth management client advisers after coming under scrutiny in the U.S. tax fraud investigation. April 15 - UBS posts a near 2 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion) loss, mainly due to writedowns and outflows at its wealth management unit. April 25 - Switzerland asks the U.S. to drop the case involving UBS bank in return for a new tax accord. June 19 - Swiss government strikes deal with Washington for a new double taxation accord, but makes no mention of the UBS case despite saying it will be hard to get the agreement approved by a referendum without a settlement for UBS.
