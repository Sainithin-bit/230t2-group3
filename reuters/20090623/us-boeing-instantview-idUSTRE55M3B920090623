 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Tuesday it had postponed the first flight of its long-delayed 787 Dreamliner to reinforce an area within the side-of-body section of the aircraft. 

 The aerospace giant said it would update its financial guidance to reflect any impact from the delay. Boeing's stock sank 6.4 percent to $43.93 in early trade. ALEX HAMILTON, ANALYST, JESUP & LAMONT SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "It's certainly not a good thing. I would applaud Boeing in the sense that they are not going to test this until they are 100 percent sure that everything is working. In that sense, they are making sure that the quality is there. "The stock recently has rallied in the last few months. I think a lot of it was based on the fact that the stock was so cheap, we were approaching the Paris Air Show and there were expectations for that and we were heading into another catalyst--the 787 first flight. "I think the stock has gone up too far too fast. In terms of investing in the stock in the short term, there's no near-term catalyst for the stock. This was the big near-term catalysts everyone was looking for and that has definitely slid out. Obviously there's going to be an impact to guidance. I don't know what the impact is going to be. "I think people who thought that Boeing was out of the woods based on valuation need to take another look. "As recent as last week, they reiterated they were going to have first flight by the end of the second quarter. "I am a little surprised. I think a lot of confidence has been blown." BERNIE MCGINN, PRESIDENT, MCGINN INVESTMENT MANAGAMENT, ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINA: "This launch was supposed to happen a couple of years ago. I think that Boeing really brought this on themselves. The development of the plane was rocket-ship fast; the schedule for bringing it to the market. They took the backend process and divvied up the work into small pieces with small contractors. At the end of the day they couldn't keep up with the work and by the time they realized this they were already into massive delays. "Investors are getting a little tired of this. Besides the delay, the other thing affecting the stock is that investors are nervous about the U.S. defense budget coming out, and Boeing's role it. Both factors are working against "But once the plane comes out, I think the stock will do very well. Last month everyone thought the plane was coming out and the stock rallied big. As an investor, you want to use this weakness [now] as a buying opportunity, because ultimately the plane will launch and Boeing will see strong growth from that." PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE ILLINOIS "It's certainly disappointing news because that is a major milestone for the company so they can start filling those backorders they have for, I think, pretty close to 1,000 airplanes. "I think it would be more of a concern if the economy was booming, if Airbus was very robustly pursuing the same type aircraft. "Boeing still has a very substantial advantage in this area. Part of the reason there have been delays is they're really breaking new ground, not just with the technology of the airplane itself, but also just the way they're going about manufacturing the airplane. "Certainly some delays would have be expected because there's so much new work being done. They're still on the cutting edge with this airplane so I don't think anyone's going to come out and steal those customers away from them." RYAN LARSON, HEAD OF EQUITY TRADING AT VOYAGEUR ASSET MANAGEMENT IN CHICAGO "Obviously since it's postponing the flight you're seeing a lot of companies related to Boeing trading lower right now. It's obviously a disappoint, but I don't know how big a surprise it is. There have been delays in the past, so the market may have gotten ahead of itself. "We've seen data points, such as at the Paris Show, that could be a positive for demand, this is obviously going to put a damper on that." JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO: "It seems like a big setback. was something that was widely anticipated. "It's a setback that's going to disappoint investors. Boeing's shares will suffer a near term setback. "I'm hopeful that this issue can be resolved quickly. But my sense is that if it's big enough to delay the introduction then this is a serious concern."
