 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve meets this week at a time when the U.S. economy seems ready to climb out of recession, and worries about the long-term fallout from the U.S. central bank's aggressive policies are rising. 

 Economists expect the Federal Open Market Committee to hold the target range for its benchmark federal funds rate steady at zero to 0.25 percent, and probably to make no shifts in its asset purchase programs. Many analysts suggest that the Fed will not raise the funds rate until late in 2010 at the earliest, even if some of its alternative stimulus measures are wound down before that. The bank "does not want to derail a fragile recovery prematurely," economists Peter Hooper and Torsten Slok at Deutsche Bank said in a research report. The Fed is likely to restate its commitment to keeping rates low "for an extended period," especially given ideas in financial markets that a rate hike could come before year-end. "They probably feel quite strongly that market expectations of an early exit are premature," said Jan Hatzius, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs. "Sending such a signal could be a very effective means of bringing down rates across the curve." Recent sharp rhetoric on inflation risks from some Fed policy-makers suggests the bank's post-meeting statement could nod to the hawkish element with some reference to the need for a clear exit strategy. "It would be wise if the Fed started to articulate a more neutral balance of risk posture ... and start to convince the markets they will be timely in removing stimulus," said economists at Action Economics. The Fed is expected to issue its policy statement around 2:15 p.m. EDT on Wednesday. Following are some of the factors policy-makers are considering: ECONOMY The worst seems over for the U.S. economy. Second quarter gross domestic product is forecast to be down modestly, with the third quarter likely to be a toss-up between contraction and growth, and forecasters more confident of growth by the fourth quarter. Analysts noted that initial weekly jobless claims, a timely indicator of economic activity, have fallen substantially from horrendous first-quarter levels. "This type of plunge is the hallmark of the end of recessions," said Dean Maki, economist at Barclays Capital. "The broad swath of recent data will lead the Fed to feel more confident in its forecast for a second-half 2009 recovery than it did at its April meeting." Even so, the monthly jobless rate, at a 26-year high of 9.4 percent in May, could continue to rise into the new year. Many forecasters look for a peak near 11 percent. "In recent past recessions, the Fed has not hiked (rates) until the unemployment rate has been in decline for at least six months," said Deutsche's Hooper and Slok. Besides jobless claims, elements that have shown signs of life recently include housing starts and sales, and selected manufacturing indicators. Retail sales in May also rose for the first time in three months, although the mild upturn failed to allay concerns that consumer spending will not be a robust engine of growth coming out of the recession. "All the data is pointing to a consumer that will remain weak for the foreseeable future," said Eugenio Aleman, economist at Wells Fargo. INFLATION The output gap created by a shrinking job market is keeping prices in check for now, but the Fed is aware of how inflation could be triggered by huge amounts of money sloshing around in the financial system from its accommodative monetary policies. Consumer price inflation in May fell by 1.3 percent year on year, its largest decline since 1950, while core prices -- which exclude food and energy -- rose by 1.8 percent. Core prices have not fallen as far as some economists had expected given the severe recession, signaling to some that inflation might spark up more quickly when growth resumes. That is doubly the case given the extraordinary stimulus from the Fed since it reached the "zero bound" on interest rates in December. Still, many analysts guess that the Fed, on balance, will view the recent jump in longer-term Treasury yields to reflect more a shift out of safe-haven assets than a ringing of alarm bells on inflation. UNCONVENTIONAL TOOLS Since the Fed surprised the market in March by confirming it would buy longer-term Treasury debt, attention has been riveted on what its next move might be. Fed watchers are keen to hear of plans for additional Treasury purchases by the Fed, or other tweaks to the central bank's array of credit-easing measures. However, most policy-makers have hinted since the last FOMC meeting that, with recovery in sight, now is the time to think about winding down stimulus, not ramping it up. "We do not expect any new developments regarding Fed asset purchases at this meeting, such as expansion, extension or unwinding," the Deutsche economists said. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
