 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights from Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's testimony on Tuesday before the House Ways and Means Committee on the Obama Administration's budget proposals for fiscal year 2012. 

 FROM GEITHNER'S WRITTEN TESTIMONY: ON GROWTH AND THE DEFICIT: "While our deficits will decline in coming years as the economy continues to recover, economic growth alone will not be enough to stabilize our finances." ON SOCIAL SECURITY: "We will consider ideas that put Social Security on more sound financial footing over the long term. However, we will reject plans that slash benefits; that fail to protect current retirees, people with disabilities and the most vulnerable; or that subject Americans' retirement savings to the whims of the stock market." ON FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY: "If the debt were to continue to grow as a share of the economy, an ever-increasing share of revenues would have to be devoted just to paying the interest on the national debt, so that in 2020 interest payments would be nearly as large as all defense spending. Such escalating interest payments would create an unsustainable cycle that would eventually force dramatic adjustments. Without appropriate reforms, this path would have consequential effects on the U.S. economy. "Cutting spending indiscriminately would force us to cut investments in vital public goods, and focusing reform solely on spending would impose an undue burden on those most in need while ignoring the opportunity to make our tax system more simple, fair, and efficient."
