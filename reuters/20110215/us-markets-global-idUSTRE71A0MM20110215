 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks edged off recent 30-month highs on Tuesday and oil prices retreated as disappointing retail sales in the United States and persistent inflationary pressures in China dented optimism about the global economic outlook. 

 The U.S. dollar climbed to an eight-week high against the yen, lifted by a jump in two-year Treasury yields to their highest since last May. Rising bond yields have pushed the dollar up about 3 percent versus the yen over the last two weeks. Sales at U.S. retailers rose by a less-than-forecast 0.3 percent in January, partly due to harsh winter weather, though economists said the underlying trend of improved spending remained intact. "The softer data will see the growth bulls marginally lower forecasts for first-quarter retail activity, but the market impact will be softened as economists give room for a rebound after weather improves," said Avery Shenfeld, CIBC chief economist in Toronto. The MSCI All-Country World index .MIWD00000PUS dipped 0.1 percent, holding near last week's 30-month highs. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 41.55 points, or 0.34 percent, at 12,226.64. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 4.31 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,328.01. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 12.83 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,804.35. Volume remained light, following the slowest trading day in U.S. markets this year. Brent crude for April delivery fell $1.44 to settle at $101.64 a barrel, after hitting a 28-month peak at $104.30 on Monday. U.S. crude for March delivery fell 49 cents to settle at $84.32 a barrel, ahead of weekly oil inventory data expected to show U.S. crude oil stocks rose last week. While protests in Iran and other Middle East countries remained a concern, analysts also looked for some unwinding of the geopolitical fear premium that emerged during Egypt's protests. "There may be some unwinding of the fear premium on overall risk reduction as the Middle East hasn't gotten out of control yet and traders also are getting ready for another expected rise in U.S. oil supplies," said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago. Data overnight showed Chinese inflation came in lower than expected at 4.9 percent in the year to January, but price pressures excluding food were their strongest in at least a decade and could force the central bank to keep tightening monetary policy. In Britain, inflation jumped to twice the Bank of England's target in January, prompting BoE Governor Mervyn King to acknowledge that interest rates might rise more rapidly than economists had expected. Rising inflation worries pushed gold to a four-week high, while the prospects of more tightening in China pushed copper off record highs in its biggest one-day slide in three weeks. DOLLAR AND YIELDS The dollar climbed to 83.93 yen on trading platform EBS, the highest level since mid-December, lifted by the recent rise in bond yields. It was last up 0.6 percent at 83.76 yen. "If the upswing in Treasury yields continues, it is not unreasonable that we see further upside for the dollar against the yen," said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. "If risk appetites improve, that will also present further downside for the yen." The dollar was little changed versus the euro after Europe moved closer to a deal on tackling its debt crisis and officials said there would be additional meetings to try to reach an accord. Uncertainty over a rescue package has caused spreads between peripheral nation bond yields and German benchmarks to widen in recent days. Greece bonds were a notable underperformer on Tuesday after data showed its recession deepened in the last months of 2010. The euro zone ended last year with stable economic growth, but disappointed those hoping for a faster recovery as expansion in the three largest nations fell short of forecasts, and Greece and Portugal contracted. But German data and a sentiment indicator suggested the country's economic recovery remained on track.
