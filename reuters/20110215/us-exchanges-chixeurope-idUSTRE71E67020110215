 LONDON  (Reuters) - Alasdair Haynes, the chief executive of Chi-X Europe -- the region's top share trading platform -- has questioned the rationale behind Deutsche Boerse AG's planned takeover of NYSE Euronext. 

 Haynes, whose firm is in exclusive merger talks with U.S. exchange Bats Global Markets, said the NYSE Euronext - Deutsche Boerse entity would not be able to compete with Chi-X Europe because of its size. "Their problems haven't gone away -- the combined NYSE Euronext/Deutsche Boerse will have thousands of employees whereas we have 50, meaning we can keep our fees to a minimum compared to the exchanges," said Haynes. Chi-X Europe, which is owned by investment banks and hedge funds, is the largest trading system in the region with a market share of 16.7 percent, compared with NYSE Euronext's 16.4 percent and Deutsche Boerse's 11.6 percent, according to data from Thomson Reuters. Haynes also said the exchanges have failed to grasp that the battleground is now Europe-wide rather than limited to individual countries, as it was in the past. "NYSE Euronext/ Deutsche Boerse say they are pan-European but they do hardly any equity trading outside of Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal. Most European national exchanges have failed to compete effectively and are simply looking to buy up market share through other exchanges," Haynes said. Deutsche Boerse announced on Tuesday a $10.2 billion deal to take over NYSE Euronext, but the exchange dodged key questions fueling concerns on either side of the Atlantic over which partner would have the upper hand in the merged group. Bats Global Markets, which through its subsidiary Bats Europe trades 6.2 percent of the European market, said on February 11 it was extending its takeover talks with Chi-X Europe, having originally gone exclusive in December.
