 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext plan to release a statement on Tuesday on their merger talks and a press conference is expected to be held at around 1500 GMT, several sources said. 

 Last week, the companies unveiled the first details of a merger plan that would create the world's largest stock exchange, just hours after the London Stock Exchange said it would buy Canada's TMX, sparking a merger frenzy in the sector. Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext declined to comment. The companies are likely to avoid delicate issues on Tuesday such as a name, and specific details about where job cuts would fall as a way to keep national and political forces on board, according to sources close to the negotiations.
