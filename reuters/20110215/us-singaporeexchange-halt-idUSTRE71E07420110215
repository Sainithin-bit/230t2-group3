 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange requested trading halt on Tuesday, pending a release of an announcement. 

 The request came after Australian bourse operator ASX said it was in talks with suitor Singapore Exchange about changes to proposed board arrangement as the sides seek to win political and regulatory support for their planned $7.9 billion tie-up. (Reporting by Harry Suhartono)
