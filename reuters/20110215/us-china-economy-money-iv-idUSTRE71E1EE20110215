 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese banks extended 1.04 trillion yuan ($157.7 billion) in new local currency loans in January, less than market expectations of 1.2 trillion yuan. 

 KEY POINTS: -- Outstanding yuan loans up 18.5 pct yr/yr (forecast 18.7 pct) -- M2 money growth up 17.2 pct (forecast 18.9 pct) COMMENTARY: JONATHAN CAVENAGH, CURRENCY STRATEGIST AT WESTPAC IN SINGAPORE: "From a risk appetite perspective, lower CPI means less tightening, but the market is watching loan data very closely in terms of momentum for growth, so if that undershoots expectations, it will weigh on the growth outlook and see Asian shares and currencies lower in my view. "From a dollar/yuan perspective, expect it to head lower into this weekend's G20 meeting." CONNIE TSE, ECONOMIST AT FORECAST PTE IN SINGAPORE: "The latest money supply and lending data suggest that government efforts to clamp down on liquidity might be taking hold, though broad-based inflation provides no leeway for the PBOC to relax its tightening stance. DU ZHENGZHENG, ANALYST AT BOHAI SECURITIES IN BEIJING: "The loan figure is a bit less than expected, but it still stayed at the upper side of the range controlled by the banking regulators, which means the demand for loans was strong. "But with the tightening measures starting to bite, the chance for the central bank to raise reserve requirements has been reduced." ISAAC MENG, ECONOMIST AT BNP PARIBAS IN BEIJING: "Lending is a little bit lower than projected, but that is most likely due to the extremely tight dynamic reserve requirement into the month end. So lending has been controlled to be a little lower than the 1.2 trillion yuan expected by the market. "The big plunge in M1 and M2 is mostly a Chinese New Year effect. I think we need to wait another month before we can read into that. "Overall, the liquidity still looks pretty loose. In February the money market rate began to ease again." XU BIAO, AN ECONOMIST WITH CHINA MERCHANTS BANK IN SHENZHEN: "Apparently, if the lending pace in 2011 remains the same as that of 2010, the 1.04 trillion yuan would translate into whole-year lending of 5.6 trillion yuan. That will be too tight. "In short, the lending in January is far from being sufficient to meet real demands for loans, for which the lending control may relax a little bit in coming months." WANG HU, AN ANALYST AT GUOTAI JUNAN SECURITIES IN SHANGHAI: "The figure of new yuan loans is at the lower end of the market's expected range, indicating that the banking regulators' tightening measures has yielded some effect. "But the figure is still very strong and reflects a robust demand for loans in the first month of this year. "We expect the credit data in the coming months will continue to rise at a fast pace, with the total new yuan loans in the first quarter to reach about 2.5 trillion yuan."

BACKGROUND: -- China's central bank has raised interest rates three times in four months, most recently on Feb 8, as it has stepped up its fight against quickening inflation. -- China has officially increased banks' required reserves seven times since early 2010 to mop up excess liquidity in the economy, which has helped trigger rising prices. -- Lending and money growth slowed steadily last year as the People's Bank of China steered monetary conditions back to normal after unleashing an extraordinary surge in bank credit in 2009 to counter the global financial crisis. -- But the customary lending frenzy at the start of this year fanned concerns that the government would move more aggressively to control loan growth and punish banks that have been particularly profligate.
