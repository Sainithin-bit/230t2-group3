 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa said on Tuesday the chance of Japan's economy resuming a moderate recovery is heightening. 

 "Japan's economy is making steady progress toward achieving our forecast made in January," Shirakawa told a news conference. Shirakawa said the BOJ saw upside and downside risks to Japan's economy roughly in balance. Earlier on Tuesday the BOJ kept monetary policy on hold and raised its assessment of the economy to say it is gradually emerging from a slowdown, further signaling that no imminent monetary easing is on the horizon.
