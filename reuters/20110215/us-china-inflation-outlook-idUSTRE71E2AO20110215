 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's inflation will stay high in the first half of this year, especially in the first quarter, before easing in the second half to bottom in the fourth quarter, Yao Jingyuan, chief economist of the National Statistics Bureau, said. 

 Yao, who was quoted on state radio on Tuesday, said the expected easing in price pressures would be a result of the government's recent anti-inflation measures. Chinese data showed on Tuesday that inflation in January was unexpectedly tame, running at an annual pace of 4.9 percent. (Reporting by Langi Chiang and Koh Gui Qing; Editing by  Simon Rabinovitch )
