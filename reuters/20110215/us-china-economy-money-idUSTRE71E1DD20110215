 BEIJING  (Reuters) - New lending by Chinese banks fell well below forecasts in January after the government toughened restrictions on credit issuance and succeeded in slowing the pace of money growth in the face of high inflation. 

 Economists had expected 1.2 trillion yuan ($182 billion) in new lending, and the official Xinhua news agency had reported that exact figure just minutes before the data release, but the People's Bank of China said that the real number was 1.04 trillion yuan. "New yuan loans are at the lower end of the market's expected range, indicating that the regulators' tightening measures have yielded some effect," said Wang Hu, an analyst at Guotai Junan Securities in Shanghai. "But the figure is still very strong and reflects a robust demand for loans in the first month of this year," he added. Annual growth in China's broad M2 measure of money supply slowed to 17.2 percent in the month from 19.7 percent in December, the central bank said in a statement on its website (www.pbc.gov.cn). Yuan loans outstanding at the end of January were 18.5 percent higher than a year earlier, down from a 19.9 percent pace a month earlier. The median forecast of economists was for an 18.7 percent rise in outstanding loans and an 18.9 percent increase in M2. As a centerpiece of its economic policy, China sets loan quotas to guide credit issuance by banks. Because of the country's relatively stunted financial markets, these targets are more important than interest rates in controlling the pace of money growth and inflation in the Chinese economy. Loan quotas took on extra urgency last month because banks began the year by unleashing their customary early-year lending surge at the same time as officials were trying to slow credit expansion to rein in prices. Earlier on Tuesday, China reported that consumer price inflation in January was lower than forecast at 4.9 percent from a year earlier, although analysts said that price pressures continued to build and would force the central bank to stick to its course of gradual monetary tightening.
