 (Reuters) - Sanofi-Aventis SA ( SASY.PA ) has reached an agreement in principle to buy Genzyme Corp GENZ.O for $19.2 billion in cash plus future payments based on the performance of an experimental Genzyme drug, according to two sources with knowledge of the talks. 

 Below are some key facts about Sanofi, currently the world's fourth-largest drugmaker by sales according to IMS Health, and Genzyme, a pioneering biotechnology company which specializes in drugs for rare diseases: SANOFI HISTORY Sanofi-Aventis is the product of numerous mergers and acquisitions. It became the world's third-largest drugmaker in 2004 when Sanofi-Synthelabo -- formed by merging subsidiaries of Total ( TOTF.PA ) and L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ) in 1999 -- bought Aventis. Sanofi named Chris Viehbacher as chief executive at the end of 2008. He has been diversifying the group into areas like animal health and consumer health to deal with the loss of patent protection on top-selling drugs that will dramatically hurt sales through 2013. Sanofi has about 102,000 employees in 100 countries.
