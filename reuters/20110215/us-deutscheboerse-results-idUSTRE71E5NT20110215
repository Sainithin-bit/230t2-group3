 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse said it was optimistic for 2011 as it reported quarterly results hours after unveiling plans to create the world's largest exchange operator in a $10.2 billion deal with NYSE Euronext. 

 "For 2011, we expect growth in all business areas," Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni said in a statement late on Tuesday as the company reported fourth-quarter net profit above expectations. Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext earlier announced their tie-up plans, which will create a company with 2010 net revenues of $5.4 billion, but dodged key questions that could yet threaten its completion. Deutsche Boerse posted a 16 percent decline in fourth-quarter net profit to 417.8 million euro ($564 million), better than the 395 million euro average estimate in a Reuters poll. The exchange operator said it had written down the value of the International Securities Exchange (ISE) by around 453 million euros, in line with previous statements, to reflect the lower value of its struggling U.S. equity options business. "The economic climate improved considerably in 2010 compared with the previous year, and consequently the demand for the products and services of Deutsche Boerse Group increased as well," the company said on Tuesday. "In addition, the considerable volatility in equity markets in the second quarter of 2010 resulted in a significant increase in volumes in cash and derivatives markets during this period." It announced an unchanged dividend of 2.10 euros per share, in line with expectations. (Reporting by  Maria Sheahan  and Harro ten Wolde)
