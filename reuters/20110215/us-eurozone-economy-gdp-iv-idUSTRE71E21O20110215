 (Reuters) - The euro zone economy grew at the same quarterly rate in the fourth quarter as in the third, data showed on Tuesday, defying expectations of an acceleration. 

 ECONOMISTS' COMMENTS: NICK KOUNIS, ECONOMIST AT ABN AMRO IN AMSTERDAM "The pace of activity may have been negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions. For instance, we estimate that the drop in construction output probably stripped 0.3 percentage points off German quarterly GDP growth, and there was probably a similar impact in some other member states. "However, these effects should not be exaggerated as there was also a positive influence of the weather in terms of energy consumption -- and production in some cases -- as well as other specific positive one-offs. "For example, French consumer spending benefited from soaring car sales, which reflected purchases before the end of the incentive program. "However, it seems fair to say that the underlying pace of growth was a little stronger in Q4 and we will probably see some payback in Q1." "Looking forward, business surveys suggest that the economy made a good start to 2011. The recovery should remain supported by strong -- albeit moderating -- global growth during the course of this year, as well as an upswing in investment. "In contrast, fiscal consolidation, of around 1.4 percent GDP for the euro zone as a whole, and sluggish labor markets should weigh on domestic demand, which may well dampen some of the positive momentum we saw at the turn of the year." LUIGI SPERANZA, BNP PARIBAS "We were a little disappointed, but the data today underestimates the underlying trend. There was bad weather in December, which contributed, but the underlying trend is a bit stronger. I believe we will see a rebound in the early part of this year." "The real problem is the divergence across the economies, with the strength mainly coming from core Europe, with Germany leading... In countries like Italy, Spain, Portugal you don't see a turnaround and domestic demand continues to be weak." "We should see a rebound in Q1 2011." MARTIN VAN VLIET, EURO ZONE ECONOMIST, ING GLOBAL ECONOMICS "It's in line with the consensus and it's matching also the pace seen in the third quarter, but I think the underlying growth picture is a bit more benign. "As we all know there was a cold snap in December, which disrupted construction and trade activity, and the acceleration in industrial activity was insufficient to offset this, so the underlying picture looks more benign. "All in all, today's figures show that although the economy experienced a weather-related impact at the end of last year, the recovery continued, so my guess is that growth will pick up in the first quarter as the weather-related impact unwinds. "But then again fiscal tightening will increasingly kick in, so on balance we remain cautiously optimistic about the growth prospects for this year, and we retain the view that the euro zone economy will grow by a round 1.5 percent." CHRISTOPH WEIL, EUROPEAN ECONOMIST AT COMMERZBANK "It's in line with expectations, perhaps a little bit lower, but it's not dramatic. I think the figures are depressed by the hard winter weather. "The interesting thing is the differential between the euro zone countries with strong growth, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, and then the peripherals such as Greece and Portugal, which are really lagging behind. "For this year, in Germany we will expect stronger growth in the first quarter, and across the euro zone as a whole we will see growth of perhaps 0.4 to 0.5 percent in the first and second quarters."
