 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The United States has slapped final duties ranging up to almost 175 percent on about $56 million of electric blankets from China because of unfair pricing, the U.S. Commerce Department said on Monday. 

 The decision is a victory for Florida company Jarden Consumer Solutions, which filed a petition last year asking for anti-dumping protection against the Chinese product. U.S. manufacturers have won dozens of duties against Chinese competitors in recent years, straining trade ties. China has accused the United States of protectionism in the cases, while U.S. officials say the duties are needed to protect vulnerable U.S. industries from unfair practices. U.S. imports of the electric blankets from China rose to $55.9 million in 2009, from $29.7 million in 2008. Hung Kuo Electronics Company, Ningbo V.K. Industry & Trading, Ningbo Jifa Electrical Appliances Company and Ningbo Jinchun Electric Appliances Company each received a final anti-dumping duty of 77.75 percent. All other Chinese producers and exporters received a final anti-dumping duty of 174.85 percent. The U.S. International Trade Commission has to give final approval to the duties. That vote is set for August. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by  Cynthia Osterman )
