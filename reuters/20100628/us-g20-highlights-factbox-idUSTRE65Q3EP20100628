 Toronto  (Reuters) - Here are some developments as leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies meet in Canada. 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * World leaders agreed to take different paths toward assuring lasting growth and making their banking systems safer, a reflection of the uneven and fragile economic recovery in many countries. AUSTERITY VS STIMULUS * The Group of 20 rich and developing economies tried to balance their contrasting priorities by pledging to halve budget deficits by 2013 without stunting growth, and to clamp down on risky bank behavior without choking off lending. * They left room for countries to move at their own pace and adopt "differentiated and tailored" policies that match national economic or political priorities, a sharp reversal from the unity of the previous three crisis-era G20 summits. BANK LEVY * The G20 allowed each country space to decide how to proceed with controversial provisions such as taxing banks to recoup bailout costs and implementing tougher bank capital rules. CHINESE YUAN * The G8 steered clear of confrontation with China by making no specific mention of the yuan currency, even though Beijing has just allowed it to resume its rise against the dollar. IMF REPRESENTATION * G20 leaders pledged to push for an agreement on more voting power for emerging economic powers in the International Monetary Fund by the next summit in Seoul, South Korea, in early November. PROTESTS * Police in Toronto fired tear gas on protesters for a second straight day as new violence surrounding the G20 summit erupted and the arrest tally climbed toward 600. QUOTES * "While growth is returning, the recovery is uneven and fragile, unemployment in many countries remains at unacceptable levels, and the social impact of the crisis is still widely felt. Strengthening the recovery is key," final G8 communique. * "Our challenges are as diverse as our nations," But together we represent some 85 percent of the global economy, and we have forged a coordinated response to the worst global economic crisis of our time," U.S. President Barack Obama. * "This will be part of the final communique," German Chancellor Angela Merkel on G20 agreement to halve public sector deficits by 2013 and stabilize government debt. "Frankly spoken, this is more than I expected." "What we saw yesterday ... is a bunch of thugs that pretend to have a difference of opinion with policies and instead choose violence in order to express those so-called differences of opinion," Dimitri Soudas, spokesman for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, on the protest violence on Saturday.
