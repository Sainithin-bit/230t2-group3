 BASEL  (Reuters) - Global economic recovery could be derailed by surging interest rates if industrial economies fail to take determined action to reduce debt, according to a report the Bank for International Settlements released on Monday. 

 European moves to ramp up austerity measures to tackle debt have fueled tensions with Washington, which fears too much budget tightening too quickly could stunt economic recovery. "High and rising levels of public debt imply significant risks for the global economy," the BIS, which acts as a forum and bank for central banks, said in the report. "As demonstrated by the recent European debt crisis, concerns about government default may lead to a sharp rise in interest rates, which could further aggravate financial fragility and put the incipient economic recovery at risk." Greece, Spain and Portugal recently announced additional measures, including public wage cuts and tax rises, that should cut debt significantly but they still faced considerable challenges in restoring investor confidence, the BIS said. Without naming names, it suggested that other countries such as the United States needed to show they had a clear strategy to address their debt too, even if they had not run into the market difficulties that have forced Greece to tap rescue funding. "Other countries that continue to enjoy investors' confidence have a higher degree of fiscal credibility and so may have some flexibility in choosing the timing and pace of their fiscal consolidation," the BIS report said. "But if they are to preserve that flexibility -- by forestalling any rise in default and inflation risk premia -- they should announce clear and credible plans to reduce their current fiscal deficits and to address their long-term fiscal imbalances," it said. The report noted that the aggregate public debt of advanced economies was set to rise from 76 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) at the start of the financial and economic crisis in 2007 to more than 100 percent by 2011. In contrast, the aggregate public debt of the emerging market economies was lower at the beginning of the crisis, is estimated to have hit about 35 percent of GDP at the end of 2009 and, in the words of the BIS, "seems unlikely to rise sharply." The BIS offered one note of optimism for the United States and Britain, where it noted that public debt was projected to reach upwards of 90 percent of GDP in 2011. Public debt surged to about 120 percent of GDP in the United States and 275 percent of GDP in Britain in the wake of World War Two, the BIS said, adding:"The required adjustment currently facing advanced economies is surely large but not unprecedented." The initial pain of tackling government debt and deficits "will be outweighed by the persistent benefits of lower real interest rates, greater stability of the financial system and better prospects for economic growth," it said.
