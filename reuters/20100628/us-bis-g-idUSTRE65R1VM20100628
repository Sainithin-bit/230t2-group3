 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - The publication of stress tests for European banks and the Group of 20 nations' support for regulatory reforms are important steps, the Bank for International Settlements' General Manager said on Monday. 

 "Recently announced policy measures represent significant steps in the right direction," BIS General Manager Jaime Caruana told a news conference following the BIS annual general meeting. "Fiscal consolidation in some countries, the publication of stress test results for European banks, and the support of the G20 for the regulatory reform agenda are all important steps forward," he said.
