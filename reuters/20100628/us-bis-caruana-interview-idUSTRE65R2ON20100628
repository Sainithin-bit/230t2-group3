 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Some countries will have to cut budget deficits more quickly than the Group of 20 nations' goal in order to restore market confidence, the head of the Bank for International Settlements said on Monday. G20 leaders meeting in Toronto at the weekend promised to at least halve budget deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016. 

 Asked about the deadline in an interview with Reuters Insider television, BIS general manager Jaime Caruana said there was not one rule for every country and some would have to act sooner than others. "In some cases, in some countries, they have to be frontloaded, they have to act decisively and soon, and this will restore confidence," he said. "We have seen ... in some cases these fiscal concerns have affected markets and it is very important to restore confidence rapidly. For that, you need to work on the deficit." "Some countries need to start sooner." (Reporting by Adrian Murdoch, writing by Krista Hughes; editing by  Patrick Graham )
