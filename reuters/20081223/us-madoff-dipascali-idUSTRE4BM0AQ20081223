 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investigators examining the alleged fraud of Wall Street investment manager Bernard Madoff are looking into the role of an official who handled client accounts, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, citing a person familiar with the matter. 

 Authorities are investigating the role of Frank DiPascali, the newspaper reported. DiPascali worked at Madoff's firm for more than 30 years, according to the newspaper. Investigators have also issued a subpoena to David Friehling, a New York-based accountant who audited the firm's financial statements, and have requested documents going back to 2000, the WSJ reported, citing a person familiar with the matter. Andrew Lankler, a lawyer for Friehling, declined comment and Marc Mukasey, a lawyer for DiPascali, could not immediately be reached for comment. The FBI, federal prosecutors and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether Madoff may have swindled thousands of investors, including charities and businesses around the world. Madoff was arrested on December 11 and is accused in a criminal complaint of one count of securities fraud. Prosecutors have said he confessed to running a $50 billion fraud.
