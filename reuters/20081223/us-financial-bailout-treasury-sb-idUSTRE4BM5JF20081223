 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Tuesday that it completed purchases of equity in 28 banks last week as part of a plan to stabilize the financial system and help return those banks to normal lending. 

 Congress approved a $700 billion financial rescue program in early October that Treasury would tap. Currently, it only has authority to use half of those funds and it has already pledged all but $15 billion of that amount. However, if it abandoned plans to inject more capital into banks, it would have about $100 billion on hand. Following are details on what has been spent or pledged so far out of the $350 billion Treasury currently has authority to draw on: -- $250 billion to buy senior preferred shares and warrants in banks and thrifts. Of that, purchases of $167.8 billion had been completed as of the latest statement on the Treasury's cash position, which covered the period through December 12. A further $10 billion is approved for Merrill Lynch but has been deferred pending its merger with Bank of America. -- $40 billion investment in troubled insurer American International Group, which has been completed. -- $20 billion investment into Citigroup pledged as part of a bailout announced on November 23. -- $5 billion pledged to cover potential losses on a portfolio of Citigroup mortgage-related assets. -- $20 billion pledged to cover potential losses for a Federal Reserve program aimed at improving consumer access to credit. Following is a list of the banks and thrifts in which Treasury has completed an investment under its $250 billion Capital Purchase Program: JPMorgan $25 billion Citigroup $25 billion Wells Fargo $25 billion Bank of America $15 billion Merrill Lynch $10 billion (see note) Goldman Sachs $10 billion Morgan Stanley $10 billion Bank of New York Mellon $3 billion State Street Corp $2 billion Bank of Commerce $17 million First Financial Svcs $16 million UCBH Holdings Inc $299 million Northern Trust Corp $1.6 billion SunTrust Banks $3.5 billion Broadway Financial Corp $9 million Washington Federal $200 million BB&T Corp $3.1 billion Provident Bancshares Corp $151 million Umpqua Holdings Corp $214 million Comerica $2.3 billion Regions Financial $3.5 billion Capital One Financial $3.6 billion First Horizon National $866 million Huntington Bancshares $1.4 billion KeyCorp $2.5 billion Valley National Bancorp $300 million Zions Bancorp $1.4 billion Marshall & Ilsley Corp $1.7 billion US Bancorp $6.6 billion TCF Financial $361 million First Niagara Financial $184 million HF Financial Corp $25 million Centerstate Banks Fla. $28 million First Community Bancshares,Inc. $42 million Western Alliance Bancorp. $140 million Webster Financial $400 million Pacific Capital Bancorp. $181 million Heritage Commerce Corp. $40 million Ameris Bancorp. $52 million Porter Bancorp $35 million Banner Corp $124 million Cascade Financial $39 million Columbia Banking $77 million Heritage Financial Corp. $24 million First PacTrust Bancorp. $19 million Severn Bancorp, Inc. $23 million Boston Private $154 million Associated Banc-Corp $525 million Trustmark Corp $215 million First Community Corp. $11 million Taylor Capital $105 million Nara Bancorp, Inc. $67 million Midwest Banc Holdings $85 million MB Financial, Inc. $20 million First Midest Bancorp $19 million United Community Banks $180 million Wesbanco Bank, Inc. $75 million Encore Bancshare, Inc. $34 million Manhattan Bancorp $1.7 million Iberiabank Corporation $90 million Eagle Bancorp, Inc. $38 million Sandy Spring Bancorp $83 million Coastal Banking Co, Inc. $10 million East West Bancorp. $307 million South Financial Group $347 million Great Southern Bancorp $58 million Cathay General Bancorp $258 million Southern Community Fin $43 million CVB Financial, Corp. $130 million First Defiance Fin $37 million First Financial Hldgs $65 million Superior Bancorp, Inc. $69 million Southwest Bancorp, Inc. $70 million Popular, Inc. $935 million Blue Valley Ban Corp $22 million Central Federal Corp $7.2 million Bank of Marin Bancorp $28 million Bank of North Carolina $31 million Central Bancorp, Inc. $10 million S.
