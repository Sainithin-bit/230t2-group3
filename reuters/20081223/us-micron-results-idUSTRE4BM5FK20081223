 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Memory chip maker Micron Technology Inc MU.N on Tuesday posted a wider quarterly loss than Wall Street had predicted, sending its stock down 14 percent in after-hours trade. 

 Excluding certain items, Micron lost $560 million, or 72 cents a share, compared with a loss of 43 cents a share expected by Wall Street, according to Reuters Estimates. The stock, which had closed 25 cents lower at $2.36 on the New York Stock Exchange, dropped to $2.02 in extended trading. "We knew the results were going to be challenging, given the market environment, but they were much worse than we expected," said Betsy Van Hees of Caris & Co. Micron declined to give any specific outlook for fiscal 2009, saying that any guidance was likely to be misleading given the uncertainties surrounding the industry. But an analyst who asked not to be identified said that reading between the lines, the current quarter looks bad for the company. The company cut its projections for capital expenditures again, this time to $650 to $750 million from $1 billion to $1.3 billion. Micron said there was very little room to make further cuts and that it and other companies were now approaching minimum capital expenditure levels. For the fiscal first quarter ended December 4, the company said its net loss widened to $706 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with a loss of $262 million, or 34 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue fell 8.7 percent to $1.402 billion, but it was better than the average analyst estimate of $1.33 billion. Micron makes DRAM, used as memory in computers, and flash memory, known as NAND, which is used in cameras and phones and holds its memory even without power. "Average selling prices for the company's memory products decreased 34 percent and 24 percent for DRAM and NAND Flash products, respectively," the company said. Micron's business is being hurt by excess capacity and falling demand. In October, the company said it would cut 15 percent of its workforce and slash production of NAND flash memory amid a weakening world economy.
