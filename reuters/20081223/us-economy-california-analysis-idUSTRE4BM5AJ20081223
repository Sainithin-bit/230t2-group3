 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Joel Kotkin, who made his mark spotting economic and political trends, is no longer bullish on California, his adopted home state, and that has many observers of the Golden State's affairs on edge. 

 Veteran Sacramento Bee columnist Dan Walters for one says a November essay by Kotkin was largely "spot-on" in identifying the forces rendering the world's eighth largest economy "functionally ungovernable" -- and that was before officials warned of a state budget gap of $40 billion this fiscal year and next and the state running out of cash in February. Kotkin in an essay titled "Sundown for California" in The American, a magazine published by the American Enterprise Institute, underscored the potential for a significantly diminished future for the most populous U.S. state. It "appears headed, if not for imminent disaster then toward an unanticipated, maddening, and largely unnecessary mediocrity," he wrote. That outlook is in sharp contrast to when Kotkin, now the Presidential Fellow in Urban Futures at Chapman University, co-wrote the book "California, Inc." 25 years ago. At the time he saw the state headed toward economic, political and cultural peaks. "For the next 20 years we were pretty accurate. We had our ups and downs but things were pretty dynamic," Kotkin told Reuters in an interview. "There was a lot of upward mobility. People got a piece of the 'California Dream.'" Today that dream of steady work, homeownership and top quality public works and schools, is coming undone for many. California's housing markets are among those most burdened by foreclosures. Its November jobless rate was 8.4 percent, one of the worst of any state. Much of its infrastructure is obsolete. Many of its school districts suffer high drop-out rates. Yet there is no sense of urgency in the state capital of Sacramento, where officials seemingly prefer to snipe at each other rather than tackle troubles head on, leaving the public with little confidence the state government works. "The distance between the political class in both parties and people on the ground is just astounding," Kotkin said. LOST CONSENSUS Partisan gamesmanship has replaced the political consensus that guided Democrats and Republicans alike in Sacramento for much of the 20th century and left behind schools, universities and public works among the nation's finest, said Kevin Starr, the preeminent historian of California. "They built the infrastructure on which California has lived for the past 50 years," Starr said. "These guys now are amateurs, total amateurs. ... They're unable to sit down and do politics and we pay them to do politics." Today lawmakers feel little pressure to compromise and routinely indulge in hyper-partisanship, as the current standoff over balancing the state budget underscores. "It is a "bad thing in itself but it's a symptom of what's wrong," Kotkin said. "You have a system that is just not working." The budget impasse boils down to Democrats not wanting to cut spending, which would hurt allies who receive state money, and Republicans refusing to raise taxes for fear that would fall on business allies. Their district lines are drawn to maintain partisan advantage so lawmakers can be inflexible. "They're willing to fight to the point where the state devolves into bankruptcy," said economist Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics. The atmosphere under the Capitol dome is "poisoned," added San Jose State University political scientist Larry Gerston. "Morale is so low that no one can find it." The Democrat-led legislature last week concluded a special session with an $18 billion budget package that included taxes in a complicated mix of measures intended to prevent anti-tax Republicans from blocking the effort. They cried foul and Republican Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said he would veto the package. Then he declared a fiscal emergency to call lawmakers into another special session and warned of furloughs and layoffs for state employees. If inaction on the budget persists and California is unable to pay its bills come February, or if Standard & Poor's Ratings Services follows through on a warning of a possible downgrade on nearly $47 billion in state debt, voters may simply take the state's finances into their own hands, Gerston said. California voters have a long history of passing ballot measures directly affecting -- often complicating -- how the state raises and spends money. In 1978 they approved Proposition 13, a landmark measure that limited property taxes and presaged a national taxpayer revolt. It also reduced the state's revenues from property taxes. Ten years later they approved Proposition 98, which requires a percentage of the state budget to be set aside for schools and for annual increases in education spending, which complicates budget writing. "Clearly if left to its own devices, the legislature is just going to stay stale-mated," Gerston said. "Then we will have to go around and around again." (Editing by Leslie Adler)
