 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Cessna Aircraft, the world's largest maker of corporate jets, plans to lay off 2,000 people -- about 13 percent of its work force -- by March, a spokesman said on Monday. 

 The cuts are in addition to the 2,200 layoffs announced by parent company Textron Inc ( TXT.N ) last month. Cessna spokesman Doug Oliver said the new move was the result of falling demand for light jets in the face of a deepening worldwide recession. "People taking delivery of new aircraft are canceling or delaying and new orders are slowing globally," Oliver said. Wichita, Kansas-based Cessna employs 15,000 people worldwide. Textron last month warned Wall Street that it expects to report a net loss for the fourth quarter as it drastically scales back its finance business.
