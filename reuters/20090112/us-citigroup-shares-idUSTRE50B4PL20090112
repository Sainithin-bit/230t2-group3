 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) shares fell more than 10 percent on Monday to their lowest level in nearly seven weeks after news that the bank might report a quarterly operating loss of at least $10 billion, as it considers combining its brokerage with that of Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). 

 Citing people familiar with the matter, The Wall Street Journal said the size of the quarterly loss could change. It excludes an estimated $4 billion gain from the recent sale of the bank's German retail banking business. Citigroup declined to comment. A $10 billion loss would cause Citigroup's full-year operating loss to be well in excess of $20 billion. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets is expected to report its quarterly results on Jan 22. The transaction combining Citigroup's Smith Barney brokerage with Morgan Stanley's brokerage would result in a joint venture run by Morgan Stanley. That bank would likely pay $2.5 billion in cash in exchange for a 51 percent stake in the venture, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. A pact is likely the middle of the week, the person said. In late morning trading, Citigroup shares were down 70 cents, or 10.4 percent, to $6.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. They traded as low as $5.75 on November 25, Reuters data show. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
