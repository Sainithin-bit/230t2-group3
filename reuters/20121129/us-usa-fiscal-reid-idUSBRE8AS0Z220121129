 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid on Thursday said Democrats are still waiting for a reasonable proposal from Republicans to resolve a stalemate over the "fiscal cliff" of tax hikes and spending cuts looming at year's end. 
 "We need a proposal from them," Reid told reporters. He made the comments shortly after U.S. House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican, emerged from a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, telling reporters he was disappointed in progress of the talks.
