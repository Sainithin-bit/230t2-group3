 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's main opposition party will vote against a second bailout for the debt-ridden country, unless the government changes current economic policy, its head Antonis Samaras said in an interview released on Saturday. 

 The Greek parliament passed two bills this week authorizing 28 billion euros ($39.7 billion) in new tax hikes and spending cuts and opening the way for the disbursement of the next tranche of emergency European Union/International Monetary Fund funding and for a second bailout. In an interview in Greek weekly Real News, Samaras, head of the conservative opposition New Democracy, said his party, which voted against the first bailout plan, would also oppose a second bailout if the ruling Socialist government did not ease policies he said only harmed an already stricken economy. "We will vote against it (the bailout), if they don't change the economic policy, which is a policy of suffocation," Samaras was quoted as saying. "We want to annihilate the deficit. We don't want to bring Greek people, the Greek middle class and Greek families to their knees." New Democracy defied pressure from European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to overcome political differences and back the package and its opposition could complicate implementation of the deeply unpopular measures. Samaras, who only agreed to back the 50-billion-euro privatisation element within the bailout package, reiterated Greece should renegotiate its five-year mid-term fiscal program, saying that the country needed a plan B. He also repeated a call for snap elections. "We need three things: an alternative plan, a different government with the credibility to implement it and a smooth transition to the alternative plan from the initial plan which has failed," Samaras said. Even within Prime Minister George Papandreou's PASOK party, which trails the conservative opposition in opinion polls, there was little confidence that the new measures would help in the long term. In an interview with Reuters on Friday, new Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos pledged to reform an inefficient tax system and put privatisation plans swiftly in action to get Greece back to growth.
