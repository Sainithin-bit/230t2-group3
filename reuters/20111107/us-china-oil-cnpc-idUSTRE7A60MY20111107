 BEIJING  (Reuters) - The Chinese government has named Jiang Jiemin, general manager of China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), as chairman of the state-owned oil and gas giant in a newly-established post, a company newspaper reported on Monday. 
 Deputy General Manager Zhou Jiping has become the new CNPC general manager and a board director, China Petroleum Daily said. Jiang is expected to be the chairman of listed PetroChina Co Ltd and Zhou the president. China is instituting a board system in its government-controlled firms in the name of building "modern state-owned enterprises with Chinese characteristics".
