 PARIS  (Reuters) - France's third-biggest listed bank, Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ), is to announce job cuts at its corporate and investment bank "in mid-November," French newspaper La Tribune reported on Monday. 
 Citing a union source, the article said employees were hearing a number of around 1,000 staff cuts but "nothing is fixed yet." The bank reports third-quarter results Thursday. A Credit Agricole investment bank spokesman was unavailable for comment. Larger rivals BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) are also expected to cut hundreds of jobs as banks shore up capital to better resist the euro zone's debt crisis.
