 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Boeing ( BA.N ) said its chief executive had not altered the latest delivery guidance on the 787 Dreamliner after a newspaper said he had expressed confidence in delivering the plane by end-year, as planned. Boeing last week said deliveries could slip into 2011 but that no decision had been taken. [ID:nN15224632] In a summary of an interview given to European Sunday newspapers by Boeing CEO Jim McNerney, released on Saturday, Germany's Welt am Sonntagsaid: "The Boeing chief was also confident that the first Dreamliner 787 can be, as announced, delivered by the end of 2010." 

 A Boeing spokesman clarified that McNerney had stuck to the same script on deliveries as the 787 general manager last week. "Mr Mcnerney made clear that the intention remains to deliver the first 787 before the end of the year, but he said that the flight test program is tight and that it is possible delivery could slip by a few weeks into January," Boeing spokesman Charlie Miller said on Saturday. "This is exactly what the head of the program (Scott Fancher) said last Thursday," he added.
