 FARNBOROUGH, England  (Reuters) - Emirates airline is set to place a $5 billion order for 20 Boeing ( BA.N ) 777 wide-body jets, aviation sources said on Saturday. 

 The order could be a key feature of the opening day of the July 19-25 Farnborough air show on Monday, when the Dubai-based airline is expected to hold a news conference. Boeing declined to comment. An order for 20 of the latest model of 777s, which seats 365 passengers, would be worth $5.4 billion at list prices. Emirates, the largest airline in the Arab world, placed an order for 32 Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A380s at the Berlin air show last month and said it was likely to order more aircraft soon.
