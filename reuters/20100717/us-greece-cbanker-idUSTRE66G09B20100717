 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's central bank chief said he expected the country's lenders to smoothly pass European Union stress tests to be published next week. 

 "My feeling is that things will go smoothly for the six Greek banks included in the sample," George Provopoulos, governor of the Bank of Greece, said in an interview published in newspaper Imerisia on Saturday. At the same time, Greece's banking sector needed to consolidate to better cope with economic crisis, Provopoulos added. "My view is that Greek banks must join forces to cope, from a more advantageous position, with a more adverse macroeconomic and financial environment in the next years," he said in the interview. A bid submitted this week by Piraeus Bank, Greece's fourth-largest, to take control of state-run ATEbank and Hellenic Postbank was a first step in this direction, Provopoulos said. "Mergers impose themselves... in the medium term," Provopoulos said. Greece's central bank chief said he was reasonably optimistic that the debt-laden government would manage to meet its deficit cut targets this year, helping the economy enter a virtuous circle from September. "On the spending and revenue side, there are legislated measures in the order of 2.5 percent of GDP, which will yield results in the second half of the year," Provopoulos said. "I can reasonably express satisfaction and optimism," he said. "I believe that, on the whole, things have taken their course and a virtuous circle begins to operate which will be much more visible from the coming autumn, as positive signs multiply." Earlier this month, Greece announced that the central government deficit shrank at an annual pace of 46 percent between January and June, boding well for efforts to narrow its general government gap to 8.1 percent of gross domestic product from 13.6 percent last year.
