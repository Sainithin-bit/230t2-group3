 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Combining Canada's stock exchanges with alternative trading system Alpha Group and the country's major clearing hub would benefit Canadian capital markets, the Maple Group consortium, which is making hostile takeover bid for stock exchange operator TMX Group, said on Monday. 

 The Maple Group -- made up of Canadian banks and other financial institutions -- took its $3.8 billion takeover bid for TMX, which operates the Toronto Stock Exchange, directly to TMX shareholders on Monday. It is trying to scupper a rival, friendly offer for TMX from the London Stock Exchange Group ahead of a June 30 vote on the LSE bid. Once it buys TMX, it plans to combine it with Alpha and clearing hub Clearing and Depository Services, which are both already largely controlled by the banks. Maple said its plan would benefit Canadian markets as it would result in an integrated trading and clearing exchange for equities, bonds, energy products and derivatives in both exchange-traded and over-the-counter markets. Persuading TMX shareholders that its offer can pass regulatory muster will be key to the success of the Maple Group bid as its plans have raised competition concerns. A combined TMX and Alpha would account for about 80 percent of Canadian stock trading by volume. In its official takeover circular, Maple sought to address shareholder concerns about the price it would be pay to combine Alpha and CDS with TMX. It said it will form a committee of its independent directors to oversee the process of evaluating the assets. On an investor conference call, Maple said that based on comparisons with other similar assets it believes CDS is worth roughly C$170 million ($173 million), while pegging the value of Alpha at somewhere between C$140 million and C$170 million. Maple said the committee will ensure that the Alpha and CDS transactions are fair to shareholders of Maple that do not already own a stake in either asset. It noted that investors with stakes in Alpha and CDS have indicated a preference for a cash bid for the assets but said the form of payment will be dependent on the talks with Maple's independent committee. The lack of clarity around the valuations of both Alpha and CDS has been one of the key concerns expressed by TMX investors, especially as some Maple investors own interests in both assets. Maple said that its investors that have stakes in the two assets have agreed to vote in favor of the transactions and to sell their respective ownership interests in Alpha and CDS. The group said it was not yet in a position to break out the size of the cost savings that the combination of Alpha and CDS with TMX would provide. Maple said it has set aside C$310 million under its debt commitment letter to help fund the Alpha and CDS acquisitions. (Reporting by Euan Rocha; editing by Peter Galloway)
