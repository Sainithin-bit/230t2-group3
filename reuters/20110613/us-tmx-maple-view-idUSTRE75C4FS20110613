 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Canada's Maple Group has taken a $3.8 billion (C$3.7 billion) takeover offer directly to TMX Group shareholders, asking shareholders to reject a rival bid from the London Stock Exchange Group. 

 Following are some reactions to the Maple Group takeover circular: MICHAEL SMEDLEY, CEO, MORGAN MEIGHEN & ASSOCIATES "I have consistently favored the Canadian offer on the basis of better value allowing Canadian investors still to participate in a great cash machine, and possibly introducing new benefits "Unless on the basis of extremely attractive payment by the London Exchange that would cause me to change my mind, I think there is too much involved here that attracts me to the Maple offer, including, for a change in these matters, the principles involved." THOMAS CALDWELL, CHAIRMAN, CALDWELL SECURITIES "The independence is critically important. I would rather see the exchange merge with London and be independently owned by a broad base of investors with separate governance. "There is a very attractive aspect to this London deal in that it does give Canadians a significant say in a bigger exchange." CHRIS DAMAS, INDEPENDENT ANALYST, TMX SHAREHOLDER "I prefer (Maple's) so far and definitely compared to the LSE all-paper offer. "But the Maple group is being stingy with their offer given the assets of the group are probably closer to a trillion with the addition of Manulife."
