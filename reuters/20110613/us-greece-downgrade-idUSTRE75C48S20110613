 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece said on Monday the move by Standard & Poor's to cut its rating to the lowest in the world overlooked intense deliberations at the European Union and the IMF to find a viable solution to its debt crisis. 

 "The (S&P) decision also overlooks the government's moves to avoid any problems relating to Greece's contractual obligations as well as the will of all Greeks to plan our future inside the euro zone," the finance ministry said in a statement after the rating action.
