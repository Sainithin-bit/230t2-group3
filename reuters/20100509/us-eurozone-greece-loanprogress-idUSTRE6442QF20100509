 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Euro zone governments are to provide Greece with 80 billion euros in three-year loans, while the International Monetary Fund will provide another 30 billion. 

 Different legal procedures in each of the 15 other euro zone countries and at the IMF mean not all players may be ready with cash at the same time. But the  European Union's executive European Commission said Greece would get the first funds before May 19, when it has to repay 8.5 billion euros of maturing debt, because by that time a critical mass of funds would be available. While no euro zone country can be forced to lend to Greece, no country can block others from lending either, the European Commission has said. Therefore a delay or even a parliamentary problem in one country does not stop the process in others. Below is an overview of how much donors would contribute, dependent on their shares in the capital of the European Central Bank, and the legal hurdles the loans face: IMF - up to 30 billion euros; the International Monetary Fund's executive board will meet on Sunday, May 9, to act on Greece's request for a $40 billion standby arrangement, a fund spokesman said on Tuesday. The IMF is fast-tracking financial aid for Greece. GERMANY - 22.33 billion euros. German President Horst Koehler signed into law a bill authorizing the country's contribution after both houses of parliament approved it on May 7, his office said. The move came despite widespread public opposition to the measure. A group of German academics have filed a challenge to Germany's aid package for Greece at the country's highest court and asked that no German loans should flow to the debt-stricken country before a ruling. The suit is thought to have little chance of success and unless the court orders that no loans be paid until it rules, which experts say is very unlikely, the loans can be paid out to Greece while the court ponders the issue. Separately, Germany's financial sector will contribute 8.1 billion euros ($10.87 billion) over three years . The private-sector financial institutions include Deutsche Bank, insurer Allianz and Munich RE. German banks and insurers had agreed to maintain existing credit lines to Greece and its financial institutions until May 2013 as well as to roll over 3.3 billion euros in credit lines which are set to expire. In a parallel step, German institutions agreed to provide the Greek state with up to 4.8 billion euros for bonds or other forms of finance to replace bonds which are set to come due by May 6, 2013. FRANCE - 16.77 billion euros. The French Senate approved France's contribution to the aid package as expected late on May 6, opening the way for the funds to be released in the coming days. France's lower house approved it early on May 4. ITALY - 14.74 billion euros. Italy's government approved a decree on May 7 authorizing a contribution to the aid package for Greece. The decree comes into force immediately, but will have to be approved by parliament within 60 days. There is no risk of parliament not approving it. SPAIN - 9.79 billion euros. The Spanish cabinet approved its contribution to the aid package on May 7. The decree law now will have to be approved in parliament. NETHERLANDS - 4.7 billion euros. The Dutch parliament approved this contribution on May 7. A majority of parties -- including the Christian Democrats, Labour, Liberals, Christian Union and Green Left -- rejected a motion to block the aid, giving the Dutch government the green light to release the aid in the next three years. Parliament is to discuss the law on May 7. Approval is needed from the both houses of parliament, though a majority of MPs have already said they would back the plan. BELGIUM - 2.86 billion euros. The Belgian government has already approved a text of a draft law, which a government spokeswoman said could be passed by the parliament relatively quickly. However, because of a new government crisis, other options may be explored, the spokeswoman said, without specifying what they were. Belgium expects to approve the disbursement of the money at the same time as other euro zone countries. AUSTRIA - 2.29 billion. Austria's finance minister and chancellor can approve up to 2 billion euros in loans to Greece without parliament's approval under a law enacted last year, at the time designed for Austria's part in European Union aid to eastern Europe. The first tranche of the Greek aid therefore does not need to pass parliament at all. To raise the 2 billion euro cap to cover Austria's 2.3 billion euro share of the 80 billion euros in euro zone aid for Greece, Austria's government has introduced a change of the law, which is due to pass parliament on May 19 or 20. PORTUGAL - 2.06 billion euros. Portugal's parliament approved on May 7 the country's loan to Greece. The law to lend to Greece was approved by the ruling Socialists and the opposition center-right Social Democrats. FINLAND - 1.48 billion euros. Parliament will vote on a bill on loans to Greece on May 12. There has been no indication from the majority 4-party coalition that the loan would not be approved. IRELAND - 1.31 billion euros. Ireland's participation requires national legislation and the government has approved the preparation of this legislation. SLOVAKIA - 820 million euros. Slovakia will sign the Greek support plan but only release its share of the aid after a parliamentary vote expected in July, Prime Minister Robert Fico said on May 7. "Slovakia has no intention to block other (euro zone) member states from (activating) the mechanism of bilateral loans," Fico told reporters. "I expect the parliament to vote after the (June) election, in July we can vote." SLOVENIA - 390 million euros. The aid is expected to be approved by parliament in late May or early June. The government had said all procedures needed to give aid would be finished by the end of June at the latest. The ruling coalition is expected to back the Greek aid legislation in parliament which should be sufficient even if opposition parties vote against it. LUXEMBOURG - 210 million euros. CYPRUS - 160 million euros MALTA - 70 million euros. (Reporting by euro zone bureaux, compiled by Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Ron Askew)
