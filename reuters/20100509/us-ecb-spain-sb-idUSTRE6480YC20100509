 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain needs to make difficult economic reforms to stimulate growth, European Central Bank Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said in an interview on Sunday. 

 "Measures taken so far can cover up some holes, but to grow you have to make long-term reforms, even if they are more difficult and costly," he said in an interview with ABC newspaper. He said Spain should end its system of inflation-linked wages to improve competitiveness. Spain has the highest unemployment in the euro zone at 20 percent. The government plans to announce a labor reform in May, but many are skeptical it will go far enough. "Spain needs profound reforms in order to create jobs," he said. When asked if Spain was in a worse situation than Greece, he replied that while the country had much lower public debt it must rein in its deficit. The country had also lost competitivity and that had increased unemployment. Spain had a public debt to GDP ratio around 55 percent in 2009, 20 percentage points below the EU average. However, its budget deficit rose to 11.2 percent in that year, and the government aims to cut that to 3 percent in 2013, something many economists doubt is possible given a weak growth outlook. Bini Smaghi also said that a euro zone debt crisis would only be worsened if a member was forced to leave the economic bloc. He also urged Spain to make reforms to its banking sector, something which is ongoing. (Reporting by Nigel Davies; Editing by Erica Billingham)
