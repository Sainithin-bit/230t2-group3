 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers are trying to reach agreement on a compromise 600-billion-euro ($805 billion) mechanism to prevent Greece's debt crisis causing turmoil in other euro zone states, EU sources said on Sunday. 

 They said no deal had been reached but the compromise being discussed included loan guarantees by euro zone countries worth 440 billion euros, a stabilization fund worth 60 billion euros and a 100 billion euro top-up of International Monetary Fund loans.
