 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union finance ministers promised to do everything to defend the euro against the "wolfpack" of the financial markets at talks on Sunday on emergency measures to stop Greece's debt crisis spreading. 

 But EU sources said a deal was proving elusive as Germany, which faces public opposition to bailouts, resisted the terms of a proposal for a larger-than-expected sum to be made available if states such as Spain or Portugal need help. President Barack Obama spoke to the German and French leaders by telephone to reinforce the need to calm jittery financial markets and ensure the global economy is not jolted by a sovereign debt crisis. The EU executive, the European Commission, presented a proposal to the finance ministers on a stabilization mechanism intended to provide a multi-billion-euro safety net for other euro zone countries with enlarged budget deficits and debt. "We now see ... wolfpack behaviors (on markets), and if we will not stop these packs, even if it is self-inflicted weakness, they will tear the weaker countries apart," Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg told reporters. Greece, with a budget deficit of 13.6-14.1 percent of gross domestic product in 2009 and debt of more than 115 percent of GDP, has secured a 110 billion euro ($148 billion) three-year loan package from the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund after its borrowing costs rose to unsustainable levels. The European Central Bank is also expected to play a role in the stabilization efforts, but it is not yet clear what. EU sources said ECB governors were discussing the crisis but no details were available. "The ECB is an independent institution of the European Union so the ECB should certainly play a role, but according to its rules and...political leaders should not influence the decisions of the ECB," Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said. COMMISSION PROPOSALS The European Commission is now asking the ministers to extend an existing aid mechanism for non-euro zone countries to nations in the single-currency bloc. EU sources said the Commission wanted an existing amount available under the mechanism, called the balance-of-payments facility, to be raised by 60 billion euros. The maximum available now is 50 billion euros. The 60 billion top-up would be guaranteed by all 27 EU states and loans paid out to any of them would carry conditions set by the IMF. Funds previously raised via the facility are rated AAA -- top investment grade -- by major credit rating agencies. As an extra measure for euro zone countries only, the Commission will propose a mechanism of intergovernmental loans, one source said. "The Commission has put on the table ... a proposal that is ambitious and comprehensive ... to enable the Union to borrow on the international markets but also looking beyond the community budget to bring member states into the mechanism," a European Commission official said. He said Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn were pushing hard in telephone discussions for a more far-reaching agreement that "goes beyond the community budget." Other EU sources said member states were under pressure now to guarantee much bigger sums because of concerns the figures being discussed would not be enough to appease markets. Economists estimate that if Portugal, Ireland and Spain eventually come to require similar three-year bailouts, the total cost could be 500 billion euros. A similar mechanism was successfully used in the cases of Latvia, Romania and Hungary after the pool of money available was increased to 50 billion euros last year. The ministers' meeting follows a summit of euro zone leaders on Friday, which asked for a European stabilization mechanism to be ready before markets open on Monday. Some economists said the move would cure the symptoms, rather than the disease. The Sunday talks were delayed further as German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, who had been due to attend, was admitted to a hospital in Brussels after reacting adversely to medicine. "He is currently under observation," Schaeuble's spokesman Michael Offer said in a statement. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere travelled to Brussels to lead the German delegation.
