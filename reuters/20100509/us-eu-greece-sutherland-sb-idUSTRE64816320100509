 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Greece won't default on its debt in the next three years if it complies with the "courageous" fiscal plan attached to its bailout package, Peter Sutherland, the chairman of Goldman Sachs' overseas arm, said. 

 European Union officials have been working over the weekend on the details of a financial support mechanism to prevent Greece's debt turmoil spreading to other euro zone strugglers especially Portugal and Spain. "There can't be a default by Greece over the next three years assuming they comply with what they say they're going to do," said Sutherland, a former European commissioner for Ireland, another highly indebted country on the euro zone's periphery. "They have a big mountain to climb. So have we," Sutherland told Irish public radio RTE in an interview recorded on Saturday and broadcast on Sunday. Sutherland, also a former chairman of oil major BP, said a break-up of the euro zone would be an "absolute disaster" but it wasn't on the cards, adding that Ireland's determined fiscal reforms had put it in a different league from Greece.
