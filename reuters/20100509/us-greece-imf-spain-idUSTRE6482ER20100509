 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is not in program talks with Portugal and Spain, a senior IMF official said Sunday, amid market concerns that the two countries may need financial help. 

 "There are no program negotiations occurring at this time with  either Portugal or Spain. There are no program negotiations underway at this time," IMF First Deputy Managing Director John Lipsky told a conference call with reporters after the IMF approved a 30 billion euro rescue loan for Greece.
