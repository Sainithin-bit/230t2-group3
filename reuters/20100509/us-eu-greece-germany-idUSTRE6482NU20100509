 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Germany wants the rest of the European Union to agree to limit any loan guarantees for debt-stricken euro zone states to a maximum of 500 billion euros ($671 billion), EU sources said on Sunday. 

 The sources said the executive European Commission wanted EU finance ministers to agree at talks in Brussels to much larger-than-expected sums to protect euro zone member states, but Germany was asking for a limit to be placed on the amount. (Reporting by  Ilona Wissenbach , editing by Dale Hudson)
