 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Sunday it would make about 5.5 billion euros available to Greece immediately and disburse a total of about 10 billion euros this year. 

 "Today's strong action by the IMF to support Greece will contribute to the broad international effort underway to help bring stability to the euro area and secure recovery in the global economy," the Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in a statement.
