 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The following are comments by European Union finance ministers and other officials on Sunday ahead of their meeting to agree on a mechanism aimed at preventing Greece's debt turmoil spreading to other countries. 

 FINNISH FINANCE MINISTER JYRKI KATAINEN "All the governments in the European Union, and especially within the euro zone, need to show a very strong commitment to consolidate the budgets." "Extreme turmoil in the markets has not been good for the euro zone, so now we have to do the measures that normalize the markets." SPANISH ECONOMY MINISTER ELENA SALGADO Asked what message the ministers would send to the markets: "The same messages that were sent by the heads of state and government when they met last Friday. So this is that we are going to defend the euro, that we think that we have to give more stability to our guarantee." BRITISH FINANCE MINISTER ALISTAIR DARLING "We need to show again today that by acting together we can stabilize the situation, we do not want to jeopardize the recovery that is slowly taking place. And we will play our part in that." "But when it comes to supporting the euro, obviously that is for the euro zone countries." FINNISH FINANCE MINISTER JYRKI KATAINEN Speaking at a news conference in Helsinki: "The situation in the financial markets has gone in a very bad direction, even though the Greek situation was brought under control." "Now we have to do everything we can to bring stability in time." "The alternative is still the same as when we talked about Greece: the threat of a serious bank crisis." Should a banking crisis occur: "We know what would happen. The bank crisis would not be one of a few countries, rather it would lead to a full recession in Europe." "Today and tonight we will seek a decision on how we can stabilize the European economy and banking market and avoid the worst. There are possibilities to do this, but it will be very tough to find a solution. Today we will do everything possible."
