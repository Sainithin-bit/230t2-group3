 By Marton Dunai SZEGED, Hungary  (Reuters) - Hungary's way to recovery is not through further monetary loosening, but instead through a speedy repayment of its high public debt and ensuring price stability, a top central banker said on Saturday. 

 "Contrary to those who see further interest rate cuts as the way to economic recovery, the central bank must reduce long-term interest rates," National Bank of Hungary Vice Governor Ferenc Karvalits told a business forum. "We can ensure that through anchoring inflation expectations and preserving the credibility of the inflation target," he said. "The most important task of the central bank continues to be ensuring price and financial stability." He also said that monetary easing was not an option the bank could consider anyway. "Hungary has no room for significant fiscal and monetary loosening. Fiscal policy is hindered by (the level of) state debt, while monetary policy by uncertain longer-term inflation outlook and the currency composition of the outstanding debt." The central bank on Monday left the key interest rate unchanged for the fifth time in a row at a record low of 5.25 percent. DEBT SERVICE KEY Karvalits warned that the level of state debt meant a constant risk in refinancing in the current global market environment. "Reducing the risk assessment must mean reducing the state debt level," he said. "It must be on track toward the levels specified in the Maastricht criteria within a foreseeable time." He said that any delay in setting public debt on a declining path would ultimately worsen the recovery outlook. "Hungary's fiscal track record is exceedingly bad. The country practically continuously fails to meet the conditions of the Stability and Growth Pact. Therefore for us, there is no grace period. Putting off the reduction of the debt stock would result in the current high-risk premiums stabilizing." "High-risk premia mean higher (market) interest rates, which would hinder investments and in the longer term worsen growth prospects." (Reporting by Marton Dunai, editing by Jane Baird)
