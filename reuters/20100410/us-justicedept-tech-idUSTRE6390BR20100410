 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether some of the biggest technology companies agreed not to recruit each others' employees, violating antitrust laws, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 The investigation is looking into hiring practices at companies including Apple Inc, Google Inc, IAC/InterActiveCorp, International Business Machines and Intel Corp, the newspaper reported. In particular, the Justice Department is investigating whether computer engineers and other workers have missed opportunities to move to better-paying jobs because of these companies' hiring practices, the WSJ said, citing people familiar with the matter. The antitrust division of the Justice Department has not yet decided how or whether to challenge the hiring practices, these people told the WSJ. Top officials from the department will meet with about a dozen companies this week and next as part of its investigation, the newspaper reported. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The companies named did not immediately respond to emails and voice messages seeking comment.
