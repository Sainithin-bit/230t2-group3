 LONDON  (Reuters) - British mortgage lender Northern Rock Plc NRK.L said the amount of emergency funding it is seeking from the Bank of England "is clearly a substantial amount" and there was no specific cap on its size. 

 "I'm not able to tell you the (interest) rate or the size other than it is clearly substantial," Northern Rock CEO Adam Applegarth told reporters on a conference call. Applegarth said he could not predict how long the liquidity squeeze would last, but said he expected the BoE emergency funding function to last "a sufficient duration to see us through the liquidity squeeze."
