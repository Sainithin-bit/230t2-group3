 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Online brokerage TD Ameritrade Holding Corp ( AMTD.O ) said on Friday it successfully removed unauthorized code from its systems that had allowed access to an internal database. 

 The company said it found no evidence of identity theft. It said it discovered the intrusion in an internal investigation of stock-related spam, or unwanted e-mail. (Reporting by  Anupreeta Das )
