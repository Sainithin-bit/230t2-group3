 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), the world's 
biggest auto maker, plans to build a new car plant in Japan to 
revamp its production facilities, domestic media reported on 
Friday. 

  The plant would cost up to 80 billion yen ($695 million), 
have an initial annual production capacity of 100,000 vehicles 
and come on line in 2010, the Nikkei business daily said.  A separate report by the Nikkan Kogyo newspaper said Toyota 
would invest about 100 billion yen ($870 million). The plant 
would have a capacity of 150,000 to 200,000 units and start 
operations in 2009.  It would be Toyota's first new domestic assembly plant 
since 1992.  Toyota spokeswoman Shiori Hashimoto said the automaker was 
always looking to improve its production capabilities but that 
it had no specific plan to build another assembly factory on 
its home turf.  Toyota sold a record 8.8 million vehicles last year, 
overtaking General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) which had held the title 
of world's largest auto maker for the previous 75 years.  The Japanese giant is cranking up its share of sales in 
mature markets in North America, Europe and at home with 
fuel-efficient models such as the Prius hybrid and RAV4 
crossover, and is rapidly expanding in markets such as China 
and Russia.  This year it expects group sales of 9.3 million vehicles 
and aims to top the 10 million mark in 2009.  The Nikkei said, however, the new plant was being built to 
replace an older factory that would close and that Toyota's 
overall production capacity would not increase.  The Nikkan Kogyo said the new plant would allow Toyota to 
idle assembly lines at existing plants so that they could be 
upgraded.  The plant is likely to be located in northern Japan, the 
papers said.  The Nikkei has also reported that Toyota's main auto parts 
maker, Denso Corp ( 6902.T ), will build a plant on the northern 
island of Hokkaido and that truck maker Isuzu Motors Ltd 
( 7202.T ) will build a diesel engine plant there to supply 
Toyota.  Toyota currently has six assembly plants in Japan and 40 
overseas.  Its shares ended up 2.4 percent at 6,530 yen, in line with 
the auto subindex .ITEQP.T.
