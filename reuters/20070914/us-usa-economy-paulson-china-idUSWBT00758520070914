 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Friday he was "impatient with the pace of change in China" but warned Congress that trade sanctions could backfire. 

 "Legislation that would impose unilateral, punitive trade sanctions isn't the answer," Paulson said in Chicago while visiting Atlas Material Testing Technology, a small manufacturing firm. "I don't want to start a trade war," he added. "Keeping our economic relationship (with China) on an even keel is critical -- maintaining and building trade, and also working to persuade the Chinese to reform their own economy more quickly, because the health of their economy affects the health of the global economy," Paulson said. Paulson termed the U.S. economy "healthy" with unemployment low and real wages rising. He called the global economy "the strongest ... I've seen in my business lifetime." Paulson urged Congress to quickly approve four free-trade agreements currently pending, with Peru, Panama, Colombia and South Korea.
