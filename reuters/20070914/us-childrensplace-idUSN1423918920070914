 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc ( PLCE.O ) said on Friday it was unable to file its most recent quarterly report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission because it is reviewing policy violations by two executives. 

 In an SEC filing, the children's apparel retailer said it did not expect the violations to result in a material change to its previously reported results. However, it said its board of directors needs to determine what actions to take before filing the report. "This delay could not be eliminated by the company without unreasonable effort and expense," the filing said. In addition to the second-quarter report, Children's Place has yet to file its three previous quarterly reports and its annual report for the year ended in February. The other delays were prompted by a review of the company's historical stock options practices. Last month, Children's Place warned that it might not file delinquent financial statements by its promised timeline of the end of August. At the time, the company said its internal policies and procedures had been violated by two employees -- one who was a "named executive officer" and one who was not. It did not identify either. The company said it expected its board to take remedial actions against the violators, but added that they would not be fired.
