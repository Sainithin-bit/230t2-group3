 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co DJ.N and its main labor union are close to a contract agreement for reporters and other employees at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, a union organizer said on Friday. 

 The company's agreement with the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees, which covers about 2,000 Dow Jones employees, originally expired Jan 31,2007, but was extended to the end of March 2007. The union and Dow Jones have not set a date for another meeting, and likely will work out remaining differences through phone calls and e-mails, said Tim Martell, an organizer for the Independent Association of Publishers' Employees. The New York Times reported on Friday that the union's board may be ready soon to endorse a deal and schedule a vote by the membership, the report said. Martell confirmed the Times's report. He declined to comment on the remaining differences, but said "we're talking about pennies on the table at this point." The union has been arguing against a proposed increase in medical coverage premiums. It also is seeking a higher pay raise. "It's fair to say that we're not discussing either issue any longer," Martell said. A Dow Jones spokeswoman was not immediately available for comment. Earlier this year, News Corp NWSa.N sealed a $5.6 billion deal to buy Dow Jones. On Wednesday, News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch made his first visit to The Wall Street Journal newsroom since the deal was reached and met with top editors.
