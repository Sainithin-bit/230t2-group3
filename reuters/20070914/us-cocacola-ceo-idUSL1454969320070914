 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola's ( KO.N ) CEO Neville Isdell indicated he would stay on at the helm of the global drinks group after he turns 65 next year, the Financial Times reported on Friday. 

 "There is no set date (for retiring). I don't think age is a factor. Look at the age of the people who are running today for president," Isdell told the newspaper in an interview. "There's a new era here. The 65 age thing is out of date," he said. Isdell was called out of retirement in 2004 to revive Coca-Cola's fortunes.
