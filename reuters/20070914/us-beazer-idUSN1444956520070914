 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Builder Beazer Homes USA Inc ( BZH.N ) said on Friday that it had asked a federal court for a preliminary injunction ordering debt trustees to withdraw default notices. 

 The company also asked the U.S. District Court in Atlanta to bar the trustees from taking any steps to speed up seeking payments due under its senior notes because of delays in filing quarterly reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Beazer disclosed the news in a filing with the SEC. The company, whose mortgage unit is the subject of a federal investigation, said on Monday that it had received a notice of default from the trustees of one series of its convertible notes and that it had asked the court to stop the trustees' action. It was the second time in less than a week that U.S. Bank National Association had sent Beazer a notice of default. Both notices allow the company 60 days to comply with the trustees' demands for it to file its fiscal third-quarter report with the SEC. On September 7, Beazer said it had received a notice of default on bonds worth about $1.3 billion. Although Beazer released its unaudited results for the period ended June 30, it has not filed its audited statement with the SEC. The company has said it delayed the filing after discovering that its former chief accounting officer may have booked some liabilities in the wrong accounting periods. Beazer has said its bond covenants do not include a deadline for filing its quarterly statements with the SEC. The covenants do require Beazer to provide bondholders with information 15 days after it files with the SEC. An analyst with Moody's Investor Services said Monday that bankruptcy was a possibility for Beazer, but it was more likely that the two sides would reach an agreement giving the company more time and the bondholders an additional fee.
