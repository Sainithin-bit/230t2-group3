 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales at retailers rose a smaller-than-expected 0.3 percent in August and they recorded the biggest decline in almost a year when car sales were stripped out, a government report showed on Friday. 

 Excluding motor vehicles and parts, retail sales fell 0.4 percent last month, the sharpest drop since September 2006, the Commerce Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting sales to gain 0.4 percent and to rise 0.2 percent when cars and parts were stripped out. Retail sales excluding cars, parts and gasoline, fell 0.1 percent, the steepest decline since April. So-called core retail sales -- which exclude cars, gasoline and building materials -- were unchanged in August after a 0.8 percent gain in July. Purchases of motor vehicles and parts, which make up around one-fifth of all sales, rose 2.8 percent, the biggest rise since July of last year. Sales fell 2.4 percent at gas stations. The August sales report showed declines from a range of other retailers. For example, clothing store sales slipped 0.1 percent, building materials and garden supply store sales fell 1.0 percent, and department store sales dropped 0.2 percent. Sales at food and beverage stores held steady in August.
