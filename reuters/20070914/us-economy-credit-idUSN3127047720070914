 NEW YORK/LONDON  (Reuters) - The Bank of England on Friday bailed out Britain's biggest casualty in the unfolding global credit crunch, and the spreading turmoil threatened to take a bite out of profits at the world's largest brokerage. 

 In London, Britain's central bank stepped in to rescue troubled lender Northern Rock NRK.L, the first time the bank of England has acted as lender of last resort in this way since it won independent control of interest rate policy in 1997. In New York, Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N warned that shaky credit markets had forced it to reduce the value of securities linked to risky subprime mortgages and other products, a move that could hurt third-quarter profit. U.S. subprime borrowers with shaky credit have recorded higher delinquencies and foreclosures in recent months. Foreclosures are expected to climb as low early payments on those loans reset, or give way to higher interest rates. Signs of distress continued in the U.S. housing market, the source of global credit anxieties, with upscale home builder Hovnanian Enterprises Inc ( HOV.N ) announcing a weekend "Deal of the Century" sale, which will cut prices by up to $100,000. "It's not going to give you a shot in the arm for your brand but it's a way to generate cash," Standard & Poor's equity analyst Ken Leon said. "... Hovnanian decided they need to sell at least 1,000 homes this weekend." In a new sign that buyout financing was freeing up, First Data Corp FDC.N and its leading bankers will meet investors on Monday to sell a $5 billion term loan to finance its $26 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co KKR.UL, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters Loan Pricing Corp. Still, the loan will be sold at 96 cents on the dollar. DIFFERING VIEWS Meanwhile, policymakers differed over the best way to restore liquidity to troubled money markets. Most major central banks have held off from raising benchmark rates as the usual heavy flows of interbank lending have dried up, driving up market interest rates. China, however, raised key rates on Friday for the fifth time this year, to curb inflation, while the Swiss National Bank poured more cheap funding into the short-term lending market a day after raising its key interest rate target. European Central Bank policymaker Yves Mersch ruled out cutting the bank's emergency lending rate unless conditions on euro zone credit markets get much worse. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its equivalent, the discount rate, on August 17. The U.S. government bond market grew cautious ahead of next week's Fed rate policy meeting. The U.S. central bank is widely expected to lower its federal funds rate for the first time in four years, though hopes of a large cut have been diminishing. BANKS WARY The recent credit turmoil has made banks wary of lending to each other for fear of exposure to high-risk debt which has been widely repackaged and used as collateral to raise funds. Northern Rock's woes dealt a further blow to the UK covered bonds market, which deals in a form of the asset-backed debt which banks have become loath to trade. Market sources said market makers suspended trading in covered bonds on Friday. European policymakers meeting in Portugal were keen not to overstate the implications of the liquidity crisis for growth, but in Germany, where two banks have needed bailouts, Economy Minister Michael Glos said the turbulence was far from over. "Now we must do everything to make sure the crisis does not spill over into the real economy," Glos told parliament. British authorities said Northern Rock had a good-quality loan book and was not at risk of insolvency, meeting the Bank of England's criteria for assistance. "A lot of reassurance can be gained from the statement from the Bank of England," said Irish finance minister Brian Cowen. Some financial institutions have criticized the Bank of England for its hands-off response to the market crisis, and a German newspaper said British banks were borrowing unusually large amounts from the European Central Bank because of the BoE's reluctance to lend at non-penal rates. Canada's central bank governor was quoted on Friday as casting doubt on how far the ECB could restore confidence by pumping liquidity into log-jammed credit markets. "I'm not sure practically whether it would do anything," David Dodge told the Financial Times, referring to the ECB's recent issuing of billions of euros in three-month money. However, there were signs money markets were stabilizing. London interbank offered rates for overnight dollar deposits were at their lowest in a month and three-month rates continued their week-long slide from 6-1/2-year highs. However, high volumes of commercial paper, short-term debt used to fund longer term investments, are due to be refinanced on Monday, making this a critical time for markets.
