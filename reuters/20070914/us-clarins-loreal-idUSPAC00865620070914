 PARIS  (Reuters) - The managing director of cosmetics group Clarins CLRP.PA said on Friday that there were no talks underway with larger rival L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ), but that his company was discussing several possible small acquisition targets. 

 "There is no talks, there is nothing," Olivier Courtin told Reuters on the sidelines of a Clarins news conference when asked about market talk of a L'Oreal tie-up. He said during the conference that Clarins had identified several small targets and that there were ongoing discussions. Shares in Clarins jumped 8.5 percent on Wednesday on renewed speculation L'Oreal could be interested in buying Clarins.
