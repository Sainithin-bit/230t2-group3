 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AnnTaylor Stores Corp ( ANN.N ) will roll out a high-end fashion line in 24 of its top stores next week and make it available on its Web site in late September or early October, a spokeswoman said on Friday. 

 The line, called Collection, will be 40 percent more expensive than the company's usual merchandise, on average, and includes about 50 items, said spokeswoman Maria Sceppaguercio. AnnTaylor is also launching a line of beauty products and a new chain that will target baby boomers. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  and  Martinne Geller )
