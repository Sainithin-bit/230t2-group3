 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union's deadline for reaching a tentative deal with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) is 11:59 p.m. EDT on Friday, September 14, the union's vice president said in an e-mail to members on Thursday. 

 "We are continuing to meet with the corporation and expect to put in long hours between now and the deadline," Rapson said in the e-mail, which also told union members that GM had been singled out as the lead company and the potential 'target' for a strike. "There is still much to be done and difficult issues to tackle," Rapson said in the email. "We are fully focused on reaching a tentative agreement that meets the needs of our active and retired members," he added. The e-mail was made available to Reuters by a source who asked not to be named. Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) and Chrysler LLC have extended their current labor contract with the union. The contracts were scheduled to expire Friday. All three automakers are in talks with the union to replace a four-year labor contract. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty )
