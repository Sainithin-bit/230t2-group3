 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ) is seeking $1 billion to $1.5 billion for its Godiva Chocolatier division, Bloomberg News reported on its Website on Friday, citing two people with direct knowledge of the sale. 

 Financial information about the unit will be sent to potential buyers later this month, the report said. Campbell said last month it was exploring alternatives for Godiva, including selling the well-known luxury brand. Analysts have said Godiva could attract a price of more than $1 billion. A Campbell spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
