 CAMBRIDGE  (Reuters) - News Corp's NWSa.N president and chief operating officer said on Friday he expected to have contentious negotiations with Apple ( AAPL.O ) over showing its television programs on iTunes. 

 "We have a pretty limited relationship with Apple and we'll see how it goes," Peter Chernin told the UK's Royal Television Society convention. "I assume it will be prickly and dicey and contentious like all negotiations are and like all negotiations should be." Chernin said News Corp currently licensed some TV shows to be sold through iTunes but not movies. A source familiar with the matter has told Reuters that News Corp's contract with Apple is not up for renewal discussions at any time soon. NBC Universal said in August it did not intend to renew its contract to sell television shows on iTunes although the two sides are still in talks, and analysts expect Apple to face a tougher time in filling its iTunes store with shows and movies.
