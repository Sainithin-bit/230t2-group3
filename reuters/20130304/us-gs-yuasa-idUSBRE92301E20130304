 TOKYO  (Reuters) - GS Yuasa Corp ( 6674.T ), the Japanese maker of lithium-ion battery cells used in Boeing Co's ( BA.N ) 787 Dreamliner, said it is working closely with the U.S. company, lead battery contractor Thales SA ( TCFP.PA ) of France and regulators to get the 787 back into the air. 
 Its statement comes after a report in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday said the company disagreed with Boeing about what should be included in a package of measures aimed at getting the airliner back in the air. "Workers involved in design, production and quality control are working 24 hours a day using all their technical skill and knowledge to uncover the cause and make the battery safer," GS Yuasa said. One battery caught fire onboard a Japan Airlines Co ( 9201.T ) plane in Boston while another forced an All Nippon Airways Co ( 9202.T ) plane to make an emergency landing in western Japan in January, prompting regulators in the U.S., Japan and elsewhere to ground all 50 Dreamliners in operation.
