 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Volkswagen's ( VOWG_p.DE ) Audi luxury division suffered a clear drop in February vehicle sales, a figure partially distorted by a statistical effect, Chief Executive Rupert Stadler said on Monday. 
 Deliveries were "clearly lower" than in January when sales surged 16.3 percent to 111,750 cars as Chinese New Year festivities took place last month, Stadler told Reuters at the Geneva auto show. VW's flagship luxury brand still managed a "single-digit" increase in percentage terms, the CEO said, without being more specific. (Reporting by Andreas Cremer; editing by  Edward Taylor )
