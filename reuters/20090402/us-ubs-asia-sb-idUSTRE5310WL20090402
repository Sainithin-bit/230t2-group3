 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) has named Stephen Gore as head of Asia mergers and acquisitions and corporate finance, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters, in the latest changes at the top of its investment banking business in the region. 

 Gore, who for the past two years has headed financial sponsors coverage for UBS in Asia, replaces Matthew Hanning, who was recently named joint head of Asia investment banking. Hanning and fellow M&A banker David Chin became joint heads for UBS' Asia investment banking business last month after veteran banker Rob Rankin left the firm after heading its regional investment banking franchise since 2003. UBS also appointed Saurabh Beniwal as head of technology, media and telecoms for Asia, the memo said. Beniwal was previously head of the Asian technology group. UBS is among the banks hardest hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, but its Asia investment banking business has been a comparatively strong performer, especially in equities. UBS has held top spot in the Asia-Pacific ex-Japan equity capital markets league tables since 2005 and is in first place thus far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. Its M&A business, however, ranks 8th so far this year after finishing last year in fifth place and in the top spot in 2007, according to Thomson Reuters data. Overall investment banking business is down in Asia and globally this year, and UBS and its rivals have shed thousands of jobs in the ongoing downturn.
