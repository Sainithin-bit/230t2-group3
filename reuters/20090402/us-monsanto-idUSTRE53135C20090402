 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - Monsanto Co ( MON.N ), the world's biggest seed company, posted better-than-expected profit on Thursday as revenue increased in its key corn and soybean seed businesses and it benefited from a low tax rate. 

 Chief Executive Hugh Grant said the company saw "unprecedented economic uncertainty globally," but still enjoyed demand from farmers for its seed technology. "We've stayed on course because we stayed focused," Grant said on a conference call. Monsanto said net income fell to $1.09 billion, or $1.97 a share, in the second quarter ended on February 28 from $1.13 billion, or $2.02 a share, a year earlier. The results include a charge in the latest quarter from the company's acquisition of a sugar cane breeding and technology company in Brazil and a year-earlier gain. Excluding items, earnings rose to $2.16 a share from $1.77. Analysts on average were expecting $2.07. Results included a tax benefit of about 9 cents a share. Net sales rose 8 percent to $4 billion. Monsanto shares rose as much as 5 percent after the earnings release, but by late morning, they had pulled back from their earlier highs. Soleil Securities analyst Mark Gulley said the company benefited from several variables, including the tax rate, but pure fundamentals were strong. "Corn and soy remain the foundation of the company, and that continues to do well," said Gulley, who has a "buy" rating on the shares. Quarterly revenue jumped in both in the U.S. branded corn seed and traits business and U.S. soybean seed and traits business, although there were fewer planted acres for corn in Brazil because of drought conditions. Seed and genomics sales rose 20 percent to $3 billion, while sales of Roundup and other herbicides dropped 21 percent. Last year, U.S. volume of the Roundup herbicide was up in the second quarter ahead of an anticipated price increase, but this year sales returned to more historical patterns, company officials said. This year will probably mark the peak for Monsanto's Roundup business, executives reiterated, with revenue and profit increasingly driven by seeds and traits. "It is not all smooth sailing from here on out," said Morningstar analyst Ben Johnson. "We are going to see a bit of a reset from the Roundup segment." Still, he said, Monsanto was well positioned to take advantage of the relative strength of the agricultural industry. Monsanto forecast single-digit percentage earnings growth for the third quarter and a loss for the fourth quarter. The company said it expected full-year net income of $4.23 to $4.33 per share. Excluding items, it continued to forecast $4.40 to $4.50, while analysts were expecting $4.72. Shares of Monsanto were up 0.3 percent at $82 on the New York Stock Exchange.
