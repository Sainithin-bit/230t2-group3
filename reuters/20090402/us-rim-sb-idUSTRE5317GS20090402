 TORONTO  (Reuters) - BlackBerry maker Research In Motion posted a surprisingly strong quarterly earnings report on Thursday and offered a rosy outlook that suggests it will continue to grow despite a global economic slowdown. 

 The results, which also revealed RIM now has a total of 25 million BlackBerry subscribers, sent the company's shares soaring about 17 percent in after-hours trade. COMMENTARY: DUNCAN STEWART, ANALYST AT DSAM CONSULTING, TORONTO "This is wildly better than people were looking for." ... "Getting improvement in both margin and growth at the same is a rare thing in the field of technology." PETER MISEK, ANALYST AT CANACCORD ADAMS, TORONTO "They are crushing it." "Not only are they holding up, but it's clear they're gaining market share." SAMUEL WILSON, ANALYST AT MP SECURITIES, SAN FRANCISCO "The results were over the top. They guided up for the May quarter, so I would say the results were very solid." "This is all about product cycle. In the summer of last year, they were devoid of new products and coming into this quarter they have the Bold, Storm and the new Curve all hitting at the same time." SHAW WU, ANALYST AT KAUFMAN BROS., SAN FRANCISCO "The results were phenomenal, this is in light of definitely some disappointment over the last two quarters."
