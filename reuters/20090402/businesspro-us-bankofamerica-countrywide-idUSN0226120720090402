 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Delaware judge rejected Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) effort to settle a shareholder lawsuit over its 2008 purchase of mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp, saying the settlement would wrongly scuttle potential fraud claims. 

 The settlement would have given investors more disclosures about the purchase, which was valued at $2.5 billion when it closed last July 1, down from an original $4.1 billion. But Delaware Chancery Court Judge John Noble concluded on Tuesday that the settlement would have improperly freed Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America from claims raised by hedge fund SRM Global Fund LP, which once owned more than 8 percent of Countrywide's shares. Run by British investor and former UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) trader Jon Wood, SRM alleged that it lost $80 million by holding onto its Countrywide shares following upbeat statements by Bank of America Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis on January 14, 2008, three days after the purchase was announced. According to the opinion, Lewis at the time dismissed rumors of an impending Countrywide bankruptcy, and said the mortgage lender "had a very impressive liquidity plan." Noble concluded that there was "precious little doubt" that the ultimate purchase price for Countrywide was "anything other than at least fair," given the absence of evidence that anyone else was interested in buying the mortgage lender. He nevertheless found that SRM had "uniquely individual" claims for money damages that were not covered by the proposed settlement. The judge suggested either that investors be allowed to opt out of the settlement or file fraud claims based on Lewis' statements, or that efforts to settle be abandoned. Bank of America spokeswoman Shirley Norton said the bank is reviewing its options and was hopeful the settlement would be approved. Dawn Schneider, a spokeswoman for SRM's lawyers Boies, Schiller & Flexner LLP, declined to comment. Shares of Bank of America closed Thursday up 2.7 percent cents at $7.24 on the New York Stock Exchange. The case is In re Countrywide Corp. Shareholders Litigation, Delaware Chancery Court (Wilmington), No. 3464. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
