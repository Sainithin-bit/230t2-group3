 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Even after taking $45 billion of taxpayer money, Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) still needs to raise another $2 billion to $6 billion to shore up its thin capital base, said a shareholder seeking to replace Kenneth Lewis as the bank's chairman. 

 Jonathan Finger said Bank of America is not in danger of failing, but it needs to raise more money after write-downs and credit losses and it should consider selling assets or shrinking its balance sheet. He also said the bank's recent acquisitions of Merrill Lynch & Co and Countrywide Financial Corp will prove less successful than Lewis expects. "We just don't think they have the core earnings power that they think they do," Finger said. Finger's family controls about 1.1 million Bank of America shares, and is demanding that the largest U.S. bank install an independent director as chairman to replace Lewis, who has been chief executive since 2001. A vote is expected at the bank's April 29 annual meeting. Lewis, in an interview with CNBC television earlier Thursday, said Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America has a strong "Tier-1" capital base, fortified by the $45 billion of preferred shares sold to the government. But more analysts now look at banks' ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets as a more accurate measure of the ability to cover losses and Finger said this is where Bank of America is weak. "They probably need to raise somewhere between $2 and $6 billion to get their tangible common equity ratio up over 3 percent," he said. Many analysts prefer a ratio twice as high. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's last month lowered credit ratings for Bank of America, citing higher pressure on earnings as the economy weakens. In the fourth quarter, the bank had its first quarterly loss in 17 years. CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Bank of America made two large acquisitions in the last year -- brokerage Merrill Lynch and mortgage lender Countrywide -- that have deepened its exposure to the debt securities and troubled mortgages that have driven losses across Wall Street. Lewis said he expects over the next few years for these takeovers to be "two of the best acquisitions we've ever made." Finger cast doubt on this, saying the earnings power of both companies is shrinking as banks have tightened lending standards and consumer appetite for new loans declines. Jonathan Finger co-manages with his father Jerry Finger a Houston investment firm called Finger Interests, which primarily manages the family's capital. Jerry Finger founded Houston commercial bank Charter Bancshares, which merged with Bank of America predecessor NationsBank in 1996. The campaign is attracting support from large institutional shareholders, Jonathan Finger said. "We'd like them to first acknowledge that they've made mistakes with regard to corporate governance, that they did not protect shareholder value and that they're going to take some concrete actions," he said. The Fingers are also calling for shareholders to reject the reelection of two directors, lead director O. Temple Sloan and Jackie Ward, chairwoman of the bank's asset-quality committee.
