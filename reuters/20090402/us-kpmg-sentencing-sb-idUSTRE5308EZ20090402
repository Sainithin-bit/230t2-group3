 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former KPMG KPMG.UL manager convicted of selling improper tax shelters was sentenced on Wednesday to more than 10 years in prison and a former tax partner at the firm received a sentence of more than eight years. 

 Former KPMG tax partner Robert Pfaff and former senior tax manager John Larson were convicted by a federal jury last December on several counts for evading taxes through a vehicle known as a BLIPS tax shelter. Larson was sentenced to 121 months and ordered to pay a fine of $6 million by Judge Lewis Kaplan in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on Wednesday and Pfaff to 97 months and a fine of $3 million. A third person convicted in the case, Raymond Ruble, a former partner at law firm Sidley Austin, was sentenced to six years and six months. Upon handing down the sentence, Kaplan called the men's behavior "extremely offensive" and said their fraudulent tax shelter scheme, which targeted clients who earned more than $20 million a year, was "a brazen act." "These defendants knew they were on the wrong side of the line," he said, adding later they had cooked up "this mass-produced scheme to cheat the government out of taxes for the purposes of enriching themselves." The losses due to the BLIPS scheme were estimated at more than $100 million. Larson, 57, and Pfaff, 58, were immediately remanded into custody but may later be granted bail pending an appeal of their convictions. Ruble was granted bail pending his appeal. After a two-month trial, Larson and Pfaff were convicted on 12 counts of tax evasion and Ruble on 10 counts of tax evasion. The jury acquitted former KPMG tax partner David Greenberg. The case was once touted as the largest criminal tax prosecution when the charges were filed in 2005, but it became much smaller after Judge Kaplan dismissed charges against 13 former KPMG executives, ruling that the government interfered with their right to counsel. During sentencing, prosecutors argued Pfaff and Larson should have received as much as 24 years imprisonment under 2008 guidelines, which increased some of the possible penalties for white-collar crimes previously established in 2000. Larson's lawyer Steven Bauer said his client was targeted by overzealous prosecutors looking for a scapegoat. "He was not trying to pull the wool over anyone's eyes," he said. None of the men admitted responsibility. Pfaff told the judge that he cherished his country and said he was not a risk of fleeing if granted bail. At the trial, the government argued that between 1996 and 2005 the defendants put together tax shelters known as FLIP, OPIS, BLIPS and SOS that were designed to generate phony tax losses. But defense lawyers argued that their clients acted with good faith in their dealings. KPMG KPMG.UL was not a defendant, agreeing in 2005 to pay $456 million to settle a federal probe. In summing up, the judge said he wanted to send a message "that will say to other quick-buck artists, not so fast." (additional reporting by Grant McCool; Editing by  Andre Grenon ,  Gary Hill )
