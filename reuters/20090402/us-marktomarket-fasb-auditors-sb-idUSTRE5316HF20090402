 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. auditors can view the mark-to-market accounting guidance approved on Thursday as the extra assurance they need to let banks paint a more rosy picture of their financial condition, accounting experts said. 

 Some banks and lawmakers have blamed auditors for forcing financial institutions to mark real estate-related assets down to firesale prices, even though accounting rule-setters have said management's internal models might give better valuations. The new guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board gives concrete examples of what constitutes a distressed sale, thereby not serving as a market price. "I don't think, based on this new guidance, that auditors will be inclined to challenge managers very actively on this," said Robert Willens, a former partner at accounting giant KPMG who now heads up a consulting firm. An independent auditor examines the financial statements that a bank's accountants prepare. That auditor issues an opinion about the accuracy of the data. Auditors typically take a conservative view of financial statements to prevent lawsuits or any damage to their reputations. Until now, auditors who examine banks' financial statements have favored observable market prices over management's judgment on valuations because FASB's prior definition of distressed sales was not specific enough, said Brian Bushee, an accounting professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "Auditors were being more conservative in requiring an objective number, when oftentimes the market transaction was someone dumping an asset to get rid of it," Bushee said. Mark-to-market, also known as fair value accounting, is aimed at giving investors an accurate view of financial companies' books. But some banks and investors have blamed the rules for accelerating the financial crisis by triggering billions of dollars in writedowns, leading to reduced capital levels and curtailing lending. The five-member FASB board voted unanimously on new guidance for mark-to-market. It will take effect in the second quarter for most U.S. financial firms, but early adoption may be allowed for first-quarter results. The board said the objective of mark-to-market in inactive markets is to determine what an asset could fetch in an "orderly" transaction between a buyer and seller. An "orderly" transaction would not include distressed transactions or fire-sales, it said. The explicit guidance will help auditors move away from their inclination to be conservative about asset valuations, Bushee said. "More specific criteria helps auditors if there is some scandal from a firm being accused of misrepresenting by not applying fair value rules," Bushee said. "The more indicators auditors can point to, the better chance an auditor has to win a lawsuit in that case." The industry's audit watchdog, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), also needs to provide "best practices" on how to apply FASB's guidance, he said. The PCAOB could provide more specific examples of indicators of a distressed sale, could say what sampling is required, and could give auditors benchmarks to help them compare sales, Bushee said. Last week, Paul Kanjorski, the Democrat who chairs the U.S. House Financial Services Committee on capital markets, said the PCAOB "must act swiftly to ensure that auditors incorporate these revisions in their reviews of the books of financial institutions as quickly as possible." The PCAOB said on Wednesday that it will evaluate FASB's changes to determine if it also needs to issue new guidance. Willens said PCAOB guidance would be icing on the cake, but not necessary. "I think auditors will follow the guidance without PCAOB saying anything," Willens said. "If you can make management happy and agree with management within the bounds of professional responsibility, that's something you want to do." (Reporting by Karey Wutkowski; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
