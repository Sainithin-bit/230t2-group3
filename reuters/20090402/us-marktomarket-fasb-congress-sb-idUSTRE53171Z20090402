 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A key U.S. lawmaker told Reuters he supports actions by accounting standard setters who allowed more flexibility in valuing toxic assets that have forced billions of dollars of write-downs at struggling banks. 

 "Some people won't like what they did, but I think what they did today strikes the right balance," Paul Kanjorski, chairman of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Capital Markets, said in an interview on Thursday with Reuters. Earlier this month Kanjorski, a Pennsylvania Democrat, threatened that Congress might need to get involved in accounting if the Financial Accounting Standards Board failed to act more quickly in addressing valuation of distressed assets. The top Republican on the House Financial Services Committee said FASB's actions were long overdue. "This announcement is a step forward," Spencer Bachus of Alabama said in a statement. The FASB met in Norwalk, Connecticut, on Thursday and agreed to give banks more flexibility in applying mark-to-market accounting to their soured assets. But in a move that would help many U.S. banks report stronger results, the board split 3-2 in approving guidance that would let lenders take smaller losses on impaired assets available for sale. The changes would take effect in the second quarter for most U.S. financial firms, but early adoption may be allowed for first-quarter results. Mark-to-market, also known as fair value accounting, is aimed at giving investors an accurate view of financial companies' books.
