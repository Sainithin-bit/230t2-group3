 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Crude futures fell on Wednesday as a jump in crude inventories in the United States and the prospect of a release of U.S. and some European strategic reserves sent oil prices into retreat. 
 U.S. crude stocks rose by 7.1 million barrels last week, the Energy Information Administration said, more than forecast. <EIA/S> Gasoline inventories declined by a more-than-expected 3.54 million barrels and distillate stocks fell 700,000 barrels. Ahead of weekly reports on U.S. oil inventories, crude stocks were expected to have risen 2.6 million barrels last week, a Reuters survey of analysts showed. Distillate inventories were expected to be down 100,000 barrels, while gasoline stocks were forecast to be down 1.3 million barrels. The prospect of a release of strategic oil reserves from the United States and some European nations also pressured oil. France is in contact with Britain and the United States on a possible release of strategic oil stocks to push fuel prices down, Le Monde daily said, citing presidential sources. A White House official reiterated that the United States was considering a reserve release but no decisions had been made. "As we have said repeatedly, while this is an option that remains on the table, no decisions have been made and no specific actions have been proposed," White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters. FUNDAMENTALS On the New York Mercantile Exchange, May crude fell $1.92, or 1.79 percent, to settle at $105.41 a barrel, below the 30-day average of $106.32, and having traded from $104.67 to $106.94. Saudi Arabia is set to use a record number of drilling rigs this year as it ramps up production, in the face of possible supply shortages due to Western sanctions on Iran. Goldman Sachs said it was shifting its recommendation on commodities to "neutral" from "overweight" on a near-term horizon, as most commodity markets including copper, crude oil and soybeans have reached the brokerage's near-term targets. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi blasted "irrationally" high oil prices in a rare opinion piece in the Financial Times, but offered no sign that the kingdom was moving to boost output.
