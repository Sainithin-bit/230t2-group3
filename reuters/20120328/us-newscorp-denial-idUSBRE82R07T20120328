 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - News Ltd, the Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, slammed an Australian media report on Wednesday that alleged a secret unit in the company had promoted piracy of its pay-TV rivals. 
 "The story is full of factual inaccuracies, flawed references, fanciful conclusions and baseless accusations which have been disproved in overseas courts," News Ltd said in a statement. "The United States Department of Justice, a federal court jury and a federal appellate court have all rejected allegations that NDS was either responsible for TV piracy or for distributing codes to facilitate piracy," it said.
