 PARIS  (Reuters) - Total ( TOTF.PA ) is still trying to identify the specific cause of a gas leak at its Elgin platform, a spokesman for the company said on Wednesday. 
 "We have not precisely identified the cause of the incident," he said. He added that a solution was still being evaluated and that it " is a question of days" to find one. The French firm had warned on Tuesday it could take six months to halt the flow. (Reporting by Sybille de La Hamaide)
