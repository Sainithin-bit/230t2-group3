 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - General Motors ( GM.N ) unit Opel appointed a 55-year-old executive from Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) to be its new chief of sales and marketing, the company said on Wednesday. 
 Alfred Rieck, who was in charge of building up the China business for VW's low-cost Czech brand Skoda, will start his new job effective July 1. "He has shown that he can manage a brand and increase its sales and market share. He will play a key role in the new positioning of Opel," Chief Executive Karl-Friedrich Stracke said in a statement. Predecessor Alain Visser switched internally to the global marketing department of GM's Chevrolet brand. The company's supervisory board began a meeting earlier on Wednesday under the cloud of potential plant closures. (Reporting by  Christiaan Hetzner )
