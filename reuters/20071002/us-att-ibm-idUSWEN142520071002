 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Tuesday it would provide telecommunications and network management services to International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ), giving the phone company up to $5 billion additional revenue over five years. 

 AT&T also said it would incur $60 million charges in 2007 related to additional technology services it will buy from IBM. It did not provide details on the charges but said they would not have a material impact on its results. While the network services deal provides new revenue, it is not expected to have a material impact on AT&T financial results. On average analysts expect AT&T to post $119.3 billion revenue for 2007, according to Reuters Estimates. AT&T expects charges of about $80 million over the next 12 months related to the network services agreement. It did not explain the charges. AT&T did not say how much revenue it already brings in from previous agreements with IBM. (Reporting by  Derek Caney )
