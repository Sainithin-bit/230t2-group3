 LONDON  (Reuters) - A consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) said on Tuesday that its bid for Dutch rival ABN AMRO AAH.AS had cleared a key regulatory hurdle in the United States. 

 The consortium, which includes Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch group Fortis FOR.BR, said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had declared a key form, including the consortium's U.S. offer document, effective. "The banks believe this marks another significant step towards satisfaction of the conditions applicable to the offer and invite ABN AMRO shareholders to accept the Banks' offer prior to its expiration on Friday, 5 October," the consortium said in a statement.
