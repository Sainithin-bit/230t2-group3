 (Corrects comparison to last year in paragraph 2)    
 DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Tuesday U.S. sales rose an adjusted 4 percent in September, boosted by incentives on its pickup trucks. 

 GM said it sold 337,640 vehicles in the United States last month compared to 338,380 vehicles a year earlier. Sales were adjusted for an extra selling day last September.
