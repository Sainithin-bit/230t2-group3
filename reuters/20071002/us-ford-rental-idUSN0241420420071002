 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Tuesday it expects to reduce U.S. sales to daily rental car companies by more than the targeted 135,000 vehicles this year. 

 The automaker has already reduced sales to these companies by 130,000 through September this year compared with last year, George Pipas, Ford's chief U.S. sales analyst, said. Pipas said Ford will be reducing sales to daily rental companies further in 2008.
