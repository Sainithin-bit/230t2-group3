 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. stock markets look set to open higher on Tuesday, extending the previous session's bull run, with little in the way of corporate news or economic data to provide direction. 

 At 0930 GMT (4:30 a.m. EDT), futures DJc1 SPc1 NDc1 pointed to all three of the leading Wall Street indexes opening around 0.1 percent higher. But the indicative Dow Jones index .DJII, which tracks how Dow shares are traded in Frankfurt, was 0.3 percent lower. The benchmark S&P 500 index  .SPX  has risen almost 5 percent in the past two weeks, lifted by the Federal Reserve's 50 basis point cut in key interest rates in mid-September. Data signaling slower economic growth have helped equities along through the effect of strengthening expectations of further monetary policy easing by the Fed. Some market watchers, however, warned such supportive factors may prove untenable. "More than 50 basis points of additional Fed easing is already embedded in the U.S. curve for the next six months, and in the very near term the data may not signal more accelerated economic weakness," Goldman Sachs said in a research note. "Weak U.S. economic data will certainly not be able to keep pushing stock markets higher," said Arnim Kogge, head of capital markets at private bankers Ellwanger & Geiger in Stuttgart. "Many companies' third-quarter reports will contain cautious forecasts," Kogge said. Two S&P 500 companies -- Pepsi Bottling Group PBG.N and Micron Tech MU.N -- are scheduled to report quarterly earnings on Tuesday. BOTTLES, CHIPS, CARS Pepsi Bottling Group's third-quarter earnings per share are seen up 10 percent year-on-year at $0.89 while chipmaker Micron is expected to report a fiscal fourth-quarter loss per share of $0.23 compared with a profit of $0.14 per share a year ago. Car stocks such as General Motors ( GM.N ) and Ford ( F.N ) could be in focus due to the release of U.S. automobile sales for September. Economists in a Reuters survey expect annualized sales of 5.2 million cars and 7.2 million trucks compared with 5.16 million cars and 7.57 million trucks in August. Eyes will also be on Palm Inc PALM.O, whose shares fell 4.1 percent in extended trade on Monday after the handheld computer maker posted a net loss for the first quarter. Palm's Frankfurt-traded shares were 1.6 percent lower at 0925 GMT (4:25 a.m. EDT). Shares of paints and coatings company Valspar Corp ( VAL.N ) dropped more than 7 percent after the bell on Monday as the company warned about its profit outlook. Tuesday's macro economic diary highlight is the pending home sales index for August from the National Association of Realtors at 1400 GMT. Economists polled by Reuters expect a 2.1 percent fall compared with a 12.2 percent slide in July. "Added to the drop in existing and new home sales, this could give further indication of the slowdown in the U.S. housing market, adding yet another bad egg to the basket of U.S. housing," Dutch bank ABN Amro said in a note. On Monday, the Dow Jones  .DJI  rose 1.4 percent to a record close of 14,087.55 points, having surged to an all-time high of 14,115.51 points during the session. The S&P 500 Index gained 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  closed up 1.5 percent, after hitting its highest level since February 2001.
