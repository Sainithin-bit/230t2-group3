 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - U.S. memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. MU.N said on Tuesday it expects capital spending of $2.5 billion in its fiscal 2008. 

 Executives said on a conference call with analysts after the company reported quarterly results that most of the spending will be on equipment used to make memory chips from larger dinner-plate-sized silicon wafers. Micron expects that about $750 million of the $2.5 billion in capital spending will come from joint-venture partners. (Reporting by  Duncan Martell )
