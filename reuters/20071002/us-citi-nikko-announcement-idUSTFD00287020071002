 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C. said it would acquire all the shares it does not already own in Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp 8603.T through a share swap. 

 Citigroup earlier this year bought a 68 percent stake in Nikko Cordial to help its expansion in the world's second-largest economy. The remaining 32 percent stake is worth about 457 billion yen ($4 billion) at Nikko's closing share price on Tuesday of 1,462 yen.
