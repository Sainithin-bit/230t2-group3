 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Dean Foods Co ( DF.N ), the largest U.S. milk and dairy products company, lowered its earnings forecast on Tuesday as soaring milk prices refused to abate. 

 Dean also said it will cut 600 to 700 jobs to further reduce costs. Dean, which makes Land O'Lakes creamers and Silk soy milk, said sales have been hurt as consumers shift to private-label brands in the wake of record-high dairy costs. In October, the minimum USDA price for raw milk was $21.59 per hundred pounds, up from $12.42 a year earlier, a Dean spokesman said. "While we had expected strong growth in milk supply to lead to lower conventional dairy commodity prices toward the end of the year, it now appears that prices will likely remain high for the balance of the year, due in part to continued strong demand for nonfat dry milk powder," Jack Callahan, Dean chief financial officer, said in a statement. Dean shares slipped 19 cents at $26.10 on Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down more than 17 percent since the end of the second quarter, well below the 2 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD. "While the reduced guidance is obviously disappointing, it was not entirely unexpected," Sanford Bernstein's Robert van Brugge said in a research note. "The stock has sold off considerably in the past several months in anticipation of a potential miss." Dallas-based Dean said it now expects earnings of about 15 cents per share in the third quarter, and about $1.25 per share for the full year. In August, it said third-quarter profit could range from 24 cents to 28 cents, adding and that it "may be able to hit the low end" of its prior guidance of $1.52 to $1.58 per share for the full year. "The third quarter has historically been the toughest quarter ... in times of severe dairy price spikes," Wachovia analyst Jonathan Feeney said in a research note. "We suspect things should get better from here -- although we still maintain a bit of caution as global milk production has yet to reach an inflection, while domestic yields remain uninspiring." The higher dairy prices also make the impact of any milk wasted in its factories more expensive, the spokesman said. He explained that about 1 percent to 2 percent of the milk that comes into the factory is left in hoses, flushed out or otherwise lost. Other food companies that have seen profits hurt by rising milk prices are Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N, which derives 19 percent of sales from cheese, and Hershey Co ( HSY.N ), which uses milk in chocolate. Complicating matters for Dean, the company's Horizon organic milk businesses is being pressure by an oversupply of organic milk. Dean said the job cuts, which will affect Dean Foods Dairy Group employees across the country, will start with voluntary departures followed by involuntary cuts if necessary. The reductions should be finished by late October, and should lead to a restructuring charge in the third quarter, Dean said. In March, Dean took on $4.8 billion in debt in order to pay shareholders a special dividend of $15 per share, a move seen as a defense against private equity firms looking for a takeover target.
