 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings on Tuesday said they may raise ratings on Commerce Bancorp Inc CBH.N, citing news that Canada's Toronto-Dominion Bank ( TD.TO ) agreed to buy Commerce in a cash-and-stock deal worth $8.5 billion. 

 The acquisition will expand Toronto-Dominion's presence in the United States. Cross-border acquisitions have been made easier for Canadian firms by the robust Canadian dollar, which reached parity with the U.S. dollar recently for the first time in more than 30 years. For details, see <ID:nN02373501>. S&P said it may raise Commerce Bancorp's counterparty credit rating, now "BBB-plus," the third-lowest investment grade. Counterparty credit ratings reflect how well a company can meet its financial obligations with customers, trading partners or other parties. Ratings will likely be raised to "AA-minus," the fourth-highest investment grade, aligning them with ratings on Toronto Dominion's TD Banknorth, when the transaction closes, S&P said in a statement. Fitch said it expects to align Commerce Bancorp's ratings with Toronto-Dominion's when the transaction closes. It currently rates Toronto-Dominion Bank at "AA-minus," the fourth-highest investment grade, and Commerce Bancorp three steps lower at "A-minus." Fitch affirmed Toronto-Dominion's rating with a stable outlook, meaning a rating change is not expected over the next one to two years. "While this is a fairly sizable acquisition for TD, it is one that brings TD an attractive retail operating model with good deposit generation and brand awareness," Fitch said in a statement. Moody's also affirmed its ratings on Toronto-Dominion and said it may upgrade Commerce Bancorp's debt rating. Moody's rates Commerce Bancorp's long-term debt at "A2", the sixth highest grade, and has an "A1" long-term deposit and senior debt rating, the fifth highest. (Additional reporting by  Walden Siew )
