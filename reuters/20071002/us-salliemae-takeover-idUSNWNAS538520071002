 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Student lender Sallie Mae SLM.N said on Tuesday it expects the consortium that agreed in April to buy it for $60 a share in cash, or $25 billion, to honor the contract. 

 Earlier, the consortium said it sent a revised buyout proposal to the student lender offering $50 a share in cash plus warrants that could result in an extra payout. The consortium includes private equity firms J.C. Flowers & Co and Friedman Fleischer and Lowe, as well as JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). "Our contract is with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, two of America's largest and strongest banks," said Sallie Mae in a statement. "We expect these banks to honor that contract, not breach the contract."
