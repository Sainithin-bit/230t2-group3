 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) reported a 5.9 
percent drop in sales of its VW brand car in the United States 
last month, while the group's premium badge Audi managed to 
keep sales flat in September. 

  The core VW brand managed to sell just 18,891 vehicles in 
the final month of the third quarter, as total demand for its 
Passat sedan and estate models plunged 40 percent.  That brought cumulative sales in the nine months through 
September down 3.9 percent to 175,079 units.  VW has become such a small player in the U.S. car market 
that Audi's sales of its premium Q7 sport utility vehicle more 
than doubled those of the mass market VW brand Touareg SUV.  Audi reported sales edged up by 0.2 percent to 8,021 
vehicles as stronger demand for the Q7 compensated for a drop 
off in sales of its core A4 mid-size model range.  In the first nine months, sales rose 9.4 percent to 68,479 
Audi brand units.
