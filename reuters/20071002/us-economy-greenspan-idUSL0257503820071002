 LONDON  (Reuters) - A long period of low prices and stable growth is coming to an end and central banks today have to pay more attention to inflation pressures, former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said on Tuesday. 

 "We're beginning to see this extraordinary period of disinflation and economic growth is coming to a halt," Greenspan told a business audience in London. "We now have to be very sensitive to the fact that inflationary pressures could well get out of hand." He added that the trade-off between inflation and growth had become more negative and that current Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke was likely to have a tougher job than he did.
