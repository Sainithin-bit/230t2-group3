 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Hershey Co ( HSY.N ) said on Tuesday that Chief Operating Officer David West will become its next chief executive, just a day after the chocolate maker announced the surprise retirement of CEO Richard Lenny. 

 The promotion was seen by some as a signal that the company wants to stick with its strategy of focusing on new products such as premium chocolate to revive sales. Some analysts argue that a combination with another company, such as Britain's Cadbury Schweppes Plc CBRY.L, would be a good move for Hershey, but the Hershey Trust which controls 78 percent of the voting rights, is seen by many as posing a roadblock to such a deal. West, who has been with the company since 2001, will become CEO on December 1, Hershey said in a statement. Lenny, who is also Hershey's chairman, will remain in that post until the end of the year. Robert Campbell, a member of Hershey's board of directors, will become nonexecutive chairman on January 1. On Monday, a Hershey spokesman said Lenny was leaving after 6-1/2 years because he felt it was the right time to turn the company over to new management. But the Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Lenny had differed with the Hershey Trust and could not run the business as autonomously as he would like. Hershey Trust officials were not immediately available to comment on West's appointment. Hershey has struggled in the past two years with rising costs and stiff competition from M&Ms maker Masterfoods USA, a unit of private Mars Inc. "This suggests that there is going to be minimal change in terms of strategic direction at the company," said Matt Arnold, an analyst with Edward Jones who has a "buy" rating on Hershey shares. "They want to try to revive the top line and go it alone." Like Lenny, West joined Hershey from Kraft Foods Inc's KFT.N Nabisco unit, where he was responsible for the finances of that company's biscuits, confections and snack businesses. In total, he spent 14 years with Nabisco. At Hershey, West has held several positions, including chief financial officer. He became COO in January, and on Tuesday was named president, effective immediately. Hershey shares fell 3.4 percent to close at $45.78 on the New York Stock Exchange.
