 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - While the worst of the global credit crisis may be over, there is more fallout to come, Ron O'Hanley, president and chief executive of BNY Mellon Asset Management, said on Tuesday. 

 "I think we've seen the worst, but I don't think it's over," O'Hanley said at a briefing for journalists. "I think there is more out there that we haven't seen." He cited Citigroup ( C.N ) as an example, after it said that it expected to report a 60-percent decline in third-quarter net income due in part to losses and writedowns on subprime securities. O'Hanley said the size or the problems there was something that he had not anticipated. But he added, "I'm not trying to suggest that there is some terrible problem out there." Another example was structured investment vehicles, known as SIVs. The extent to which SIVs will be able to replace their funding as the appetite for commercial paper goes down, and, if they can't. the implications, are not known, he said. O'Hanley said a related but different issue is the extent of the U.S. housing downturn. "I think it's very clear it's going to cut back growth." he said. "We're not going to see anywhere near the growth in the economy that we've had in the last three or four years. The U.S. could be headed for a "growth recession," he said, considering the large number of people whose livelihoods are tied, directly or indirectly, to housing. While there is a "fair amount of risk for a recession," O'Hanley's own prediction is that it will be averted but the growth recession "is not going to feel very good." Kent Wosepka, portfolio manager with Standish Mellon, a fixed-income manager within BNY Mellon Asset Management, said that people expecting a quick turnaround in the housing downturn "are likely to be disappointed." He said recoveries typically take about five years, and the U.S. is only two years into the problem. Wosepka said the recent 50-basis point cut in short term rates by the Fed is a "start" but "another 50 to 100 basis points of rate cuts by the Fed is certainly on the table." He also said that in the current environment short maturity high quality bonds are good values. He cited as an example issues of General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co  ( WFC.N ). "These are not high risk companies," but credit spreads on two year bonds of the companies have gone up from about 50 basis points to 100-120 basis points. Wosepka said it was function of supply and demand factors pushing Treasury yields lower. O'Hanley and Wosepka were speaking as part of a program on "Investing In An Increasingly Risk Averse Environment." BNY Mellon Asset Management, part of Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ), manages assets of about $1.2 trillion.
