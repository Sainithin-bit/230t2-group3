 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The consortium that agreed to acquire Sallie Mae SLM.N said on Tuesday it sent a revised proposal to the student lender offering to pay $50 a share in cash plus warrants that could result in an extra payout. 

 But Sallie Mae responded by saying it expects the buyers to honor their original contract. The group had agreed to pay $60 a share, or $25 billion, for Sallie Mae in April. Since then, legislation slashing subsidies to student lenders and a serious credit squeeze have jeopardized the deal. Private equity firm J.C. Flowers & Co said it sent the revised proposal on behalf of the consortium, which also includes JP Morgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and private equity firm Friedman Fleischer and Lowe. In the revised proposal, the consortium said if Sallie Mae performed in line with its own projections, the warrants could result in a payout of more than $7 per share, and if the student lender exceeded its projections, the payout could reach $10 per share. "I think Sallie was probably looking for closer to $55, but you do have the sweetener if the business is going well ... you should get about $57," said Richard Hofmann, analyst at CreditSights. "I think they (Sallie Mae) might try to come back and get more cash." The consortium said its proposal to revise the offer expires on October 9. "This revised proposal offers full and fair value to the Sallie Mae shareholders in light of the changes that have occurred since the signing of our agreement ... " Christopher Flowers, managing director of J.C. Flowers, said in a letter to Sallie Mae's board. BREAKUP FEE The consortium has already said it does not expect to complete its acquisition on the terms agreed in April. The original agreement has a breakup fee of $900 million, but if the buyers can prove the new legislation affecting student lenders causes a material adverse effect to the transaction, they would not have to pay. The student lender has maintained the new legislation does not constitute a material adverse effect. "Our contract is with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, two of America's largest and strongest banks," Sallie Mae said in a statement on Tuesday. "We expect these banks to honor that contract, not breach the contract." In their letter to Sallie Mae, the buyers estimated the combined impact of the legislation and credit crunch would reduce the student lender's core earnings net income by 14.4 percent in 2009, and by 20.1 percent in 2012, when compared to assumptions provided by the student lender. "The bottom line is that Sallie Mae has suffered an MAE (material adverse effect) as defined in the contract," the buyers said in their letter. On September 27, President George W. Bush signed student loan legislation that cuts federal subsidies to lenders such as Sallie Mae, Citigroup ( C.N ), Bank of America and many others. If the Sallie Mae deal were to fail, it would be the latest casualty among a series of proposed leveraged buyouts to falter following the meltdown in credit markets over the last couple of months. Sallie Mae shares closed up 19 cents at $50.09. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick/Maureen Bavdek/Braden Reddall)
