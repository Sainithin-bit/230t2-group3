 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co Ltd ( 7201.T ) on Tuesday said its U.S. sales rose 11 percent on an adjusted basis, driven by increased demand for its Altima sedans and Pathfinder sport utility vehicle. 

 The Japanese automaker said it sold 94,269 vehicles in September, up from 88,340 units a year earlier. Sales were adjusted for an extra selling day last September. (Reporting by Jui Chakavorty)
