 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Tuesday that U.S. sales fell 21 percent in September, hit by a decline in showroom sales. 

 The second-largest U.S. automaker sold 189,893 vehicles in September, down from 204,070 vehicles a year earlier. The company said retail, or showroom, sales fell 15 percent, while sales to car rental companies were down 62 percent. Results for Ford, which had sought to cut its lower-margin fleet sales to car rental companies, included its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks and were not adjusted for extra selling day last year.
