 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks fell on Tuesday as investors booked profits from the prior session's rally, while falling oil prices weighed on shares of energy companies. 

 Technology companies and big manufacturers, such as Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), which had climbed a day earlier to help propel the Dow to its 33rd record-high finish for 2007 on Monday retreated. Oil dropped below $80 a barrel as the dollar strengthened and made commodities priced in dollars cheaper. Exxon Mobil was the biggest drag on both the Dow and the S&P 500 stock gauges, falling 2.6 percent. "We had this massive move up in the market yesterday, so it's only natural that there be some profit-taking," said Stephen Massocca, co-chief executive of San Francisco-based investment bank Pacific Growth Equities. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 61.21 points, or 0.43 percent, at 14,026.34. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 5.11 points, or 0.33 percent, at 1,541.93. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 3.46 points, or 0.13 percent, at 2,737.53. Exxon Mobil shares fell to $91.48 and Chevron Corp ( CVX.N ) shed 2.7 percent to $91.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. crude for November delivery fell 1.5 percent to $79.02. On the Nasdaq, shares of Garmin Ltd ( GRMN.O ), the world's largest maker of navigation devices, fell for a second day following Nokia's ( NOK1V.HE ) offer to buy Garmin's rival, Navteq NVT.N. Palm Inc PALM.O, maker of the Treo smart phone, fell 3 percent to $15.50 after it warned on Monday profit would lag Wall Street targets. Also declining was rival Research In Motion RIM.TO RIMM.O, which fell more than 2 percent to  $96.12. Shares of financial companies rose as investors drew comfort from a push by banks to write off losses tied to the credit market crisis. "The market, by and large, thinks that the companies have taken their medicine. They've recognized their problems and are dealing with them," said Massocca. Shares of Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) rose 1.9 percent to $51.57, while shares of Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) fell after the investment bank said it will cut 600 jobs.

Sallie Mae shares were up 1.3 percent at $50.77.
