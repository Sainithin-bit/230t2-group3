 MESA, Arizona  (Reuters) - The Obama administration's plan to reduce mortgage payments for struggling homeowners is expected to help mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday. 

 "Fannie and Freddie believe that the program we announced -- this refinancing program -- is economically sensible for them and will leave them overall in a better position going forward," Geithner told reporters. (Reporting by  Caren Bohan )
