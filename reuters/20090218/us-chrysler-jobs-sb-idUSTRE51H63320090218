 DUBAI  (Reuters) - U.S. automaker Chrysler LLC sees no significant jobs cuts in its operations in Europe, Middle East and Africa, but has put a freeze on new hires for the time being, a company official said on Wednesday. 

 On Tuesday, Chrysler requested another $5 billion in U.S. government aid and submitted a blueprint to the U.S. Treasury outlining restructuring plans that include reducing capacity and 3,000 job cuts. "I can't confirm that there will not be any layoffs, but I don't see any significant layoffs (in Europe, Middle East or Africa), but there is a freeze on hiring with exceptions," Thomas Hausch, vice president of international sales, told reporters in Dubai. Sales in the Middle East grew 18 percent in 2008 compared with the previous year, slowing from a 24 percent year-on-year rise in 2007, Hausch said.
