 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Auto lender GMAC cannot access a special Federal Reserve lending program because it requires participants' securities to be AAA-rated, General Motors Corp told the U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday. 

 The Fed's Term Asset-Backed Loan Facility, or TALF, was created with seed money from the Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout for the U.S. financial services industry. Under the recently-expanded program, the Fed plans to pump up to $1 trillion into credit markets with loans that are collateralized by automobile, student, credit card and small business loans. GM said the program cannot help GMAC make more automobile loans to consumers because credit rating companies are unwilling to provide AAA-ratings, given the automaker's uncertain outlook. "Should the rating agencies continue to take this view, even after GM submits its viability plan, and potentially receives federal government support, the continued lack of funding will have a substantial negative impact on GMAC's ability to provide both retail and wholesale funding in the U.S. and Canada, and consequently on GM's ability to sell cars and trucks in these markets," the company said. The Fed lending facility was mentioned in GM's restructuring plan submitted to the U.S. government on Tuesday as a condition of the company's December bailout. In December, the Fed approved GMAC's application to become a bank holding company and GMAC then received $5 billion from the Treasury Department's bailout fund. That funding helped GMAC launch special financing programs to help consumers buy select 2008 and 2009 models. (Reporting by  Julie Vorman ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
