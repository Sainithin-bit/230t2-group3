 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Deere & Co ( DE.N ) reported a sharper-than-expected drop in quarterly profit on Wednesday and cut its forecast for the full year, as the deepening global recession cut into its bottom line. 

 Although sales of its tractors, harvesters and other farm equipment rose 18 percent in the quarter, Deere warned about a number of worrisome headwinds to growth -- including the U.S. dollar's appreciation versus currencies including the Russian ruble, Australian dollar and Brazilian real. With U.S. farm incomes also expected to decline this year for the first time in a decade, that weakness is likely to spread to North America, leaving Deere, which is already grappling with a sharp drop in demand for its construction equipment because of the housing collapse, no room to hide. The world's largest maker of farm equipment said profit fell 45 percent to $203.9 million, or 48 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter that ended on January 31, from $369.1 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected earnings of 62 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 1 percent to $5.15 billion. "Every market was down twice as much as they thought it would be," Longbow Research analyst Eli Lustgarten said. One of the big culprits during the quarter was the company's financial services unit, where profit fell more than 50 percent, pulled down by increased provisions for loan losses and narrowing spreads. TROUBLE AHEAD, TROUBLE BEHIND Moline, Illinois-based Deere cut its full-year earnings outlook more than 20 percent, to $1.5 billion. Just three months ago it had forecast $1.9 billion. But the company warned of "more risk on the downside" for its fiscal-year outlook. "The coming year remains unusually uncertain," it said in a statement. It said it now expects full year sales to fall 8 percent. Three months ago, it was forecasting flat sales for 2009. After enjoying five years of double-digit percentage gains in sales of high-horsepower tractors and combines, Deere and rivals CNH Global NV CNH.N and Agco Corp ( AG.N ) are now facing a pullback in spending. The decline in farm incomes predicted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture -- the first in a decade -- is not the only problem down on the farm for Deere. A confluence of factors are weighing on the company's outlook. The ethanol industry that sent grain prices soaring last year is looking wobbly, a victim of overcapacity, weak demand and poor margins; the global economy is in recession; and the credit crunch is hurting sales in what were recently the world's fastest-growing agricultural markets, including South America, Eastern Europe and Russia. Adding to Deere's woes is its construction and forestry equipment business, which was already grappling with the sharp drop in homebuilding that has hammered companies like Caterpillar Inc ( CAT.N ), Komatsu ( 6301.T ), Hitachi Construction Machinery ( 6305.T ) and Terex Corp ( TEX.N ). As a result, Deere said it expected its equipment sales to decline about 8 percent this year. Three months ago, it had forecast flat sales for the year. It said farm equipment sales would fall 2 percent in 2009, down from an earlier forecast of up 5 percent. Deere shares were last down 1.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange after earlier falling as much as 5.3 percent. The stock closed Tuesday's session at $33.49, down 65 percent from the 52-week high of $94.89 it touched last spring.
