 QUITO  (Reuters) - Ecuador is investigating the operations of two local units of Stanford Financial Group after the firm was engulfed in an international fraud scandal, government regulators told Reuters on Wednesday. 

 The two regulators, who oversee the country's markets, said the total exposure of local investors was not yet known. The stock exchanges in Guayaquil and Quito were expected to suspend Stanford's local brokerage house later on Wednesday, officials said. "We have launched an investigation into the portfolios managed by Stanford," said Santiago Noboa, the head regulator for markets in Quito. Noboa said the Stanford units managed a fund and investor portfolios that totaled about $15 million, but authorities were yet unaware of other instruments the firm might have sold to local investors. Noboa said the government was waiting for the results of the investigation before taking action. Dozens of well-dressed, prosperous looking clients flooded into Stanford's brokerage office in Quito's ritzy business district, demanding information about their deposits. "I don't know what is going on. I read it in the newspaper and immediately came over," said Anita Cazar, a real estate agent who invested in certificates of deposit. Sitting on a leather couch in the luxurious office, she added, "I want to get that money out." (Reporting by  Alonso Soto ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
