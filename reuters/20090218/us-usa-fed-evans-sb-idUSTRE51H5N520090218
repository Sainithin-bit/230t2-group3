 ROCKFORD, Illinois  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is still contracting at a "disturbing" pace, underlining the need for more stimulus even with interest rates already set near zero, a top Federal Reserve policy-maker said on Wednesday. 

 "We likely are in for a protracted period of poor economic performance," Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said in a speech on the economic outlook to the Rockford Chamber of Commerce in Rockford, Illinois. "For the Fed, this means that the (Federal Open Market) Committee will have to focus on other ways to impart monetary stimulus to the economy." The central bank's various new liquidity programs can still be expanded, and the purchase of longer-term Treasuries is still being mulled, Evans noted. Evans, a voting member of the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2009, said that the pessimistic outlook "has reduced everyone's confidence," making investors, households and businesses reluctant to take on longer-term investments or new spending, only adding to the economy's woes. Real GDP, the broadest measure of economic growth, "will fall markedly" in the first half of 2009 before potentially expanding later in the year and moving back to "the neighborhood" of its potential in 2010. "However, I do not see growth as being strong enough to make much progress in closing resource gaps over this period. Indeed, the unemployment rate ... is likely to rise into 2010," he said. The impact the Obama administration's $787 billion economic stimulus would have on GDP was not yet clear, he added. "The new fiscal stimulus package will boost output ... Our forecast could need some recalibration as we gain knowledge of how the package is affecting the economy." Evans said inflation was likely to remain "a good deal below" the 2-percent level that is consistent with price stability in both 2009 and 2010, and reiterated support for a more explicit inflation target. Discussing the Fed's initiatives to pump liquidity into various corners of the credit market, Evans said the programs reflected the current dysfunction and risk aversion rampant in financial markets. "Markets have become highly segmented .... as stressed markets improve, more normal functioning of the financial system as a whole can be achieved," he said. For now, the Fed's traditional and nontraditional policy actions "are beginning to help the functioning of credit markets," as shown by falling spreads on interest rates charged for interbank lending since October, Evans said. Evans said some of the winding down of the Fed's nontraditional programs "will occur naturally as market conditions improve," allowing the central bank to return to its traditional focus on short-term lending rates. Financial markets currently do not fully price an increase in the federal funds rate to 0.50 percent from the current range of zero to 0.25 percent until December.
