 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co paid Chief Executive Jeff Immelt 28 percent less last year as the U.S. conglomerate's top executive asked for no bonus in light of the drop in GE's profits and stock price. 

 Immelt's 2008 compensation was valued at $14.1 million, down from $19.6 million, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The 53-year-old CEO said he had recommended to the board that he receive no bonus for 2008 and declined an $11.7 million payout he was eligible for under the company's long-term incentive plan. "Given the circumstances, I recommended to the board that I not receive this payout," Immelt said in a statement posted to the company's GEReports.com Web site. GE shares were unchanged at $10.81 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. "He avoided a public relations nightmare," said Richard Steinberg, president of Steinberg Global Asset Management in Boca Raton, Florida, which owns GE shares. "They're playing defense right now." As they struggle with the worst downturn the United States has seen since the early 1980s, companies in all sectors have shed thousands of jobs and frozen pay for workers in a bid to hold up their sagging profits. Shares of the world's largest maker of jet engines and electricity-producing turbines lost more than half their value last year. They have continued to slide through the first weeks of 2009 as weakness at the company's GE Capital finance arm contributed to a 22 percent fall in profit. Pay rose for four other top company officials -- including its chief financial officer, the heads of the GE Money and GE Technology Infrastructure unit and the former head of NBC Universal media, reflecting the payouts under the long-term incentive plan. "It is important that the board and I have the freedom to compensate our senior executives in a fair and reasonable way," Immelt said in the statement. Since Immelt took the reins at GE in September 2001, succeeding legendary CEO Jack Welch, the company's share price has fallen by almost 75 percent.
