 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration's housing rescue plan will commit up to $275 billion in federal funds toward refinancing and modifying mortgages to make them more affordable, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. 

 The plan will include $200 billion in additional funding support for government-controlled housing finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, along with $50 billion from the $700 billion financial rescue fund to help reduce payments on "at-risk" mortgages in danger of foreclosure. Fannie and Freddie will kick in another $20-25 billion to help modify these loans, the official said. (Reporting by  David Lawder )
