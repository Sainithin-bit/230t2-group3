 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday said it had slashed its economic forecast for 2009 to a likely decline in output and considered setting a specific inflation target to sharpen its efforts to pull the economy out of a prolonged recession. 

 KEY POINTS: * Fed officials lowered their core projections for 2009 to a decline in output of between 1.3 percent and 0.5 percent. Fed officials in October anticipated output for the year ranging from a shrinkage of 0.2 percent to an expansion of 1.1 percent. COMMENTS: ASHA BANGALORE, ECONOMIST, NORTHERN TRUST, CHICAGO: "It's interesting to see they lowered their projections for output in 2009. They are also quite pessimistic about the situation. It's just telling you that things are not as good. "But if you look  at 2010, it's quite bullish." BRET BARKER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, METROPOLITAN WEST ASSET MANAGEMENT, LOS ANGELES: "This was a bit of a non-event. I think it would have been nice to see some comments on buying Treasuries, but I think they were focused on the outlook -- definitely weaker but no surprise there. I think we know they want to go to some form of inflation-targeting. Not a specific one but something. Overall, no big market mover here." WILLIAM O'DONNELL, HEAD OF U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGY AND RESEARCH, UBS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "We were looking most closely at any discussion or hints about Treasury purchases. "They discussed Treasury purchases. The consensus appeared to be that for now purchases of agency debt and mortgage debt and support through TALF for the ABS markets would be more effective. "At some point if those programs lose effectiveness that certainly is an arrow they can yank out of the quiver, but it doesn't appear to be immediate." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "There are two takeaways from the Federal Reserve minutes. First, the Fed is moving closer to adopting a 2 percent long-term inflation target. Secondly, their weaker GDP forecast is still not as dire as the market is pricing." JAMES CARON, CO-HEAD OF GLOBAL RATES RESEARCH, MORGAN STANLEY, NEW YORK: "It was nothing too out of the ordinary. Lacker still differentiates himself from everybody else. The citing inflation and citing deflation risks had to be the topic du jour. Clearly most central banks are all about inflation fighting and they are always going to have to talk about what the end game is to all of this stuff, and after all there is a lot of monetary and fiscal stimulus floating around out there and money supply has grown quite a bit." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes pare losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices slightly pare losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains.
