 BOGOTA  (Reuters) - The local arm of the Stanford Financial Group has halted its activities on Colombia's stock exchange with the permission of authorities, the Colombian Financial Superintendency said in a statement on Wednesday. 

 U.S. authorities have charged the group and its founder with perpetrating a "massive" fraud. Alvaro Camaro, the bank's local director, told Reuters the company had sufficient solvency to provide guarantees to its local investors. "With what has happened to the group at a global level, we had to take a decision to protect investors and naturally to guarantee stability in the market," Camaro said. In a complaint filed in federal court in Dallas, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused billionaire Allen Stanford of fraudulently selling $8 billion in high-yield certificates of deposit in a scheme that stretched from Texas to the Caribbean.
