 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A top U.S. regulator on Wednesday backed the idea of giving public company shareholders a so-called say on pay on executive compensation, a concept gaining momentum among investors and lawmakers amid the financial crisis. 

 The comments by SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter, a Democrat, come as banks and other companies receiving federal bailout money have been ordered to give shareholders such voting power. These votes are nonbinding on companies but seen as sending a strong signal about shareholders' attitudes about companies' pay decisions. Some other companies, including Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) and Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ), have said they would voluntarily adopt say-on-pay voting as Corporate America faces pressure from angry investors about the size of executive pay packages at a time when the economy is in turmoil. Say-on-pay measures "can help restore investor trust" and lead to "increased shareholder participation," Walter said in a speech at a corporate governance forum in New York sponsored by the Practising Law Institute. Walter is one of five SEC commissioners who make decisions on federal securities rules. The new SEC chairman, Mary Schapiro, has also said it is appropriate to allow shareholders to cast an advisory vote on executives' compensation. Like Schapiro, Walter also said on Wednesday the commission should revisit the thorny issue of proxy access, or giving stockholders an easier way to put forward their own nominees for corporate board seats. "I believe the commission should move forward with proxy access," she said, adding that she believed the commission needed to "carefully consider" a range of possibilities on the matter. Shareholders already have the right to put forth board nominees by waging a proxy fight. However, that route is considered onerous and expensive, and shareholder advocates say the SEC should allow investors to place their nominees for board elections on the company's annual proxy document instead. Business groups counter that such an idea only serves activists who may not have a company's best interests at heart. Walter also said she wanted to see more disclosure from companies in board election materials distributed to shareholders about a nominee's qualifications to serve on the board. Currently, companies typically only list a nominee's biography. It would be better, Walter said, if companies were required to explain why they believe that director nominee would "add value" the  company. (Reporting by Martha Graybow, editing by Matthew Lewis)
