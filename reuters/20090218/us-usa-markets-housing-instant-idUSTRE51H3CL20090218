 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. housing starts and permits dropped to record lows in January, data showed on Wednesday, as builders held back on construction amid an overhang of unsold houses and a slump in demand. 

 U.S. import prices fell the smallest amount in six months in January as a string of double-digit declines in petroleum import prices ended, a U.S. Labor Department report said on Wednesday. KEY POINTS: HOUSING * Housing starts tumbled 16.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 466,000 units, the lowest since the Commerce Department started keeping records in 1959, from December's upwardly revised 560,000 units. That was the biggest percentage drop since January 1994, the Commerce Department said. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected an annual rate of 530,000 units for January. * New building permits, which give a sense of future home construction, dropped 4.8 percent to 521,000 units, also an all-time low, from 547,000 units in December. That was below analysts' estimates of 530,000. IMPORT/EXPORT PRICES * Petroleum import prices fell just 2.4 percent in January after four consecutive months of double-digit declines. That helped hold the 1.1 percent overall import price drop close to the 1.3 percent mark expected by analysts before the report. COMMENTS: CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "Housing amazingly keeps surprising to the downside even this far into it. The one silver lining is that precondition of getting house prices to stabilize is to stop building homes basically that the market doesn't need. "Although this is bad for GDP arithmetic it is something of a good thing in the medium term the fact that they are building fewer homes. Therefore the inventory will take not quite as long to work off. Unfortunately the inventory is pretty massive." KEVIN KRUSZENSKI, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS, CLEVELAND "I think expectations were fairly low going into this number. The starts, in particular, were much worse than expected. Expectations are so low for housing that I think even if you had a better-than-expected number, the market would have seen it as an anomaly." IAN SHEPHERDSON, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, HIGH FREQUENCY ECONOMICS, VALHALLA, NEW YORK: "The huge drop in starts reflects a 28 percent plunge in the very volatile multi-family home sector, while single-family starts fell by 12 percent -- grim but not quite as bad as the headline. Moreover, it is possible that severe weather in parts of the country accounted for some of the drop in starts. We note that single-family permits, which are much less susceptible to the weather than starts, fell 8.0 percent, rather less than the drop in starts. The numbers are still terrible, though, and with the inventory of new homes still rising relative to sales, we can't be confident this is the bottom. Starts can't fall below zero, though..." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "They certainly were weak. January housing starts were well below expectations and the permits were basically in-line, slightly below expectations and that does show the inventory of housing continues to moderate which should eventually lead to a stabilization in pricing. "We expect stable prices in the next year, possibly in a shorter time frame given that population growth is outstripping the supply in housing. The market looks like we have a slightly positive start for the day and we might see a little bit of a positive here from that data. Of course, it's not good news for the housing manufacturers but for the overall market. The real focus today is on Geithner and what he says specifically about housing and mortgages." MATT ESTEVE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADER, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: "It's a pretty awful (housing) number but in a certain way the bad reading was to be expected. There's no bottom yet in sight for the U.S. economy. But the truth is that the outlook for the rest of the world is even worse and that should sustain the dollar bid. We've seen a re-emergence of risk aversion in the past couple of days and any dip in the dollar may be a good buying opportunity." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "I don't think they're particularly strong (housing data), but the weakness is expected. I do think the stock market is testing the low of its range, so I don't think there will be downward movement on the number. This is just a continuation of the data we've been seeing. "I think the market is looking for two things: a little more clarity on the refinancing of financials, and economic data both in and outside the U.S. "I don't think the market is looking too much to Obama's speech. With his signing the stimulus yesterday, I think it's more of a question of how much the market has discounted." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures hold gains. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices hold gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains versus yen.
