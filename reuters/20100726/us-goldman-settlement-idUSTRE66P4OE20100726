 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Goldman Sachs Group Inc will be allowed to continue to issue securities after settling civil fraud charges earlier this month, according to a letter posted to its website on Monday. 

 Goldman's status as an eligible issuer was brought into question by an SEC lawsuit stemming from Goldman's packaging and marketing of the Abacus 2007 collateralized debt obligation. On July 15, The Wall Street firm agreed to pay $550 million to settle the case, while acknowledging some mistakes. As the firm stopped short of admitting to the SEC's allegations, its status as an eligible issuer was not in jeopardy, according to the letter. Goldman, in a letter to the SEC dated July 15, had requested that the company not be considered an "ineligible issuer" as a result of its settlement with the SEC.
