 (Reuters) - Oil and natural gas producers were restoring production 

 but 50 percent of daily crude oil production in U.S.-regulated areas of the Gulf of Mexico was shut as of Sunday due to Tropical Depression Bonnie, the U.S. government said. Tropical Depression Bonnie, the season's second named tropical storm, dissipated into a disorganized low-pressure system in the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Saturday. Forecasters said the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season could be the worst since 2005, when Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma caused havoc in the Gulf Coast, damaging oil rigs and refineries and forcing sharp cuts in production. The hurricane season runs from June 1 through November 30 and often affects the Gulf of Mexico, home to about 30 percent of U.S. oil production, 11 percent of natural gas production, and more than 43 percent of U.S. refinery capacity. Oil and gas production shut as of Sunday was 746,338 barrels per day (bpd) of crude production and 1.41 billion cubic feet per day (cfd) in gas output, the U.S. government said.
