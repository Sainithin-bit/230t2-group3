 LJUBLJANA  (Reuters) - The Eurogroup chairman Jean-Claude Juncker said on Monday EU bank stress tests were done "in a very professional way," rejecting criticism that they had not been harsh enough. 

 Juncker also told reporters that economic recovery in the euro zone remained fragile, with possible downside risks, and that the time has come for monetary consolidation and structural reforms. Eurogroup comprises all euro zone finance ministers. (Reporting by Marja Novak)
