 LONDON  (Reuters) - A number of European banks may soon find it easier to fund their business after regulators probed the health of their industry across the continent, though the weakest players will struggle for longer. 

 "Not a lot has changed but perhaps the market will recognize that there is more strength in the system than some had thought. Several boxes have been ticked," said Martin Egan, global head of primary markets at BNP Paribas. Equity and credit markets gave last week's results the benefit of the doubt on Monday, taking at face value the finding that only seven out of 91 banks failed a test of whether they could withstand another severe economic downturn. More easily available bank funding would be a good result for politicians, under fire for their role in a crisis that left only the strongest banks able to fund themselves directly in the bond market. Other banks -- especially those in the weaker euro zone economies -- have increasingly relied on the European Central Bank, which has a number of funding programs in place. Spanish and Portuguese banks borrowed a record 136 billion euros and 40 billion euros respectively from the ECB in June. Since the onset of the sovereign debt crisis this year, only the top tier of European banks enjoy an unlimited ability to fund themselves directly via the bond markets, with the second tier's access intermittent, and the third tier shut out. Egan said it  would be a day or so before it would be clear whether investors are ready to fund the second tier of banks. "Does that mean now we no longer have a three-tier market for financial issuers? Unfortunately no, at least for the time being," said Robert Ellison, deputy head of the financial institutions group, debt capital markets at UBS. Europe found fewer banks failed than markets had expected in the eagerly awaited stress tests [ID:nNN2516007] and only 3.5 billion euros ($4.52 billion) in equity needed to be raised, though a much larger group scraped past narrowly. The Markit iTraxx credit indices had already rallied significantly heading into the tests, and the European senior financials index tightened by a further 5 basis points to 126 bps on Monday indicating a diminishing fear of default. It stood at 164 bps at the start of the month. "Whether or not we agree with the methodology of the exercise at least there is a lot more disclosure about the banks now," said UBS's Ellison. OPEN THE VAULTS The exam by Europe's regulators could ease a severe system blockage -- matching large piles of investor cash with banks' need to refinance 3.3 trillion euros of senior debt, half of it due in 2010-2012, according to Morgan Stanley estimates. But banks are unlikely to move in large numbers to sell debt just yet as long as investors are still absorbing the information provided. And for third-tier players, the markets will likely remain shut altogether. "It does not feel like we'll see investors really jump in too deep right now," said Egan. The European primary debt market normally slows down anyway during the European summer as issuers enter information blackout periods ahead of results and investors take a break. That might change if the new-found positive sentiment around the economy continues, and investors might turn to the lesser names if the best banks spreads tighten too fast. For now, the debate will focus on aspects of the test such as how sovereign debt exposure was treated, whether total tier 1 capital is an appropriate measure for solidity, and if the capital threshold of 6 percent ratio was too low. "The question is on which side the weight of subjective opinion comes down," said Alan Patterson, of Amias Berman & Co, a broker and advisory firm.
