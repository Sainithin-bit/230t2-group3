 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's government cannot continue to rely on excessive bond issuance to fund fiscal spending, the finance minister warned on Monday, as ruling Democratic Party officials wrangle over spending for the next fiscal year. 

 The cabinet is expected on Tuesday to approve guidelines for budget requests for the fiscal year starting in April 2011, and Democratic Party policy chief Koichiro Gemba wants 2 trillion yen ($23 billion) earmarked for the government's economic growth strategy and the party's campaign pledges. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshito Sengoku told reporters the government would set aside more than 1 trillion yen in the 2011/12 budget to support growth and people's livelihoods, and ministries would be asked to cut spending by 10 percent so money could be reallocated to areas with growth potential. Credit agencies have warned of possible downgrades to Japan's debt rating as the Democratic Party's loss in an upper house election this month jeopardized efforts to rein in the country's huge public debt. "Our finances are in the worst state compared with other developed countries and it is difficult to rely on bond issuance," Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said at a meeting of regional finance bureau chiefs. "We must work to rebuild our finances." The Democratic Party-led government has already agreed to cap general spending, which includes tax grants to local governments but excludes debt servicing costs, at 71 trillion yen and to limit new bond issuance to 44.3 trillion yen in next year's budget. But the strength of this commitment has come under doubt after the upper house election defeat, which has left Prime Minister Naoto Kan's Democrats without enough seats to pass legislation on their own and has raised the specter of infighting in the party. Japan's public debt is nearly twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, the worst ratio among industrialized nations. (Editing by  Charlotte Cooper )
