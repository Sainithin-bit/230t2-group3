 LONODN  (Reuters) - BP Plc Chief Executive Tony Hayward is to be nominated for a board position at its Russian venture TNK-BP when he steps down from his current role, Sky News reported, citing sources. 

 TNK-BP declined to comment on the Sky News report on Monday when contacted by Reuters. BP is expected to install American Bob Dudley as CEO, sources close to the company said, replacing Hayward who has come under fire for his gaffe-prone handling of the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Dudley, the U.S. executive managing the response operation to the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, is poised to get the top job in the next 24 hours, a move that could soften U.S. criticism of the British oil major. Shares in BP closed up 4.6 percent at 417 pence, valuing the business at about 80 billion pounds ($123.6 billion).
