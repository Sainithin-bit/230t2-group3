 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said on Monday he hoped the results of stress tests on the European banking system would help ease investors' concerns about its debt crisis. 

 Some investors and analysts have said the European Union's tests of banks' ability to withstand financial shocks, which was published on Friday, was too lenient. Seven out of 91 banks failed the tests. But the initial market reaction has been one of cautious optimism, suggesting there could be a pause in speculators' selling of euro-denominated assets due to worries that Greece's sovereign debt crisis had put the Continent's entire banking system at risk. The euro edged higher on Monday and the yen fell, while stocks in Japan, South Korea and Australia rose. "I expect these results will contribute to easing investors' worries about Europe," Noda told Reuters when asked whether the stress tests were too easy on European banks. The atmosphere last week leading up to the stress tests had been particularly trying for Japanese policy-makers as it pushed the yen higher against the dollar, threatening to harm Japan's exporters.
