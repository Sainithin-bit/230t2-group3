 (Reuters) - Intel Corp assured Clearwire Corp it is closely guarding its investment information on the wireless-broadband company after an insider-trading scandal surfaced last week, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing Clearwire chief executive Bill Morrow. 

 "It's necessary to ensure that information is properly protected," Morrow told the paper in an interview. Billionaire hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam and executives from some of the most prestigious U.S. companies were charged last week with the largest hedge fund insider-trading scheme ever. One of the criminal complaints accuses Rajaratnam of conspiring with Intel Capital treasury department managing director Rajiv Goel. Around March 2008, Rajaratnam's Galleon Group bought about 125,800 shares of Clearwire based on inside information about an investment Intel Capital was planning to make in the company, prosecutors have said. Intel could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters. Clearwire had raised about $3.2 billion in capital from investors, including Comcast, Intel, Time Warner Cable Inc and Google Inc.
