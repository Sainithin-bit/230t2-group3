 LONDON  (Reuters) - BAE Systems Chief Executive Mike Turner said on Thursday a probe launched by the U.S. Department of Justice was not holding back business for Europe's biggest defense company. 

 "It has not affected our business in the United States in any way," Turner told reporters on a conference call. The DoJ said in June it had launched an investigation into the British defense company's compliance with anti-bribery laws, including its past dealings with Saudi Arabia.
