 LONDON  (Reuters) - British defense contractor BAE Systems BA.L beat estimates with a 17 percent rise in mid-year underlying profits on Thursday as its armored vehicle business boosted growth. 

 Earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) rose to 700 million pounds ($1.42 billion), BAE said in a statement. "Building on the strong first half performance, the previously anticipated good growth outlook for 2007 as a whole is expected to benefit further from the US-led Land & Armaments and UK Programmes & Support sectors where growth is ahead of expectations," Europe's largest defense company said. Operating profit of 643 million pounds was up 19 percent, beating expectations of 614 million in a Reuters poll. Sales rose 8 percent to 6.891 billion pounds for the six months to June 30, slightly ahead of analysts' forecasts. It proposed a dividend of 5.0 pence versus 4.4p in the same period a year earlier. BAE said talks to finalize the sale of Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets to Saudi Arabia were continuing. "Negotiations continue towards a contract for the supply of Typhoon aircraft and associated training and support under the Understanding Document signed in December 2005 between the UK government and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia," it said. Executive director and board member Chris Geoghegan will leave at the end of the year and retire from the board, BAE said a day earlier.
