 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's largest insurer, Aviva ( AV.L ), reported an 8 percent drop in first-half operating profit, as the cost of Britain's heavy flooding weighed on its general insurance business and overshadowed growth in life. 

 But the insurer beat a key general insurance target and its new chief executive, former finance director Andrew Moss, sought to assuage concerns over acquisitions, saying on Thursday his priority was to realize the potential of Aviva's existing businesses. Worries that Aviva favored deals over organic growth have weighed on the group since it made a failed takeover approach for UK rival Prudential ( PRU.L ) in March last year, largely driven by its ambitions in Asia and the United States. Since then, however, Aviva has since accelerated growth there on its own. The company said operating profit, on a European embedded value (EEV) basis, fell to 1.54 billion pounds ($3.13 billion), just shy of an average forecast of 1.57 billion pounds, according to a Reuters poll, but within the range of forecasts. "The headline number is slightly disappointing, but only slightly," analyst Kevin Ryan at ING said. "The question is whether they will do something about the potential volatility of the non-life business. It's very much that that has derailed these numbers." Hit by 235 million pounds of weather losses after June's floods and January's Kyrill windstorm in Europe, first-half operating profit from general insurance dropped 34 percent to 560 million pounds. However, its closely watched combined operating ratio -- costs and claims as a percentage of premiums -- was 97 percent. That was worse than last year's 92 percent as weather and competitive pressures weighed, but ahead of the company's "meet or beat" target of 98 percent, lifted by Europe. A figure below 100 indicates an underwriting profit. Aviva shares were trading down 0.2 percent at 704 pence at 3:37 a.m. EDT, compared with a drop of 1.4 percent in the DJ Stoxx index of European insurance stocks .SXIP. LIFE CLIMBS Operating profit at Aviva's life business rose 24 percent to 1.25 billion pounds, boosted by its U.S. unit, after it bought insurer AmerUs last summer. Stronger margins in Britain, the United States and Asia helped offset a dip in Europe, where Spain weighed. The group's overall first-half margin was unchanged at 3.5 percent. Group sales jumped 25 percent to 19.29 billion pounds, helped by a proforma 51 percent jump in its U.S. business and by a 14 percent rise in sales in continental Europe, where it has signed a raft of distribution deals in the past few months. New business contribution -- net of required capital, tax and minorities -- rose 25 percent to 240 million pounds. Aviva raised its interim dividend 10 percent, in line with expectations, to 11.9 pence.
