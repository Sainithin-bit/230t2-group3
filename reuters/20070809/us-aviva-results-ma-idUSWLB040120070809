 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's largest insurer Aviva ( AV.L ) said on Thursday large acquisitions are not a priority, as it concentrates on organic growth, though it would still look at opportunities including bancassurance agreements. 

 "I've made a very firm statement that our top priority is to realize the full potential of our existing businesses," Aviva's new chief executive, former finance director Andrew Moss, told reporters on a conference call. "You shouldn't think we are not going to look for opportunities to expand...What that isn't, of course, is larger deals, which we don't think are a priority at this point." Aviva raised its interim dividend 10 percent, but Moss declined to comment on whether there was scope to accelerate that rise going forward. "We think a 10 percent increase in the dividend and the cash returns that our shareholders are seeing are very attractive and compare very favorably with companies in our sector and more broadly," Moss said. Aviva also said its exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage market was "negligible" at a group level.
