 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N on 
Wednesday said fourth-quarter profit rose 4.5 percent on higher 
advertising sales and affiliate revenue from the Fox News 
Channel and on more new subscribers at the Sky Italia satellite 
TV service. 

  News Corp, which said revenue was lower at its 20th Century 
Fox movie studios, said its fiscal fourth-quarter net income 
rose to $890 million, or 28 cents per share, from $852 million, 
or 27 cents per share, a year earlier.  Quarterly operating income rose 18 percent to $1.2 billion.  Revenue rose 8.6 percent to $7.37 billion.  Murdoch secured a $5.6 billion deal to buy Dow Jones & Co 
DJ.N, the publisher of the Wall Street Journal, for $60 per 
share last week.  Cable networks, including Fox News, posted operating income 
46 percent higher and revenue 17 percent higher.  News Corp's satellite television operation operating profit 
rose 84 percent and revenue rose 15 percent. It ended the 
quarter with 4.2 million customers.  Movie studios' operating profit fell nearly 50 percent and 
revenue fell 18.5 percent compared with the same period last 
year when it saw strong box office sales from "Ice Age: The 
Meltdown," the company said. Quarterly results were also 
dragged by costs from the release of "Fantastic Four."  Newspaper segment operating income rose 19.4 percent, 
reflecting higher contributions from its papers in the United 
Kingdom and Australia. Newspaper revenue rose 13 percent.  UK newspaper ad and circulation revenue fell, but 
promotional and employee costs also fell, News Corp said. The 
Australian papers reported higher ad revenue, but that was 
offset by increased costs for newsprint and production.  News Corp shares trade at a premium to its media 
conglomerate peers.  Its enterprise value -- market capitalization plus debt, 
minus cash -- trades at 11.57 times its estimated 2008 earnings 
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared 
with Time Warner Inc's ( TWX.N ) 7.75 and Walt Disney Co's 
( DIS.N ) 8.45 multiples.  (Reporting by  Kenneth Li )
