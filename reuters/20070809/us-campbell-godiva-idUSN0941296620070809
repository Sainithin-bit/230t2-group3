 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ) said on Thursday that it was exploring strategic alternatives for Godiva Chocolatier, including a possible sale of the luxury chocolate business. 

 A Campbell spokesman said the move was in order to focus on its core baked snacks and soup business. Campbell said it had retained Centerview Partners LLC as its financial advisor. (See  here  -- Reuters' retail and consumer blog)
