 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Top Japanese tire maker Bridgestone Corp. ( 5108.T ) posted a 21 percent rise in half-year operating profit on Thursday as the yen weakened and sales grew globally, especially in higher-margin segments. 

 The Tokyo-based company tweaked its recently increased full-year forecasts to reflect the slightly better-than-expected results for the first half, and raised its dividend by 2 yen to 26 yen for 2007. Bridgestone now expects 2007 operating profit of 215 billion yen ($1.80 billion), up 13 percent from last year, and net profit of 109 billion yen, up 28 percent, as a global sales expansion makes up for a rise in raw materials costs. That is up from its forecasts of 211 billion yen and 106 billion yen announced in late June, when it factored in a sharp drop in the yen's value beyond its initial assumption of 110 yen to the dollar and 140 yen to the euro. Consensus projections call for a much higher 226.9 billion yen and 115 billion yen, according to a survey of 11 brokerages by Reuters Estimates. Bridgestone estimates that a 1 yen rise in the dollar adds 1.6 billion yen to its operating profit, and about half that against the euro. On Thursday the dollar was trading around 119 yen and the euro around 164 yen. "Demand in the global tire market remains strong, especially in the construction sector," Chief Financial Officer Akira Nozawa told a news conference. "We continue to expect rosy sales in the second half." For January-June, operating profit was 102.01 billion yen ($852.6 million) while net profit rose 61 percent to 52.94 billion yen. Revenues grew 13 percent to 1.62 trillion yen, partly due to the addition of sales from Bandag Inc., a U.S. supplier of retread tires that Bridgestone acquired earlier this year. Pricier raw materials slashed 20 billion yen from its interim operating profit but an increase in product prices, sales volumes, a higher ratio of more expensive products and currency windfalls more than made up for the negatives, the company said. Nozawa said Bridgestone has managed to absorb about 60 percent of the rise in commodity prices with price hikes. French rival Michelin ( MICP.PA ) last month also reported a big improvement in first-half income, driven largely by solid demand in Europe, South America and Asia. Restructuring U.S. tire maker Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT.N reported an improvement in the latest quarter, but expects to be hit by shrinking demand for commercial truck tires in North America. Bridgestone shares ended up 2.5 percent at 2,690 yen before the announcement.
