 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ) said on Thursday that sales at stores open at least a year fell 5 percent in July, hurt by weakness at its LOFT chain. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting the company's same-store sales to fall 3.3 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales for the four weeks ended August 4 were $161 million, up 2.8 percent from the year-ago period.
