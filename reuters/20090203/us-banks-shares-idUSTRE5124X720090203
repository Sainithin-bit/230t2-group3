 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. bank shares fell about 5 percent on Tuesday as investors worried the government may have to nationalize the sector, or parts of it. 

 Bank of America Corp's ( BAC.N ) shares fell 8.5 percent to $5.49, while Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) fell 3.3 percent to $3.53. The broad KBW Banks index .BKX was down by about 4 percent at midday. "Investors are betting on a nationalization of Citi and BofA, which will force their stocks down to zero or close to zero," said Tom Sowanick, the chief investment officer for $22 billion in assets at Clearbrook Financial LLC, in Princeton, New Jersey. Bank of America said in January it received an additional $20 billion from the U.S. government under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the government is also sharing losses on $118 billion in residential and commercial mortgages, derivatives and corporate debt at the bank. This is similar to a an arrangement Citigroup agreed with the government in November, in which the government shoulders the bulk of losses on a $301 billion portfolio of risky assets.
