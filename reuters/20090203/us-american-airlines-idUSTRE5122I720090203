 MADRID  (Reuters) - American Airlines said on Tuesday it was holding off from any further capacity cuts despite "disappointing" forward bookings, easing months of gloom in a sector pummeled by weak traffic and economic sloth. 

 "Our advance bookings are down from where they were this time last year despite the capacity cuts, so that's disappointing, but not at this point so alarming that we are cutting more capacity," Chief Executive Gerard Arpey said. "But we are clearly watching carefully," he told journalists at a meeting of the 'oneworld' airline alliance in Madrid. AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, last month posted wider quarterly losses and warned that the economic slowdown in 2008 would likely continue this year, causing larger-than-expected job and route cuts. Arpey's comments came as Germany's Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ), a leading member of the rival Star Alliance grouping, delivered a surprise increase in its profit forecast, lifting sector shares. It raised its forecast for full-year 2008 operating profit, becoming the second European airline in as many days to say it could defy the tough industry environment after Ryanair ( RYA.I ). Looking ahead, however, Lufthansa said it anticipated higher than usual risks as demand remained weak. Lufthansa shares rose more than 5 percent. By contrast, Japan Airlines (JAL) 9205.T said in Madrid it was considering slashing 10 percent of international capacity and 2-3 percent from domestic flights in the coming fiscal year to adjust to weaker demand. "For the capacity we may cut almost 10 percent for the next fiscal year. For domestic routes we are just in a cut back, but very nominally, maybe 2 percent maybe 3 percent," JAL Vice President Tetsuya Takenaka told Reuters. American's Arpey said he was optimistic the U.S. carrier would receive anti-trust immunity in the U.S. for its alliance with British Airways BAY.L and Iberia IBLA.MC as soon as the early summer.
