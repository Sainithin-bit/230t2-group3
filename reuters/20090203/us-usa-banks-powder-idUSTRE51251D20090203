 DALLAS  (Reuters) - A New Mexico man has been arrested for sending more than 60 threatening letters, all but one of them laced with white powder, to banks and federal offices last October, U.S. authorities said on Tuesday. 

 Richard Leon Goyette, 47, was arrested on Monday at the airport in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement. Goyette is accused of sending an email on September 26 saying he had lost $63,525 on his stock in Washington Mutual Bank which was seized by U.S. banking regulators and sold to JP Morgan Chase and Co. The 65 letters were mailed through the U.S. Postal Service and were postmarked from Amarillo, Texas, on October 18, 2008. They were sent to branches of Chase Bank, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in 11 states and the District of Columbia. The OTS regulates savings banks and savings and loan associations. "Mr. Goyette's alleged criminal actions caused emergency responders and hazardous response teams immense unnecessary labor and expense ... and caused untold emotional distress to those who received the letters," James Jacks, acting U.S. Attorney for north Texas, said in the Justice Department statement. Sixty-four of the 65 letters contained an unidentified white power. They also said that the person breathing the powder would die within 10 days. Tests found no traces of dangerous materials. The criminal complaint charges that he "knowingly and intentionally conveyed false and misleading information." Investigators discovered that a computer in a library at the University of New Mexico's Albuquerque campus was used to find addresses that received the threatening letters. Investigators also said Goyette rented a car from October 17-18 in New Mexico and obtained permission to drive it into Texas.
