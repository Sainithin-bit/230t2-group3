 (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) hired more than 200 brokers in the United States in the fourth quarter as it sought to counter client defections, a report by Bloomberg said. 

 Switzerland's largest bank lured employees from Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and other competitors by offering signing bonuses of as much as 260 percent of the revenue the brokers brought in over the previous 12 months, Bloomberg said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. The agency also said UBS may report a loss of almost 18 billion francs for 2008 when it publishes results on February 10, citing a median estimate of eight analysts surveyed. The fourth-quarter deficit was probably 6.3 billion francs, Bloomberg added. UBS, hobbled by $49 billion of losses on subprime mortgage securities and other assets during the past two years, received a $5.2 billion capital injection from the Swiss government on October 16. The bank has shaken up its capital markets management ranks, announced plans to slash its exposure to capital intensive businesses and cut thousands of jobs. A UBS spokesman in Hong Kong was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters. (Reporting by Bhaswati Mukhopadhyay in Bangalore, editing by Will Waterman)
