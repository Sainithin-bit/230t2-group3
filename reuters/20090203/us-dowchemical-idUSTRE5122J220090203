 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co ( DOW.N ) posted a fourth-quarter loss on Tuesday, as sales and volumes fell sharply amid the global economic downturn. 

 The largest U.S. chemicals maker's net loss was $1.55 billion, or $1.68 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $472 million, or 49 cents a share. Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 62 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of 84 cents. The growing global recession has hit Dow and its peers in the chemical sector as demand has plummeted in key end markets like the construction, electronics and automotive industries. The company's performance plastics segment, which includes the Dow Automotive and Dow Building Solutions businesses, posted an operating loss of $479 million in the quarter. Dow has also suffered from a sharp slowdown in many emerging regions, which had been driving growth for the company in recent quarters. Over the last two years, Dow has launched a two-pronged strategy to revamp its earnings profile. The company first announced plans to sell a 50 percent stake in its highly cyclical basic plastics business to Kuwaiti investors for more than $9 billion. Then, in July, it announced plans to acquire specialty chemical maker Rohm and Haas Co ROH.N for more than $15 billion. Dow's plans faltered after Kuwait backed out of the joint venture just days before the deal was to close. The collapse of the deal with Kuwait has jeopardized Dow's plans to buy Rohm and Haas. Dow had intended to use proceeds from the joint venture to help fund the Rohm and Haas buy. Last month, Dow said it would not complete the Rohm and Haas deal on schedule, saying the recent economic downturn had made closing untenable at this time. Rohm and Haas has sued Dow and asked a Delaware court to compel the company to honor the merger agreement. Dow Chemical shares, which at Monday's close had fallen almost 70 percent over the last six months, were down 6.7 percent to $10.31 in trading before the market opened.
