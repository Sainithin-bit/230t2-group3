 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pending sales of existing U.S. homes rebounded in December, data showed on Tuesday, as buyers waded back into the market to take advantage of lower prices and mortgage interest rates. 

 KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in December, surged 6.3 percent to 87.7, rising for the first time since August. * Compared with the same period a year-ago, pending homes sale were up 2.1 percent in December. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales to be flat in December. November's pending home sales index was revised up to 82.5. COMMENTS: KEVIN KRUSZENSKI, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS, CLEVELAND: "One number doesn't make a trend. I don't think (investors) are going to key too much on this. The problem still lies with new homes and there's quite a bit of inventory out there." "But there's a glimmer of hope out there." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "It's a real shot in the arm for sentiment. Markets have been waffling and staying down in the dumps. But in an otherwise bleak landscape, this represents a ray of hope, as it's a leading indicator for existing home sales. I'm sure it's foreclosure-driven, so it could be a hollow number. But right now, it's improving sentiment. Stocks are rallying, as are the yen crosses. We made a high in the euro for the day but we need to see it hold over that to get things going again. Otherwise we're stock in a consolidation range." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Dow and S&P 500 turn positive. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices add to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends losses versus euro.
