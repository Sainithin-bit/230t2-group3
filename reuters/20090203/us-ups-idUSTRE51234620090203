 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc ( UPS.N ) reported a worse-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, and said the global economic decline had taken a heavy toll on package volumes, forcing it to cut costs, including freezing some wages. 

 "The severe decline in economic activity around the world resulted in sharply lower package and freight volumes for UPS," Chief Executive Scott Davis said in a statement. "Consequently, we're making the tough decisions necessary to adapt our enterprise to today's realities. "This includes changes in organizational structure, compensation and network configuration," he added. UPS said those cost-cutting measures have included eliminating some package handling operations, freezing management salaries and matching contributions for 401(k) plans. Like rival FedEx Corp ( FDX.N ), UPS is considered to be a bellwether of U.S. economic activity. In a healthy economy, businesses and consumers order and ship more goods, in a recession they do the opposite. UPS said talks continue with DHL on handling the Deutsche Post AG ( DPWGn.DE ) unit's U.S. domestic volumes, but those talks are difficult due to the current economic environment. The Atlanta-based company reported fourth-quarter net income of $254 million, or 25 cents a share, compared with $2.64 billion, or a loss of $2.52 a share a year earlier. Excluding a noncash $575 million charge related to a write-down in goodwill at the UPS Freight trucking unit due to the tough economy, UPS reported earnings per share of 83 cents. The fourth-quarter loss in 2007 was due to a $6.1 billion charge related to withdrawing employees from a multi-employer pension plan. Analysts had on average expected earnings per share for the quarter of 85 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "Thanks to the economy, the holiday season was horrible and that shows in their (UPS's) results," said Sandeep Kar, a transportation analyst at consulting company Frost & Sullivan. "Long term, all their ducks are in row and they've taken the right strategic decisions that will pay off in a few years. "In the meantime, they just have to weather the storm," he added. UPS reported revenue of $12.70 billion, compared with $13.40 billion in the same quarter in 2007. Analysts had expected revenue of $13.10 billion. "When the global economy catches a cold, there is no escaping it for UPS," said Keith Schoonmaker, an analyst at Morningstar. "Noncash charges have no bearing on their future performance." "UPS is delivering exactly what we'd expect: strong management in hard times." For the first quarter, UPS said it expects to earn between 52 cents and 68 cents per share. Analysts had expected earnings per share of 68 cents. UPS said that due to economic uncertainty, it would not provide an outlook beyond the first quarter. On a conference call with analysts, Davis said talks with DHL continue, but because of DHL's reduced needs as the U.S. economy slows, "we are finding it very difficult to reach an agreement." In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Deutsche Post CEO Frank Appel said the "coming weeks will show whether we will come to an agreement." DHL said in November it would halt its U.S. domestic service with the loss of 9,500 jobs, citing the slowing U.S. economy and the dominance of UPS and FedEx in their home market. UPS shares rose $3, or 7.2 percent, to $45.51 on the New York Stock Exchange in morning trading. (Editing by Maureen Bavdek)
