 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pending sales of existing U.S. homes rebounded in December, data showed on Tuesday, as buyers waded back into the market to take advantage of lower prices and mortgage interest rates. 

 KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in December, surged 6.3 percent to 87.7, rising for the first time since August. * Compared with the same period a year-ago, pending homes sale were up 2.1 percent in December. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales to be flat in December. November's pending home sales index was revised up to 82.5. COMMENTS: KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS, MINNEAPOLIS: "It's probably a bit of payback from prior months weakness. The competing information coming from the Census Bureau, the homeowner vacancy reports, would suggest that they're still an awfully large supply overhang that needs to be worked down. "Whether or not it breaks the trend of downward movement in home sales remains to be seen given the large declines in the prior three months." DOUG ROBERTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, CHANNEL CAPITAL RESEARCH, SHREWSBURY, NEW JERSEY: "The numbers are basically substantially higher than what was expected. Primarily what it shows is that there is clearing in the market, at these prices, but we have to remember that they are foreclosure sales, so that doesn't give us any underlying increase in demand, just an assurance that at some price there is movement in the market. "As it relates to the market, there's been so much gloom that anything considered less worse than expected tends to work pretty well. Just as with the ISM data, which was still in recessionary territory but beat expectations. Same thing. "I think any gain from this will be short-term. What people are looking for is employment data, and also ADP and ISM data. If there are any gains on this, they will be temporary." JOHN RYDING, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RDQ ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "It's an encouraging straw in the wind in the housing market that the pending home sales numbers were up, though we need to see a lot more straws in the wind before one can feel more positive about the housing market. "It's encouraging with what we saw here and what we saw in the existing home sales data. Though prices are coming down, transactions are getting done." "Some people are getting loans and making purchases. It's not enough to turn the housing market around yet but maybe it's an encouraging sign that things might get worse at a slower rate in the first half of this year." DAVID KELLY, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN ASSET MANAGEMENT, NEW YORK: "I think we've got to be very close to the bottom here. "The two reports on housing we got last week -- one said sales were up and one said sales were down, but they both showed that inventories were down heavily and prices were down heavily. "The second part of the story is interest rates. These pending home sales reflect some improvement in mortgage applications that we've seen as the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage headed toward 5 percent. It's now a little above that at this state. "Still, if you look at the combination of falling prices and relatively low mortgage rates, housing is more affordable today nationwide than at any time in the last almost 40 years. "When sales are at such a depressed level and inventories are falling I would expect the market to bounce." TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET  MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "We had heard that December was strong for home sales. That certainly reflects lower mortgage rates. We have seen rates tick up so we may see some givebacks in January. You also have the Treasury department coming up with some plan to send rates even lower. This home sales number is certainly a surprise. There appears to be bargain hunters out there. There appears to be some stabilization in some of the weakest markets. Some of those markets were held up, such as in the in the New York area because of the job market. This is certainly good news in terms of one step in the stabilization of housing prices. We're not out of the woods yet, but we're headed in the right direction with the building of new homes below the rate of household formation, therefore we continue to take excess data out of the market." BRIAN FABBRI, NORTH AMERICAN CHIEF ECONOMIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "Yes they are up, but it doesn't seem to me as though this is the bottom. I think what we are looking at in terms of pending home sales, just as we saw in existing home sales, are a lot of foreclosures that the banks have taken on are now being sold at particularly low prices and that is boosting some of this information. It means that someone is buying a house at a distressed price but it is still a foreclosed home that the banks are selling at truly distressed prices. I don't know that many of these distressed home sales include a mortgage along with the sale, and it is mortgage availability that we think is still an issue that will stymie demand for a while until more money is made available in the mortgage market." KEVIN KRUSZENSKI, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, KEYBANC CAPITAL MARKETS, CLEVELAND: "One number doesn't make a trend. I don't think (investors) are going to key too much on this. The problem still lies with new homes and there's quite a bit of inventory out there." "But there's a glimmer of hope out there." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "It's a real shot in the arm for sentiment. Markets have been waffling and staying down in the dumps. But in an otherwise bleak landscape, this represents a ray of hope, as it's a leading indicator for existing home sales. I'm sure it's foreclosure-driven, so it could be a hollow number. But right now, it's improving sentiment. Stocks are rallying, as are the yen crosses. We made a high in the euro for the day but we need to see it hold over that to get things going again. Otherwise we're stock in a consolidation range." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Dow and S&P 500 initially turn positive. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices add to losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends losses versus euro.
