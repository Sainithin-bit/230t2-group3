 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup, which has received more than $45 billion (31.7 billion pounds) from the government, said Tuesday it is putting $36.5 billion of capital to work in areas including mortgage lending, student loans and credit cards. 

 Most of the money will be funnelled into mortgages, the bank said. The bank is investing $25.7 billion into U.S. residential mortgages, including $10 billion in mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. About $1 billion will be used for government-guaranteed student loans, $1.5 billion for corporate loans, and $5.8 billion for credit-card lending. The bank has received $45 billion of capital from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Programme and has also issued $7 billion of preferred stock to the Treasury and the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp in exchange for the government guaranteeing a $301 billion portfolio of assets.
