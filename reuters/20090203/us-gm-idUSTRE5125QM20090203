 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) reported a 49 percent drop in January sales on Tuesday, a steeper-than-expected plunge that came as overall U.S. auto sales tumbled to their lowest level since 1982. 

 GM cut its first-quarter production plan and rolled out a new round of discounting in response to the sales decline, which was the largest sales drop for any of the major automakers. Shares of GM dropped more than 4 percent. GM, which has been struggling to restructure under the terms of a $13.4 billion federal bailout, said it estimated that overall U.S. auto sales for the month of January fell to near 9.8 million units on an annualized basis. That industrywide sales decline allowed China to surpass the United States as the world's largest auto market for the first time on a monthly basis in January, GM said. GM said its own retail sales through U.S. showrooms were off 38 percent, but sales to fleet operators, including car rental agencies, dropped by 80 percent. The automaker cut its first-quarter North American production plan to 380,000 vehicles, down from a forecast for 420,000 units of production offered a month earlier. GM also said it would offer zero-percent financing and cash rebates on slower-selling models in February. The automaker has suffered as credit tightened for its former captive finance arm, GMAC. In December, GMAC won approval to operate as a bank holding company and $6 billion in funding from the U.S. Treasury. The finance company, which is 51 percent owned by Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, posted a $7.5 billion fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday as a gain from a debt swap offset losses from its auto and mortgage units. Mark LaNeve, GM's sales chief for North America, said GMAC had financed about 5,000 GM vehicle sales in January after financing almost no sales in the fourth quarter when GM was driven to seek a federal bailout. But GM sales analyst Mike DiGiovanni said that tight credit continued to pressure industrywide U.S. auto sales. "People are coming in, wanting to buy vehicles and they're being turned down, just that simple," DiGiovanni said. "And we have to break and thaw the credit markets for consumers who want to buy automobiles." (Reporting by Kevin Krolicki; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
