 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Top executives from Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, JPMorgan and other banks will be called before Congress next week to explain how they spent billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bailouts, a senior Democrat said on Tuesday. 

 The Obama administration and lawmakers have grown increasingly concerned about banks failing to use the fresh capital to make loans that would help jump-start the sagging U.S. economy. Last week, the White House also criticized what it called "irresponsible" bonuses paid to executives at Wall Street companies receiving government help. The U.S. House Financial Services Committee will hold a February 11 hearing with CEOs from the first eight banks that participated in the Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a committee aide and chairman Barney Frank said on Tuesday. CEOs from State Street, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of New York Mellon also were invited testify at the hearing on TARP, the aide said. Combined, the eight banks have accepted more than $125 billion in taxpayer funds since October. "There has never, in my experience, been a greater division of opinion between people who are at the top of the pyramid of decision making... and the average citizen," said Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who has pledged to make broad reforms to financial regulation this year. Frank told a news conference he could see the U.S. Treasury Department asking Congress for more money beyond the $700 billion already allocated to the TARP fund, but declined to speculate on a dollar figure. The first half of the TARP money has already been spent. The Obama administration is now crafting stricter conditions for the final $350 billion in response to critics who say initial recipients got easy money with few restrictions on executive pay and dividend payments. Frank said the Treasury Department must show it is using the second half of the funds responsibly before Congress will authorize more money for TARP. "Until they are successful in showing Americans that the money is being used reasonably, they don't need to ask for it because they won't get it," Frank told reporters. Last week, the White House pledged action against big bonuses paid to executives at bailed-out Wall Street companies. Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri introduced a bill that would limit their compensation to $400,000 a year -- the amount paid to the U.S. president. CITI, JPMORGAN DEFEND ACTIONS Citigroup, a major recipient of federal funds, said on Tuesday that it will use $36.5 billion in bailout money to boost lending. The bank has also come under scrutiny for a $400-million New York Mets baseball stadium sponsorship deal and its now-abandoned plan to buy a $50-million corporate jet. Separately, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon on Tuesday defended paying bankers for tough jobs. Banks must be able to tap the best person -- and pay accordingly -- for the difficult job of reviving the banking industry, he told a New York conference. Dimon and the chief executives of Citigroup and Morgan Stanley have said they would not seek a bonus for 2008. Frank said the Obama administration must improve upon the prior administration's handling of TARP, and ensure that some of the money goes to foreclosure mitigation and more lending. Treasury is expected to say next week how it will use the final $350 billion to further assist the banking industry. Among the proposals being considered are creating a "bad bank" to buy troubled assets, a government insurance program to limit losses and more fresh capital. Frank also said Neil Barofsky, the chief government watchdog for the TARP, will demand that every firm receiving TARP funds fully account for how the money will be spent. On Thursday, Barofsky will testify at a Senate Banking Committee hearing on how the program can be improved. Also appearing will be the acting head of the U.S. Government Accountability Office and the chairwoman of a Congressionally-appointed oversight panel for TARP. Looking more broadly at executive compensation, Frank said the Federal Reserve, if assigned the role of systemic risk regulator, would have to set some restrictions on pay incentives that encourage excessive risk taking.
