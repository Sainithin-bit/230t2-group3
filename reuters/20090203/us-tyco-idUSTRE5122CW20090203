 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ) reported a 24 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Tuesday, as profits fell in all five of its business units, but results topped Wall Street forecasts. 

 Net earnings were $277 million, or 58 cents per share, in the first quarter ended on December 26, down from $363 million, or 73 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings excluding one-time items were 61 cents a share, compared with 48 cents expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue fell 8 percent to $4.43 billion, compared with Wall Street forecasts of $4.39 billion. Tyco attributed most of the sales decline to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, whose rise erodes the value of overseas sales. Tyco's electrical products segment reported double-digit declines in sales and operating profit, amid lower demand for steel and copper products. Sales and operating profits were also lower in Tyco's four other segments; the smallest decline was in the ADT security business. Tyco, which has proposed reincorporating from Bermuda to Switzerland, did not immediately provide a quarterly or full-year profit forecast. It said it would focus on reducing costs while positioning itself for long-term growth. The company's shares rose 1.7 percent to $20.69 in light premarket trading from Monday's close of $20.34 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Nick Zieminski; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
