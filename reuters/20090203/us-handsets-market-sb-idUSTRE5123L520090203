 (Reuters) - The world's fifth-largest mobile phone maker Motorola Inc forecast on Tuesday a deeper-than-expected first-quarter loss, and suspended its quarterly dividend, sending its shares down 10 percent.

The following is a summary of fourth-quarter sales in millions of units, as reported by the world's top five handset vendors.
