 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said on Tuesday it expects U.S. light vehicle sales to decline 35 percent across the industry in January to the lowest level in 26 years, extending a downturn that has forced major U.S. automakers to seek government aid. 

 Chrysler Vice Chairman Jim Press also told reporters the automaker was in intense discussions with Fiat SpA to hammer out the details of the proposed alliance and was not currently in talks with any other automakers for potential partnerships. Chrysler sees the annualized sales rate coming in below 10 million units in January as the sales atmosphere during the month showed no improvement from the depressed levels seen in December. "We got to get our arms around the fact that this is going to be normal for some time," Press said. Automakers are scheduled to report January U.S. vehicle sales later on Tuesday. U.S. auto sales, which typically account for about 20 percent of all retail sales, dropped by 18 percent in 2008 to a 16-year low of 13.2 million units. Chrysler, which began offering aggressive consumer incentives last month, said the promotion along with extensive production cuts helped the automaker reduce its inventory by 25,000 units to about 370,000 units by the end of January. The automaker's fleet sales also declined by 40,000 vehicles last month, Press said. He declined to reveal the sales results for Chrysler. In wide-ranging remarks, Press said the automaker has "ample" cash and he feels "good" about Chrysler's financial position. Press said Chrysler does not need a partner to prove to the U.S. government that it is a viable company. "We don't need Fiat to get through 2009 on cash position," Press said. "We are still viable." He also said that if the Fiat deal does not conclude, the automaker could possibly go back to some of the other parties it has had discussions with in the past. Chrysler, which is struggling to restructure under federal oversight and a $4 billion bailout program, has to meet certain cost cutting targets by February 17 to prove that the company is viable long-term. Press said Chrysler is in informal talks with banks on a debt-to-equity swap. (Editing by Dave Zimmerman)
