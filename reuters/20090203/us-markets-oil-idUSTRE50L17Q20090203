 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday after OPEC signaled it might deepen its record output cuts to help boost prices and drain bloated stockpiles. 

 Oil's gains were encouraged by an uptick on the equities markets, after better-than-expected U.S. pending home sales data boosted sentiment about the economy. U.S. light crude for March delivery rose 70 cents to settle at $40.78 a barrel, while London Brent rose 26 cents to $44.08 a barrel. The president of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries told Reuters on Tuesday the group could add to its agreed output cuts of 4.2 million barrels per day when it meets on March 15. "Prices do seem to have bottomed for now," said Kevin Norrish of Barclays Capital. "OPEC has probably taken more than enough off the market and there's a risk of over-tightening, in which case prices would go back up fairly swiftly." Slowing economic growth in the United States, China, Japan and other major consumers has dampened fuel use, swelled stocks and knocked more than $100 a barrel off the price of crude since its July peak near $150. OPEC has aggressively countered the consumption slowdown with deep output cuts and a Reuters survey showed the group, which pumps a third of the world's oil, had carried out about 67 percent of its production curb in January. Algeria's oil minister said Tuesday that there was a 50 percent chance the cartel could cut more production in March. "OPEC's latest adherence to their production cuts has been phenomenal," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. "And the fact that the stock market was up today on a bit of good economic news on housing -- all helped to pull up crude futures today," he added. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1.3 percent Tuesday, helped by data showing pending sales of previously owned U.S. homes surged in December. Adding support to prices Tuesday were oil worker labor disputes in the United States, Europe and Nigeria. Negotiators hashed out a contract for U.S. refinery and pipeline workers Tuesday afternoon, averting a strike that would have shut some 10 percent of the nation's fuel production capacity. In Europe, hundreds of contract workers at British energy facilities were protesting the use of foreign workers, though operations at refineries, power plants and pipelines remained unaffected. In Nigeria, the senior oil workers' union threatened to begin an indefinite strike Monday unless the government improved security in the Niger Delta, its restive oil heartland. Dealers were also awaiting U.S. crude inventory data due to be released by the American Petroleum Institute Tuesday. Analysts said the report was likely to show stocks rose for the sixth time in a row as refinery utilization remained curbed by seasonal maintenance. <EIA/S>.
