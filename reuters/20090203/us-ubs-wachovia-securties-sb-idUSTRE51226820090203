 (Reuters) - Swiss bank UBS AG has held preliminary talks with Wells Fargo & Co's Wachovia Securities about forging a joint venture of the pair's North American wealth-management units, the New York Post reported. 

 It is unclear at what stage the discussions are in, or exactly what form a joint venture might take, the paper said on Tuesday citing sources. One source told the paper a deal might never materialize. If an agreement is reached, it could enable UBS to cut costs at its U.S. wealth-management unit, the paper said. A UBS spokesman declined to comment. Wachovia Securities could not be immediately reached for comment. Wachovia, which was hobbled by mortgage-related losses and write-downs last year, was scooped up by Wells Fargo on January 1.
