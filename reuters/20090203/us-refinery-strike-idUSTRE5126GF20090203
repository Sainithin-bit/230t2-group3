 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - The United Steelworkers union and Shell Oil Co ( RDSa.L ) agreed to a basic contract for U.S. refineries and chemical plants on Tuesday, averting a possible nationwide strike by 30,000 energy industry workers, according to the union. 

 The new national agreement came days after the current contract was temporarily extended past its Sunday expiration to continue negotiations. Hourly workers represented by the Steelworkers will get a 3 percent, per year, pay increase for each of the three years of the contract and pay 20 percent of their healthcare costs, according to sources familiar with the agreement. The average national wage for U.S. refinery workers is $30.06 an hour. An analyst said the agreement staved off a possible jump in motor fuel prices. "American drivers should be breathing a sigh of relief that contract talks between refinery workers and management have been settled, preventing a strike," said Phil Flynn, an analyst at Alaron Trading. Pump prices climbed late last week as the Sunday deadline for a new contract loomed. Prices have fallen off since the announcement that talks for a new deal would continue. The union fell short in its goal of more stringent process safety protections for refinery and chemical plant workers. A push by the union for stricter safeguards delayed agreement to the wage and healthcare proposals accepted Tuesday. They were originally proposed on Saturday, one of the sources said. USW Vice President Gary Beevers, who led the union's negotiators, said in a stamen the U.S. economic recession weighed heavily in the decision to make Tuesday's agreement. "We certainly didn't want to contribute to the economic struggles of the American public by calling a national strike and possibly seeing the spiking of gas and diesel prices, home foreclosures of our members, or any other hardships," Beevers said. While a nationwide strike has been averted, local negotiations could lead to work stoppages at individual plants as workers and managers finish talks over site-specific contracts during the next several weeks. A spokesman for lead refiner negotiator Shell said the company was pleased with the agreement. "The current contracts remain in force until the respective local unions conclude bargaining and ratify their new contracts," said Shell spokesman Stan Mays. "We are optimistic agreements will be ratified at the local level in the near future." Many USW union locals have concluded talks and will sign contracts as soon as documents combining the national terms and local agreements can be drafted and approved by the union's leadership. One local union official said disappointment would be widespread among the union's members. "There's going to be some disappointed people because the industry's making so much money in spite of the tough times," said the official, who asked not be identified by name. The USW represents workers at 64 percent of U.S. refineries. At least 10 percent of U.S. refining capacity of 17.6 million barrels would have been idled in the days following a strike as top refiners BP Plc ( BP.L ) and Valero Energy Corp ( VLO.N ) promised to idle some for their refineries during a work stoppage.
