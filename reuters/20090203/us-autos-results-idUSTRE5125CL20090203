 PARIS  (Reuters) - Investors will be scanning the blighted auto sector for any respite from stretched cash flow and bloated inventories when French and German manufacturers report grim full-year results in the coming weeks. 

 Car sales have plummeted as the credit crunch and the worsening economic climate put the brakes on consumer spending. Major European automakers have already trimmed their full-year earnings targets to reflect the deteriorating outlook and may still miss these lowered objectives, analysts said. Italy's Fiat set the tone last month for an industry in the grip of crisis with results which sent its shares tumbling. But investors will not be focusing on the past. "Profits will be largely irrelevant," said Credit Suisse analyst Stuart Pearson. "Everyone will focus on inventory positions combined with cash-burn - where their debt positions finished, what credit lines are available and their near-term liquidity needs." CASH, INVENTORIES KEY "We've got a bit of a conundrum," said Nomura International analyst Michael Tyndall. "Manufacturers can keep their factories producing cars that go into inventory - which helps with margins, but investors will be more comfortable with lower inventories. "Counterintuitively, it could be that the market likes the manfuacturers with worse results that show they have managed working capital. The market does not want to see companies with high levels of inventory going into 2009," he added. Analysts are least pessimistic about German makers which look "best placed to preserve capital and offer the least chance of equity issuance or state intervention," said Bernstein analysts in a research note. "Germany is less of a worry because of the nature of their working capital and the slight better volumes," said Credit Suisse's Pearson. "VW's registration numbers have been very good, it has been late in making production cuts," agreed Tyndall. "But people may think it will have to make cuts in Q1 and it has said it may be loss-making in Q1." The group's annual press conference is on March 12, with its Audi unit reporting two days earlier. BMW INVENTORY BMW, due to report on March 18, "may have worse results but less inventory," Tyndall said, adding that "the advantage for the Germans over the French is that they have cash." Germany's Daimler is due to present results on Feb 17. Meanwhile in France, PSA Peugeot Citroen and Renault are due to report full year results on February 11 and 12 respectively. Both have already reported a slump in full year unit sales and cut profitability targets. And "the Fiat publication showed that cash burn could be severe," said Natixis analysts in a research note. "The problem for Renault is that it has had the Megane changeover, and a lot of yen debt when the yen is strengthening," said Tyndall. "PSA has been aggressive with production cuts and may find the middle ground," he added. SUPPLIERS SUFFERING TOO Suppliers are preparing for glum results statements too, as they fight the same dwindling sales and suffering from lower visibility on market trends than their carmaking counterparts. The world's largest automotive supplier, Germany's Robert Bosch, last week missed its full year margin target and warned that 2009 could be worse. In France, Tyndall said, Faurecia and Valeo - due to report on February 10 and 13 - "are going to have a very tough time trying to put a positive light on their results. We're expecting grim results, a tough outlook and a focus on preserving liquidity." Michelin should tell a different story, however, with the larger part of its business catering for consumers. "Replacement tire markets have been weak but should eventually recover," Tyndall said, adding that the French group "will talk about a sizeable raw material tailwind." German rival Continental AG, which reports on February 19, "is now 75 percent exposed to original equipment, and likely to feel the full force of world manufacturers slamming on the brakes in Q4 08," Natixis analysts said in a research note. OUTLOOK IMPOSSIBLE The car industry was turned upside down in 2008. Carmakers went into the year pursuing ambitious earnings targets and limped out of it slashing jobs, idling factories and lobbying for government help to survive. So investors are hoping for guidance on how companies will manage their capital expenditure, R&D costs and wage rates in the short-term, said Pearson. As for earnings guidance, Nomura's Tyndall said; "The market isn't looking for it, and won't believe it. They (the manufacturers) certainly won't give earnings targets - they would be particularly brave if they did." (Editing by  Marcel Michelson  and David Cowell)
