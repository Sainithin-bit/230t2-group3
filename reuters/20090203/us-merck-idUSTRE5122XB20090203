 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) reported better-than-expected fourth quarter profit on Tuesday, helped by cost controls and sales of its diabetes drugs. 

 The company earned $1.64 billion, or 78 cents per share. That compared with a loss of $1.63 billion, or 75 cents per share, in the year-earlier period, when Merck took a $4.85 billion charge related to a legal settlement for its withdrawn Vioxx arthritis drug. Excluding special items, earnings were 87 cents per share, 13 cents ahead of analysts' average estimate, according to Reuters Estimates.
