 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ) on Tuesday said sales at stores open at least a year rose just 0.4 percent in January, as consumers filled fewer prescriptions and cut back on buying general merchandise after the holidays. 

 Same-store pharmacy sales rose 1 percent, while same-store sales of general merchandise fell 0.9 percent. The results fell short of some forecasts. UBS analyst Neil Currie expected total same-store sales to rise 1.7 percent, with a 2.7 percent rise in pharmacy and a 1 percent decline in general merchandise. Pali Research analyst Robert Summers expected total same-store sales to be 2.7 percent higher, with a 4 percent rise in pharmacy and a 0.5 percent gain in general merchandise. While Walgreen's same-store sales growth was weaker than the 4.9 percent rise the chain posted in December, the results still outpace much of the retail industry. Analysts expect January same-store sales to fall 2.5 percent, according to recent Thomson Reuters data, which would be the worst sales month since it began tracking sales data in 2000. Many retailers will report their January sales on Thursday. Walgreen said total prescriptions filled at comparable stores declined 2 percent, due in part to more consumers filling 90-day prescriptions instead of 30-day prescriptions. Same-store pharmacy sales were hurt by generic drug introductions, since those typically sell for less than their branded counterparts. The sales were also pressured by having one fewer week day compared with a year ago, since customers tend to fill more prescriptions during the week than on weekends. While Walgreen did not specifically cite a weaker flu season, analysts have said a lower level of flu activity could hurt sales at drugstores. "The 2008-2009 flu season continues to trend below last year's levels, and we believe that traffic and same-store sales at the drugstores will be negatively impacted," Citigroup's Deborah Weinswig wrote in a research note on Monday. Total January sales rose 5.3 percent to $5.22 billion. Walgreen said it had 6,658 drugstores as of January 31, 586 more than a year earlier. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Maureen Bavdek)
