 Below are recent comments from members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries: SAUDI ARABIA -- Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi Dec 4: "All options are open."

In Doha on November 30, with U.S. oil near $90: "There is absolutely ample supply." In Singapore on November 28 when U.S. oil was about $94: "We observe with great concern the recent escalation of oil prices. But we believe that the world market is well supplied and petroleum inventories are comfortable." "There is no relationship between fundamentals and the price today. There is a mismatch. Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong." IRAN -- Iran's OPEC governor Hossein Kazempour Ardebili Dec 4 Abu Dhabi: "There is no need to do anything now...the market is well supplied." Dec 4 Tehran: "Currently there is no need for an increase in OPEC's production and the market has no shortage in crude supplies."

LIBYA -- OPEC delegation head Shokri Ghanem Dec 4 Abu Dhabi: If the market needs oil, we give oil," Ghanem said. "I don't think it needs it." "If OPEC makes a decision, I am not opposed if they can convince me. I need convincing."
