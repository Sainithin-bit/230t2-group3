 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Financial market anxiety has rebounded and the process of rebuilding confidence will be "long and slow", a top U.S. Treasury official said on Tuesday. 

 "As we head into year end, we are witnessing a resurgence of risk aversion and continued impaired liquidity across the credit spectrum," Assistant Secretary for Financial Matters Anthony Ryan told a financial markets conference in Paris. A copy of his remarks were made available to the media in Washington prior to delivery. "It will take additional time for markets to regain confidence, and we will likely witness more unforeseen challenges leading to more headlines and volatility as additional disclosures are made," Ryan, the senior Treasury official in charge of debt management, told the Euromoney Euro Fixed Income Forum. Problems in the U.S. subprime mortgage market spurred a global credit crunch in August and wary investors have been back on the defensive in recent weeks, concerned that the housing slowdown could tip the United States in recession. Ryan reiterated the U.S. government's argument that the credit market troubles were unfolding against a backdrop of strong global growth, which would benefit the U.S. economy. "Corporate profits are solid and global growth is boosting U.S. exports, helping to improve the current account balance. ... Importantly, core inflation remains contained," he said. Ryan did not refer to the U.S. currency directly. The dollar has notched fresh record lows against the euro and pound since August, making U.S. exports cheaper for foreign customers and aiding the trade balance. "While the U.S. economy does face serious headwinds from a weak housing market and high energy prices in addition to current credit market conditions, solid economic fundamentals should support continued growth," he said. Tame recent readings on core U.S. inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, has allowed the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 75 basis points since mid-September to 4.5 percent. Investors expect the Fed to ease by at least another 25 basis points at their next policy meeting, on December 11, to ward off further fallout from the housing problems. Ryan confirmed that the sector was still not out of the woods. "The correction in both home building and housing prices is still unfolding. The longer housing prices remain stagnant or fall, the greater the penalty to near-term economic growth and the bigger the effect on American families," he warned.
