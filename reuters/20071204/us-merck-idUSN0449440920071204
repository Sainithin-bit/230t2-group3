 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) forecast 2008 earnings on Tuesday at the lower end of expectations as it braces for increased competition against its top-selling osteoporosis drug. 

 The drug maker forecast 2008 earnings, excluding special items, of $3.28 to $3.38 per share. Analysts' average forecast is $3.37, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts said Merck's forecast was conservative, reflecting its desire to ensure that it meets or beats its estimate. But the company's projections for some products, such as vaccines, came in lower than some had expected. "It looks like Merck is setting a pretty low bar with these projections," said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. "I think you're seeing them set up a situation where they can easily meet the expectations." Merck shares have risen 35 percent this year, making the company a top gainer among components of the Dow Jones industrial average, fueled by strong sales of its diabetes drug Januvia, which was approved a year ago, and its cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil. But the company faces generic competition against its $3.1 billion osteoporosis drug Fosamax, as well as potential competition against Gardasil from GlaxoSmithKline Plc's ( GSK.L ) Cervarix, a product that is available in Europe but not yet approved in the United States. Last month Glaxo's chief executive, Jean-Pierre Garnier, said in an interview that he expects Cervarix to eventually secure 50 percent of the cervical cancer vaccine market. Both Gardasil and Cervarix protect against cancer-causing strains of the human papillomavirus (HPV). "CONSTRUCTIVE BUT CONSERVATIVE" "Given the loss of Fosamax in early 2008, we expected Merck to give constructive but conservative initial (earnings) guidance, but still fully expect actual results to come in ahead of that and move up for the year," said Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan. Merck shares fell nearly 4 percent in early trading but recouped their losses after Chief Executive Richard Clark told analysts the company's fundamentals are growing stronger, including "breathtaking" improvements in its manufacturing systems and cost controls. Clark also acknowledged the company prefers to be conservative in its forecasts. Merck is slated to meet on December 11 with investors and industry analysts to further review its strategy and its line of experimental products. The company on Tuesday said it will seek approvals next year for MK-524b -- which combines Merck's Zocor cholesterol fighter with an experimental drug called Cordaptive that raises "good" HDL cholesterol -- and an obesity drug called taranabant. Taranabant, like Sanofi-Aventis's ( SASY.PA ) drug rimonabant, blocks the so-called canniboid receptor, the same brain circuit that stimulates hunger in people smoking marijuana. But U.S. regulators earlier this year rejected the Sanofi drug due to its links to depression and suicidal thoughts. OBESITY VACUUM "If the data for taranabant are better than rimonabant, it will likely become a blockbuster drug because there is a vacuum in the obesity market now," said Mehta Partners analyst Shaojing Tong. Merck said it expects 2008 sales of its vaccines to rise to between $4.8 billion and $5.2 billion. Some analysts had expected $5.5 billion. Merck expects 2007 earnings of $3.08 to $3.14 per share, excluding special items. Analysts' average forecast is $3.14. The company projected 2008 net earnings of $3.96 to $4.06 per share, including a big gain associated with its partnership with AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ). The drug maker said it remains on track to post double-digit compound annual earnings-per-share growth from 2005 to 2010, excluding special items. It said it would take a pretax charge of $670 million this year in connection with the anticipated resolution of civil investigations, some dating back to 2002, by federal and state authorities relating to certain past marketing and selling activities. Merck also expects a fourth-quarter pretax gain of $450 million related to insurance coverage for costs incurred in its Vioxx product liability litigation. Merck agreed last month to pay $4.85 billion to settle most claims that Vioxx, its withdrawn painkiller, caused heart attacks and strokes in thousands of users. Merck shares were up 10 cents in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $58.87, down from a year high of $60.29 reached on November 29.
