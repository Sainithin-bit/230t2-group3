 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policy-makers on Monday gave a sober assessment of the U.S. economy as renewed financial market turmoil cast a shadow on growth prospects. 

 Such views reinforced market expectations that the U.S. central bank will cut short-term interest rates next week for a third consecutive time when its Federal Open Market Committee meets. The Fed has cut its benchmark federal funds rate by a cumulative 75 basis points since mid-September to prevent economic fallout from market turmoil that originated with problems in the U.S. mortgage market. "Since the October FOMC meeting, financial conditions have deteriorated, and we have seen some unexpected softening in the economic data," San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank President Janet Yellen said in a speech to business leaders in Seattle. "These developments necessitate some rethinking of my growth forecast, and have highlighted the downside skew in the risks to that forecast," said Yellen, not a voting member this year on the Fed's rate-setting committee. Renewed credit concerns were the main focus of markets on Monday. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell to 3.88 percent while stock prices retreated as financial shares sank. After the October FOMC meeting, the Fed said the risks of slower growth were balanced with those of higher inflation, and subsequent remarks by various Fed policy-makers had implied that the Fed did not see the need for further easing. But last week, both Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said that renewed financial turmoil may have a larger adverse effect on the economy, signaling that downside risks had increased. The Fed will hold its next policy meeting on December 11. Yellen echoed Bernanke and Kohn, saying the outlook was particularly uncertain now due to financial conditions. "Developments have been fast-moving," she told reporters after the speech. "A lot of things have happened in financial markets." Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren, speaking in Boston, said the U.S. economy will grow "well below" potential in coming quarters, and the foreclosure crisis plaguing the housing and banking sectors is likely to worsen. Rosengren, a voting member on the FOMC this year, did not elaborate further on the economy and focused most of his speech on subprime mortgage problems. He said lenders and borrowers should work together to modify loans to avoid even greater pain for both sides. DOWNSIDE RISKS In her speech, Yellen elaborated on the possible downside risks to the economy, highlighting that the recent tightening of credit conditions would further worsen the housing sector, which in turn could prompt consumers to refrain from spending. On inflation, Yellen said consumer prices were expected to rise broadly in line with price stability, although there were some "notable upside risks" such as higher labor costs, a weaker dollar and rising energy prices. She added that more economic data to be released ahead of next week's FOMC meeting would have to be incorporated into the outlook. Monthly payroll data will be released on Friday. Economic growth for the last three months of the year will likely be sluggish, Yellen said, and growth may come in weaker than she had previously anticipated over the next few quarters due to the possible adverse effects of financial turmoil. "The fourth quarter is sizing up to show only very meager growth," she told the Seattle Community Development Roundtable and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce Board of Trustees. While that probably reflects some "payback" from strong growth earlier this year, it also may reflect some impact of the financial turmoil, she said. "If so, a more prolonged period of sluggishness in demand seems more likely," she said. While an "all-out credit crunch" has not emerged, tighter lending conditions as lenders worry about the economic outlook may hurt households and businesses, she said. But Yellen noted that not all the data was negative. The labor market remained fairly robust, and business investment was also fairly strong, though recent data suggested some deceleration, she said. Net exports are a "huge bright spot in the economy" and will bolster the economy going forward. The weakening of the U.S. dollar has improved the massive U.S. trade deficit and offset some of the effects of tighter credit conditions and lower equity prices, although a weaker dollar also lowers the purchasing power of American consumers, Yellen said.
