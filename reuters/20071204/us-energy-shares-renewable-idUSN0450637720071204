 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The shares of renewable energy companies rose on Tuesday in anticipation of Congress approving an energy bill that environmentalists have hailed for tough action on automobile fuel efficiency. 

 China-based LDK Solar Co Ltd ( LDK.N ), which is undergoing an independent audit over allegations it overstated the value of its polysilicon inventories, also saw its stock rise on a report it will tap $700 million in long-term debt and credit lines and about $100 million in customer prepayments. Telephone calls to the company's office in Sunnyvale, California, requesting confirmation from Chief Financial Officer Jack Lai and from its public relations officials were not immediately returned. Last Friday, LDK, which manufactures multicrystalline solar wafers used in solar cells, said it has secured an additional 312 tonnes of polysilicon supplies for 2008. On the New York Stock Exchange, LDK Solar closed up $8.67, or 26.84 percent, at $40.97, and Trina Solar Ltd ( TSL.N ) gained 8.2 percent at $48.98. On Nasdaq, Solarfun Power Holdings Co Ltd SOLF.O finished the day $5.65, or 27.43 percent ahead at $26.25, China Sunergy Co Ltd ( CSUN.O ) rose 12.85 percent to $10.45, and Canadian Solar Inc ( CSIQ.O ) was up 15 percent at $18.70. In options trading, 45,000 calls compared with 13,000 puts changed hands in LDK, which was four times its average volume, according to market research firm Trade Alert. "The House of Representatives is expected to vote on an energy bill within the next two days. An energy bill before Congress is expected to move quickly," said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. "The main issue is alternative energy. If approved this is perceived as a positive for LDK and other stocks in the sector," he said. "LDK calls, conveying the right to buy the stock as high as $80 per share, are active this morning." The House is expected to vote on an energy bill this week after Speaker Nancy Pelosi struck a deal with Michigan Rep. John Dingell, a long-time champion of Detroit automakers such as General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ), to raise fuel-economy standards to 35 miles per gallon by 2020. Environmental groups have hailed the deal as historic, because it would be the first time Congress has taken significant action on fuel efficiency since the 1980s. But it is still uncertain whether production tax credits for solar, wind and other alternative energy sources will be in the bill. Pete Najarian, co-founder of Web information site optionmonster.com in Chicago said: "What we are seeing are more and more companies such as Solarfun reacting to solar as a renewable energy. The call speculation has been building in many of the names." Solarfun said on Tuesday that Good Energies, an investor in the renewable energy and energy efficiency industry, agreed to purchase about 66.7 million ordinary shares and 281,011 American Depository Shares from current shareholders. The investment would raise Good Energies' stake in the company to about 34.7 percent from 6.3 percent.
