 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Germany exposed mounting unease over the euro's rise against the dollar and other currencies as European finance ministers met on Tuesday with survival warnings from European planemaker Airbus ringing in their ears. 

 German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck changed tone overnight to denounce exchange rate trends as "disorderly" and declare G7 powers may need to talk tougher on the dollar, which hit an all-time low versus the euro on November 23. That amounted to a new message from a man who until now had made a point of saying Germany's export machine, the world leader, was weathering the euro's relentless rise against the dollar, the yen and China's state-controlled yuan. His comments coincided with warnings that Airbus would have to shift some production out of the 13-country euro zone to survive in a battle against U.S. archrival Boeing, which can produce planes at lower labor and component cost. Steinbrueck told reporters overnight: "At the moment we have a disorderly adjustment and unwinding." He spoke after a regular meeting with euro zone colleagues and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet, talks that were broadened on Tuesday to include finance ministers from the rest of the 27-nation European Union, without Trichet. He also said, as he has before, that the German economy was still coping well. With regard to complaints from some companies, he countered that the trade-weighted rise in the euro this year was limited to 4 percent. The euro is more than 20 percent higher against the dollar than two years ago and hit record peaks recently versus the yen, while China's currency has lost ground to the euro but gained against the dollar. That makes life harder for European exporters competing on world markets. Steinbrueck said appeals to Beijing on the yuan, or renminbi, could not produce a fast fix for European concerns that China has an unfairly weak currency. Trichet pressed Europe's case in meetings last month with Chinese leaders in Beijing. Commerzbank currency investment analyst Gavin Friend said if Steinbrueck's comments were very deliberate it amounted to a distinct change of tone, especially if the view was in any way shared by the ECB's Trichet and others. "I'm skeptical. If it's true he has raised the bar," Friend said. DON'T PACK YOUR BAGS TOO FAST Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the Eurogroup forum where Trichet and euro zone ministers confer on strategy, appealed to the likes of Airbus to think twice before moving production and jobs out of the euro zone. "It's the flurry of announcements that worries me," he told a news conference after Eurogroup deliberations finished late on Monday. "I'd advise the people taking such decisions to think about their merits in the medium term." Louis Gallois, head of Airbus parent company EADS, said on Monday that moving some Airbus production outside the euro zone would be needed to survive due to the continued slide of the dollar versus the euro. "I don't think we're going to have much choice," he said in an interview on French Europe 1 radio. "It's no longer taboo and it risks becoming an obligation if we want to keep going ... nobody knows where the dollar will stop, that's the problem for us," he said. Much of Airbus's plants and jobs are in France and Germany. France's Dassault Aviation issued similar warnings over the weekend, in comments from chief executive Charles Edelstenne carried by Le Monde newspaper in its Saturday edition. Dassault lost out to Lockheed Martin in October when Morocco, traditionally an ally of France, rejected its multi-role Rafale jet in favor of the cheaper U.S.-built F16s. The weaker dollar can help American exporters at a time when the U.S. economy is suffering from a housing slump, trouble in mortgage markets and a now-global credit crunch. "Exports are a huge bright spot in the economy ... and a source of strength going forward," Janet Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said on Monday. Juncker nevertheless said he detected greater willingness from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to stress that currency markets should pay heed to the U.S. administration's line that a strong dollar was in U.S. interests. Ministers heading into the second day of talks in Brussels on Tuesday remained mostly tight-lipped after the previous day's discussions in the Eurogroup focused on risks to growth and higher inflation. Austrian Finance Minister Wilhelm Molterer said he remained optimistic about growth and jobs despite the credit crunch, which snowballed in August from what started as a debt default crisis in the high-risk end of the U.S. mortgage market. "I am still optimistic when talking about economic perspectives," he said. "Growth rates are still OK, job creation is still OK. That means Europe is in a good position, it's a strong economy. Those are the perspectives for the next year. Of course it is necessary to be careful."
