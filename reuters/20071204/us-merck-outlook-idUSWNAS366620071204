 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co ( MRK.N ) forecast 2008 earnings on Tuesday whose range was mostly below expectations, sending the drug company's shares down 1.4 percent in pre-market electronic trading. 

 Merck projected 2008 earnings, excluding special items, of $3.28 to $3.38 per share, a range that just barely hits the average analyst estimate of $3.37 a share as polled by Reuters Estimates. "It looks like Merck is setting a pretty low bar with these projections," said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. "In the past the company has gotten into trouble when it has set too high expectations, so I think you're seeing them set up a situation where they can easily meet the expectations." Merck's share price has risen 35 percent this year, a top gainer among members of the Dow Jones industrial average. The company anticipates 2007 earnings of $3.08 to $3.14 per share excluding special items. Analysts on average expected $3.14 for 2007. Merck projected 2008 net earnings of $3.96 to $4.06 per share, including a big gain associated with its partnership with AstraZeneca Plc ( AZN.L ). Merck projected that sales of its Singulair respiratory drug would continue to grow, seen hitting $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion next year. Sales of its vaccines, which are fairly new products, are expected to rise to $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion. The drugmaker said it remains on track to post double-digit compound annual earnings per share growth from 2005 to 2010, excluding items. The company said it would take a pretax charge of $670 million this year in connection with the anticipated resolution of civil investigations by federal and state authorities relating to certain past marketing and selling activities. Merck also expects a fourth-quarter pretax gain of about $450 million relating to insurance proceeds which it won from arbitration with some insurance carriers relating to coverage for costs incurred in its Vioxx product liability litigation. Merck agreed last month to pay $4.85 billion to settle most claims that Vioxx, its withdrawn painkiller, caused heart attacks and strokes in thousands of users.
