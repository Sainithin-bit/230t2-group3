 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O said on Tuesday its board authorized a $10 billion stock buyback and its repurchase program would resume this week, sending shares of the computer maker up 2 percent. 

 The authorized repurchase represents about 18 percent of Dell's market capitalization of about $55 billion. "Dell is committed to a long-term share repurchase program as part of an overall capital allocation plan that supports growth and also returns value to shareholders," Dell Chairman and Chief Executive Michael Dell said in a statement at an annual shareholders meeting in Texas on Tuesday. Shares of Dell, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, rose to $24.39 in pre-market trading from their Monday close on Nasdaq of $23.94. The stock fell as much as 15 percent last week after Dell reported lower-than-expected third-quarter profit margins and warned that rising costs could depress future earnings. The Round Rock, Texas-based company is facing greater competition from Asian rivals including Acer Inc ( 2353.TW ) and Lenovo Group Ltd ( 0992.HK ), as well as market leader Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ). In June, Dell began to sell PCs in retail stores for the first time after 23 years of direct-only sales via the telephone or Internet. (Reporting by  Kenneth Li , editing by Steve Orlofsky)
