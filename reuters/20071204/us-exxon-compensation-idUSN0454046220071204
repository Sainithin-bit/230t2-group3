 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) on Tuesday said it gave Chief Executive Rex Tillerson a cash bonus and restricted stock currently valued at close to $20 million under its short-term incentive plan for 2007. 

 The company said in a filing with U.S. regulators that it gave Tillerson a cash bonus of $3.36 million as well as 185,000 restricted shares under the plan. At Monday's close, those shares were worth about $16.4 million. Exxon, the largest U.S. oil company, said Tillerson's annual salary will increase to $1.87 million, a 7 percent hike from the $1.75 million he is earning this year. Tillerson succeeded Lee Raymond as Exxon Mobil's CEO in December 2005. The company has earned close to $29 billion through the first three quarters of 2007 as oil prices surged to record levels. In 2006, Exxon had record profits of $39.5 billion. Exxon's shares were trading down 55 cents at $88.30 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up over 15 percent since the beginning of the year, but have underperformed the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index, which is up around 24 percent in the same period.
