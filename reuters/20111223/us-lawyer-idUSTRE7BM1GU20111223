 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News Corp ( NWSA.O ) is close to hiring Gerson Zweifach as its top corporate lawyer, bringing in the highly regarded litigator at a time when the company is dealing with the fallout from its phone-hacking scandal. 
 News Corp's discussions with Zweifach, a partner with Williams & Connolly, are at an advanced stage and a deal could be announced as early as next week, according to a source close to the matter. The source declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the talks. A News Corp representative declined to comment. Zweifach could not be immediately reached for comment. A 29-year veteran at White & Connolly, Zweifach's work as a litigator has focused on securities and antitrust cases. Among other clients, he has represented former New York Stock Exchange Chief Executive Richard Grasso and AstraZeneca Plc's ( AZN.L ) Medimmune unit. Zweifach would replace Lawrence Jacobs, who resigned in June. News Corp has been considering both internal and external candidates since then.
