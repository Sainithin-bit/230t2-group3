 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Ethan Allen Interiors Inc ( ETH.N ) and Victory Land Group Thursday recalled 37,250 cribs on reports of suffocation and fall hazards that led to injuries in infants. 

 The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and Victory Land Group, which sells these cribs at Kmart Corp, a unit of Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ), said they got 17 reports of incidents involving drop-side rail detachments from the cribs. Three infants received bruises and abrasions to the neck, back and legs after becoming entrapped, the CPSC said. Private company Angel Line recalled about 3,400 cribs citing drop-side rail hardware malfunction, the CPSC said. The recalls come two days after Graco Children's Products Inc, a unit of Newell Rubbermaid ( NWL.N ), recalled about 2 million baby strollers sold before 2008 at major U.S. retailers, after four infants died of strangulation. Furniture retailer Ethan Allen received five reports of incidents involving the crib's drop-side detaching, resulting in bumps and bruises to three children. Shares of the company, which have risen 7 percent in the last three months, were trading down 3 percent at $15.60 Friday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.
