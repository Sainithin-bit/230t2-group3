 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mall owner General Growth Properties Inc ( GGP.N ), which was cleared on Thursday to exit bankruptcy, is negotiating to hire Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) executive Sandeep Mathrani to be its next chief executive, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 A board committee overseeing the search has focused on Mathrani as its prime candidate after a six-week search but talks with him could yet hit an impasse, the Journal reported, citing those people. General Growth, the No. 2 U.S. mall operator owner after Simon Property Group ( SPG.N ), is expected to emerge from bankruptcy around November 8.
