 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) expects sales to rise 5 percent or more next year, with profit at its four divisions rising 10 percent or more, top executives told investors on Friday. 

 "It's reasonable to anticipate approximately 5 percent-plus recorded top line sales growth for Honeywell in 2011 over the expected 2010 sales of $33 billion," Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson told analysts on a conference call. "Currency, of course, foreign exchange will obviously be an influence here and would impact the year-over-year. We also have a path we believe to double-digit segment profit growth for 2011." That is roughly in line with Wall Street forecasts. Analysts, on average, expect 2011 revenue of $35.3 billion, which would represent growth of 7.6 percent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Wall Street expects 2011 earnings per share of $3.03, excluding one-time items. Honeywell on Friday reported better-than-expected third-quarter profit. Net earnings were down, reflecting the company's aggressive approach to pension accounting. It expects pension funding to weigh on next year's net earnings by $350 million to $400 million, Anderson said. (Reporting by  Scott Malone ; editing by John Wallace)
