 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) topped Wall Street's profit expectations, citing a pickup in demand for products including spare parts for airplanes and automotive turbochargers. 

 The diversified manufacturer said on Friday that third-quarter net income fell to $499 million, or 64 cents per share, from $608 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. The 18 percent decline reflected the company's aggressive approach to pension accounting. Analysts on average had looked for profit of 62 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Honeywell raised its full-year profit target to $2.52 per share, excluding the noncash pension charges, from its most recent forecast of $2.40 to $2.50. That marked the third time the company has raised the target this year. Analysts had looked for full-year profit of $2.53 per share. Revenue rose 9 percent to $8.39 billion. Honeywell, the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics, reported a pickup in demand at its aerospace division, as airlines that held off on major maintenance projects last year need to resume major service of their fleets. United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), which reported third-quarter results earlier this week, also benefited from this trend. Morris Township, New Jersey-based Honeywell, which also makes systems for controlling large buildings, closed its $1.1 billion acquisition of French security-equipment maker Sperian Protection during the quarter. So far this year, Honeywell shares have gained about 18 percent, outpacing the 14 percent rise of the Standard & Poor's capital goods industry index .GSPIC and more than three times the rise of the broad S&P 500  .SPX . The company's competitors include United Tech in aerospace and building control systems, Goodrich Corp GR.N in aviation and DuPont Co ( DD.N ) in specialty materials.
