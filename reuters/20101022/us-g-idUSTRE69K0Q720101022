 GYEONGJU, South Korea  (Reuters) - Finance leaders from the Group of 20 economies will pledge on Saturday to commit themselves to pursue market-determined exchange rates and refrain from "competitive devaluation" of their currencies, a U.S. official said. 

 A communique to be issued at the conclusion of G20 finance ministers' and central bank governors' meeting here will state: "We're all committed to moving toward market determined exchange rates that reflect underlying fundamentals and refrain from competitive devaluation," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
