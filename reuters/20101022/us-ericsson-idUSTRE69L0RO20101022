 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ) reversed a year of falling sales in the July-September period, raising expectations the mobile network gear market has bottomed out, while cost cuts and high-margin upgrades boosted profits. 

 The company said it expected supply chain problems to ease further in the months ahead but they would continue to crimp revenues. The telecoms equipment market has remained sluggish after the global downturn as operators focus on costs. A surge in data traffic due to smartphones like Apple ( AAPL.O )'s iPhone has yet to lead operators to invest heavily in increasing capacity. Ericsson said operator capex had continued to fall in the first half of the year, but saw signs of improvement. "We have had four quarters of negative growth, this was the first quarter ... we actually had a positive growth -- of 2 percent," Chief Executive Hans Vestberg said. "Even though it is small, it is an important one for us." The global economic rebound has touched off a scramble among telecoms firms, car makers, consumer electronics suppliers and other manufacturers for common parts such as computer chips, leading to supply problems. Ericsson rival Nokia Siemens Networks NSN.UL saw sales rise 7 percent in the third quarter against the same period last year [ID:nSAB023704] but was also hurt by a scarcity of parts. Alcatel Lucent ( ALUA.PA ) sees the shortages stretching into next year. The industry-wide component shortage cut sales by 2-3 billion crowns in Ericsson's third quarter. "There is a shortage of components that will impact the fourth quarter," Vestberg said. "We see, however, a gradual improvement." Pierre Ferragu, analyst at Sanford Bernstein, said he expected Ericsson to see further benefits from supply chain improvements, a rising market in India and growing demand for mobile broadband in Europe. Ericsson's gross margin is likely to slip as business in India and Europe is likely to be low-margin initially. "But we also see that largely compensated by the growth opportunity," Ferragu said. Banking group WestLB raised Ericsson to "buy" from "neutral" after the report. "We think the share is clearly undervalued," said WestLB analyst Thomas Langer. Ericsson shares were 4.45 percent higher at 75.100 crowns at 1455 GMT, outpacing a 1.00 percent gain in the European tech index .SX8P. Ericsson shares had been falling steadily from near 90 crowns in July due to weak second-quarter results. CUT COSTS Ericsson has combated the tough environment by slashing annual costs by more than 15 billion crowns ($2.25 billion) in the past 18 months and, in recent quarters, has benefited from a higher proportion of network upgrades and expansions in its business mix, padding margins and profits. Ericsson will take around 1.5 billion in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter as it trims more fat from its business. It said cost cutting would remain in focus. Third quarter profit surged to 6.2 billion crowns ($931 million), easily beating the average estimate of 5.5 billion in a Reuters poll, which was also what the company earned in the same quarter a year ago. The key Networks unit, which accounts for more than half of group sales, increased revenue 6 percent year-on-year while the unit's margins also improved. That helped push group margins to 39 percent from 36 percent a year earlier. Ericsson, which reckons about 40 percent of all mobile calls pass through its networks, saw sales rise to 47.5 billion crowns, lagging the average market forecast by 1 billion.
