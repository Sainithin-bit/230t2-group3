 GYEONGJU, South Korea  (Reuters) - Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said on Friday that U.S. proposals to target current account balances as a mean to rebalance the global economy were "constructive." 

 Referring to proposals floated by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Swan said "it's one way of dealing with such a challenge, and a constructive one. From our perspective when it comes to current accounts, not one size fits all." "We see a floating exchange rate as an important shock absorber in our economy," he said. Swan said Australia was committed to flexible exchange rate despite the Australian dollar briefly reaching a parity against the U.S. dollar last. Australia's current account deficit is 4.25 percent. Earlier, G20 finance officials started two days of meetings by discussing a U.S. proposal to set a target of 4 percent of gross domestic product for current account balances.
