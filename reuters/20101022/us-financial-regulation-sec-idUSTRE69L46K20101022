 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Any more changes to U.S. stock markets are on hold at least until December, sources said, as the Wall Street reform bill preoccupies regulators dealing with fallout from the May "flash crash." 

 Rules to make anonymous trading venues known as dark pools more transparent and to ban flash orders that exchanges show to some traders before routing them to the wider marketplace will not be adopted before the end of the year, said two sources familiar with the matter. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is swamped with writing more than 100 new rules included in the Dodd-Frank bill enacted in July to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. The May 6 flash crash has spurred some reforms, such as trading pauses known as circuit breakers. But several others, such as the dark pool changes, will not receive the SEC's stamp of approval this year, the sources said. Though staff at the Big Board and other exchanges are helping regulators write the rules, the SEC is taking longer than expected to react to the unprecedented market crash. It took nearly five months for the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to produce a comprehensive report on what caused the crash. Any further changes could revamp the way tens of trillions of dollars circulate through cash equity markets and change the trading strategies of banks, hedge funds and big proprietary trading firms. An SEC plan to crack down on sponsored access -- in which high-speed traders borrow a broker's license to get fast and direct access to exchanges -- will likely be adopted first because it is least controversial, said the sources, who were not authorized to speak to the press. But the sources were wary that this could be adopted before the end of the year. PILOT PROGRAM One month after the market crash, the SEC acted with uncharacteristic speed and rolled out a pilot program to give a single stock a five-minute reprieve if that stock fell more than 10 percent in five minutes. But that program is due to end December 10 and the SEC is pressuring the exchanges to develop a "limit up/limit down" proposal by early December, the sources said. This would set temporary price ceilings and floors for individual stocks that would refresh regularly through the day, slowing any big price changes without halting trading altogether. Limit up/limit down could replace or work in tandem with the market-wide circuit breakers that the SEC adopted shortly after the flash crash, which briefly wiped $1 trillion in paper value off U.S. stocks in a matter of minutes. The crash spawned a proposed ban on so-called stub quotes, which are bids and offers well off the public price of stocks, as well as new obligations for high-frequency algorithmic traders who act as effective market makers to provide liquidity when markets are distressed. The sources said the SEC would not act on this before the November 2 midterm election. (Reporting by Rachelle Younglai and Jonathan Spicer. Editing by Robert MacMillan)
