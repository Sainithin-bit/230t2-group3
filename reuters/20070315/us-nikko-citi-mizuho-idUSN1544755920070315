 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mizuho Financial Group, ( 8411.T ), Japan's No. 2 banking group, plans to sell shares of brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T to Citigroup ( C.N ), Japanese news service Kyodo reported on Thursday. 


 The move would be an important step forward for Citi as it seeks to buy a controlling stake in Nikko and expand its international business. The news service did not specify the price, or whether Mizuho intended to sell all or a portion of its roughly 4.8 percent stake in Nikko. The English language version of the story cited "sources close to the bid," but the Japanese language version did not cite sources. Earlier this week, Citi increased its bid for Nikko to 1,700 yen ($14.62) a share, which could be worth as much as $13.5 billion. The higher bid came after Nikko escaped delisting by the Tokyo Stock Exchange, a development that weakened Citi's leverage against North American investors who had dismissed its original offer as too low. The four largest investors, who own over 25 percent of Nikko, objected to the original offer of 1,350 yen a share, but have not made public statements regarding the current bid. Fund managers including Orbis Investment Management Ltd., Harris Associates, and Southeastern Asset Management said in prior statements and communications that they believed the brokerage's shares were worth closer to 2,000 yen a share. But Citi said on Tuesday that it does not plan to raise its bid. Citi already owns about 4.9 percent of Nikko, but is hoping to buy all remaining outstanding shares, or failing that, at least enough shares to own a controlling stake. A U.S. spokesman for a Mizuho unit in the U.S. declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Citi in New York. (Additional reporting by  Ritsuko Ando  in New York)
