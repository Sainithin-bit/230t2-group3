 BOCA RATON, Florida  (Reuters) - Upstart energy exchange IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) on Thursday offered to buy futures market CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N for $9.9 billion, besting an existing takeover offer from Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N. 


 ICE, an afterthought in the exchanges business just five years ago, has emerged recently as a force in commodities trading. A combination with the Chicago Board of Trade's parent would make ICE one of the largest financial derivatives markets in the world. CBOT shares soared more than 17 percent as investors started to anticipate a bidding war between ICE and CME. Should the unsolicited bid succeed, shareholders of CBOT, the No. 2 U.S. futures exchange, would get a premium of about 11 percent over the current CME terms and a majority stake in the combined company. CBOT said in a statement that its board would review the proposal "in a manner consistent with their duties and a merger agreement with CME." ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher would hold the top job in a combined exchange, but many top CBOT brass would retain their posts, in contrast to the CME-heavy management structure proposed for the merged CME-CBOT. The majority ownership would also allow CBOT members to retain the rights to trade equity options at the neighboring Chicago Board Options Exchange, an arrangement under threat from the current merger plan. "Price is an important metric, but not the only metric," Sprecher said. BID COMES AT FLORIDA CONFERENCE Sources at the Futures Industry Association meeting here said terms of the proposal were slipped under the door of CBOT Chief Executive Bernard Dan's and Chairman Charles Carey's hotel rooms overnight. CBOT canceled a planned media briefing early Thursday as its executives disappeared from public view. ICE's all-stock bid values CBOT at $187.34 a share, compared with the $169.53 a share, or $8.96 billion, offered by CME, based on the closing price on Wednesday. At those prices, the rival bid would put the price-to-earnings ratio of CBOT at 57.64, compared with 52.16 for the CME deal, according to Reuters Estimates. But Sprecher told reporters that ICE could put in up to $3 billion in cash as well, if needed. The combined company would be based in Chicago, where Sprecher said he recently bought a house and where ICE is building a data center. Morgan Stanley was ICE's adviser. CME defended the terms of its deal. "We are confident that the CME/CBOT merger will create a strong combination and provide significant and unique benefits to shareholders and customers," Chief Executive Craig Donohue said in an e-mailed statement. WALL STREET ENTHUSIASM Still, many analysts and CBOT members were intrigued by ICE's Boca bombshell. "The ICE deal has got aspects that will be attractive to CBOT members. It's a credible offer," said Chris Hehmeyer, chief executive of brokerage firm Penson-GHCO, a subsidiary of Penson Worldwide. Penson-GHCO is a member of CBOT, CME and ICE. "CBOT members were, I believe, prepared to vote for the (CME) deal, to vote yes," he said. "Now all of us are going to have to reevaluate. But it will have to be a good deal to stop the train that was ready to leave the station." On Wednesday, officials from CBOT and CME speaking at the FIA conference were confident that the deal would close by mid-year. The CME deal had raised antitrust concerns, given the 85 percent or more market share of U.S. futures, options on futures and clearing that the combined mart would control. By contrast, Sprecher predicted that an ISE-CBOT tie-up would be "clean," with no significant antitrust risks. "The regulatory hurdles are probably less, just because there is much less of a product overlap," said Rick Wetmore, a financial services analyst at Turner Investment Partners, which is a big holder of both ICE and CME. Based in Atlanta, the all-electronic ICE has little product overlap with the CBOT, whose biggest products are U.S. Treasury debt and agricultural derivatives such as corn and soybeans. Under Thursday's proposal, CBOT's derivatives trades would be cleared at the New York Board of Trade clearing house. ICE bought NYBOT, a small exchange that trades mostly soft commodities such as coffee, cocoa and sugar, in January. Some worried that NYBOT's clearing operation might struggle with CBOT's much larger volume. LATEST SIGN OF CONSOLIDATION Thursday's surprise move by ICE is the latest sign of consolidation in the once-sleepy exchanges sector, which has been revolutionized as many markets have gone public. "We are going to continue to see deals as time goes forward," said Warren West, president of Greentree Brokerage Services. "I don't see an end to it until we end up with a more structured market." CBOT members are set to vote on April 4 on whether to approve the CME deal, which was announced in October and is awaiting approval from the U.S. Department of Justice. "We suspect that vote will have to happen before the outcome of the DOJ review, and that the members and shareholders of the CBOT won't have the benefit of knowing that outcome," said Sprecher said on the financial news network CNBC. "So we decided to enter now to let them know there is an alternative." At the New York Stock Exchange CBOT closed at $194.95, up $28.86, with CME down $31.09 at $532.88 and ICE down $3.83 at  $128.10.
