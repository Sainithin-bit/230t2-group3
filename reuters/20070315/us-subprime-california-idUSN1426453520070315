 IRVINE, California  (Reuters) - There was no sign of financial meltdown on Wednesday at the Southern California office park surrounding New Century Financial Corp., but neighbors walking by one of the starting points of the mortgage industry crisis shivered at the thought of what could be next. 


 "You are always at risk of losing your job. There is always someone younger, stronger, eager," said Elai Malikyar, an event planner who works mornings at nearby Calfirst Bancorp, one of many financial institutions dotting this green section of Orange County. The prosperous county just south of Los Angeles, a backdrop for many television shows, has become a financial powerhouse. And New Century played a leading role from its headquarters nestled among fountains and palm trees. Glass buildings with bank names surround the plaza and streets where New Century is based, and Malikyar said many of the workers in the area were gloomy and scared of losing jobs. Other office workers lingering for a breakfast burrito were shocked to learn that Wall Street was betting their neighbor was near bankruptcy. New Century was at the vanguard of subprime lenders, who make home loans to people with poor credit histories. The lenders have been battered by rising delinquencies and defaults, and demands from their own lenders to take back soured loans at a loss. "I didn't know they had problems. I'm just grateful I didn't have stock," said a woman who read about New Century in the morning paper and was concerned for people inside the company as well as investors and borrowers. She said her name was Donnie Lynch. "Lynch like hanging. Like what they might do there," she added, gesturing at New Century's low glass tower. Trading in shares of New Century has been suspended by the New York Stock Exchange, and the company has received a grand jury subpoena in a federal criminal probe. On Monday, the Irvine-based company said it lacked enough cash to repay its own lenders. Some neighbors on Wednesday were quite aware of the effect New Century was having beyond Orange County. "It's had a negative effect on my billfold -- just the sheer uncertainty it casts on the economy in general," said David Moore of Berman Investment Group, referring to pressures on the stock market. Some with connections to the mortgage industry, which soared in recent years with the U.S. housing boom, saw job losses ahead. That was potentially good news for recruiters with the right clients, said head hunter Jimmy Donaldson, who said his firm, which he did not identify, was getting interest from mortgage professionals looking to switch industries. "Everybody's going down, not just New Century," he opined. New Century employees themselves kept quiet, following company policy not to speak publicly about the situation.
