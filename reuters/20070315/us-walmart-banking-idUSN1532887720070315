 NEW YORK/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker has released an e-mail he said shows that Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s interest in consumer banking extends beyond what the retail giant had previously disclosed to regulators. 


 At a press conference on Thursday, Republican Rep. Paul Gillmor of Ohio distributed a copy of an e-mail from a Wal-Mart executive with language the retailer has included in tenant leases letting it reserve the right to offer a variety of financial services, including mortgages and home equity loans. Gillmor said the e-mail suggests Wal-Mart has been deceptive in its disclosure of its banking plans. "The only reasonable explanation of Wal-Mart's recent plan to revise its leases is that it plans to enter into full-scale banking," Gillmor told reporters. "This helps us pass a bill." Wal-Mart has submitted an application to U.S. banking regulators that, if approved, would allow it to operate a specialty bank known as an industrial loan company (ILC). It has long insisted that it was not interested in branch banking, but was looking to use the bank as a way to save money by internalizing credit-card and check transactions. But consumer groups and banks fear Wal-Mart could eventually provide other retail banking services. "The e-mail and Wal-Mart's actions seem to contradict past statements in which Wal-Mart publicly stated that they had no intention of offering a broad array of banking services," said WakeUpWalMart.com, a union funded group. The group called on Wal-Mart to withdraw its ILC application. The president of a trade group that opposes commercial ownership of banks said the e-mail represents another example of the world's largest retailer shooting itself in the foot. "Wal-Mart has more smoking guns than a shooting range," said Camden Fine, president of Independent Community Bankers of America. A Wal-Mart spokesman said the retailer had recently updated language in its leases but had similar language in the agreements for the last five years. "At this point, no one should be surprised that Wal-Mart is interested in financial services. We continue to grow our product offering like check cashing, money transfers," said WalMart spokesman Kevin Gardner. While efforts to get its ILC application approved have stalled in the United States, Wal-Mart de Mexico, a unit of Wal-Mart Stores, will open its first in-store bank branch in June. The bank will offer basic savings and loan services to low-income earners with limited access to credit. MORE HEARINGS Earlier this year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation extended a freeze on applications by commercial companies to open or acquire ILCs, and the U.S. House Financial Services Committee plans a March 22 hearing on the issue. Gillmor and Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, reintroduced a bill earlier this year aimed at blocking retailers from opening banks and limiting current retailer-owned banks established after October 1, 2003, from expanding. The bill, which is widely expected to be approved by the full House, would also give the FDIC increased regulatory powers for ILC holding companies. Gillmor said he has not spoken to Sen. Robert Bennett, an influential senior Republican on the Senate Banking Committee who backs commercial ownership of ILCs, since the two failed to reach an agreement at a meeting in January. Many ILCs operated by both financial and nonfinancial companies are chartered in Utah, the state Bennett represents. Bennett has not changed his position, his spokeswoman said on Thursday. Gillmor signaled that there may be room for flexibility in the bill when negotiating the final outcome with the Senate. "We're going to negotiate that in a conference committee instead of at a news conference," Gillmor said. Wal-Mart shares rose 38 cents to $46.11 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.
