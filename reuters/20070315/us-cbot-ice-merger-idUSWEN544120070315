 BOCA RATON, Florida  (Reuters) - Upstart energy exchange IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) on Thursday offered to buy futures market CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N for $9.9 billion, besting an existing takeover offer from Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N. 


 ICE, an afterthought in the exchanges business just five years ago, has emerged recently as a force in commodities trading, and a combination with the Chicago Board of Trade's parent would make it one of the world's largest financial derivatives markets. Should the unsolicited bid succeed, shareholders of CBOT, the No. 2 U.S. futures exchange, would get both a premium over the current CME terms and a majority stake in the combined company. ICE Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher would hold the top job in the combined exchange, but many top CBOT executives and some directors would retain their jobs, in contrast to the CME-heavy management proposed for the merged CME-CBOT. Sources at the Futures Industry Association meeting here said terms of the proposal were slipped under the door of CBOT chief executive Bernard Dan's hotel room overnight. CBOT canceled a planned media briefing early Thursday as its executives disappeared from view. ICE's all-stock bid  values CBOT at $187.34 a share, compared with the $169.53 a share, or $8.96 billion, offered by CME, based on the closing price Wednesday. But Sprecher told reporters that ICE could put up to $3 billion in cash in as well, if needed. The combined company would be based in Chicago, where Sprecher recently bought a house and where ICE is building a data center. The majority ownership would allow CBOT members to retain the rights to trade equity options at the neighboring Chicago Board Options Exchange, an arrangement under threat from the current merger plan. "Price is an important metric, but not the only metric," Sprecher said. "We are confident that the CME/CBOT merger will create a strong combination and provide significant and unique benefits to shareholders and customers," CME Chief Executive Craig Donohue said in an e-mailed statement. ANALYSTS WEIGH IN Still, many analysts and CBOT members were intrigued by ICE's Boca bombshell. "The ICE deal has got aspects that will be attractive to CBOT members. It's a credible offer," said Chris Hehmeyer, chief executive of brokerage firm Penson-GHCO, a subsidiary of Penson Worldwide. Penson-GHCO is a member of CBOT, CME and  ICE. "CBOT members were, I believe, prepared to vote for the (CME) deal, to vote yes. Now all of us are going to have to reevaluate. But it will have to be a good deal to stop the train that was ready to leave the station," he said. On Wednesday, officials from CBOT and CME speaking at FIA were confident that the deal would close by mid-year. Shares of CBOT jumped nearly 14 percent, to $189 each, while those of CME fell more than 3 percent in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares in ICE were down about 1 percent. The CME deal had raised antitrust concerns given the 85 percent or more market share of U.S. futures, options on futures and clearing that the combined mart would control. By contrast, Sprecher said an ISE-CBOT tie-up would be "clean," with no significant antitrust risks. "The regulatory hurdles are probably less, just because there is much less of a product overlap," said Rick Wetmore, a financial services analyst at Turner Investment Partners, which is a big holder of both ICE and CME. The all-electronic ICE, which is based in Atlanta, has little product overlap with the CBOT, whose biggest products are U.S. Treasury debt and agricultural derivatives such as corn and soybeans. Under Thursday's proposal, CBOT's derivatives trades would be cleared at the New York Board of Trade clearing house. ICE bought NYBOT, a small exchange that trades mostly soft commodities such as coffee, cocoa and sugar, in January. Thursday's surprise move by ICE is the latest sign of consolidation in the once sleepy exchanges sector, which has been revolutionized as many markets have gone public. "We are going to continue to see deals as time goes forward. I don't see an end to it until we end up with a more structured market -- right now it's so fragmented," said Warren West, president of Greentree Brokerage Services. CBOT members are set to vote on April 4 on whether to approve the CME deal, which was announced in October and is awaiting approval from the U.S. Department of Justice.
