 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Higher energy costs pushed producer prices up by a bigger-than-expected 1.3 percent in February and there was a large drop in the number of initial jobless claims filed last week, Labor Department data on Thursday showed. 


 Adding to a mixed picture as the economy inches ahead, separate data from the New York Federal Reserve showed manufacturing activity in that area plunging to its lowest level since May 2005. The increase in producer prices followed a 0.6 percent decrease in January, and was well above the 0.5 percent gain analysts polled by Reuters ahead of the report were expecting. Excluding volatile food and energy prices, the so-called core Producer Price Index advanced 0.4 percent, still somewhat more than the 0.2 percent gain economists were expecting. A 4.1 percent surge in tobacco prices helped push up core prices. Separate Labor Department data showed that first-time jobless claims fell by a larger than expected 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 318,000. Analysts polled ahead of the report were expecting claims to increase slightly. The more reliable four-week moving average of initial claims dropped by 10,250 to 329,250. Still, the number of workers remaining on unemployment benefits rose by 48,000 to 2.576 million, for the week ended March 3, the most recent week these data were available. That was close to the 2.54 million continued claims analysts were expecting. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell after data showed a bigger-than-expected gain in the PPI, spurring inflation worries ahead of next week's Federal Reserve policy meeting. Stock prices were little changed. Even so, readings on the inflation picture were mixed among economists. "These numbers are not going to change much the view that inflation is somewhat tame, or slowing, and that the Fed will need to cut rates later in the year," said Mark Meadows, currency analyst at Tempus Consulting. Others saw some signs of price pressures, making it less likely the central bank would be able to cut its benchmark fed funds rate any time soon. "This would signal that there are inflationary issues, which would certainly mean that the Fed is not ready to lower interest rates," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer at Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York. Energy prices advanced by 3.5 percent in February after falling 4.6 percent the prior month, the report showed. Food prices were up 1.9 percent after a 1.1 percent gain in January. Overall prices in the index were up 2.5 percent from the same time a year ago. But core prices were up a more moderate 1.8 percent from a year ago, likely giving some relief to Fed officials as they manage inflation while trying to help the economy grow at a sustainable pace. The producer price numbers came a day before the Labor Department was set to release its closely watched Consumer Price Index. Economists are expecting to see moderate gains in consumer prices during February. MANUFACTURING SLUMPS Separate data on Thursday from the New York Federal Reserve showed a surprisingly big decline in manufacturing activity in the New York region in March. The New York Fed's "Empire State" general business conditions index fell to its lowest reading since May 2005, pulled down by a sharp decrease in new orders. This adds to evidence that business spending is slackening this year, as the economy is expected to limp along at a tepid pace. Separate government data showed that net U.S. capital flows turned positive in January with $74.4 billion of net inflows after a $14.7 net outflow in December. This rebound was driven by $84 billion of net foreign purchases of long-term securities, including swaps, after $1.2 billion inflows in December. Excluding swaps, international investors bought a net $97.4 billion in long-term securities. The dollar rose slightly against the euro after the inflows data.
