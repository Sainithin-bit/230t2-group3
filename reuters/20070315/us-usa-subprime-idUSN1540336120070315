 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global financial markets on Thursday emerged from two days of turmoil sparked by a crisis in the U.S. housing finance sector, and government officials stepped up efforts to find out what went wrong and how to fix it. 


 Still, investors were wary of further developments after markets were rocked earlier in the week by the news that a record number of U.S. mortgages were headed into foreclosure in what some took to be a long-anticipated bursting of the housing bubble. A light flurry of selling hit Wall Street in the afternoon when Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chief, told a futures industry conference in Boca Raton, Florida, that the foreclosures in the subprime mortgage market could have a broader impact. "You can't take 10 percent out of mortgage originations without some impact," Greenspan said. Greenspan roiled the markets last month when he suggested there was a chance of a U.S. recession in the year ahead. His comments on Thursday dealt only with housing finance, and had less impact. The Dow industrials  .DJI  continued to recover with a 26.28-point, or 0.22 percent, gain at the unofficial close, after rising 57.44 points in the prior session. Earlier in the day, Europe's FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  jumped 1.8 percent and Tokyo's Nikkei  .N225  climbed 1.1 percent. Wall Street opened steady after the strong trading abroad and news that a key Wall Street player in the securitization of home mortgages, investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N, said problems with subprime mortgages have been contained to that sector. Consumer groups and politicians have forecast that upwards of 2 million loans would go bad, most in the subprime category reserved for borrowers with poor credit histories and lent out at high interest rates, the riskiest category of home loans. Government officials stepped up their investigation of whether some loan brokers may have used fraudulent means to dupe home buyers into taking on debt they could not handle. Those loans, in turn, were syndicated to investors around the world as packaged securities. A score of companies that initiated the loans have already gone out of business as losses mounted. While U.S. Treasury officials have repeatedly said the problem has been "contained" in a relatively small sector of the housing industry, some have forecast a broader impact. They argue that consumers, who have been pumped up by healthy home price gains, will start to pull back on spending. Bank foreclosures could accelerate the decline. Brokerage giant Merrill Lynch issued a research note which said home prices could tumble 10 percent this year and force the United States into recession. But it said this would happen only if a "credit crunch" unfolds that makes borrowing difficult for home buyers. Further, it said the likelihood was for a "growth recession," meaning a period of very slow growth. Trying to head off a worse disaster, politicians unveiled plans to blunt the impact of widespread foreclosures and to prevent a housing debacle from unfolding in the future. Sen. Hillary Clinton, a New York Democrat who is a front-runner in the 2008 presidential race, said there should be incentives for lenders to identify troubled mortgages and offer "a foreclosure timeout" and possibly revise repayment terms. Others concentrated on tracking down any lenders who might have broken laws with unscrupulous lending. New York state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said his office is looking into the subprime market. Ohio's attorney general barred one of the biggest troubled mortgage lenders, New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), from operating in his state. Florida's bank investigator said he has launched a probe of New Century. Earlier in the week, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and New Hampshire issued cease-and-desist orders against the company, halting it from taking new loans in their states. But as some backpedaled from the home loan market, others saw a chance to gain market share. General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) and private equity firm Blackstone Group said they would acquire mortgage and fleet management services company PHH Corp. ( PHH.N ) for $1.8 billion and split the two businesses. Bear Stearns, the largest underwriter of U.S. mortgage-backed securities, said it expects large bulk sales of troubled mortgages in coming months, providing the bank with an opportunity. The well-financed buyers see a chance to move in and snap up bargain-priced housing assets that will position them for a rebound. The subprime collapse "has a lot of the characteristics of past credit cycles," said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica Bank. "Every time the Fed tightens, it's a search for the weakest link in the credit market. It turns out the weakest link was in the subprime mortgage market. My hunch: it will have an impact but not a severe impact on the economy."
