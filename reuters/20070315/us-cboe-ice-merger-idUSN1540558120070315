 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Energy exchange IntercontinentalExchange Inc.'s ( ICE.N ) surprise $9.9 billion bid for CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N is prompting some questions over the implications the offer has for CBOT trading rights at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. 


 Under the ICE offer, which tops an existing bid from Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc. CME.N, CBOT shareholders would get a majority stake in the combined company. One benefit of that ownership is that it would allow CBOT members to retain the rights to trade equity options at the neighboring CBOE, an arrangement threatened by the CME merger plan. CBOT, the No. 2 U.S. futures exchange, has said it was committed to protecting those exercise rights under the CME plan and is in litigation over the matter. The unsolicited bid by ICE comes just a few weeks before CBOT shareholders were due to vote on the CME proposal. CBOE, the largest U.S. options exchange, declined to comment. But several CBOE members said ISE's bombshell announcement caught them off guard and they did not know what the offer meant for the ongoing legal battle. "Everybody is scratching their heads and trying to figure what this means for CBOE exercise rights," said Lawrence Blum, a member of both CBOE and CBOT. "In my opinion, this may force negotiations between the CBOT and CBOE. This is still an issue that has to be resolved," Blum added. LOGGERHEADS CBOE is now in the process of converting to a for-profit entity from a member-owned organization after the exercise dispute delayed its restructuring for at least a year. For its part, the options exchange has asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to approve a rule filing that would terminate the trading rights upon completion of the acquisition of CBOT by CME. If the proposed CME-CBOT merger takes place, CBOE believes the CBOT memberships with trading privileges at the CBOE would no longer exist. The CBOT wants the court to review that interpretation. The two exchanges have been at loggerheads over the exercise rights matter since the 1990s. The trading rights, created when CBOT spun off the CBOE in 1973, give full CBOT members the right to trade at the CBOE without having to buy a membership. On March 1 CBOT filed a brief with a Delaware court supporting its motion for a partial summary judgment against CBOE's attempt to extinguish the trading rights. CBOT contends that its full members should be able to reap the same benefits as CBOE members once the options exchange transforms into a stock company. The value of CBOE's reorganization, which paves the way for a possible initial public offering, is reflected by the sharp rise in membership since the start of 2006. CBOE's seat sales this month topped more than $2 million. "The news shocked everybody," said one CBOE member who declined to be identified. "It casts a new dimension on the possible value of CBOE exercise rights."
