 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A Massachusetts retirement fund sued Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ) on Thursday, alleging the parent of jobs Web site Monster.com inflated its stock price by improperly accounting for stock option grants. 


 It is the first proposed class-action suit against Monster, said plaintiffs' lawyer Christopher Keller, a partner with Labaton Sucharow & Rudoff LLP in New York. The suit was filed on behalf of shareholders who bought Monster stock between May 6, 2005 and June 9, 2006. "Basically, investors paid too much for the stock because the stock was worth less on account of the failure of Monster to account for the stock options properly," Keller said. Monster Worldwide did not immediately return calls seeking comment. The lead plaintiff is Middlesex County Retirement System, a public pension fund in Massachusetts. The fund is seeking recovery for losses in the "tens of millions, if not hundreds of millions," Keller added. The complaint, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, also named as defendants former Monster Chief Executive Andrew McKelvey, former general counsel Myron Olesnyckyj and current Chief Financial Officer Charles "Lanny" Baker. Monster shares closed on Thursday down 62 cents at $46.98 on Nasdaq.
