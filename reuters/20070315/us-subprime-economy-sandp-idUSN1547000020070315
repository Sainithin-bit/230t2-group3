 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An increase in U.S. homes for sale as a result of subprime loan borrowers defaulting on their mortgages, in addition to less construction of new homes, is likely to depress gross domestic product growth, Standard & Poor's said on Thursday. 


 S&P expects losses from subprime residential mortgage-backed securities made in 2006 to rise to a record of between 5.25 percent and 7.75 percent. The highest loss previously was 5 percent in 2000. "The difficulties of subprime lenders affect the economy because more foreclosed houses will be on the market, in addition to homes for sale by individuals," S&P said in a report. "And new home construction should drop even more." Declines in residential construction cut GDP growth by a full percentage point during the second half of 2006. "This pattern will likely hold through most of 2007, also depressing GDP," S&P said. "The fall-off in construction will also exacerbate the loss of income in the construction industry." Forty percent of adjustable-rate and interest-only home loans made in 2006 were to subprime borrowers, and subprime loans account for about 20 percent of all mortgage loans made in the past two years. "A confluence of two factors is propelling today's losses: rising interest rates, which have made mortgages more expensive since late 2005, and stagnating home prices, as opposed to the galloping gains prior to 2006," S&P said. "We don't see low interest rates or double-digit gains in home prices returning in the near term. Thus, conditions in the subprime market will probably get worse before they get better." While subprime losses will be a record for the assets, it still compares favorably with recent periods of defaults by high-yield corporate borrowers, which exceeded 8 percent for two consecutive years in the last recession, S&P said. "The pain in the financial sector from rising subprime defaults should be minimal for major banks because of their diversified income streams and because they have only a limited presence in this market," S&P said. However, as the number of homeowners borrowing against the equity of their houses falls, companies that sell home improvement products or services are likely to suffer. The amount of money homeowners borrow from the home equity in their houses is likely to fall, due not just to subprime defaults but also due to higher interest rates and falling home prices. "Home remodeling retailers, building materials companies, furniture makers, and major appliance manufacturers might all show some weakness in the coming year as consumers opt to defer remodeling plans," S&P said. "The decline in new home construction will hurt many of these businesses even more."
