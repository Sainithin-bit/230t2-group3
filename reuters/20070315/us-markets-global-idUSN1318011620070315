 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks edged higher on Thursday, while bonds were flat to mixed after strong inflation data on producer prices caused investors to scale back bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by mid-year. 


 The dollar gained against the yen, lifted by the modest advance in stocks. But fears that rising defaults in the subprime mortgage sector could spill over into the broader economy kept investors edgy, causing volatility across markets. In New York, oil prices fell, following a decline in gasoline futures. Gold prices rose, reflecting the rebound in the U.S. stock market. The turbulence in the subprime sector has resulted in the dollar closely tracking stocks in recent weeks, while bonds have moved in the opposite direction of equities. Rising home loan delinquencies among borrowers with poor credit histories have forced at least 20 subprime lenders out of business. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's former chairman, said there was a risk the sector's problems could spill over in to the rest of the economy. Stocks were supported by strong earnings from Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N and brisk buying of financial services shares after their recent battering by the subprime mortgage market crisis. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.28 points, or 0.22 percent, to end at 12,159.68. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 5.11 points, or 0.37 percent, to finish at 1,392.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  advanced 6.96 points, or 0.29 percent, to close at 2,378.70. But the gains were tempered by news that the Producer Price Index, or PPI, surged 1.3 percent in February, causing investors to lower the odds for an interest-rate cut by June.  "The bottom line is we are heading toward stagflation here if this is a trend. The Fed is not cutting anything if this is the type of inflation we are seeing," said Robert Macintosh, chief economist of Eaton Vance Management in Boston. Stagflation happens when economic growth is slow and unemployment is fairly high, while prices rise. MID-YEAR RATE CUT ODDS DIMINISHING Fed funds futures were pricing in a roughly 38 percent perceived chance of a 25-basis-point cut in the fed funds rate by June, versus a 42 percent probability late on Wednesday. The Federal Reserve's policy-makers, who are scheduled to meet next week on Tuesday and Wednesday, are widely expected to hold their rate target on overnight loans between banks at 5.25 percent. Concerns over the impact of the subprime market's problems on the broader economy limited the dollar's response to the fading hopes for an interest-rate cut. The dollar rose 0.4 percent to 117.47 yen  JPY=  from 117.04 yen late Wednesday. Against the dollar, the euro was little changed, up 0.1 percent at $1.3236  EUR=  from $1.3224 the previous day. The PPI report overshadowed another release showing that manufacturing activity in New York State factories plunged to its lowest level in nearly two-years in March. But that report, together with another showing that factory activity in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region came below expectations in March, helped government bonds to erase losses triggered by the PPI report.  The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR was unchanged in price at 100-22/32, yielding 4.54 percent. European stocks broke a three-day losing run to end higher on Thursday as acquisition and restructuring, coupled with high metal prices, took investors' minds off worries about the U.S. mortgage market. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares rose 2 percent to end at 1,455.92, its biggest one-day gain since a slide in global equities on February 27. In Tokyo, the Nikkei  .N225  climbed 183.50 points, or 1.1 percent, to close at 16,860.39, buoyed by a rebound in exporters' shares after the yen retreated. OIL SLIPS, GOLD RISES U.S. crude oil futures ended lower in choppy trade amid a drop in gasoline futures prices on profit-taking. Crude for April delivery CLJ7 fell 61 cents to end at $57.55 per barrel. Gold futures prices rose as traders drew inspiration from the recovery in the U.S. stock market. Benchmark April gold GCJ7 rose $4.60 to end at $647.10 an ounce in New York.
