 LONDON  (Reuters) - Two U.S. private equity funds have agreed to acquire British biofuels company Ensus and finance the construction of a major bioethanol plant in northeast England, Ensus said in a statement on Thursday. 


 The Carlyle Group, which has more than $54.5 billion under management and investments in more than 80 companies, and Riverstone, a $6.0 billion private investment firm, agreed to acquire and invest in Ensus. Ensus plans to build a bioethanol plant in Teesside with an annual capacity of more than 400 million liters of bioethanol. Construction will start in the second quarter of this year with full production expected in early 2009. "This first facility in Teesside provides the ideal platform from which to establish our position and we are already actively exploring opportunities for further facilities in the UK and abroad," Carlyle managing director Robert Easton said. Britain does not currently have any major bioethanol plants, in contrast to the United States, where there has been a rapid expansion in production in the last couple of years. The United States and Brazil are the two world's largest producers of the biofuel. "The financial resources of Carlyle and Riverstone, together with their experience in investing in biofuels in North America, make them the ideal partners as we seek to create one of the leading biofuels companies in Europe," Ensus chairman Rob Margetts said. FEEDSTOCK WHEAT Biofuels can be substituted for fossil fuels and are seen as a way to reduce the emission of the greenhouse gases believed to contribute to global warming. Bioethanol is normally produced from grains or sugar. Ensus said its plant would use wheat sourced from local markets as its feedstock. The wheat will be supplied by Glencore Grain UK while Shell ( RDSa.L ) has contracted to buy the bioethanol produced, the statement said. The plant is expected to use around 1.2 million tonnes of wheat. Britain has announced that five percent of all motor fuel sold by 2010 must come from renewable sources. The target is expected to largely be met by blending five percent biofuel with fossil fuels for use in conventionally powered vehicles. "The government is keen to see a strong and stable market for biofuels in the UK and I welcome the boost this project will give the sector," UK Transport Minister Stephen Ladyman said. British Sugar is currently constructing Britain's first significant bioethanol plant in eastern England. The plant will use sugar beet as its feedstock and production is expected to start in the middle of this year. The company is a unit of Associated British Foods ( ABF.L ).
