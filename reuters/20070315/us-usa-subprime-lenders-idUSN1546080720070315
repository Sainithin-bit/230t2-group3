 ATLANTIC CITY, New Jersey  (Reuters) - Subprime mortgage lenders could lose up to a third of their business if proposals to scrap some types of loans to high-risk borrowers, currently under consideration by federal regulators, go into effect, a leading underwriter said on Thursday. 


 Rodrigo Alba, vice president of federal and regulatory affairs for ACC Capital Holdings, said six federal agencies are looking at whether so-called hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages are misleading to borrowers because they typically offer low rates for the first two or three years and then significantly increase payments for the remainder of the loan. ACC Capital is the parent of subprime lender Ameriquest. The higher rate can create financial difficulty for borrowers, which has led to a crisis of confidence in the subprime market. Almost one in five subprime loans made in 2005 and 2006 will end in foreclosure, according to the Center for Responsible Lending, a citizens group. The loans, typically for 30 years, are known as 2-28 or 3-27 mortgages in which the first number refers to the number of years in which the introductory rate applies, and the latter number to the higher rate. They are often taken out by so-called subprime borrowers who have weak credit ratings and thus are unable to obtain conventional loans. "Subprime lenders would lose 25 percent to 35 percent of their business if the 2-28 proposal is adopted," Alba told Reuters in an interview during a Mortgage Bankers Association conference. "Many in the industry feel that the 2-28 will just disappear." Under the proposals published on March 2, lenders would have to qualify borrowers at a "fully indexed" rate, or the highest possible rate that would apply over the life of the loan, rather than the rate that applies in the "teaser" period at the start. The mortgage lending industry is arguing that scrapping 2-28s or other hybrid ARMs would result in fewer "needy" people being able to become homeowners, Alba said. "They want to make sure that policy-makers understand this comes at a cost," he said. Industry representatives would like to find a compromise solution under which hybrid ARMs survive but are sold in a way that allows borrowers to clearly understand the terms of the loan, and so are better able to make a decision on their ability to repay, Alba said. "We understand what the concerns are for the government, but is there a middle point?" Alba asked. "This is a product that helps put people into homes." Alba stressed that hybrid ARMs are not necessarily taken out by subprime borrowers but are sometimes used by relatively well-paid individuals to enter expensive property markets. "It's a stepladder into good credit," he said. The hybrid ARM issue is also being addressed by federal lawmakers, including Sen. Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who on Wednesday said regulators have been too slow to deal with predatory lending. Industry groups involved in the discussions include the Mortgage Bankers Association, the American Bankers Association, and the American Financial Services Association, said Alba. He added that he is not personally involved in the talks, which also include community groups such as the Center for Responsible Lending, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, and the senior citizens group AARP. Federal agencies include the Treasury, the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
