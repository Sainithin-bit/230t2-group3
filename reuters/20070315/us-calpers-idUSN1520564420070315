 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Insurance broker Marsh & McLennan ( MMC.N ), drug company Eli Lilly ( LLY.N ) and nine other companies need to improve their "dismal stock performance" and "poor governance practices," the biggest U.S. pension fund said on Thursday. 


 California Public Employees Retirement System, the $230.3 billion fund known as Calpers, also named Sara Lee SLE.N, International Paper ( IP.N ), Tenet Healthcare ( THC.N ), EMC ( EMC.N ), Dollar Tree Stores ( DLTR.O ), Corinthian Colleges ( COCO.O ), Kellwood Co. KWD.N, Tribune Co. TRB.N and Sanmina-SCI ( SANM.O ) on its latest Focus List. In 2006 the fund, which has singled out the worst corporate performers since 1992 in an effort to force companies to be more accountable to shareholders, listed six offenders. "The long-term performance of all 11 companies is at least 20 percent behind their peers, and they have resisted appeals to change corporate practices that make their boards unresponsive to shareholder interests," Rob Feckner, Calpers' board president, said in a statement. The fund warned it would start or step up existing efforts to push for changes if the companies do not act quickly themselves. Calpers is already pursuing shareholder proposals at four of the 11 companies, it said. "Unless the companies make changes, we'll pursue shareholder proposals to address our concerns," said Charles Valdes, who chairs Calpers investment committee. Tribune Co. spokesman Gary Weitman said in an e-mailed statement, "We have been working with CalPERS since their request for governance changes was first brought to our attention just nine days ago. At that time, we agreed to communicate CalPERS' proposal to Tribune's full board at its May meeting, and it is premature to say what action the Board will take before that time." The giant fund, which pays out benefits to roughly 1.5 million retired state and local workers, reported a return of 15.4 percent last year, lagging the broader market slightly but beating the median performance of other big funds. Calpers said that Eli Lilly, known for drugs that treat mental illness, and Sara Lee, maker of baked good, sausages and other household products, do not let shareholders amend company bylaws. Only 4 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500 companies have that restriction. The fund said Marsh & McLennan, which has had heavy turnover in its executive ranks in recent years, paid excessive severance packages. Calpers said EMC, the world's largest maker of data storage equipment, also was reluctant to change "excessive pay practices." Making it onto the Calpers list is bad for a company's image and its business, industry consultants have said, and many try to make changes in a hurry. All of the six companies named in 2006 improved sufficiently to escape the list in 2007.
