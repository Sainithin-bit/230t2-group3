 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Suddenly, the subprime crisis doesn't look so scary. 


 Shares of U.S. financial stocks rallied on Thursday, led by Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N, which posted an 8 percent rise in quarterly earnings and said problems in mortgages to people with weak credit were not showing any sign of spreading to other markets. It was a far cry from Tuesday, when Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) shares fell 1.7 percent even while it reported a 29 percent surge in quarterly earnings to a new record, clobbering analysts' estimates. Investment bank stocks overall fell 4.4 percent that day. "People had been saying this was the beginning of the end for the economy, and now they're seeing it's not that bad," said Erin Archer, an analyst covering investment banks at Thrivent Financial in Minneapolis. Investors who had never heard of subprime mortgages in January began taking notice in February, when HSBC Holdings Plc ( HSBA.L ) warned that it was writing down $10.6 billion of bad debts for 2006, and New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N , the largest U.S. independent subprime lender, projected an unexpected loss. Those announcements kicked off a long march downward for financial stocks, with the Amex Securities Broker Dealer index .XBD falling more than 10 percent between February 8 and March 14. Officials at Goldman, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N, and Bear Stearns all made similar comments about the subprime mortgage business: the problems are contained, broader markets don't seem to be at risk and they are still looking for opportunities in subprime mortgages in the longer term. "Their comments were reassuring, because everyone was worried about subprime problems spreading," said Lee Norton, an analyst who covers financial stocks at JS Asset Management in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. On Thursday, Bear's shares rose 2.2 percent to close at $148.50, Lehman rose 1.8 percent to $73.03, and Goldman rose 0.37 percent to $200.89. Bear and Lehman are often seen as the investment banks with the biggest subprime exposure. But in a worst-case scenario of a credit crisis, Goldman would be the biggest loser with a 24 percent drop in pretax earnings, wrote Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz in a recent note. ALL IS NOT NECESSARILY BETTER The collective sigh of relief that greeted the brokerage earnings does not mean everything is rosy for financial stocks, analysts said. Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned on Thursday that rising subprime mortgage defaults could spill into other economic sectors, adding that subprime concerns "were not a small issue." As lenders tighten their standards for giving loans, and foreclosed homes are put on the market, new home sales could decline. Futures markets are pricing in a roughly 40 percent chance of a Federal Reserve rate cut in June, which implies that fixed-income investors are concerned indeed about the state of the economy. Buying investment banks now may amount to a call on the stock market: If stocks do well, investment bank stocks will do well; and if not, they could get hurt, said Ralph Cole, portfolio manager at Ferguson Wellman Capital Management in Portland, Oregon. "The wind has been at brokers' backs for three years, and I think people really think the best is behind them," Cole said.
