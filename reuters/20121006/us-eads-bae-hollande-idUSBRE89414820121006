 VALLETTA  (Reuters) - French President Francois Hollande said on Friday the companies involved in a proposed deal to merge EADS ( EAD.PA ) with British defense group BAE ( BAES.L ) should take into account governments' views about the deal. 
 "We have said what we consider as the conditions," Hollande told reporters at a summit of North African and European countries in Malta. "After that it's up to the companies to continue their talks or negotiations knowing France's position." (Reporting By Julien Ponthus; writing by  John Irish )
