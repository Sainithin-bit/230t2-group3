 RIYADH  (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde said on Saturday that IMF talks with Greece on its debt crisis had been positive. 
 The discussion of the fiscal chapter of Greece's program has been "very good and very productive", she said without elaborating. The talks also include Greece's structural reforms, financing and debt sustainability. Lagarde was speaking at a news conference after meeting with senior officials from the six oil exporters in the Gulf Cooperation Council.
