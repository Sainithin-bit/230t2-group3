 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Retailer Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) posted a 20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by a legal settlement and other special gains, but sales declined at both its Sears and Kmart units as consumers were strapped by rising gasoline prices. 

 Earnings for Sears, controlled by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, came in roughly in the middle of a targeted range the company gave in early May, disappointing some investors and sending the company's shares down more than 2 percent. First-quarter net income rose to $216 million, or $1.40 a share, from $180 million, or $1.14 a share, a year earlier. On May 3, Sears said it expected net income of $1.30 to $1.53 a share. Excluding special items, earnings were $1.10 per share. Analysts, on average, were expecting $1.22, according to Reuters Estimates. "Our domestic operating results reflect the impact of some of the same challenges being faced by our customers, such as rising energy costs and a slower housing market," Chief Executive Aylwin Lewis said in a release. Sales fell 2.5 percent to $11.7 billion, and U.S. sales at stores open at least a year were down 3.9 percent. By brand, comparable-store sales, also known as "comps," declined 3.4 percent at Sears and fell 4.4 percent at Kmart. "Surprisingly, comps at Sears were a full point lower, at -3.4 percent, than they projected with two days to go in the quarter," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said in a note to clients. "Must have been a tough last weekend." Kmart's operating income fell 39 percent to $95 million, while Sears' U.S. operating profit rose nearly 40 percent to $246 million. Richard Hastings, senior retail analyst at credit ratings agency Bernard Sands LLC, said Kmart was losing market share to department stores such as Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ). In addition, lower-income consumers, Kmart's primary customers, have been hit hard by rising gas prices. SPECIAL ITEMS Sears Holdings' one-time items during the quarter included gains from a legal settlement, the curtailment of Sears Canada's retiree benefit plans, hurricane-related recoveries, asset sales, and an investment in Sears Mexico. Those gains outweighed a loss of 8 cents per share from complicated derivative trades called "total return swaps," which the company has said involve substantial risks and returns that could vary significantly from quarter to quarter. In the fourth quarter of last year, Sears lost 11 cents per share from total return swaps. But in the third quarter, it made 42 cents per share from the swaps -- more than it earned from its primary retail business. Total return swaps allow an investor to take on the risk of buying shares of a stock with borrowed money, without actually borrowing the money or buying shares. If the stock performs well, the investor can generate big returns without putting up much money. But if the stock sinks, big losses can ensue. Hastings said he was not worried about the investment losses as long as they don't worsen. "If the losses were to become greater, more material to earnings, then I would become more concerned," he said. Sears, which is based in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, said its cash balance came to $3.4 billion. Investors watch the cash closely because Sears has given Lampert authority to invest excess money as he sees fit. Sears shares were down $4.29, or 2.3 percent, at $178.96 in afternoon Nasdaq trade. Balter said he expects Sears shares to remain in the $160 to $190 range unless it can "turn its massive working capital into cash, buy back more stock, or invest into new ventures." "Importantly," he added, "none of this assumes that the company significantly improves its retail results." (Additional reporting by  Aarthi Sivaraman  and  Patrick Fitzgibbons  in New York)
