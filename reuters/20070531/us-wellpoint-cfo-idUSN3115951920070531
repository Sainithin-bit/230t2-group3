 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wellpoint Inc. ( WLP.N ), the biggest U.S. health insurer, ousted its chief financial officer on Thursday after an external probe revealed he violated its code of conduct, sending its shares down about 3 percent. 

 The board of directors named Chief Accounting Officer Wayne DeVeydt as CFO, replacing David Colby, effective immediately. It comes just a day before Angela Braly takes the helm as chief executive officer and president from retiring Larry Glasscock. Wellpoint, which insures one in 10 Americans, said the investigation did not reveal illegal conduct and the violations were not related to Wellpoint's business. But the company declined to comment on the nature of the violations. Turbulence in the executive suite could disrupt business, and will likely weigh on the stock in the short term, analysts said. "When Dave Colby wasn't appointed the new CEO of WellPoint, we were concerned it could result in his leaving the company. We didn't envision it happening quite like this," CIBC World Markets analyst Carl McDonald said. "It's hard to argue that the sudden change in both the CEO and CFO in a three-month period won't be disruptive to operations." Wellpoint shares were down $2.73 at $81.66 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trade. On a conference call with analysts, management declined to take questions on the specific circumstances that led to Colby's ouster, but said no other employee resigned in connection with his departure. "I fully expect the rest of our management team to remain together," Braly said. She confirmed the accuracy of Wellpoint's financial statements and its outlook. Glasscock, the company's current CEO and president, added that the action "in no way related to the CEO transition." Braly was named in late February to replace Glasscock. Indianapolis-based Wellpoint has grown over several years through acquisitions to become the biggest U.S. health insurer by membership with $56 billion in revenue in 2006. A call to Colby was not immediately returned. NO SECOND CHANCES Some Wall Street analysts expressed disappointment about Colby's resignation. One analyst asked if management considered giving him a second chance. "We don't have double standards at the company," Glasscock said, noting Wellpoint's code of conduct applies to every employee. That code, posted on Wellpoint's Web site, addresses topics including ethical decision-making, alcohol and drug use, sexual harassment in the workplace and confidentiality of information. Another analyst asked if management expects to be sued as a result. Glasscock declined to answer the question, and simply said Colby would do what he thinks is right. "I believe we absolutely did the right thing based on where the facts led us," Glasscock added. Management said it has yet to name a new chief accounting officer to succeed DeVeydt in that position. "The stock is dead money between now and the third-quarter earnings report because you have this cloud of concern over it, with a new CEO and CFO who are untried and untested in these roles," said Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst who follows the industry for CRT Capital. Shares of Wellpoint, whose membership rose about 2 percent to 34.9 million as of the end of March, have risen 7.25 percent in the year to date. They hit a record $85.45 on May 17.
