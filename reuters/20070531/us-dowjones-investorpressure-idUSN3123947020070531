 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Applying public pressure to persuade Dow Jones & Co.'s DJ.N family owners to sell the media company to Rupert Murdoch may do more harm than good, one institutional shareholder said on Thursday. 

 "Large investors will try to put pressure on the family to sell and I, too, wish they would say 'Yes'," said Jean-Marie Eveillard, a top mutual fund manager who owns Dow shares. "But I'm not sure this will help the situation." All month outside investors have been hoping the Bancroft family, which has for decades protected the company from potential bidders, would accept the $60 a share offer News Corp NWS.N made on May 1. This week Brian Rogers, chief investment officer at T. Rowe Price, Dow's largest outside shareholder, voiced what many shareholders have said privately in public, again. "There might be other buyers more palatable to them. But who's to say Rupert Murdoch is all that bad?," Rogers, who runs T. Rowe's flagship $25 billion Equity Income fund, told the Financial Times. If the family sells, T. Rowe's investment will be good. Without a deal it will not be good, Rogers added. A spokesman for the Baltimore-based fund manager which invests $350 billion and is known for keeping a low profile, said T. Rowe is not actively trying to put public pressure on the Bancrofts. "Our stance has not changed, we are not mounting a campaign," T. Rowe's spokesman Brian Lewbart said. Still the situation appears delicate with many family members reportedly distrusting Murdoch's media conglomerate that any statements could be misunderstood, Eveillard worried. "Maybe some family members will be persuaded by this kind of talk, but others may be irritated and you really don't want to antagonize them right now," Eveillard added. Eveillard's First Eagle mutual funds had owned a 2.4 percent stake in Dow Jones at the start of the month but cut it to less than 1 percent because the manager worried the family would rebuff Murdoch and kick the share price lower. First Eagle sold when the share price, which jumped to $56.20 from $36.33 the day Murdoch's bid was announced, traded near $54 and $55, Eveillard said. "We did not see the odds being high that the family would acquiesce, and if they don't then the share price could fall right back to $30, Eveillard said, adding "and $54 is a lot closer to $60 than $30 is." Meanwhile other large investors like Fidelity Investments and hedge funds have kept silent about Murdoch's proposed deal, something investors and analysts say is a smart move. Fidelity managers own Dow Jones shares and the company manages Dow Jones' retirement plans. "The big players often have conflicts of interest that force them to stay silent. But even if we still owned a lot, I don't think we would have tried to help our case by pressuring the family," Eveillard said. Dow Jones shares were up 25 cents, or .47 percent, to $53.10 on the New York Stock Exchange in late afternoon trade.
