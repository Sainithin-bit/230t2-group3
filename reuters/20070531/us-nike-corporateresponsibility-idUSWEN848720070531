 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nike Inc. ( NKE.N ) said on Thursday it would improve conditions for its 800,000 workers in factories that make its products by eliminating excess overtime by 2011. 

 In its fiscal 2005 and 2006 Corporate Responsibility Report, the footwear and apparel maker announced a series of business targets for 2011, including cutting carbon dioxide emissions from its plants and contracted plants that make its sneakers and apparel by 2011. It also plans to use more environmentally-friendly material in its shoes and design footwear to meet its waste reduction targets for 2011, and invest $315 million in the next five years in community-based sport initiatives targeted at youth.
