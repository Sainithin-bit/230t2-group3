 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The family that controls Dow Jones & Co. DJ.N said on Thursday that it plans to meet with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. to discuss his $5 billion bid to buy the company, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. 

 The decision marks a shift in the thinking of the Bancroft family, which controls 64 percent of Dow Jones & Co.'s voting power. Most of the family has been opposed to the bid until now because they are concerned that it could affect the editorial integrity of the Journal, its flagship publication. The family said in a statement that it would meet with News Corp. It also said it would consider other bidders and options for the company, the paper said. "The family has reached consensus that the mission of Dow Jones may be better accomplished in combination or collaboration with another organization, which may include News Corporation," said the statement, posted on the Journal's Web site on Thursday. "Accordingly, the family has advised the company's board that it intends to meet with News Corporation to determine whether... it will be possible to ensure the level of commitment to editorial independence, integrity and journalistic freedom that is the hallmark of Dow Jones," the statement also said. A Dow Jones spokeswoman and a News Corp. spokesman were not immediately available for comment. Hugh Bancroft III, one of the family members, declined to comment, and other Bancroft family members and their legal representatives did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Dow Jones shares rose to $58.50 in after-hours electronic trading. They closed up 46 cents to $53.31 on the New York Stock Exchange earlier in the day.
