 COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (Reuters) - Some progress is being made to modify home loans to borrowers with poor credit histories but more work by regulators and industry is needed, a senior U.S. banking regulator said on Thursday. 

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Vice Chairman Martin Gruenberg said accounting, tax and legal issues remain before some subprime loans sold as securities can be modified to help homeowners facing late payments and foreclosure. "A successful outcome would require a committed and concerted effort by servicers and other mortgage industry participants working together with federal and state regulators," Gruenberg said at a conference of state banking officials. Interest rates on about 2 million subprime mortgages, which represent about 14 percent of the outstanding market, are expected to re-price over the next two years. About half of subprime loans were made by lenders not subject to federal regulation. Gruenberg said federal regulators believe many subprime loans can be refinanced to loans with fixed interest rates and are trying to help other subprime borrowers facing the loss of their homes. Federal regulators might issue this summer final industry guidance on subprime mortgages, including the so-called "2-28" adjustable rate mortgage. With this type of loan, the monthly interest rate payment resets after the first two years. Gruenberg said regulators have been reviewing more than 200 comment letters from the public, industry and consumer groups on how to proceed. "During this rapid growth in subprime lending many loans were made without regard to prudent underwriting standards," he said. "But it now appears that the most elementary notion of predatory lending -- the failure to underwrite based on the borrower's ability to pay -- became prevalent in the subprime mortgage market." Another U.S. regulator said last week that the practice of stated income -- the use of unverified income data in making mortgage loans -- helped people qualify for bigger loans and more expensive houses, and tempted brokers to push such practices to gain higher fees. In a lofty market, borrowers used rising home prices to service their debts by refinancing and using the equity generated by house price appreciation, said Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan. Refinancing also brought in another round of fees for brokers and lenders. Delinquent payments and foreclosures have since risen as many adjustable rate loans reset at higher interest rates and U.S. home prices stagnate or fall in some areas. "We need to restore responsible underwriting standards to the subprime mortgage market," Gruenberg said.
