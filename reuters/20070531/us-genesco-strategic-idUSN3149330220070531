 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Shoe and hat retailer Genesco Inc. said on Thursday that it rejected a sweetened takeover bid of $1.2 billion from rival Foot Locker Inc. ( FL.N ) and hired Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) to help it explore strategic options, including a possible sale of the company. 

 Genesco ( GCO.N ), which operates the Lids and Journeys chains, said it received a takeover offer of $1.2 billion, or $51-share, from Foot Locker on May 24. It rejected the offer, saying it was not in the best interest of its shareholders. In April, Foot Locker offered to buy Genesco for $46 per share. That would have valued Genesco at $1.0 billion, based on its 22.75 million shares outstanding as of March 23. Genesco said Foot Locker's initial offer failed to reflect Genesco's long-term value, including its market position and growth prospects. At the time, Foot Locker said it was considering other options that included raising the bid and a proxy fight. After Genesco rejected Foot Locker's sweetened takeover bid on Thursday, Foot Locker said it would no longer pursue its proposal. Genesco's stock initially rose, hitting a high of $53.85, on the news it hired Goldman Sachs to explore a potential sale. The stock fell somewhat after Foot Locker abandoned its bid. Still, shares of Genesco traded above Foot Locker's last offer -- up 30 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $52.60 in noon trading. "There's not a lot of people clamoring to buy Genesco. Without Foot Locker as a hungry bidder, any auction (of Genesco) now becomes more of a plea than a competitive sale," said one investment banker, who declined to be identified by name. Genesco currently trades for 18.7-times Wall Street's earnings forecasts for 2007, which is above the average 16.4-times earnings for the apparel-retail sector. Foot Locker's latest offer of $51 per share would have valued Genesco at 18.3-times earnings. Jefferies & Co. analyst Timothy Allen said Foot Locker's sweetened bid had been too low, but an offer in the mid- to high-$60's-per-share might be something Genesco would consider. Women's Wear Daily reported earlier in May that Genesco was in talks with a buyout firm, possibly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL, which was also interested in making a bid for footwear retailer Skechers USA Inc. ( SKX.N ). Separately, Genesco on Thursday also reported a 79 percent drop in first-quarter earnings due to charges for closing underperforming stores. Net income fell to $2.2 million, or 10 cents a share, compared with $10.5 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Net income included asset impairment charges of 15 cents per share. Sales increased 6 percent to $335 million. The company said it expects fiscal 2008 earnings of $2.37 to $2.40 per share on sales of $1.59 billion.
