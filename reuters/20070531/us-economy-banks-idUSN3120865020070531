 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Earnings at U.S. banks fell slightly in the first three months of the year amid a continuing housing slump and tightening credit standards, a banking regulator said on Thursday. 

 Commercial lenders overseen by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. posted a net income of $36 billion in the first quarter of the year. That was off 2.5 percent, or $900 million, compared with the same quarter a year ago and was the fourth-highest income reported by the industry, the FDIC said. Earnings "remain solid" despite a slump in housing and a general tightening of credit, FDIC chairman Sheila Bair said. "We are seeing signs of a gradual turn in the credit cycle," Bair said. While banks showed overall health, the FDIC did register problem signs in real estate lending. Delinquencies among mortgage loans helped drive up the overall level of late loans by $4 billion, or 7 percent, from the previous quarter. Delinquent residential mortgages increased by $1.7 billion, or 7.3 percent, at the end of March compared with the end of 2006. The rate of delinquent mortgages registered a 17-year high at 1.13 percent, the FDIC said. Those dark spots in real estate were not a cause for alarm about the overall health of the lending industry, Bair said. Lenders have been shaken, in part, by failures among subprime loans offered to borrowers with damaged credit. The lending regulators will finalize rules governing subprime loans before the end of July, Bair said. Those rules will regulate lenders that rely on depositors for capital, but other strictures are needed for loans bankrolled by Wall Street and other investors, she said. "I think we need to work with the (Federal Reserve) and Congress to see if we can impose standards nationally for all lenders to fully address this problem," Bair said. Crafting new regulations "would be faster and more fine- tuned" than new lawmaking, she said. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke may set new lending standards under a wide-ranging consumer protection law called the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA). Bair said HOEPA "could be broader in its impact" than the rules that bank regulators come up with. HOEPA could even be used as a way to indirectly regulate mortgage brokers who do not now have to abide by specific federal standards. "You can get to mortgage broker practices through regulating the relationship with the lender. In other words, if you say the lender will be liable if the broker does x,y,z, then you can indirectly regulate it," she said. Many subprime borrowers who now face foreclosure have found their mortgages are in the hands of investors who are not willing or able to change the payment terms to help them save their homes. Bair said the FDIC will continue to push investors to ease up on troubled borrowers where possible. "The (mortgage) servicing community needs to work with community advocacy groups to reach out and get these loans restructured in a way that is sustainable," she said. For the first time, the FDIC studied the use of mortgages that let borrowers put off big payments and so grow their loan balances. Such negative amortizing loans made up $207 billion, or 9.5 percent, of the $2.2 trillion mortgage market at the end of March, the FDIC said. Negative amortizing loans were popular on the West Coast during the recent housing boom when borrowers came to see rising home values as an insurance policy against high mortgage costs.
