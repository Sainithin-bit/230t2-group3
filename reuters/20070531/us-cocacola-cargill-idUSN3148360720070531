 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) has teamed up with privately-held Cargill Inc. to market a new calorie-free natural sweetener aimed at health-conscious consumers, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Thursday. 

 Coke has filed 24 patent applications for the product, tentatively named rebiana, and would have exclusive rights to develop and sell rebiana in beverages, the Journal reported. Neither company specified development costs for rebiana, according to the report. Coke did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
