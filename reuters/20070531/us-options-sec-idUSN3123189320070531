 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mercury Interactive and Brocade Communications Systems Inc. ( BRCD.O ) agreed to pay a combined $35 million to settle charges they fraudulently backdated stock options that helped enrich former executives, U.S. regulators said on Thursday. 

 The settlements represent the first time companies have agreed to pay civil penalties related to the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe of more than 100 companies suspected of manipulating option grant dates. Mercury, a software company acquired by Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) in November, will pay $28 million, and Brocade, a maker of data storage equipment, agreed to pay $7 million. Both Silicon Valley companies settled the charges without admitting or denying wrongdoing. SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said the enforcement action demonstrated that the agency "will use all the weapons in our arsenal" to protect investors from fraudulent backdating. The agency has also filed civil charges against several executives with Brocade and Mercury. The SEC alleged that Brocade, its former chief executive and other former executives, backdated grants for "tens of millions" of stock options, misstated compensation expenses and concealed the conduct by falsifying documents. "Brocade is being held accountable for the egregious and long-running misconduct of its former CEO and other former executives who misled investors and obscured the company's financial condition and performance," the SEC said. The agency alleged that Brocade's former boss, Gregory Reyes, routinely boosted employees' compensation by granting valuable in-the-money stock options for which financial statement expenses were required. The SEC alleged that former executives of the San Jose, California, company had concealed the fact that the options had been granted in-the-money -- or below the prices at which the stock was selling at the time -- by creating false records. That way, the company could avoid reporting hundreds of millions of dollars in undisclosed compensation expenses. Last July, the SEC filed a civil lawsuit against Reyes and two other former executives of Brocade for fraud and securities laws violations. They also face a criminal fraud trial next month for charges filed by the U.S. Justice Department. Brocade said in a statement that it did not expect any action by federal prosecutors against the company. MERCURY ACCUSED OF MANIPULATING EARNINGS Separately, the SEC accused Mercury and four former senior executives of scheming from 1997 to 2005 to award themselves secret compensation by backdating stock option grants and falsifying documents to hide their actions. The SEC said the former Mercury executives failed to record hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation expenses on company financial statements and falsified documents. The agency is still pursuing civil fraud charges against former Mercury Chief Executive Amnon Landan, former chief financial officers Sharlene Abrams and Douglas Smith, and former general counsel Susan Skaer. Landan and Smith violated the certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley reform law by signing 10-K financial reports in 2003-2005 that contained false information, the agency said. The executives "should have known or were reckless in not knowing" that they filed false information, the SEC said. Attorneys for Smith and Abrams separately said their clients did nothing wrong. Skaer's lawyer, Melinda Haag, said Skaer is not an accountant. "Susan had no responsibility for accounting at Mercury, and had no idea that the company operated in violation of any accounting rules," Haag said in an e-mailed statement. The agency said Landan and Abrams created a "secret backlog" of revenue that could be booked whenever needed to smooth out Mercury's earnings. The revenue was accumulated by directing employees to not ship ordered products toward the end of a quarter once financial targets were made, it said. Abrams went so far as to make a PowerPoint presentation to other company executives in May 1999 that was titled, "Our Hidden Backlog ... What Any Analyst Would Love to Get Their Hands On!" One of the products that Mercury sold was software to help companies comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley law, a corporate reform passed in 2002 after several accounting scandals. Last month, the SEC settled option dating charges with the former chief financial officer of Apple, who paid a $3.5 million civil fine. The agency also has a case pending against Apple's former general counsel. Federal prosecutors have filed criminal cases against former executives of McAfee Inc. MFE.N and Comverse Technology Inc. CMVT.PK. (Additional reporting by  Philipp Gollner  in San Francisco and  Joseph Giannone  in New York)
