 BOSTON  (Reuters) - A female staff attorney at General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) sued her employer on Thursday, claiming that it underpays and underpromotes its women employees. In papers prepared for filing in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, Lorene Schaefer charged the world's second-largest company by market capitalization with gender discrimination. The suit also names 13 GE officers and directors, including Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt. Her suit, which is seeking class-action status, seeks $500 million in damages for a class of about 1,500 GE women workers, according to a statement issued by her attorneys, David Sanford and Steven Wittels of Sanford Wittels & Heisler LP. "This lawsuit is designed to achieve systemic injunctive relief to change GE's discriminatory pay and promotions practices and policies," Schaefer, 43, charged in court papers. Schaefer, 13-year veteran of the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company, serves as general counsel at GE's transportation unit.
