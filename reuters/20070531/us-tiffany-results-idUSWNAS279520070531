 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co. ( TIF.N ) reported a 15 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, edging past Wall Street estimates, and forecast full-year earnings in line with analysts' expectations. 

 Net income rose to $49.7 million, or 36 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30, from $43.1 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings were a penny above analysts' average forecast of 35 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 15 percent to $620.9 million, helped by growth in most markets except for Japan, where net sales fell 3 percent, the company said. Japan accounts for more than half of Tiffany's international sales. For fiscal 2007, the New York-based company said it expects a profit of $2.10 to $2.15 per share. Analysts' average forecast is $2.11. It forecast sales growth of 12 percent for the full fiscal year. It expects same-store sales -- sales at stores open at least a year -- to increase in the high single digits in the United States and in the mid- to high single digits abroad. Fading sales in Japan are expected to be offset by strength in its other markets, Tiffany said. Same-store sales in Japan fell 10 percent in April and have not improved since then, it said. Tiffany also said it plans to increase its store footprint by 10 percent and expand its Tiffany & Co. branded wholesale watch distribution significantly. New U.S. stores planned include ones on Wall Street in Manhattan, in Red Bank, New Jersey, and in Las Vegas. Tiffany shares were up 18 cents at $52.64 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $54.75 earlier in the session. Through Wednesday, the stock had risen nearly 34 percent this year.
