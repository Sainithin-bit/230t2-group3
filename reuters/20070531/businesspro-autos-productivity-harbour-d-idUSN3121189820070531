 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Japan's Toyota Motor Corp.( 7203.T ) had 
the most efficient North American manufacturing plants in 2006, 
an annual benchmark survey released on Thursday showed. 

  But the gap in productivity among the six major North 
American automakers continued to narrow, as quality advances 
and more-flexible labor agreements drove improvements, 
according to the Harbour Report, released by Harbour 
Consulting.  Last year, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7267.T ) showed the biggest 
improvement of 2.7 percent in combined assembly, stamping and 
powertrain operations, the report said.  In overall productivity, General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), 
Honda, DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE DCX.N Chrysler Group 
and Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) showed improvement in 2006.  "General Motors essentially caught Toyota in vehicle 
assembly productivity," Ron Harbour, president of Harbour 
Consulting. "Considering that they will be building vehicles in 
2007 with dramatically fewer hourly employees in the U.S., GM, 
Ford and Chrysler likely will reduce their hours per vehicle 
significantly."  Harbour Consulting measures productivity at North American 
plants, calculating the labor hours needed to make vehicles.  Ron Harbour said lower production time equated to a cost 
advantage of about $200 to $300 for Toyota over Ford, which 
trailed all of the surveyed automakers.  Japan's Toyota led in 2006 by producing a vehicle in 29.93 
labor hours, on average, followed by Honda, which took 31.63 
labor hours.  Productivity improved for each of the Detroit-based 
automakers over 2005, but they still trailed Toyota and Honda.  GM trimmed total production hours per vehicle by 2.5 
percent in 2006 to 32.36 hours. Chrysler improved 2.4 percent 
in 2006 to 32.90 hours across its assembly, stamping and 
powertrain plants. Ford productivity improved 1.9 percent, but 
it placed last at 35.10 labor hours.  Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) did not participate in this 
year's report, but Harbour estimates it took 29.97 hours to 
build a vehicle the year before.  All three Detroit automakers are in the midst of shutting 
plants and cutting jobs in North America as they restructure 
operations. On a combined basis, they are closing more than two 
dozen plants and cutting over 80,000 jobs in North America.  By closing plants in the next two years, all three should 
improve capacity utilization, the report said.  Ford's vice president of North America manufacturing Joe 
Hinrichs said the company expects a "significant improvement" 
next year, but declined to be more specific.  Gary Cowger, GM vice president of global manufacturing and 
labor relations, said productivity gains are key to the 
turnaround of the automaker.  "There are still a lot of areas where we need to continue 
to improve our flexibility, our productivity, and we have to 
close the gap to every competitor in the world," Cowger said.  While production times narrowed among the automakers, big 
gaps remained in profitability.  Toyota and Honda each earned an average pretax margin of 
more than $1,200 on vehicles sold in North America. In 
contrast, Chrysler lost $1,072 per vehicle, while GM lost 
$1,436 and Ford lost $5,234 per vehicle in 2006.  The losses reflected a variety of factors, including the 
large difference in health care and pension costs, as well as 
rebates and low-interest-rate financing, the report said.  GM and Ford are struggling with multibillion-dollar "legacy 
costs," including retiree health care and pension benefits 
awarded under contracts with the United Auto Workers union.
