 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Business activity in the U.S. Midwest expanded in May at a much faster rate than expected fueled by a surge in new orders and stronger hiring, a report showed on Thursday. 

 The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 61.7 from 52.9 in April. Economists had forecast the index at 54.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion. "The index has seen a lot of recent volatility and the rise is probably overstated, but the trend appears to be picking up from a recent soft spot," said David Sloan, economist at 4CAST Ltd. in New York. Analysts said automakers, an important part of the Chicago-area economy, have been working off bloated inventories with production cutbacks. "This confirms that the inventory adjustment is behind us and that the manufacturing sector will contribute to a re-acceleration of growth in the economy," said Dana Johnson, chief economist at Comerica in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The NAPM-Chicago's employment component of the index jumped to 57.3 from 50.5 in April, its strongest since April 2005. New orders surged to 71.1 from 56.5 and production was at 69.8 against 62.2. Prices paid rose to 70.2 from 64.9, the highest since August 2006. The report triggered a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, with the benchmark 10-year note yield rising above 4.90 percent for the first time since August, from 4.87 percent earlier. Short-term interest rates futures fell, slashing the chances for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut this year below 30 percent. Futures still show no appetite for the Fed to raise overnight borrowing rates above the current 5.25 percent. "The prices paid index is very high and support's the Fed's view that inflation remains the top concern," said David Watt, foreign exchange strategist at RBC Capital in Toronto. "At these levels it may be enough to keep pushing back expectations for a rate cut this year." Many analysts see the NAPM-Chicago survey as a factory-sector report since the region is relatively industrialized, but service sector firms are also polled. The index measures activity by companies based in the Chicago area, even if they have operations else where. Separately on Thursday, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, area's PMI rose to 58 in May from 49 in April.
