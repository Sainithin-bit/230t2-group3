 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday picked AT&T ( T.N ), Level 3 LVLT.O, Qwest ( Q.N ), Verizon ( VZ.N ) and Sprint Nextel ( S.N ) for a contract worth up to $20 billion over 10 years to improve its telecommunications services. 

 This is the second of two contracts that comprise the government's Networx program, which is designed to overhaul federal agencies' telecommunication services. The General Services Administration picked AT&T, Verizon Communications and Qwest for the first contract worth up to $48 billion. The U.S. government chose Sprint among other  companies for its second lucrative contract. Sprint's failure to win part of the first contract was a surprising upset because the company had provided telecommunication services to U.S. government agencies for some 18 years. The second contract was less demanding than the first and required companies to show they could provide nine mandatory services. The first contract required an ability to provide 36 mandatory services. The GSA provides business services of all kinds for some 135 federal agencies and offices. "It's quite a large population in terms of our customer base," a GSA spokesman said at a news conference. "Most if not all agencies that we currently have today will choose to use the Networx program." The five winning companies will still have to compete with each other for individual sales within government agencies, according to GSA officials.
