 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Average U.S. home prices rose 0.5 percent in the first quarter from the prior quarter and 4.3 percent from a year earlier, but price appreciation was the slowest in a decade, a federal regulatory agency reported on Thursday. 

 Although some economists expected the Home Price Index to fall, house prices nationwide continued climbing in the first quarter, "albeit at the lowest rate in 10 years," James Lockhart director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), said in a news release. The quarterly index is based on sales and refinancing transactions. OFHEO's purchase-only index, based solely on purchase price data, showed slower price appreciation over the past year of 3 percent. Price trends varied considerably regionally, OFHEO said. Seven states posted double-digit annual home price gains while seven sates had price appreciation of less than 2 percent. Prices fell in seven states, including Florida and California. Nationally, house prices grew faster over the past year than non-housing goods and services prices that are reflected in the Consumer Price Index, according to OFHEO. House prices rose 4.3 percent while prices of goods and services excluding shelter increased 1.6 percent. "Low interest rates and unemployment rates continue to prop up house prices in most markets," OFHEO Chief Economist Patrick Lawler said in the release. "Prices are rising slowly in most areas. However, there are some exceptions," he added. "For the first time in seven years, two states -- Massachusetts and Michigan -- experienced four-quarter price declines." The states with the largest price growth in the first quarter compared with the same quarter a year ago were Utah, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and Washington. The increases ranged from 11.6 percent in Washington to 17 percent in Utah. States on the other end of the spectrum were Michigan, Massachusetts, Nevada, Ohio and New Hampshire. Prices in those states ranged from a 0.7 percent drop in Michigan to a 1.1 percent rise in New Hampshire.
