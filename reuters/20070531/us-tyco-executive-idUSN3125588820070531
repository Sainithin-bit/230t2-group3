 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. judge said on Thursday that Tyco International ( TYC.N ) owed severance pay and interest of about $1.2 million to a former senior executive accused of participating in an accounting scandal at the diversified manufacturer. 

 Richard Power, a former vice president and division chief financial officer, sued the company for breach of contract and about $9 million in severance pay in 2002. Power, who reported to now-jailed chief executive Dennis Kozlowski, claimed that in a phone conversation, the two agreed, in the event of his termination, Power would receive severance pay equal to the greater of $1.5 million or twice his salary and bonus in his last year of employment. Power was fired by Tyco's new management in 2002. U.S. District Judge Gerard Lynch, who heard the case in Manhattan, ruled on Thursday that Tyco had, in fact, breached an oral severance agreement with Power. Finding that neither Power nor Kozlowski were credible witnesses in the case, Lynch awarded Power $900,000 plus interest. The figure is twice Powers' fiscal 2001 salary, but excluded the $4.2 million cash bonus he received that year. "It would be extremely unusual for a severance agreement of the sort Power contends was made not to be committed to writing," Lynch wrote in the opinion. A lawyer for Power, Kenneth Rubinstein, said his client was "not displeased" with the opinion. "We're obviously pleased that the judge decided that there was actually an agreement," Rubinstein said. Lynch also wrote that he did not find any merit to Tyco's argument that any agreement Power had with the company would be void because of fraud. In December, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Power and another ex-Tyco executive, of inflating the company's operating income by hundreds of millions of dollars through a sham transaction. "We're evaluating the court's ruling," Tyco spokesman Paul Fitzhenry said. Earlier this year Tyco settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay $50 million to settle accounting fraud charges. The SEC said Tyco overstated its results by $1 billion between 1996 and 2002 in a fraud that was orchestrated by the company's top officials. Kozlowski is currently serving a sentence of up to 25 years at the Mid-State Correctional Facility in Marcy, New York.
