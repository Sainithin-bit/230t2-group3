 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co. reported a 15 percent rise in quarterly profit on Thursday, edging past Wall Street estimates, as higher-priced items pushed up sales in all of its markets except Japan. 

 The company, which also forecast full-year earnings in line with Wall Street expectations, has relied on pricier items such as diamonds to boost sales in the past few quarters. Net income rose to $49.7 million, or 36 cents per share, in the first quarter ended April 30, from $43.1 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings were a penny above analysts' average forecast of 35 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales rose 15 percent to $620.9 million, helping to offset a decline of 3 percent in Japan, which accounts for more than half of the retailer's international sales. For fiscal 2007, the New York-based company said it expects a profit of $2.10 to $2.15 per share. Analysts' average forecast is  $2.11. It forecast sales growth of 12 percent for the full fiscal year. It expects same-store sales -- those at stores open at least a year -- to increase in the high single digits in the United States and in the mid- to high single digits abroad. JAPAN, NEW STORES Tiffany expects weak sales in Japan to be offset by strength in other markets, it said. Same-store sales in that market fell 10 percent in April and have not improved since then. The company, which has been trying to turn around sales in Japan by opening new stores and closing underperforming ones, also announced plans to expand its less-expensive silver jewelry line there. Tiffany said it plans to increase its total number of stores by 10 percent and expand its Tiffany & Co. branded wholesale watch distribution significantly. Planned new stores include Wall Street in Manhattan in New York City; Red Bank, New Jersey, and Las Vegas, Nevada; as well as overseas in cities such as London and Hamburg. Maintaining her "hold" rating on the company's stock, WR Hambrecht & Co. analyst Melissa Otto said strength in new markets, particularly "second tier" U.S. cities such as Houston, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia, as well as others in the Asia Pacific region, should be able to offset softness in Japan. The company's shares were little changed at $52.41 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $54.75 earlier in the session. Through Wednesday, the stock had risen nearly 34 percent this year.
