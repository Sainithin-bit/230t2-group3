 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's Commerce Ministry said on Wednesday that it would impose anti-subsidy and anti-dumping duties on imports of small U.S. automobiles, the latest in a series of trade spats between the world's two largest economies. 
 The duties, to affect major U.S. auto makers, including General Motors, Chrysler Group, Ford Motor Company and U.S.-based foreign automakers, will begin from Thursday and last two years, a statement on the ministry website (www.mofcom.gov.cn) said. The amounts of the duties would range from 2.0 percent to 21.5 percent. (Reporting by Wang Lan and Michael Martina; Editing by  Ken Wills )
