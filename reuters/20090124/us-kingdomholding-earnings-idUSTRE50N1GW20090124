 RIYADH  (Reuters) - Kingdom Holding Co 4280.SE, owned by Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, said on Saturday that it had revised its fourth-quarter earnings to show a small overall profit after initially reporting a net loss close to $8.3 billion. 

 The revision followed the completion of an examination by Kingdom Holding of its preliminary financial earnings for 2008 and a "re-categorization of some items of its income statement," according to a statement posted on Saudi bourse website. Based on this "re-categorization," the company said, Kingdom Holding showed an "overall" profit of 276 million riyals ($73.6 million). The company reported on January 20 a Q4 net loss of 30.97 billion riyals ($8.26 billion) after a dive in the value of its assets, which include a substantial stake in Citigroup ( C.N ). Kingdom's spokeswoman Heba Fatani declined to immediately comment on the official stock market disclosure. (Reporting by  Souhail Karam ; Editing by  Thomas Atkins )
