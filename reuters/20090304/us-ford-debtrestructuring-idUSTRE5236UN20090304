 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it was launching offers to restructure its debt through a combination of conversion and cash tender offers. 

 Ford said it was making available up to $2.2 billion cash to restructure its debt. The automaker had $25.8 billion of automotive debt as of the end 2008. Ford has the potential to restructure up to $10.4 billion of debt, given the cash available and the prices, the company said (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
