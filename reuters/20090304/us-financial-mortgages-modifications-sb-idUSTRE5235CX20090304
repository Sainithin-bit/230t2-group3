 (Reuters) - The Obama administration on Wednesday gave lenders a green light to begin modifying home mortgages under a new $75 billion program aimed primarily at people facing imminent financial hardship. 

 The $75 billion mortgage modification plan is part of a larger Obama administration effort announced on February 18 to support the U.S. housing market and distressed homeowners. Eligibility requirements for the mortgage modification program include the following: MODIFICATION ELIGIBILTY * Borrowers must represent that they do not have sufficient liquid assets to make their monthly mortgage payments. These assets will not include retirement accounts. * Every borrower who seeks a modification must be screened for financial hardship. Borrowers must demonstrate a change in circumstances that causes hardship, such as a drop in income or an imminent payment increase. * Delinquency is not a requirement, and households that are at imminent risk of default are eligible. * Borrowers with high total debt may qualify but only after they enter government-certified debt counseling. * The mortgage to be modified must have been originated on or before January 1, 2009, and homes must be owner-occupied, 1-4 unit family dwellings that are primary residences. * Loans must have unpaid principal balance up to $729,750 for a single-family home, $934,200 for a two-unit home, $1.129 million for a three-unit home, and $1.403 million for a four-unit home. * New applications for the program will be accepted until December 31, 2012. There is no borrower cost to obtain a modification. * There is no minimum or maximum loan-to-value ratio. * Borrowers in bankruptcy are not automatically eliminated from consideration for modification, and borrowers in litigation regarding their mortgage can qualify for a modification without waiving their legal rights. * Foreclosure actions are temporarily suspended while borrowers are considered for foreclosure prevention options. Loans can only be modified once under the program. * Eligibility for the program will sunset at the end of three years. INCENTIVES FOR LENDERS, BORROWERS * The U.S. Treasury will share with lenders and mortgage servicers part of the cost of reducing monthly payments. * The lender is responsible for reducing payments to 38 percent of the borrower's monthly income through interest-rate reductions or other means. The Treasury will match dollar-for-dollar further reductions that bring payments down to 31 percent of the borrower's monthly income. * Loan servicers that modify loans according to the program guidelines will receive a $1,000 up-front fee for each modification and a $1,000 annual fee for each still-performing loan. * Home owners who make modified payments on time will receive a $1,000 reduction in their loan principal each year, up to $5,000. * Lenders and investors will receive a one-time bonus of $1,500 for each loan modified before borrowers miss any payments. Servicers will receive a $500 bonus on these loans. * The U.S. Treasury is developing additional incentives to encourage extinguishing second-lien home equity loans to reduce a borrower's overall indebtedness. * The program sets an interest rate floor of 2 percent on modified loans. The modified rate must remain in place for five years. * After five years, the rate increases 1 percent per year up to a cap that is intended to reflect market rates at the time the loan was modified. RELAXED RULES ON FANNIE MAE/FREDDIE MAC REFINANCINGS * Program targets 4 million to 5 million borrowers with solid payment histories on mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that were originated with a loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent or less. * Lenders can refinance these loans with guarantees by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac even if the loan-to-value ratio has risen to up to 105 percent. No additional credit enhancement is needed. * Borrowers are responsible for paying lender fees, points and other closing costs. * Interest rates are prevailing market rates for 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages.
