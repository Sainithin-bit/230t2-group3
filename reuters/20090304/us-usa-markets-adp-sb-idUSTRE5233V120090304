 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector shrank further in February but by less than expected, according to a report released on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index came in at 41.6 in February versus 42.9 in January. * The level of 50 separates expansion from contraction in the index, which dates back to July 1997. * Economists had expected a reading of 41.0, according to the median of 69 forecasts in a Reuters poll ranging from 37.0 to 44.0. COMMENTS: ROBERT BLAKE, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, STATE STREET GLOBAL MARKETS, BOSTON: "The ISM headline was a little better than expected. Given that economic data coming out of the United States have been pretty grim, the fact that this number is showing some relative stability is probably good for risk appetite and therefore we're seeing the euro move a little bit higher against the dollar. But I don't think the impact on the market would last. The employment index was also higher from the previous month, but I think the ADP report is a better indicator for Friday's non-farm payrolls report and that was pretty grim. So I don't think the ISM's employment index would affect the market's bearish expectations for the jobs data." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The ISM non-manufacturing index gives a mixed message in that activity remains in a broad decline, broader than last month, but the employment index improved a bit which hints that employer sentiment may be stabilizing. But that's a very very mild improvement. Otherwise, it's a very negative set of numbers. Orders were a bit weaker, backlogs fell, and the sentiment expressed in the headline figure was particularly negative. It's discouraging because the non-manufacturing sector tends to be more stable than the manufacturing sector and this report is showing non-manufacturing deteriorating even as the ISM manufacturing data we got on Monday suggested a slightly more stable picture. It's definitely a rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic situation." KURT KARL, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, SWISS RE, NEW YORK "On aggregate, the services sector is more pessimistic going forward and it is contracting a bit faster. It's going in the wrong direction. This is a slow "U"-shape recession. We are still sinking. There is no sign of a bottom." TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "Just like yesterday's ISM report, the non-manufacturing report suggests that the pace of deterioration is slowing. One detail in the report was interesting in that the employment gauge actually rose. Bonds are close to breaking out to fresh high yields for the year-to-date and stocks appear to have turned the corner on the 700 barrier for the S&P 500." ANDREW BEKOFF, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, LPB CAPITAL LLC, DOYLESTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA: "Below 50 is considered contraction and the economy continues to contract. The dollar is very extended right now and I'm looking for a pullback to the 87 level on the dollar index, but the intermediate trend remains bullish for the dollar." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes steady at higher levels. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices steady at lower levels. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar holds gains versus yen.
