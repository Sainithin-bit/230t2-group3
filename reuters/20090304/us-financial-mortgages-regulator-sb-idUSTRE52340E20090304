 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banking regulators on Wednesday urged lenders and mortgage servicers to participate in a government program to support home loan modifications, in an effort to ease downward pressure on house prices and prevent home foreclosures. 

 "By providing servicers and and holders of eligible residential mortgages with incentives to modify loans at risk of foreclosure, the program will promote sustainable alternatives to foreclosures," five federal bank oversight agencies said in a statement.
