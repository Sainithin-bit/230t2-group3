 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Three top MySpace executives, including chief operating officer Amit Kapur, are leaving News Corp's ( NWSA.O ) online social network to start a new venture, the company said on Tuesday. 

 MySpace said Kapur was leaving along with Jim Benedetto, senior vice president of engineering, and Steve Pearman, senior vice president of product strategy, but that they would remain on board for the next few weeks to ensure a smooth transition. The company made no comment on plans to replace Kapur, who was at MySpace for four years andd was COO for more than a year. The executive oversaw the social network's first MySpace initiatives for mobile phones and was a key part of the creation of the MySpace Music venture.
