 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) has won a contract worth up to $5 billion through 2018 to provide contractor logistics support for the U.S. military's Special Operations Command, the Pentagon said on Tuesday. 

 The contract included a variety of payment provisions, including firm fixed price, incentive arrangements and cost reimbursable arrangements, the Defense Department said in its daily digest of major contract awards. Under the contract, Lockheed would provide contractor logistics support services to support U.S. Special Operations Command at locations worldwide. The contract, which has a minimum guaranteed amount of $2.5 million, runs through March 2018, the Pentagon said. (Reporting by  Andrea Shalal-Esa ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
