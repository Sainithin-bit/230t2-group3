 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ) slashed its dividend 88 percent on Wednesday, joining a slew of major U.S. lenders reducing payouts to preserve capital. 

 The eighth-largest U.S. bank cut its quarterly dividend to 5 cents per share from 42.5 cents, citing uncertainty in financial markets and a weakening economy. The move should save more than $2.6 billion a year. Shares of U.S. Bancorp fell 12.7 percent in afternoon trading. Prior to 2008, U.S. Bancorp had boosted its dividend for 36 straight years. The Minneapolis-based bank took $6.6 billion from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Dozens of lenders, including Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), PNC Financial Services Group Inc ( PNC.N ), have reduced or eliminated dividends to preserve capital needed to cover rising credit losses. "A dividend reduction is the least dilutive and most economical means of raising capital" and "a prudent response to our concerns surrounding the industry's capital adequacy, given the uncertain economic environment," Chief Executive Richard Davis said on a conference call. Alluding to government regulators, he said the bank was "not directed" by anyone to lower the payout. Peter Winter, a BMO Capital Markets analyst, wrote that even with the reduction, U.S. Bancorp could still use more capital, "especially in an environment with accelerated credit costs." He rated the bank "market perform." Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) remains the largest traditional U.S. commercial bank not to lower its dividend during the credit crisis. At Tuesday's close, its yield was 12.7 percent, close to U.S. Bancorp's 13.5 percent. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Julia Tunis Bernard declined to comment. Other banks that have left their dividends alone include BB&T Corp ( BBT.N ), Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ), Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ). U.S. Bancorp shares were down $1.60 at $10.98. Wells Fargo shares slid 14 percent. The KBW Bank Index .BKX shed 5.2percent. CREDIT LOSSES INCREASE U.S. Bancorp has weathered the credit crisis better than many rivals because its mix of businesses is less dependent on the health of the consumer. Nevertheless, fourth-quarter profit fell 65 percent to its lowest level since 2001, and the bank more than quintupled the amount set aside for credit losses. CEO Davis said the bank expects to keep building loss reserves but should perform "quite well" when it undergoes a government "stress test" to gauge its ability to handle a deep recession. He also said U.S. Bancorp does not need new capital, and plans to pay back the TARP money "as soon as possible." Chief Financial Officer Andrew Cecere said the bank should be profitable in the first quarter and the full year. Analysts, on average, expect profit of 28 cents per share for the quarter and $1.24 for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. U.S. Bancorp has $265.9 billion of assets and 2,791 banking offices in 24 U.S. states.
