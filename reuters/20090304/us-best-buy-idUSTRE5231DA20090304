 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. electronics retailer Best Buy ( BBY.N ) and joint venture partner Carphone Warehouse ( CPW.L ) have postponed the launch of their first UK store until the first quarter of 2010, the Financial Times reported. 

 "If it makes more commercial sense to open three or four months later, that is what we will do," Roger Taylor, Carphone Warehouse's finance director, told the newspaper. The joint venture had planned to open its first store in the UK this summer. "Because of the economic climate <it is> more sensible to wait for better sites ... the quality of the sites is getting better, not just the locations, but also the economics," said Taylor. He added that the postponement was "unrelated" to Best Buy's woes. The group issued a profit warning in November. The delay comes as rival DSG International Plc DSGI.L received a positive reaction on Tuesday to its announcement it would roll out its new format stores.
