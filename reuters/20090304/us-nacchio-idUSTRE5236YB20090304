 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday ordered ex-Qwest Communications International Inc ( Q.N ) Chief Executive Joseph Nacchio to report to prison in Pennsylvania by March 23 to begin serving a sentence for insider trading. 

 Nacchio will serve the six-year prison term at the minimum-security satellite prison camp at Schuylkill federal prison at Minersville, Pennsylvania, according to an order by U.S. District Judge Marcia Krieger. A jury convicted Nacchio in 2007 on 19 counts of insider trading for illegally selling $52 million worth of stock six years earlier, after company insiders warned him that Qwest could not meet its financial targets. A three-judge appeals panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the convictions last year. But the full appeals court reinstated the conviction and Nacchio's six-year prison sentence last week. Nacchio's attorney said her client would ask the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. Nacchio's conviction was considered an important victory in government efforts to crack down on corporate titans who profited while their companies suffered financial setbacks.
