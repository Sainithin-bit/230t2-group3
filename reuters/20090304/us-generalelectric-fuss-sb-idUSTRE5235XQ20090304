 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Loomis Sayles' Dan Fuss, one of the biggest, most widely followed U.S. bond managers, said on Wednesday that the corporate bonds of General Electric Co and its finance unit are still attractive even if traders expect their coveted "AAA" debt ratings to be stripped by the credit agencies. 

 "They are priced in the "A" territory -- the bonds are cheap," Fuss told Reuters in an interview. "GE is a very strong, viable company. There is no liquidity issue for GE and GE Capital. I am comfortable with the credit." Fuss is vice chairman of Boston-based Loomis Sayles, which oversees more than $100 billion in fixed-income securities, including GE and GE Capital Corp. On Wednesday, the heavy selling sent spreads for GE Capital's 5.45 percent notes due in 2013 widening about 185 basis points, yielding 9.8 percent. That is comparable to bonds trading at a "BBB" ratings scale, or the lowest tier of investment grade. "The bonds are cheap relative to the market and, right now, you have a market imbalance, where there are more sellers than buyers," Fuss said. Fuss was referring to the "forced selling" among some of the biggest institutional investors including sovereign wealth funds and foundations and endowments which would no longer be able to hold GE debt if it lost the "AAA" rating. The GE Capital finance business has been GE's Achilles heel in the current downturn, with profit falling 29 percent last year. But Fuss said because it is a finance unit, "it becomes a cost-of-capital issue in this environment." "It is conceivable that it could become an availability issue of capital, although I doubt that," Fuss added. (Additional reporting by  Dena Aubin  and  Walden Siew ; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
