 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pacific Investment Management Co.'s co-chief investment officer, Bill Gross, said on Wednesday the steep sell-off in General Electric shares stemmed from traders betting that the company and its finance unit will lose their coveted triple-A debt rating. 

 General Electric's stocks and bonds are widely held by sovereign wealth funds, Gross told CNBC television. He added the decline in GE shares, which fell more than 10 percent on Wednesday, was partly driven by technical selling by overseas participants.
