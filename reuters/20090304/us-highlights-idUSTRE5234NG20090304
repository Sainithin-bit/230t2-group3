 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The following are highlights of U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's testimony on Wednesday to the Senate Finance Committee on the Obama administration's proposed fiscal 2010 budget. 

 GEITHNER ON NAMING ADDITIONAL TREASURY NOMINEES We're making some progress. We hope to come before the committee soon with a full slate of very strong people. We're doing this carefully, as you would expect, to try to make sure we have the best talent in the country. GEITHNER ON AIG "The biggest effects (of not bailing out AIG) would have been on the direct counterparties to the affiliates of AIG that sold a bunch of credit protection. The biggest effects and the most troubling effects, like we saw with Lehman, but they would be bigger in this case, would have been on broader confidence in the financial system, in asset values, in interest rates and in willingness of people to take risk in exposure to financial institutions. That would have caused much damage. That's harder to quantify, but in the case of AIG it's important because millions of Americans here and around the world depend on AIG for insurance policies and a range of different types of savings products. The judgment your government made in that context was the right judgment because the effect on confidence would have been more dramatic, more dramatic than even in the case of failure of a major investment bank."
