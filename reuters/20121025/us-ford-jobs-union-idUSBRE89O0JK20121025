 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ford ( F.N ) is to close its Transit van factory in Southampton and a stamping plant in Dagenham, Essex, next year in a move that could lead to the loss of around 2,000 jobs, a union official said on Thursday. 
 The move is part of a wider restructuring by Ford which is designed to stem losses in Europe by slashing fixed costs. (Reporting by  Kate Holton ; editing by  Rhys Jones )
