 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities regulator on Monday staked her claim on a slice of the over-the-counter derivatives markets while calling for "limited" changes to federal securities laws. 

 SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro told lawmakers that her agency should get enhanced powers to regulate securities-related OTC derivatives, and argued that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should get responsibility for all other OTC derivatives. "Securities-related OTC derivatives could be brought under the same umbrella of oversight as the related, underlying securities markets in a relatively straightforward manner with little need to 'reinvent the wheel,'" Schapiro told a Senate Banking subcommittee in prepared remarks. The Obama administration unveiled last week its sweeping plan for regulatory reform, which calls on the SEC and CFTC to develop a plan by September on how to harmonize their rules on over-the-counter derivatives. Many securities, such as options on certain types of exchange traded funds, now fall under the jurisdiction of both regulators. At the same time, credit default swaps, widely blamed for contributing to the global financial meltdown, have fallen through regulatory cracks. Schapiro said Congress can make "limited" changes to federal laws by clarifying the definition of "security" to include securities-related OTC derivatives, such as equity derivatives, and credit and other fixed-income derivatives. The CFTC would regulate derivatives related to interest rates, foreign exchange, commodities, energy and metals. Schapiro said the exclusion of securities-related derivatives from the regulatory regime has hurt the SEC's mission of protecting investors. "The SEC's enforcement efforts have been seriously complicated by the lack of a mechanism for promptly obtaining critical information -- who traded, how much, and when -- that is complete and accurate," she said. The SEC is exploring a "tiered approach" to regulating derivatives that would call for additional disclosure requirements for derivatives marketed to less sophisticated counterparties, Schapiro said. She also said the agency may subject people using equity derivatives, such as equity swaps, to beneficial ownership reporting provisions. Such a rule could bring more transparency to takeover efforts by activist hedge funds or other major investors. Under Schapiro's plan, the SEC would also have a role in capital requirements, but would only have such authority over nonbank OTC derivatives dealers who do not have a federal banking regulator. Further, the SEC would regulate trading markets and clearinghouses for securities-related OTC derivatives to ensure that all participants have fair access.
