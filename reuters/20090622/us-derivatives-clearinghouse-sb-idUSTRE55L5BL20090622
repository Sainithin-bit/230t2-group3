 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A key way to reduce economic risk from over-the-counter derivatives would be to require deals in the exotic instruments to go through clearinghouses that guarantee payment, the U.S. regulator of futures markets said on Monday. 

 Gary Gensler, chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, also asked for federal law to require "the registration and regulation of all derivative dealers." "Central clearing should help reduce systemic risks in addition to the benefits derived from comprehensive regulation of derivatives dealer," said Gensler in testimony prepared for a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing. In its proposal for financial regulatory reform, the Obama administration called last week for comprehensive regulation of OTC derivatives. One set of rules would cover dealers and another would cover markets. The proposal would require clearing of "standardized" OTC derivatives through central counter-parties and would move derivatives trading onto regulated exchanges whenever possible. Customized derivatives would be covered by recordkeeping, reporting, margin-setting and antifraud rules. Clearinghouses bring liquidity to markets, set margin requirements and make terms of trade public. With clearinghouses to assure the integrity of a contract, Gensler said, "the failure of a single trader, like AIG, would no longer jeopardize all of the counterparties to its trades." The systemic risk regulator proposed by the administration would ensure "consistent and robust standards for all systemically important clearing, settlement and payment systems," said Gensler, but CFTC would remain the primary futures regulator. He said the systemic regulator could participate in CFTC examinations and make recommendations to the CFTC "and ultimately, after consulting with the primary regulator and the new Financial Services Oversight Council, use emergency authority to compel a clearinghouse to take actions to address financial risks." Under the administration plan, clearinghouses would have to be open to any firm, whether a dealer or trading firm, that meets objective and prudent standards. Indirect participation also should be permitted, said Gensler. Whether OTC contracts go through clearing or are reported to trade repositories, information about the transactions would be available to the public under the administration plan.
