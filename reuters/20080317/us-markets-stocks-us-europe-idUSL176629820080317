 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase's purchase of stricken rival Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom price is expected to drive U.S. indexes down on Monday, following a surprise move by the U.S. Federal Reserve. 

 The Fed made an emergency quarter-point cut to its discount rate to 3.25 percent and arranged to provide cash to a wider range of big financial firms previously unable to borrow directly from the central bank. This was the first time since the Great Depression in the 1930s that the Fed expanded lending to securities firms to prop up the financial system. By 6:22 a.m. EDT, June Dow Jones futures were down 1.5 percent, Nasdaq 100 and Standard & Poor's 500 futures were both down 1.9 percent. The indicative Dow Jones index, which tracks how Dow stocks trade in Frankfurt, was down 1.1 percent. "It is really - and I don't want to use the broadly quoted word 'panic' here - but it is an absolute confidence crisis and a liquidity crisis. Nobody trusts anyone anymore. It is not a nice situation," said Roland Hirschmueller, an equities trader at German brokerage Baader. "Crucial now is how markets will react to the takeover of Bear Stearns for more or less $2 after the stock closed at $30," he added, but said he did not expect to see U.S. stock markets crashing and hoped for an "orderly retraction" instead. Bear shares were quoted at around $2.90 a share in electronic composite trading in New York, against a close on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday of $30. JPMorgan is paying just $2 a share for Bear, or a total of $236 million, although the bank put a total $6 billion price tag on the deal including litigation and severance costs. Still, the per-share payout is just one-fifteenth of Bear's stock price on Friday and miles off its record share price of $172.61 last year. "This was the large bank that had to fall. It cleared the air. But now the big question is what this means for other institutions, how much there still is to come and how much they are now still worth," Hirschmueller said. Another financial firm fell victim to the financial crisis over the weekend as Carlyle Capital Corp announced it is filing for compulsory winding up. The U.S. dollar hit a record low against the euro, Asian and European stock markets plummeted, gold and oil hit fresh record highs and low-risk bonds jumped. FED MEETING "The only positive thing is that the Fed seems to be doing everything it can to bring back confidence into the markets," Hirschmueller said. Market players keenly await the Fed policy-setting meeting on Tuesday. Interest rate futures prices shifted to fully price in an expected 1 percentage point cut, with some chance of an even bigger move -- reductions of a size that would be unprecedented in the central bank's modern history. Economic data on Monday that could give more clues about the U.S. economy's health will be industrial production and capacity utilization, due at 9:15 a.m. Three major Wall Street firms report first-quarter earnings this week. Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Morgan Stanley on Wednesday. Bear Stearns said on Sunday it would no longer announce first-quarter earnings due on Monday. On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.60 percent, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index shed 2.08 percent, the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 2.26 percent. (Editing by Quentin Bryar)
