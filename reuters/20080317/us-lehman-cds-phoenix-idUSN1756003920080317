 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The cost of protecting the debt of Lehman Brothers LEH.N fell on Monday, after earlier rising, while Bear Stearns also rallied after a fire sale of the company to JPMorgan Chase. 

 JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) said late on Sunday it would buy Bear Stearns BSC.N for just $2 a share -- less than 10 percent of its price at Friday's close. The move staved off a likely bankruptcy after the bank's cash position weakened, spurring it to secure emergency financing. But it also shocked markets into speculating other brokers may be in similar distress, with many traders zoning in on Lehman Brothers. Lehman Brothers's credit default swaps surged as much as 130 basis points to a high of 580 basis points before retracing to 430 basis points, 20 basis points tighter than Friday's close, according to Phoenix Partners Group. That means it costs $430,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt. Yields on Lehman Brothers' bonds relative to those on Treasuries ended higher, however, as investors demanded more compensation for their risks. Yields on Lehman Brothers' 5.25 percent notes due in 2012 rose to 572 basis points over Treasuries, up from 501 basis points on Friday, according to MarketAxess. Option traders were also on the defensive in Lehman as its shares were sharply lower in reaction to the Bear Stearns debacle, said independent options trader Frederic Ruffy. In all, roughly 392,000 puts vs. 226,000 calls traded in Lehman, seven times the normal option volume, according to options analytics firm Trade Alert. Heavy volumes were seen in the soon-to-expire March puts at strikes as low as $25, extending into the April contracts with the $10 strike. Traders keen for protection bidded up the price of the April $10 put -- conveying the right to sell Lehman shares at $10 a piece within the next few weeks -- to $1.65 earlier in the session, said Rebecca Engmann Darst, analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in a note to clients. This despite the fact that the market only assigns about a 3 percent probability of the strike landing in-the-money by that time, Darst said. The April $10 puts, with volume of 28,711 contracts, closed at $1.30 a contract, up 55 cents on the day. BEAR STEARNS Bear Stearns' bonds and credit default swaps, meanwhile, rallied after JPMorgan said it will guarantee the trading obligations of Bear Stearns and its subsidiaries. Bear Stearns' credit default swaps narrowed by 310 basis points to 420 basis points, according to Phoenix Partners. "While a positive sale resolution of Bear Stearns is welcomed, it is still not assured, and has knock-on effects to financials funding levels and access to capacity," CreditSights analysts said in a report. They changed their recommendation on brokers to "marketweight," from "overweight." "Supervisory authorities need to act in (a) more muscular fashion to dampen interlocking effects of liquidity strains," they said. Washington Mutual Inc's ( WM.N ) credit default swap spreads also weakened, widening 4.4 percent to around 694 basis points, or $694,000 per year for five years to insure $10 million in debt, from 665 basis points at Friday's close, according to Markit Intraday. "Washington Mutual has outsized exposure to the mortgage crisis via its on-balance sheet loan portfolios, which is predominantly comprised of first mortgages and home equity loans," CreditSights said. As housing markets continue to worsen, the bank's revenues will be negatively impacted and the company is likely to be unprofitable for 2008 and possibly into 1009, they added.
