 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A U.S. law firm said on Monday it had sued Bear Stearns Co Inc, accusing the troubled investment bank of misleading investors about its financial condition ahead of its stock collapse. 

 The lawsuit was filed in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, law firm Coughlin Stoia Geller Rudman & Robbins LLP said in a statement. A copy of the complaint was not immediately available. The law firm said the suit accuses the investment bank, which is selling itself to JPMorgan Chase & Co for $2 a share, of violations of federal securities laws.
