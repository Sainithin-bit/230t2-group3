 LONDON  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase has bought stricken rival Bear Stearns for a rock-bottom $2 a share, while the U.S. Federal Reserve has expanded lending to securities firms for the first time since the Great Depression. 

 The shock weekend news sent European shares tumbling in Monday's early trade, with investors rattled by fears of contagion. The following are analysts' comments on the moves. SANFORD BERNSTEIN, ANALYST BRAD HINTZ, NEW YORK "Despite Bernstein's price targets, which imply an average of 44 percent upside potential over the next six to twelve months, we would NOT recommend getting into the large capitalization names at this time. "The unfortunate events at Bear Stearns will lead to sharply increasing funding pressure on the other four large capitalization brokers (Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley) in the near term. And although these four companies have strong capital bases and capable corporate treasuries and repo desks, investing in the brokers now is a bet on a recovery of confidence in credit markets that are experiencing the worst turmoil in several decades." MF GLOBAL, ANALYST SIMON MAUGHAN, LONDON "If you get a crisis of confidence in the wholesale banking space and something the size of Bear Stearns could go under, then people start to panic. You get a real fear factor. What happens to the investment banking model? If you lose confidence in that kind of situation, the business model collapses. When you're in the middle of these things it feels like there's an ever looming crisis but we have seen things like this before. In 1998 and 2002/03 it was sharper and more dramatic. What might be different is the speed at which we recover. It may be a lot slower." SANFORD BERNSTEIN, SENIOR ANALYST DIRK HOFFMANN-BECKING,  LONDON "These events are driven as much by psychology as by underlying facts. Hence no assurances can be given that the banks in our coverage are safe from a similar liquidity crunch. However, credit default swap spreads as of close of business on Friday indicate that all three of the European capital markets banks are perceived to have materially less counterparty risk than Bear Stearns had prior to the start of their recent liquidity troubles. All three have direct access to central bank funding and own assets such as their wealth management and retail franchises, which are highly cash generative and could theoretically be sold in times of high stress. Given that one of the major players in this industry, though it was the smallest and most exposed to fixed income earnings, had experienced something not far off a run on the bank, we recommend investors maintain extreme caution on the European capital markets banks. We would expect the stocks to sell off from here, irrespective of longer term outlooks." AMAS BANK, HEAD OF TRADING ION-MARC VALAHU, SWITZERLAND "We are getting close to a bottom because the panic is setting in and banks are starting to go bust. Until this system is cleaned we will not rebound. We had a bubble in the credit markets and it needs to pop. I am seriously looking at JPMorgan, it looks like they got a bargain -- $2 per share, it is less than their real estate holdings. I would not jump in yet, but there are going to be some great opportunities in the weeks to come." PANMURE GORDON, ANALYST SANDY CHEN, LONDON "So, what to do now? Sell your banks. Banks themselves must be tightening their credit and risk models even further, leading to even greater pressure despite any further rate cuts. This means two things - higher funding costs and higher impairment charges, with the added concern that capital cushions could quickly disappear if funding concerns result in massive withdrawals. One thing to watch will be LIBOR, which we expect will rise even further and the 68 bp (basis point) LIBOR-BR (bank rate) gap is wide enough as it is already. We have had the UK banks on underweight, and most of those banks on "sell" since August 2007; if anything, we think the situation has worsened even beyond our bearish expectations." KEEFE, BRUYETTE & WOODS, LONDON "A flood of liquidity-orientated proposals by the Fed/U.S. government in the last seven days, culminating in the rescue of Bear Stearns, are unlikely to mark the end to the turbulence in the financial markets in our view. (While) not wishing to lose sight of long-term fundamentals, we would remain cautious on the European investment banks in the present environment." OPPENHEIMER, ANALYST MEREDITH WHITNEY, NEW YORK "We believe that JPMorgan is acting as the stability agent for the Fed in this transaction and that the concern for the $2.5 trillion in notional counterparty exposure trumps the interest of the existing Bear Stearns shareholder. A company is only as solvent as the perception of its solvency. When a company that is leveraged over 30-to-1 faces crisis of liquidity and confidence of creditworthiness, that company will be unable to leverage collateral and its leverage will be forced down to one-to-one. BSC's equity could become worthless. Forced sales create asset deflation, which could cause cannibalization of remaining capital." LEHMAN BROTHERS, ANALYST JASON GOLDBERG, NEW YORK "We surmise Bears Stearns felt intense pressure to find a buyer quickly amid a crisis of confidence, and JPMorgan was best positioned to act, allowing it to win favorable pricing. We believe the purchase of Bear Stearns is a plus for JPM as it adds prime brokerage capabilities and scale in other areas. Still, what the valuation JPM paid says for the valuation of financial assets in general could be disconcerting to bank stock investors, although we note Bear Stearns was under considerable liquidity strain over the past week."
