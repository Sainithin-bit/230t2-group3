 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares were set for their largest one-day fall in two months by midday on Monday as the distress sale of Bear Stearns triggered fears that the credit crisis may claim more victims among the banks. 

 The euro hit a new high against the dollar and crude continued to surge to new records, compounding the woes of companies in the region, although financial stocks were the largest drag on the broader equity market. At 7:40 a.m. EDT, the FTSEurofirst 300 was down 3.6 percent at 1,209.56, tracking big losses in global equity markets after JP Morgan unveiled a takeover of Bear Stearns at a rock-bottom price. An index of European market volatility shot up by more than 14 percent to a two-month high, reflecting the degree of investor nervousness. "The fears that people have about the position of the financial companies are being realized. That obviously breeds more fear and more instability," said Darren Winder, head of macro and strategy research at Cazenove. "There will be a finale to this, but I think at the moment, people are not confident that that will be any time soon." Banks were biggest losers, with UBS falling nearly 11 percent, while Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays fell around 8 percent. HBOS and Alliance & Leicester slid more than 10 percent. "There's turmoil in all markets after Bear Stearns, and equities is not the place to be," said BNP Paribas strategist Edmund Shing. "Everyone's asking: Who's next? Is there a Bear Stearns in Europe, could investment banks start to fail? "It's clear that Bear was by far the most exposed to mortgage-backed securities relative to their size and were also hit by failure of their internal hedge funds," Shing said, adding there was uncertainty about the extent of European bank losses. Investors were also on edge ahead of earnings reports later in the week from top U.S. investment banks. FED PROPS UP MARKETS In the United States the Fed cut its discount rate on Sunday by a quarter point to 3.25 percent and launched a new facility that would allow U.S. primary dealers, mainly investment banks, to tap the discount window in a tool not used since the Great Depression. Some analysts said the JPMorgan move on Bear Stearns may prove positive in the longer run. "This is not good news for business, or for those who work there, but it must happen as the Fed can't keep propping up banks. There must be blood and this is part of it," said Justin Urquhart Stewart at 7 Investment Management. The Fed holds a rate-setting meeting on Tuesday and futures indicate investors believe the central bank is almost certain to deliver a full percentage-point cut to the federal funds rate. Credit spreads widened in Europe, driving investment grade spreads to record highs on concern that liquidity problems could extend to other banks. "The Fed has to keep on cutting interest rates even if the widening spreads in the credit markets are currently frustrating its efforts to loosen monetary conditions," Brewin Dolphin chief strategist Mike Lenhoff said in a note. Across Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 fell 2.4 percent, Germany's DAX lost 3.2 percent and France's CAC lost 2.4 percent. The DAX's underperformance was driven by a profit warning from engineering heavyweight Siemens, which tumbled 12.5 percent. "With today's bad news -- basically another 1 billion euros in shareholders' equity lost -- we believe sentiment and investor confidence will hardly improve," brokerage Cheuvreux said of Siemens in a note. Rival Alstom slid 7 percent. A few big gainers stuck out in the sea of red. British Energy gained more than 10 percent after saying it was in talks that could lead to a business combination or an offer, while Greek telecoms group OTE jumped 8.4 percent after Deutsche Telekom said it was buying a 20 percent stake in the company.
