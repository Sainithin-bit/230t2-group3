 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's government struggled to resolve a deadlock over a new central bank chief, but chances of a breakthrough before a Wednesday deadline when the current governor retires were dimming even as market turmoil took the dollar to fresh lows and battered Tokyo stocks. 

 Opposition parties, which can veto nominees to succeed Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui, last week rejected the government's first choice to replace him, Toshiro Muto, raising the possibility of a monetary policy vacuum. On Monday evening, the ruling party told the opposition the government would not submit a new candidate that day, an opposition lawmaker said. "This is not something that the government can decide on its own," Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda told reporters. "All we can do is act cautiously ... it's under discussion." He said speed was desirable but that the stance of the main opposition Democratic Party on potential candidates was unclear. The showdown reflects a broader political deadlock that is undermining confidence in Fukuda, who is already suffering public doubts about his leadership that have cut his support rates to around 30 percent, a critical level for political survival. Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference that Wednesday's deadline for a new central bank governor could still be met if the nominee were unveiled on Tuesday, but an opposition lawmaker said time was running out. "It doesn't seem as if they (the government) are trying to take responsibility for avoiding a policy vacuum," said Tatsuo Kawabata, a senior Democratic Party parliament member. The stalemate coincides with a global credit crunch and fears that the U.S. economy is already in recession, concerns that drove the dollar below 96 yen to a 13-year low on Monday, as well as to record lows against the euro. COMPLICATING COORDINATION The Tokyo stock market's benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  slid 3.7 percent or 454.09 points to 11,787.51, its lowest finish since August 2005. Although the Federal Reserve lowered its discount rate to 3.25 percent from 3.5 percent late on Sunday, fears were growing that more financial institutions could become casualties in the widening crisis, after problems at investment bank Bear Stearns led to its sale to JPMorgan Chase.  Analysts said the deadlock over Fukui's successor would not have a big impact on monetary policy, since Japan's interest rates are near rock bottom, but the confusion would complicate efforts to coordinate global monetary policy. "We're in a situation where some kind of joint action by central banks may be needed -- such as a joint intervention in the currency market, perhaps -- but the policy people are busy with this mess," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities. Opposition to Muto, now a deputy governor, to head the central bank centered on the fact that he is a former senior finance ministry bureaucrat, a background that Democrat lawmakers insist would put monetary policy independence at risk. VARIOUS OPTIONS A ruling partly lawmaker told Reuters there was virtually no chance of Muto's name being put forward again. But the Democrats' secretary-general, Yukio Hatoyama, said on Sunday they would not rule out all career MOF officials. Haruhiko Kuroda and Hiroshi Watanabe, both former vice finance ministers for international affairs, could be good candidates, Hatoyama told a TV program. Kuroda, who has headed the Asian Development Bank since 2005, was Japan's top financial diplomat from 1999 to 2003. When prices persistently fell in Japan several years ago, Kuroda repeatedly called on the BOJ to do more to stem deflation. Watanabe retired from the finance ministry last year and is now an adviser at a government-linked think tank. Japanese media said the opposition had rejected on Monday a suggestion to extend Fukui's tenure beyond Wednesday, but Machimura said the reports were wrong, without specifying how. Domestic media also said some LDP members wanted to nominate former Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) Chairman Hiroshi Okuda. One option could be for former BOJ official Masaaki Shirakawa to run the central bank, at least temporarily. Picked by the government to be a deputy governor, he was the only BOJ nominee to win parliamentary approval last week. The Democratic Party and smaller allies control parliament's upper house, which gives them the power to veto government nominees for the BOJ as well as delay laws.
