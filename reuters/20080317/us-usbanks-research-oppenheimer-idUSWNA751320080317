 (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Co Inc's "fire sale" has put banks at risk as it will result in valuation adjustments for all financial firms, and their share prices could fall further by as much as 50 percent, Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney said. 

 "As we believe we will begin to see goodwill writedowns during the first half of this year, we believe investors will focus more on tangible book value and stocks will quickly revalue to far lower levels," Whitney wrote in a note to clients.
