 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's on Monday affirmed JP Morgan Chase & Co's credit ratings after it agreed to buy Bear Stearns, a deal the ratings agency said it saw as positive. 

 S&P affirmed JP Morgan's AA- long-term rating with a stable outlook and said it could change Bear's BBB rating. It said Bear's rating could be changed to be the same as JP Morgan if the acquisition proceeded as planned. "We consider the acquisition of Bear by JPMC as positive, as it will permit Bear to meet its obligations through funding sources obtained directly from its new parent," said credit analyst Diane Hilton. JP Morgan agreed on Sunday to buy stricken rival Bear for just $2 a share -- versus Friday's close of $30.85 -- in an all-stock deal that values the bank at about $236 million. S&P said JP Morgan's post-acquisition capital and leverage metrics would remain satisfactory. It said it expected JP Morgan to assume all of Bear's obligations when the acquisition closes. "JPMC is acquiring some valuable businesses, such as Bear's prime brokerage and clearing operations, which we do not expect will add much risk to its balance sheet," said Tanya Azarchs, another credit analyst at S&P.
