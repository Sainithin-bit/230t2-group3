 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - World number two truck maker Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) said on Monday it had reached a three year agreement with workers at its New River Valley plant in the United States, ending a strike there. 

 Around 2,600 workers at the Mack and Volvo truck plant in Virginia have been on strike since February 1. Volvo said the employees would return to work on March 24 and would begin ramping up production to 146 vehicles per day. The Swedish firm gave no details of the agreement.
