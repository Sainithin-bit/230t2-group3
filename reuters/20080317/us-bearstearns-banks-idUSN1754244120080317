 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bear Stearns Cos Inc's "fire sale" has put bank stocks at risk of falling as much as 50 percent, Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney said. 

 "While we believe Bear Stearns's case is unique, what will not be unique, in our view, is a resulting major negative revaluation of financials," said Whitney in a note to clients on Monday. Similar sentiment was voiced by Lehman Brothers analyst Jason Goldberg. He said the valuation paid by JPMorgan Chase & Co for Bear Stearns "in general could be disconcerting to bank stock investors." JPMorgan on Sunday agreed to buy Bear Stearns, slammed by a sudden cash crunch, for just $2 a share -- more than 90 percent below its Friday close. The deal followed an emergency funding package on Friday for Bear Stearns, the fifth-largest U.S. bank, by the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan after Bear Stearns' liquidity deteriorated significantly. Oppenheimer's Whitney expects financial firms will begin to write down goodwill in the first half of 2008. As a result, investors will likely focus more on tangible book value and "stocks will quickly revalue to far lower levels," Whitney said. She said banks, with the exception of Wachovia Corp, are currently trading well above their price-to-book lows during the credit crunch of the early 1990s and would have to decline on average 54 percent to reach those valuations. JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp, and Citigroup Inc would have to decline 74 percent on average to reach those levels, Whitney said.
