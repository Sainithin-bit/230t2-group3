 LONDON  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase will inherit responsibility for more than 200,000 square feet of empty office space at London's Canary Wharf financial district, if its $236 million takeover of embattled Bear Stearns proceeds. 

 JPMorgan will have to pay up to 8.34 million pounds ($16.44 million) in annual rent on behalf of Bear, which agreed to occupy 206,000 square feet on a 20-year lease in a bespoke building currently being developed by landlord Canary Wharf Group. The 300,000 square foot property at 5 Churchill Place is adjacent to the London headquarters of Barclays and opposite State Street Bank. Construction of the property is due to complete in summer 2009. John Garwood, a spokesman for Canary Wharf Group (CWG), told Reuters the status of the Bear Stearns pre-let was unchanged notwithstanding the JPMorgan bid. "As far as we are concerned, it is just business as usual... Bear Stearns is still on the lease. It's just another company that owns its shares," said Garwood. "Construction of 5 Churchill Place will continue, and we are on schedule to complete next summer," he said. Garwood said Bear Stearns already occupied around 150,000 square feet of space at the 0ne Canada Square skyscraper at the heart of the Canary Wharf estate, which is also home to Citi's European headquarters, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and HSBC. JPMorgan has 12 months to decide whether it will occupy 5 Churchill Place itself, or whether it should hunt for a sub-tenant to share the burden of the 40.50 pounds annual rent per square foot that Bear agreed to pay for the space. "Obviously, CWG will be absolutely delighted JPMorgan are taking Bear over and they are not going bust, otherwise there would be trouble," said one property broker familiar with Canary Wharf lettings market, on condition of anonymity. "But the question is do JPMorgan occupy it for some function themselves or do they look to sublet it? ...I don't expect a resolution on that for months and months," he said. The assumption of Bear Stearns' property rental liabilities at Canary Wharf has cast doubts on whether JPMorgan, which has long since been looking to consolidate its London-based workforce in one building, will rubberstamp plans to move into a new 1 million square foot European headquarters on the site of St Alphage House in London's City financial district.
