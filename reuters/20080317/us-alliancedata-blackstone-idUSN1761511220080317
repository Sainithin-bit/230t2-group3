 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity and real estate firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) said on Monday it had complied with all its obligations under its deal to buy Alliance Data Systems Corp ( ADS.N ), a deal that has stalled amid regulatory issues. 

 ADS said on Monday that Blackstone Group was in breach of contract on its agreement to buy the credit-card transaction company. "Nothing has changed," a Blackstone spokesman said in an e-mailed statement. "Blackstone has fully complied with all of its obligations under the merger agreement. Any claims to the contrary are absurd." (Reporting by  Megan Davies ; Editing by  Gary Hill )
