 (Reuters) - Japan's government struggled to resolve a deadlock over a new central bank chief on Monday, just two days before the current governor retires, but chances of a breakthrough were unclear even as market turmoil took the dollar to fresh lows and battered Tokyo stocks. 

 The term of BOJ Governor Toshihiko Fukui ends on Wednesday, and uncertainty over who will succeed him has prompted talk of a monetary policy vacuum in Japan at a time when central banks worldwide are working together to ease a credit crisis. Parliament's lower house, controlled by the ruling coalition, approved the government's choice for the top job, Deputy BOJ Governor Toshiro Muto, last week along with retired central bank official Masaaki Shirakawa and academic Takatoshi Ito as deputies. But coming after the upper house's rejection of Muto and Ito, the vote simply confirmed a political impasse over the central bank's leadership. Of the three nominees, only Shirakawa has won approval from both houses of parliament, to be a deputy governor. Following are recent comments by Japanese policymakers on the selection of the next governor: YASUO FUKUDA, PRIME MINISTER, March 17, speaking to reporters. "This is not something the government can decide on its own after the upper house vetoed the candidates. All we can do is act cautiously. "It is unclear what opposition parties, especially the (main opposition) Democratic Party, are thinking. So it's under discussion. "It is a general rule that we don't comment on specific names for personnel issues until they are decided. "We are in a difficult situation. It is not good that it is taking a long time, but the parliamentary situation is affecting the personnel issues. "I do not want to create a policy vacuum." Asked if he would submit candidates on Tuesday: "I think it is better to submit them as soon as possible." YUKIO HATOYAMA, DEMOCRATIC PARTY SECRETARY-GENERAL, March 17, to reporters: "In effect, it is impossible to make it in time (to select new BOJ leadership before the current governor's term expires). People will start to wonder what the government is doing." NOBUTAKA MACHIMURA, CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY, March 17, at a news conference: "We are making utmost efforts so as not to create a policy vacuum." Asked the deadline for presenting the government's nominee for BOJ governor to parliament: "In common sense terms, the deadline has passed but at the final stage we want to seek parliament's cooperation and clear the deadline. "We are always ready to hold a meeting" of LDP and Democratic Party heads on the BOJ nominee issue. Asked if the deadline could still be met if the government puts forward its BOJ nominees on Tuesday instead of on Monday: "I haven't sorted out issues with such a detailed timeframe in mind. But I think we can make it on time (even if the proposal was made on Tuesday)." BUNMEI IBUKI, RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S SECRETARY-GENERAL, March 17, news conference: "The nomination must be made on Tuesday if we are to make it in time." HIROKO OTA, ECONOMICS MINISTER, March 17, to reporters: Asked about the impact of a policy vacuum on markets: "It is incomprehensible to leave the position of BOJ governor vacant in this difficult (market) environment, so I would like them to make a decision. "The central bank governor is very important not only for Japan but for the world, so I would like them to select an excellent governor as soon as possible." Asked if she sees a need for a BOJ rate cut: "I decline to comment as it is up to the BOJ to decide monetary policy. Anyway, it is important not to leave the position of BOJ governor vacant." SADAKAZU TANIGAKI, LDP POLICY CHIEF, March 17, news conference: "Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda told a meeting of ruling party and government officials (held Monday noon) that he is making final adjustments to propose a government nominee (for BOJ governor) today. "The government has the responsibility to appoint the BOJ governor. But what happens if no decision can be made? ... I strongly feel that some kind of legislative measures need to be made (to prevent a policy vacuum at the BOJ)." HATOYAMA, DEMOCRATIC PARTY SECRETARY-GENERAL, March 16 TV program: Asked whether his party would approve if Haruhiko Kuroda and Hiroshi Watanabe, both former vice finance ministers for international affairs, were nominated: "Vice finance ministers for international affairs have views that are more global, it is certain that they are well-versed in international financial matters. "We are not saying that we will not approve any finance ministry official. It is undesirable to name someone who is extremely close to the finance ministry because it hampers the BOJ's independence." KAORU YOSANO, A SENIOR LDP MEMBER, March 16 TV program: "I think it would be a rude political move to put forward a proposal that has been recently rejected by the upper house. "They should again listen to opinions of opposition lawmakers who now control the upper house, including what parties said about reasons behind rejecting (Muto). Otherwise, Japan would be seen in the international community as a country that cannot decide anything and that would not be good." FUKUDA, March 14, to reporters: "I feel responsible for the current situation over the BOJ leadership at a time when there are a lot of changes and worries about the global economy and markets. "But given the situation, we need to decide on a central bank governor as soon as possible. "We are talking about the BOJ governor and deputy governors, so we need to decide cautiously and quickly." AKIHIRO OTA, HEAD OF JUNIOR RULING COALITION PARTNER NEW KOMEITO, March 14 news conference: "Ultimately, it is the government's decision and we think Muto is fine. But the rejection by the upper house should be taken very seriously." (Reporting by Tokyo Policy Desk)
