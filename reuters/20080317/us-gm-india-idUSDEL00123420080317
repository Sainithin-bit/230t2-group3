 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) wants to launch a second small car in India in the next two years, a senior company official said on Monday. 

 The car will not compete directly with Tata Motors' ( TAMO.BO ) Nano but will be cheaper than GM's current lowest priced car in India, David Reilly, GM group vice-president, told a news conference. (Reporting by  Devidutta Tripathy , Editing by Mark Williams)
