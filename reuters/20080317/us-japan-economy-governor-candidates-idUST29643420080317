 (Reuters) - The Japanese government is set to put forward a new nominee to head the Bank of Japan after its first choice, Toshiro Muto, was vetoed by parliament's upper house. Present governor Toshihiko Fukui retires on Wednesday. Here are some potential candidates to succeed Fukui: YUTAKA YAMAGUCHI (67) Deputy governor from 1998 to 2003, Yamaguchi was a career central banker and a former head of the central bank's Monetary Affairs department. Though an expert on economic theory, he is seen as being poor at communicating on policy issues and lacking political savvy. (For a separate profile story, click HARUHIKO KURODA (63) Oxford-educated Kuroda, president of the Asian Development Bank since 2005, is a former career bureaucrat at Japan's Finance Ministry. As vice finance minister for international affairs, he was Japan's top financial diplomat, in charge of currency policy from 1999 to 2003. When prices persistently fell in Japan several years ago, Kuroda repeatedly called on the BOJ to do more to stem deflation. After retiring from the ministry and before joining the ADB, Kuroda served as a special adviser to the cabinet of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi on international monetary issues. He also taught at the graduate school of economics at Hitotsubashi University in Tokyo. Soft-spoken and scholarly, Kuroda has been an advocate of Asian regional cooperation, calling for the creation of a common Asian currency in the long run. HIROSHI WATANABE (58) A former currency policy tsar at the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and well-versed in international negotiations, Watanabe currently works at a government-linked think tank, the Japan Center for International Finance, as a special adviser. Before retiring from the ministry, Watanabe served as vice finance minister for international affairs from 2004 to 2007, during which he said he believed in letting markets determine currency rates. Unlike his predecessors he never intervened in the currency market, partly thanks to relatively stable yen movements at that time. While at the MOF, Watanabe usually avoided commenting on what the BOJ should do and stuck to the stance that monetary policy was the BOJ's prerogative. After serving in the ministry as a tax expert, Watanabe was an assistant to then Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. He has recently advised Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda on international monetary and finance issues. Independent, confident and a fluent English speaker, Watanabe has spent several months speaking at seminars in Japan and abroad, including one at Stanford University a month ago. A fan of mystery stories, he has written a book using mysteries from around the world as a way to examine different cultures. MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA (58) Shikawa was alone among the three government nominees for the central bank to avoid a veto from the opposition bloc controlling the upper house. He was appointed a deputy governor by parliament. Currently a professor at Kyoto University School of Government, Shirakawa worked at the Bank of Japan for 34 years, serving in various sections covering monetary matters, international affairs and financial markets. He briefly worked at the BOJ office in New York. His personal views on monetary policy are not widely known in the market, but he represented the mainstream view of the BOJ while serving at the central bank. Shirakawa said last week he had no particular position now on interest rates. He played a pivotal role in the bank's exit in 2006 from its super-easy policy of flooding the banking system with excess cash and pinning money market rates near zero in an attempt to bolster economic activity and beat deflation.
