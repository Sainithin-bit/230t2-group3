 BERLIN/MUNICH, March 17 - Project delays and cancelled orders forced German engineering group Siemens ( SIEGn.DE ) to issue a profit warning on Monday, sending its shares down as much as 19 percent and shaking investor faith in its turnaround. 

 The stock took its biggest one-day percentage fall since it entered the German blue-chip index in April 1991. "This signifies something of a loss of trust, even if part of the decline can be attributed to current market conditions," said Merck Finck analyst Theo Kitz. "Nevertheless, it will be a difficult time for management for a while," he added. Chief Executive Peter Loescher, the first outsider and non-German to head Siemens, was appointed last May to slim down and reshape the unwieldy company. Since his appointment Siemens' market value has shrunk by around 37 billion euros. Loescher and finance chief Joe Kaeser on Monday purchased Siemens shares for 3.3 million euros and 197,880 euros respectively. Loescher and Kaeser had confirmed company targets in January as the trains-to-lightbulbs conglomerate denied market talk then that it could cut its earnings outlook. The Munich-based company said at the time it expected sales this fiscal year to increase at twice the rate of global gross domestic product growth, while operating profit should grow at least twice as fast as sales. Now it expects a negative impact on earnings of around 900 million euros ($1.2 billion) in the current quarter. Analysts fear they may be more to come despite assurances from Siemens that this amount represented the largest piece of any additional financial burdens for 2008. The news comes as Siemens struggles to put an end to a corruption and bribery scandal that rocked the company. In the United States, Siemens is being investigated for suspected payments to parties described as business consultants and may face fines or be blacklisted from public contracts. Siemens closed down 17.1 percent at 66.42 euros, the biggest decliner in the German blue-chip index, which fell 4.2 percent. "Just the other day Siemens went and told us about their wonderful profit. How do I know if they truly expect to make a profit," said Dirk Mueller, trader at German brokerage ICF. MORE TO COME? A review of three core businesses triggered the warning. Wolfgang Dehen, head of Siemens' newly created energy division, said the company had bitten off more than it could chew at its power plant division. Problems in managing a large number of turnkey projects accumulated since 2004, structural challenges in the supplier markets and delays recruiting experienced project engineers had hit profits. In its transportation business, Siemens cited delays in the awarding of major projects as well as repairing defective trams at its Combino business. At Siemens IT Solutions and Services, the British government had cancelled an 85 million euro contract because Siemens could not maintain the promised timetable. On a conference call Loescher, who has vowed to close the performance gap between Siemens and rivals such as General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and Philips Electronics Group ( PHG.AS ), said: "We are dealing with remnants of the past." Loescher declined to give new targets for the fiscal year which ends September 30, saying he would present an outlook when the company reports second-quarter figures at the end of April. Kaeser added the worst of the company's efforts to straighten out its businesses were over but he did not rule out further impact in coming quarters. Kaeser said Siemens had charges of around 600 million euros at its power plant unit, some 200 million euros at its train unit and another 100 million at its IT division SIS. The company confirmed its mid-term targets but analysts were skeptical. "Our analysis of the situation concludes that Siemens is suffering from a deep-seated problem in its approach to contract tendering and execution," Bear Stearns said in a note.
