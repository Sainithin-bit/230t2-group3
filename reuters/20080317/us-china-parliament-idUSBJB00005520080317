 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Central bank governor Zhou Xiaochuan was reappointed on Monday as China's central bank governor. 

 The National People's Congress, the largely ceremonial parliament, approved Zhou's nomination with 2,756 votes in favor, 156 against and 30 abstentions. The Congress also rubber-stamped Zhang Ping as head of the National Development and Reform Commission, the main economic planning agency. Zhang replaces Ma Kai, who was named as one of five state councilors as well as secretary-general of the State Council, China's cabinet. Congress named four vice-premiers, cementing top leadership positions for the next five years. The four are Li Keqiang, Hui Liangyu, Zhang Dejiang and Wang Qishan. Vice-premiers outrank state councilors, who in turn outrank cabinet ministers, in the Chinese government hierarchy. Among others confirmed in their jobs were Commerce Minister Chen Deming, Finance Minister Xie Xuren, Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and Agriculture Minister Sun Zhengcai. Zhou Shengxian becomes environment minister after his agency, the State Environmental Protection Administration, was upgraded to ministerial status in a government reshuffle last week.
