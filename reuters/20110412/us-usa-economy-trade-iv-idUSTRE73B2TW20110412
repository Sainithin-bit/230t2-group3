 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit shrank in February as both imports and exports fell, according to a government report on Tuesday that suggested a slowdown in global demand. 

 KEY POINTS: * The monthly trade gap totaled $45.8 billion, down from an upwardly revised estimate of $47.0 billion in January. * Analysts surveyed before the report had expected the deficit to narrow to $44.5 billion, from the previously reported January tally of $46.3 billion. * U.S. March import prices rise 2.7 percent. COMMENTS: WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL, NEW YORK "Price indexes were higher than expected, which isn't wonderful. We don't love that. No doubt we're seeing inflationary pressures build. We've seen commodities go up and there's no doubt that all these cost inputs are going up. It's obviously showing up here in this index. We don't love that. "There's been an undercurrent of selling in the (stock) market this last week. The tone appears to be becoming more negative. Risk levels appear to be rising. The next few days are going to be important; if we don't get a bounce from these oversold levels, that's a negative. It is possible we may be nearing an intermediate-term top. The tone has not been good." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, IFR, THOMSON REUTERS "February's trade deficit of $45.8 bln is narrower than January's, which was revised up to a $47.0 bln deficit from $46.3 bln, but remains significantly higher than the Q4 2010 average of $38.9 bln. "February's deficit exceeds a consensus of $44.5 bln, meaning we have seen only a modest correction from a sharp increase in January's deficit, which was revised even higher. This suggests net exports will be a significant negative in Q1 GDP, which may struggle to achieve growth much above 2.0 percent. Looking deeper in the details, the picture of this monthly report remains one of disappointment. "The breakdown, showing both exports and imports slipping back after strong January gains, does not augur well for economic activity." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures hold steady at lower levels. BONDS: U.S. bond prices hold steady at higher levels. FOREX: The dollar extends losses versus euro, hits weakest level in 15 months.
