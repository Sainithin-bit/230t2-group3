 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Allied Irish Banks (AIB) would consider debt forgiveness for some mortgage holders in danger of default as part of efforts to deal with the aftermath of Ireland's property binge, its chairman said. 

 AIB unveiled a jaw-dropping 10.4 billion euros annual net loss on Tuesday after it hiked provisions for potential losses on loans written during the go-go years of the Celtic Tiger economy. David Hodgkinson said government plans for AIB, already effectively nationalized, to raise its capital cushion by a further 13.3 billion euros gave it the firepower to consider solutions for some stretched borrowers. "We are working on initiatives that go beyond just deferring problems," AIB's executive chairman told a news conference. "The increased capital we are receiving provides the means for us to seek better solutions." Asked if the solution might include debt forgiveness, Hodgkinson said: "It's one of the options." One in ten Irish mortgages were either in arrears or restructured at the end of 2010 and more customers are set to fall into difficulty after the ECB raised its base rate earlier this month. The level of arrears in AIB's owner occupier book in its home market nearly doubled to 2.87 percent at the end of 2010 from 1.51 percent a year ago. Arrears in the riskier buy-to-let portfolio jumped to 9.6 percent from 3.22 percent. At the end of last year, AIB had repossessed eight properties, all on a voluntary basis. "I have never worked with quite as many problems as AIB had, particularly in the property sense," Hodgkinson said. (Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
