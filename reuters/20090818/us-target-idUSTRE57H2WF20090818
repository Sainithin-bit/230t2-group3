 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Target Corp ( TGT.N ) reported its eighth consecutive drop in quarterly profit, but the results were better than Wall Street had expected as the No 2 U.S. discount retailer cut costs and stocked less merchandise. 

 Target said profit was $594 million, or 79 cents per share, for its second quarter ended August 1, compared with $634 million, or 82 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had been expecting it to earn 66 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 2.7 percent to $14.6 billion, while sales at stores open at least a year, a key retail gauge known as same-store sales, fell 6.2 percent. Shares rose to $43.60 in premarket trading on Tuesday after closing at $41.38 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
