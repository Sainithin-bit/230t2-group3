 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Target Corp ( TGT.N ), Saks Inc SKS.N and Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) impressed Wall Street with better-than-expected quarterly results on Tuesday as the retailers clamped down on expenses and inventory to offset falling sales, sending shares higher. 

 While Wall Street likes cost cuts, analysts said retailers must show that they can coax shoppers back into their stores and start showing sales growth in the next few months. "At some point, they have to show them the money," said Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics Inc. Target's and Saks' sales have faltered during the recession as people avoided splurging, not just on the full-priced designer shoes and clothing at Saks, but also on discount designer goods sold at Target. Shoppers are instead bargain-hunting in the aisles of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. TJX Cos Inc ( TJX.N ), which runs the off-price clothing chains, reported a 4 percent rise in sales in the quarter and profit jumped 31 percent, beating Street expectations. Its full-year profit outlook could miss Wall Street's expectations, however. Home Depot shares rose 2.8 percent after the home-improvement retailer reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as cost cuts partly offset weak sales. COST CUTS, INVENTORY CONTROL At Target and Saks, cost cuts and a tight control on inventory helped to bolster the quarter, a trend seen last week when retailers including Macy's Inc ( M.N ) and Nordstrom Inc ( JWN.N ) reported results. "We're getting a sense here that the environment has really stabilized, and there's a great deal of power to these business models when they're able to control costs," said Sarah Henry, retail analyst at MFC Global Investment Management. Target has cut jobs and pulled back on store openings, while Saks is targeting a 20 percent cut in inventory. Saks' net loss widened to $54.5 million in the quarter, but excluding items, it beat analysts' forecasts. Saks, which sells designer brands such as Versace and Oscar de la Renta, said same-store sales fell 15.5 percent. It expects the decline to continue for the rest of the year. "We are not expecting to see a rapid turnaround in the consumer," Chief Executive Stephen Sadove said. Target's sales also fell, but its profit beat forecasts. To get shoppers to its stores more frequently, Target is launching a marketing campaign to highlight its pharmacy services. It also is rolling out "P-fresh" -- stores with an expanded selection of grocery items, like fresh produce, and it will introduce a line of Anna Sui clothing in September. Target's strong results were driven by improved gross margins and better-than-expected performance in its credit card division, said William Blair & Co analyst Mark Miller. "While consumer spending in discretionary categories remains weak -- and (same) store sales have lagged expectations -- we believe Target continues to manage the business admirably," he wrote in a research note. Earlier this year, Target fended off a proxy contest launched by William Ackman, whose Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund had amassed a 7.8 percent stake in the retailer. Since losing the proxy contest, Pershing Square has altered its Target holdings, and now owns a 4.4 percent stake in Minneapolis-based Target. Saks shares rose 8.4 percent to $5.80, and Target shares were up 7.57 percent to $44.33. Home Depot shares rose 2.83 percent to $26.85, and TJX shares fell 3.31 percent to $34.21.
