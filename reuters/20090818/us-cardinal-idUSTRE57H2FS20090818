 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Drug wholesaler Cardinal Health Inc ( CAH.N ) posted stronger-than-expected quarterly revenue on Tuesday and raised its profit forecast for the next fiscal year, sending its shares up nearly 3 percent. 

 Cardinal also projected fiscal-year earnings for its soon-to-be-spun-off CareFusion medical technology company that encouraged analysts. "We view the guidance positively and expect it to come as a relief to investors, particularly on the CareFusion side where results have been weighed down by slower capital spending at hospitals," JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill said in a research note. Net earnings fell 14 percent to $273.2 million, or 75 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended on June 30 from $318 million, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Results included 12 cents per share of special items and other costs, mostly tied to the planned spin-off of CareFusion. Cardinal said the spin-off remained on track for completion at the end of the month. Excluding special items, earnings were in line with analysts' forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 10 percent to $25.2 billion, ahead of the $24.4 billion expected by analysts. Revenue in the company's main healthcare supply chain business rose 11 percent to $24.3 billion. On top of the stronger-than-expected revenue, profit margins for the standalone Cardinal business were better than expected, Sanford Bernstein analyst Helene Wolk said in a research note. Cardinal has also benefited from renewing a key contract with drugstore chain CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) without significantly sacrificing profit margins, said William Blair & Co analyst John Kreger. "It seems like some of the risk factors for drug distribution have been alleviated," Kreger said. Cardinal projected fiscal 2010 profit of $1.90 to $2.00 per share, excluding items, for its standalone business. It said that outlook was an increase over its previous forecast of $1.87 to $1.91, implied in comments from its June investor day. For CareFusion, the company forecast fiscal 2010 earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share, excluding items. "The outlook is a little bit better than they were talking about for both halves of the business," said Gabelli & Co analyst Jeff Jonas, who also cited the company's quarterly revenue as a positive factor. "CareFusion is sort of the more exciting growth part of the business," Jonas said, "although it had been a little depressed recently by" pressures on capital expenditures by hospitals. Cardinal shares rose 2.7 percent to $34.27 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Maureen Bavdek, Gerald E. McCormick and Lisa Von Ahn)
