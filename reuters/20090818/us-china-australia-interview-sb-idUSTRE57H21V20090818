 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Australia's Minister for Resources and Energy Martin Ferguson said a huge natural gas deal signed with China on Tuesday showed the potential of the two nation's resource ties despite recent ructions over the arrest of an Australian employee of Rio Tinto. 

 Speaking to Reuters in Beijing before the signing of the A$50 billion ($41.3 billion) contract for gas from Australia's Gorgon LNG project, Ferguson said the two countries needed each other to prosper, and he saw opportunities for more Australian resource exports to fast-growing China, including uranium. "It's a statement about the nature of our two economies and the fact that Australia is important to China, just like China is important to Australia," Ferguson said of the contract. "Australia is a resource- and energy-rich nation, and we have a capacity, if we develop our resources, to meet the economic needs of China." (Reporting by Chris Buckley, Editing by Jacqueline Wong)
