 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investors often scrutinize insider stock sales for what they suggest about a company's prospects. Now researchers say there's evidence that corporations could be in for trouble when top executives cash out quickly. 

 Gradient Analytics, an independent research firm that looks closely at executive compensation, says it has come up with a model that pinpoints instances in which corporate insiders exercise large caches of options "abnormally early." The findings are significant for investors because they show a strong link between early exercise decisions and a subsequent deterioration of the company's profits and share price, according to Gradient founder Carr Bettis, who has previously taught finance at Arizona State University. The research is based on a working paper Bettis wrote with two other academic experts examining more than 60,000 option exercises by corporate chief executives, chairmen, presidents and chief operating officers at 3,437 companies from 1996 to 2004. The study says executives appear to use private information of future earnings underperformance to time option exercises. It found that the negative performance typically showed up six months after the early option exercise. Using the ideas behind that study, Scottsdale, Arizona-based Gradient has raised questions in reports to clients about past option exercise activity at companies such as software distributor Red Hat Inc. ( RHT.N ) and retailer Jos A. Bank Clothiers Inc. ( JOSB.O ) Both of those reports went out last year, and shares of both companies fell in the months afterward. Gradient declined to provide any stock research reports on other companies from this year, saying they are still being digested by its roster of clients, including hedge funds and other investors. However, "we have had a rash of what we think are compelling signals" of early exercise transactions over the last two months, Bettis said. He said the phenomenon has been most noticeable in the technology sector, which has traditionally doled out copious options to employees. HARDER LINE The research comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors are taking a hard look at corporate America's options practices, especially awards that might have been backdated to give executives the chance to earn extra profit. There are also continuing questions about the overall trading practices of corporate insiders. In a recent study, Stanford University assistant professor Alan Jagolinzer examined prearranged trading schedules, known as 10b5-1 plans, designed to allow insiders to trade when they do not possess material, nonpublic information. Jagolinzer's study found trades in the plans, set up by an SEC rule in 2000, outperformed the broader market. Although insiders are supposed to plan trades when not privately informed, the study found the rule appeared to enable strategic trade. Gradient's research on exercise decisions is based on mathematical forecasts looking at when insiders might normally want to unload some options, factoring in sales to diversify a portfolio or because of a run-up in the share price. The model focuses on "deep in the money" options, in which the current value of the company's shares is well above the option's exercise price. These are particularly valuable options, and earlier-than-projected exercises can raise red flags that bad news at the company might be about to hit, Bettis said. When options are exercised, the underlying shares are almost always immediately sold. "What we found was that not only do these early, deep-in-the-money exercises result in share price declines over the period that follows, but they also are associated with earnings misses and future misses," Bettis said. At Red Hat, for example, Gradient issued a February 10 report saying the volume of exercise activity at the time was the largest in the company's history and the principal concern was share-price risk in coming quarters. When the report was released, Red Hat shares traded at nearly $27, but fell below $23 six months later. They closed at $22.25 on Thursday. At Jos A. Bank, Gradient reported on March 13 that a resurgence of early exercise of deep-in-the-money options might indicate heightened risk of underperformance. At the time, shares traded at about $44. They were down to about $28 six months later and closed on Thursday at $30.37. Neither Red Hat nor Jos A. Bank immediately responded to requests for comment. The theory doesn't always bear out. In one case, Gradient suggested to clients in January 2006 that what it called abnormal exercise activity at Smith International Inc. SII.N could be a bad omen for the stock. Shares have seesawed since the report, which came out when the stock traded around $40. It climbed to nearly $43 six months later, dipped below $35 in September, and closed on Thursday at $39.26, about flat with a year ago. "We looked at it as a case that didn't work out as expected," Bettis said. A Smith International representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gradient says insider selling is one of more than a dozen factors its analysts sift through when assessing a stock -- and that it shouldn't be looked at in a vacuum. Other experts also suggest viewing insider sales in a broader context. "It's valuable information," said Nejat Seyhun, a University of Michigan finance professor who studies insider transactions. But "I wouldn't base my entire trading strategy on whether insiders bought or sold."
