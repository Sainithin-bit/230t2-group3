 DAVOS  (Reuters) - World Trade Organization (WTO) chief Pascal Lamy said on Saturday that a group of key trade ministers had backed his call to resume stalled global trade talks, although no timetable was set. 

 Some 30 ministers meeting in this Alpine resort had agreed to get "back to full-negotiating mode in Geneva," he said, referring to the WTO's headquarters.
