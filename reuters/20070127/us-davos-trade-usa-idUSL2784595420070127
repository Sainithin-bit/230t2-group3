 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - The United States welcomed a decision to resume world trade talks on Saturday but stressed it was not prepared to make a unilateral move on farm subsidies to kickstart the negotiations. 

 "I emerge from these meetings with a real sense of optimism but also a sense of realism about all the work ahead of us," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab told reporters. "Wishing a successful outcome for the Doha Round, we have learned, does not make it so. Pointing fingers does not make it so. Having one country go first does not result in a successful outcome," she said. Earlier on Saturday, some 30 trade ministers agreed the moment had come to get back to full negotiations over the World Trade Organization's Doha Round of talks to bring down barriers to trade. They had been suspended since July. Pressure has grown on Washington to go further with its offer to cut farm subsidies. Brazil's foreign minister said the United States, as well as the European Union, had given "big signals" in the area of farm reform. Schwab said all countries seemed ready to go further with concessions. "We feel as if we are being joined by other trading partners who, like us, recognize that we are all going to have to stretch beyond our nominal mandates to come up with a broad-based agreement" to boost trade and ease poverty, she said. Schwab also said the focus of the talks now on specific agricultural products, as opposed to top-line numbers on which countries have disagreed, gave negotiators a chance to ensure real new market opportunities.
