 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wireless chip maker Broadcom Corp. ( BRCM.O ) said on Friday a federal jury in San Diego found that the company had not infringed on two patents for digital video compression owned by rival Qualcomm Inc. ( QCOM.O ) 

 The nine-member U.S. District Court jury reached a unanimous verdict after six hours of deliberation, rejecting Qualcomm's claims of infringement following a nine-day trial, Broadcom said in a statement. "This is a victory not just for Broadcom but for the entire digital video community against an attempt by Qualcomm once again to tax an important new technology," said David Dull, Broadcom's general counsel, in the statement. The jury's decision marks Broadcom's second win against Qualcomm involving intellectual property issues. Last fall, a U.S. International Trade Commission judge ruled that Qualcomm's cellular baseband chips infringed claims of a Broadcom patent. Qualcomm and Broadcom have other patent disputes pending in U.S. District Court in San Diego, Broadcom said.
