 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - A market for carbon trading, seen as a way to combat global warming, must cover the whole world to ensure firms can shop around for the best price, business leaders said on Saturday. 

 The European Union bloc of nations operates a trading scheme which imposes a ceiling on heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions and uses a market to allow countries or companies to buy and sell rights to emit greenhouse gasses. "Expanding the greenhouse gas market into a global market will ensure that climate change is being addressed effectively ... as well as produce a more liquid and competitive market with one global price for carbon," Daniel Gagnier, Senior VP for Corporate and External Affairs at aluminum producer Alcan, which campaigns for a global carbon market. He was speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos where climate change has been high on the agenda. In the United States, where the Bush administration initially dismissed the issue, some companies are now urging mandatory curbs on greenhouse gas emissions. But many developing countries are still reluctant to discuss sustainable development and emissions trading as they say forcing companies to curb emissions at this stage could hamper their economic development. "What is so good about having a global price on emissions is that it will give market actors correct signals on where to invest," Andrei Marcu, President and CEO of the International Emission Trading Association, Switzerland said. VOLATILE MARKET? Critics have said the market turned out to be too volatile, pointing to an April crash which wiped nearly 40 percent off the value of Europe's greenhouse gas trading scheme. But Marcu said the market was functioning well but needed greater liquidity to reduce volatlity. "What happened in last year is actually a signal that the market works. The market came out to be long and priced dropped. The market did react correctly to the kind of signals it was getting," he said. Lars Josefsson, President and CEO of Europe's largest heat generator Vattenfall said a functional emissions trading market would not have to encompass 100 percent of the world, but would have to be big enough to be credible. "The market has developed quite a lot and we should all expand that market," said Josefsson. "Long term India and China will also have to cap their emission. I predict that time is sooner than later."
