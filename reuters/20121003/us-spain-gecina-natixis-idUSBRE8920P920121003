 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Natixis ( CNAT.PA ) confirmed it had a 266 million-euro ($344.07 million) loan exposure to two Spanish investment firms that own 31 percent of French property company Gecina ( GFCP.PA ) but said any losses from the firms' bankruptcy would be minimal. 
 "This doesn't present any risk to Natixis, it's a deal that's mostly hedged," a Natixis spokeswoman said on Wednesday. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb ; Editing by  James Regan )
