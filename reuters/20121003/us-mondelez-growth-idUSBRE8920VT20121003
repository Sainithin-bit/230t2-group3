 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mondelez International Inc ( MDLZ.O ) Chief Executive Irene Rosenfeld is happy with her new company's current portfolio, but told Reuters on Wednesday that there could be opportunities to add to it. 
 Speaking in New York on the company's second day of trading as a stand-alone snacks company, Rosenfeld said most of the company's growth moving forward will therefore be organic. (Reporting By  Martinne Geller  in New York; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
