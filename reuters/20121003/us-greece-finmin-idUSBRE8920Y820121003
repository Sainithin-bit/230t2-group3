 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's talks with international lenders to reach an agreement on an 11.5 billion euro austerity package are progressing well, the country's finance minister said on Wednesday. 
 "Discussions with the troika (EU/ECB/IMF) are on a good track," Yannis Stournaras told reporters after meeting with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. "There is still a large gap, we are trying to reach a compromise to seal a deal." (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas)
