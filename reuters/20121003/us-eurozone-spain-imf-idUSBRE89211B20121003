 PARIS  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund stands ready to help Spain in multiple ways if Madrid seeks its aid, IMF chief Christine Lagarde said in a newspaper interview published on Wednesday. 
 "If Spain wants it, we could help in diverse ways, for example by simply auditing and monitoring reforms negotiated with its European partners without the IMF participating in financing," Lagarde told French daily Le Figaro. "But we could also play a role in financing," she added. (Reporting by  Leigh Thomas ; editing by  Daniel Flynn )
