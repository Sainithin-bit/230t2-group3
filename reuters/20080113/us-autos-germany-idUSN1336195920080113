 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German carmakers expect to soon sell 1 million vehicles in the United States after boosting sales 3 percent last year to 948,000 cars and light trucks, the country's industry association VDA said on Sunday. 

 "We are confident that we can further increase our share of the U.S. market in the current year and see a good chance of breaking the 1 million mark in the near future," VDA President Matthias Wissmann said in a statement, adding that its U.S. growth strategy was partly based on future demand for diesels. He forecast U.S. light vehicle sales to decline a good 2 percent to roughly 15.7 million vehicles in 2008. Last year, sales of cars with German brands like Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), Audi ( NSUG.DE ), Daimler ( DAIGn.DE ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) rose 1 percent to 768,000 units. Best sellers such as the BMW 3 Series, the VW Jetta and the Mercedes C-Class helped German brands acquire a share of more than 10 percent of the U.S. passenger car market. Sales of light trucks such as the Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) Cayenne off-roader, Mercedes M-Class BMW X5 and Audi Q7 increased by comparison 14 percent to 180,000 units. "We grew in this segment faster than any other competitor," Wissmann said, referring to the brisk demand in the United States for German sport utility vehicles. In total, exports of German cars and light trucks to the United States grew 3 percent last year to 570,000 vehicles -- roughly 13 percent of all German autos exported worldwide -- despite the ongoing strength of the euro. Automotive products worth more than 23 billion euros were exported into the United States, or expressed differently one out of every eight euros generated from Germany's automotive export business, according to the VDA. Roughly a third of Germany's entire exports to the U.S. last year valued at 74 billion euros were therefore automobiles as well as automotive components. "One out of every 12 jobs, in our industry is now dependent on the U.S. market. That's about 60,000 employees," Wissmann said. Alone, car parts exports totaled more than 3 billion euros in value, the VDA said. By comparison, some 250,000 German branded vehicles sold in the United States are produced in the NAFTA region.
