 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Slowing U.S. economic growth should have no impact on Ford Motor Co's ( F.N ) restructuring plans and its goal of a return to profitability in North America in 2009, the company's top executive said on Sunday. 

 "(We have) no change in (our) plan at this point," Chief Executive Alan Mulally said on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, responding to questions from reporters about how rising signs of strain on U.S. consumer spending and debt would affect Ford's plan. Mulally also said the company has no plans at this point to forge an alliance with another automaker and has not held any discussions with any other car makers so far along those lines. Ford, which lost $12.6 billion in 2006, is in the midst of a multi-year restructuring that aims to return its money-losing North American operations to profitability in 2009.
