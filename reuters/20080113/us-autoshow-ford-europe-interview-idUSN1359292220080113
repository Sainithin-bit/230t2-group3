 DETROIT  (Reuters) - For Lewis Booth, the decision by Ford ( F.N ) to sell the Jaguar and Land Rover brands was not just a business decision. 

 The Liverpool-born chairman of Ford of Europe, the son of a car dealer, is emotionally very attached to the British car industry and does not hide his passion for cars. But he said in an interview on Sunday that the likely sale of the two brands to Tata ( TAMO.BO )( TTM.N ) of India was in the best interest of the brands and their employees. Ford said on January 3 that Tata was the front-runner to buy the two storied British brands, with final negotiations still taking place. Ford, which lost $12.6 billion in 2006, is in the midst of a multi-year restructuring. "All business decisions are tough decisions. I think I felt we were doing the right thing. We put our heart and soul into developing new products for Jaguar and Land Rover and I feel very confident that we have good plans for both brands," Booth told Reuters at the Detroit Auto Show. "The Land Rover Jaguar decision is more about Ford than about Jaguar and Land Rover," Booth said. "I found it very important that having found a plan for them, that they could realize that plan in the future. We can't guarantee it at Ford because of our other financial pressures." Booth, who was also chairman of the Premier Automotive Group that included Jaguar and Land Rover, will remain head of Ford's remaining European brand, Volvo, after the sale. "Volvo has some issues. They have been very badly hurt by the strong euro, strong crown, weak dollar, weak yen. Very badly hurt. And higher commodity prices. So we have work to do make a better plan for Volvo," he said. He said Volvo needs cars that combine Scandinavian values for safety and environmental friendliness with Swedish design. Ford of Europe is mainly made up of the sales organization for Europe and manufacturing sites in Britain, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Turkey, Russia and, soon, Romania. Booth said Ford of Europe was having some success but is not making much money yet. For Booth, the problem of the European car markets was that it remained very fragmented due to different taxes and incentives in various countries that influence the buying behavior of customers differently and makes it harder to obtain efficiencies of scale. But the currency was a big headache. "At the moment there is the double disadvantage of a high domestic currency which makes it hard to export and easy to import," Booth said. "We are absolutely at the mercy of the Japanese and the South Koreans at the moment...we have to be very careful about the risk to the business in Europe because of the currency," he said.
