 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co.'s ( F.N ) Land Rover luxury unit "is strongly in profit at the moment," the unit's managing director said on Sunday. 

 "We haven't found the ceiling yet in some of these markets," Phil Popham told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the North American International Auto Show, adding that he sees "positive signs for this year." Land Rover, along with its sister luxury brand, Jaguar, is in the process of being sold by Ford, which said earlier this month that it has selected India's Tata Motors Ltd ( TAMO.BO ) as the frontrunner to buy the units. In 2007, Land Rover's global sales increased nearly 18 percent to 226,395 vehicles, driven by a 96 percent increase in sales in Russia and a 143 percent increase in sales in China. Ford does not break out the financial results of individual brands. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta )
