 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), the world's fourth largest carmaker, increased group vehicle sales by 7.9 percent to a record 6.189 million units last year thanks to growth at all 8 brands and forecast a further gain for 2008. 

 "There will be growth but whether it will be 8 percent again, I cannot say," Chief Executive Martin Winterkorn told reporters at the Detroit auto show. (Reporting by  Marcel Michelson ; Editing by Rory Channing)
