 DETROIT  (Reuters) - As the Detroit auto show opens on Sunday, major global automakers are set to unwrap glittering new vehicles that span the gamut of styles from the gas-hogging fast to the gas-free green. 

 But the uninvited theme hanging over the industry's largest annual trade show is whether the U.S. market for cars and trucks will spin into the kind of steep downturn this year it has managed to avoid for the past decade and a half. U.S. auto sales fell for the second consecutive year in 2007, dragged down by a slowing economy, a slumping housing market and tighter credit markets that pinched less credit-worthy borrowers. While the consensus view among Wall Street analysts and high-profile investors points to a further decline in the world industry's single-largest market in 2008, there is still a debate about how deep it will go -- especially if the U.S. economy tips into outright recession. Sales of cars and light trucks in the United States slipped to 16.15 million vehicles in 2007, down 2.5 percent from the year earlier. Many analysts and some industry executives see a risk for a drop down to near 15.5 million vehicles this year, although some automakers like General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) are still banking on stronger demand in the second half to prevent that kind of downturn and hold sales nearly flat. "Comments at the Detroit auto show will likely reinforce our negative outlook for the U.S. market in 2008," Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Johnson said in a note for clients last week. "We indeed expect significant further weakness in U.S. auto sales this year, due to a likely consumer credit tightening, combined with the (automakers') resolution not to step up with incentives." During the auto industry's last major slump in 1991, sales plunged 16 percent from then-peak levels before stabilizing. Heading into 2008, the most bearish outlook has come from Thomas Stallkamp, a partner at private equity firm Ripplewood Holdings, who had said in November that sales could fall another 10 percent to 14.5 million vehicles this year. Analysts agree that a decline of that magnitude would force even more sweeping production cuts and job losses, especially among the Detroit-based automakers that have been banking on a turnaround after already wrenching restructurings. By cutting production plans for 2008, automakers have already hedged against the risk of a downturn. Industry tracking service CSM Worldwide expects the rate of annualized U.S. light-vehicle production to fall from 15.5 million units in January to a trough of 12.9 million by March before stabilizing. "For us, any slowdown in the economy -- the housing industry, financing of vehicles, tightening of credit, housing starts -- it puts a lot of pressure on consumer confidence to buy big-ticket items," Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally told reporters ahead of the North American International Auto Show. LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL? The debate about the relative strength of the U.S. market comes as industry insiders are growing more optimistic that the industry is turning a corner toward improved profitability. In a survey of global auto executives released last week, consultancy KPMG LLP found that while a majority still expected volatile or flat profits, 26 percent saw earnings rising for the sector over the next five years. That was up from just 16 percent in the same survey a year earlier. In a similar shift in sentiment, the largest group of executives -- 48 percent -- said they expected bankruptcy filings by auto suppliers to stabilize now. "Many execs in our survey are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with respect to the turnaround prospects for North American" automakers, said Daron Gifford, who heads the automotive group at KPMG. That view has not been shared by the financial markets. Shares in GM have lost 44 percent since their recent high in mid-October, when the stock was buoyed by a landmark cost-saving labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. Shares of smaller rival Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) have dropped 34 percent over the same period. Both have underperformed a slumping U.S. stock market that has seen the S&P 500 index drop 10 percent over the past three months. For its part, GM expects vehicle sales above 16 million units this year -- including about 300,000 medium-duty work trucks -- although it concedes there are risks to that view. "Could it be lower than that? You bet. Could it be higher? I don't right now see that," GM CEO Rick Wagoner told reporters last week. "We do look at a lower industry -- whether its China or the U.S. or Brazil -- to say OK, how are we structured to handle it? It's usually more challenging to look at the downside. Looking at the upside is fun." (Additional reporting by  Jui Chakravorty )
