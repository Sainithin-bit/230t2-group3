 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC ended 2007 with more cash on hand than its new private owner Cerberus Capital Management had projected, but the automaker is looking to sell off real estate and other assets to boost liquidity, Chief Executive Officer Bob Nardelli said on Sunday. 

 Separately, while he was unsure whether the U.S. economy was facing recession, Nardelli said it was clear that consumer spending had slowed. "We certainly have seen a slowdown in the consumer overall," Nardelli told reporters on the sidelines of the Detroit auto show. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
