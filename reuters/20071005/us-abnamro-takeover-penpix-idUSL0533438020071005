 LONDON  (Reuters) - A trio of banks led by Royal Bank of Scotland and including Fortis and Santander moved in to win the battle for Dutch bank ABN AMRO on Friday, clinching the world's biggest bank takeover as rival Barclays conceded defeat. 

 The following are the key people involved in the consortium's success: FRED GOODWIN, 49, RBS chief executive Goodwin has spearheaded the consortium's chase and the trio's success cements his reputation as one of banking's shrewdest and toughest dealmakers. The deal also shows he is well aware that it pays to keep close allies such as Santander. Goodwin took the top job at RBS after it bought NatWest in 2000, having helped mastermind the acquisition that transformed the Edinburgh-based lender into Europe's second-biggest bank. The acquisition of U.S. bank Charter One in 2004 prompted an accusation he was a megalomaniac, but share buybacks and dividend hikes had replaced deals before the pursuit of ABN. Goodwin, charismatic and driven, is a proven deal-maker, and the ability to squeeze cost savings out of targets earned him the nickname "Fred the Shred". A qualified accountant knighted in 2004 for services to banking, he previously headed Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks. For a full profile click on. EMILIO BOTIN, 73, Santander chairman Botin has kept a relatively low profile during the pursuit of ABN, but the deal is probably better for Santander than anyone else -- it gains gems in Brazil and Italy. A straight-talking disciplinarian with a keen eye for a deal, Botin has turned Santander from a small Spanish operation into the euro zone's biggest bank during 21 years at the helm. It is often said there are few deals done in Spain without the knowledge of Don Emilio, as he is known in the bank. Botins of three generations have run Banco Santander since the 1850s, and his daughter Ana Patricia, who the Financial Times has named Europe's top businesswoman for the last two years, is expected to fill her father's shoes. Under Botin's stewardship, Santander led a buying spree in Latin America in the 1990s and changed the face of Spanish banking three years ago with the purchase of British lender Abbey National for more than 9 billion pounds. Such is the respect Botin commands in Spain that neither a messy boardroom rift in 2001 nor several legal battles have dented his image, jealously guarded by the media-shy executive. JEAN-PAUL VOTRON, 57, Fortis chief executive A former ABN AMRO and Citigroup executive, Votron took the helm of Fortis in October 2004 with a pledge to grow at a faster pace and to expand the group outside the Benelux region, gaining enough clout to keep predators at bay. Having failed to land a proposed merger with Dexia in 2005, the deal with ABN will create a formidable bank across the Netherlands and Belgium. Votron, a keen jogger and skier, was head of Citigroup's European retail banking operation before joining Fortis. He started his career in 1975 at Unilever. ANDREA ORCEL, 44, Merrill Lynch head of investment banking Orcel was instrumental in coming up with the consortium's offer, and the deal helped him get promoted to head of global origination and investment banking at Merrill. Half-French, half-Italian with a reputation for hard and long hours, he speaks four languages. Orcel advised in financial institutions before getting the wider role. He advised Santander on its acquisition of Abbey, the previous biggest cross-border banking deal. RIJKMAN GROENINK, 58, ABN chairman of managing board A tough banker, Groenink was known as "The Terminator" in the Dutch press after he took the helm at ABN in 2000 and began a group-wide restructuring effort. He has been named "European banker of the year", but Groenink has been through some tough times at the top, with many shareholders calling for his head when the bank became embroiled in the protracted 2005 battle for Italian bank Antonveneta. Groenink, who joined the Amsterdam-Rotterdam (AMRO) bank as a trainee in 1974, is likely to be out of a job once the takeover is completed. He had strongly supported the deal with Barclays and drew criticism from the consortium for not taking a more neutral stance. He was recently admitted to hospital with acute appendicitis but told staff this week he was recovering well.

His U.S. experience has made him a key figure on the ABN management team and he took a more prominent role in the takeover process as criticism of Groenink's stance increased. CHRIS HOHN, 40, founder of The Children's Investment Fund Money manager Hohn became the face of hedge fund activism in 2005 when his fund criticized Deutsche Boerse's approach for the London Stock Exchange, eventually forcing out the German bourse's chief executive and torpedoing the bid. The elusive Hohn, whose UK-based fund is named after the money it donates to children's charities, triggered ABN's merger talks when he sent a letter to management in February saying the bank should break up or sell itself. Hohn has strongly supported the higher value on offer from the RBS-led group and led calls that Groenink should be sacked for not opening its books to the consortium earlier. JOHN VARLEY, 51, Barclays chief executive Varley began the battle for ABN with an ambitious attempt to buy it in March, which was supported by ABN's management. Married into one of the families that helped build up Barclays, he would have headed the enlarged bank. He was ultimately outgunned by rivals who could afford to pay more, raising the question of whether he will attempt another big deal to propel Barclays into the top tier of global banks.
