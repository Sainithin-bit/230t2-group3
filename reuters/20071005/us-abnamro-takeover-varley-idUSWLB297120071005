 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ) is confident of an independent future, its chief executive said on Friday, dismissing speculation that the failure to win control of ABN AMRO AAH.AS could leave it vulnerable to a takeover. 

 "I have complete confidence in the independent future of Barclays," John Varley said in a telephone interview. Barclays conceded defeat in the 7-month battle for the Dutch bank earlier on Friday but Varley said the bank was not dependent on the ABN deal for growth and would still consider other acquisition opportunities. "We have been absolutely clear in terms of the discipline we bring to (the ABN) opportunity -- we must not overpay. It goes with that that we should...be in a position where we could walk away," he told Reuters. "We are walking away today...I feel a sense of disappointment, of course I do, because I would like us to have merged with ABN AMRO, but it is disappointment -- not despondency and not dependency."
