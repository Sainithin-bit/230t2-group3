 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N, the second-largest U.S. savings and loan, joined other major banks on Friday in warning that loan losses would impact third-quarter results. 

 Sovereign said it would boost its provision for credit losses to a range of $155 million to $165 million in the third quarter, up from $51 million in the second quarter, mostly due to problems in its home equity and auto lending portfolios. Sovereign did not say what impact the higher provision would have on third-quarter earnings, which analysts, on average, had expected to be 33 cents a share before exceptional items, according to Reuters Estimates. The bank, which is 25 percent owned by Spain's Banco Santander Central Hispano ( SAN.MC ), cited deterioration in consumer credit and volatility in mortgage-backed securities as reasons for the losses. Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N and Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) also said on Friday they would take big writedowns on mortgages and other credit losses. Still, at the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Sovereign shares were up 33 cents, or 1.9 percent, at $17.73 as financial stocks gained on hopes the worst was over. Sovereign said in a statement that $50 million of the increase in the credit losses provision was due to $491 million that remained in a home equity loan portfolio as of the end of June. The Philadelphia-based bank had gotten out of the business in early 2006 and sold $3.3 billion of that portfolio, but retained loans they could not sell, many of them non-prime, which are usually given to home buyers with poor credit records. About $40 million of the increase represented a boost in reserves for an auto lending portfolio in response to anticipated higher credit losses, the bank said. Sovereign also said it would take pretax charges of about $20 million for losses on financings to mortgage lenders which have since filed for bankruptcy protection or defaulted on credit agreements and $15 million for the lower of cost or market adjustments on certain loan portfolios classified as loans held for sale. The bank said there were no credit issues for these loans. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb  and Ed Leefeldt)
