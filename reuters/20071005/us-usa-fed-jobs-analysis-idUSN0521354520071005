 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Surprisingly robust U.S. third-quarter employment growth gives the Federal Reserve breathing space as it mulls whether more interest rate cuts are needed to help the world's largest economy weather a housing slump and credit crisis. 

 Fed policy-makers, who aggressively cut the benchmark federal funds rate on September 18 after a report saying the economy had shed jobs in August, will feel less pressure to cut rates again at their October 30-31 meeting after fresh data that showed the labor market was actually not in such bad shape after all. Interest-rate futures have trimmed back bets the Fed will cut by a quarter percentage point at the next meeting and in late Friday trade implied a 44 percent likelihood of a move, compared with a 72 percent chance before the latest jobs report. This chimed with the findings of Reuters' latest poll, in which 10 out of 18 primary bond dealers surveyed thought the central bank would lower rates by a quarter point. Upward revisions to the monthly employment report on Friday showed it added 89,000 positions in August, instead of losing 4,000, and there were 118,000 more jobs created in July and August than previously thought.  It also added a bigger-than-expected 110,000 jobs in September, according to the Labor Department. While that number puts the economy on pace for relatively modest employment gains, it suggests tighter credit and the prolonged housing downturn have not led to broad business retrenchment that has pushed the country toward recession. "The September number alone suggests that economic growth has moderated, but it really hasn't fallen off the cliff at all," said John Silvia, chief economist for Wachovia. The Fed's unexpectedly big half-point rate cut on September 18 was aimed at counteracting rapidly deteriorating credit conditions and giving economic growth a decisive shove, Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said in a speech on Friday. Even without a complete picture of whether the housing slump and credit problems had spilled over to hurt the broader economy, policy-makers opted for a course they believed was the safest bet to deal with the circumstances they faced. "I thought that economic performance would be better served by the Federal Reserve taking its chances on responding too much, or too rapidly, to the turmoil in financial markets rather than acting too little, or too slowly," Kohn told the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce. In addition to a less worrisome picture for growth suggested by the payrolls report, some signs of stability in credit markets emerged this week. U.S. commercial paper outstanding grew for the first time since a surge in mortgage delinquencies triggered broader credit problems in August. Also, banks borrowed less at the Fed's discount window in the latest week, a sign that they were able to borrow through regular channels. "At this juncture it appears that businesses are still reasonably confident and have access to credit so that they are expanding payrolls in various industries," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America Capital Management. "We have a number of weak links, including housing (and) manufacturing ... but the economy is still moving forward and at this point the Fed may chose to pause and wait for more data, since it has moved proactively with that aggressive rate cut in September," Reaser said. But former Fed Governor Lyle Gramley said Kohn's comments were a clear clue to expect another cut, because they highlighted the economy was already experiencing subpar growth before the financial crisis hit. "I think you have got a solid case for (a quarter-percentage point cut)," he said. "If you are going to try to help the economy, it seems to me you want to help it early on." Kohn said on Friday that growth had averaged around 2 percent since mid-2006, compared with long-run trend estimates of 2.5-3.0 percent, and the Fed's July forecasts were for a gradual increase in unemployment into next year.
