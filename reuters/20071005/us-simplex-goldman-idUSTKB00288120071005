 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and fund management firm Aetos Capital plan to take over property investor Simplex Investment Advisors Inc 8942.T in a $1.4 billion deal in what may be a harbinger of more acquisitions in Japan's property market. 

 Goldman and Aetos will offer 215,000 yen per Simplex share, the two said on Friday, representing a 65 percent premium over Simplex's Thursday closing price of 130,000 yen. Shares of Simplex rose on Friday to 150,000 yen, up the daily limit of 20,000 yen or 15.4 percent, after Reuters reported that the Simplex sales were up for sale. Trading was later suspended after sources told Reuters that Goldman planned to launch the bid. Share prices of real estate firms have fallen steeply, as a global liquidity squeeze ended a five-year bull run in Japan's $40 billion property trust market, where the likes of Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) and Goldman Sachs have invested. Simplex and Nikko Cordial 8603.T, Simplex's top shareholder with a 42.5 percent stake, said they agreed to Goldman's offer. Under the deal, which values Simplex at 157 billion yen ($1.35 billion), a special purpose vehicle set up by Japan units of Goldman and Aetos would acquire at least 80 percent of Simplex shares for a minimum 124.7 billion yen. After the bid, to run from October 12 to November 8, the vehicle will buy up any remaining Simplex shares, they said. Reuters reported late on Thursday that Yoshihiro Mikami, a major shareholder in Simplex and a former Salomon Brothers bond trader, was looking to sell his 29 percent stake. Nikko Cordial said it expected to post a special profit of 44 billion yen in the business year to March 2008 on the share sale. Simplex has three main business segments: asset management of real estate funds in Japan, property development and property marketing. (Additional reporting by Alison Tudor)
