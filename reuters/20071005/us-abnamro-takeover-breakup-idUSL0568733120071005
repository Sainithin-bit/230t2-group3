 (Reuters) - The intense 7-month battle for ABN AMRO AAH.AS neared its conclusion on Friday, with a trio of European bidders led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) set to win control of the Netherlands' largest bank. 

 The outcome of the biggest-ever banking takeover battle had been widely expected after a fall in the share price of rival bidder Barclays ( BARC.L ) saw its bid slip behind the 71.8 billion euro ($101 billion) mostly cash offer from the RBS consortium. Following is a factbox about a possible break-up of ABN and who could get what when the three-way bid goes ahead. RBS GETS WHOLESALE CLIENTS RBS, which was initially attracted by ABN's U.S. operations, has now shifted its focus to taking over the Dutch bank's investment banking business after it was unable to prevent the sale of Chicago-based LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ) during the takeover process. For its investment banking business, RBS will acquire ABN's wholesale clients in the Netherlands, Latin America excluding Brazil, Asia excluding Saudi Hollandi, and BU Europe excluding Antonveneta. RBS is expecting cost and revenue benefits of 1.8 billion euros by 2010. SANTANDER PLUGS ITALIAN GAP Santander, Spain's largest bank, would get Antonveneta in Italy, where ABN was instrumental in breaking down hostility to foreign takeovers, buying Banca Antonveneta in 2006 for 7.5 billion euros. Santander would also get ABN's Banco Real in Brazil and merge it with its own Brazilian unit Banespa. Both banks have been growing on the back of an expanding retail market and mortgages. Santander will also take on ABN's branches elsewhere in Latin America where it already has a strong presence. Santander expects cost savings of 855 million and revenue benefits of 175 million euros by 2010. FORTIS BECOMES BENELUX HEAVYWEIGHT The Belgian-Dutch bank, keen to bulk up its size to become less of a potential takeover target itself, will take over ABN's branch network in the Netherlands. Fortis will also get ABN's private banking clients, excluding those in Latin America and ABN's asset management business. Fortis estimates cost and revenue benefits of 1.3 billion euros by 2010.
