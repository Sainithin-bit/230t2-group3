 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders denied committing insider trading in the sale of shares in parent company EADS ( EAD.PA ) and pledged to help the authorities quickly finish a probe into the matter. 

 "I have never committed any insider trading, and I have not been accused of insider dealing by anyone, including the AMF (French stock market regulator)," Enders said in a letter to senior executives dated October 4. "We are not prepared to accept being described in the media as being suspected or accused of insider dealings. Such accusation is both very serious and unjustified." Enders added: "We will continue to support the AMF and other authorities with their effort in bringing the facts to the table and finding justice. But I am also urging the authorities to quickly conclude their investigations and communicate the result in a proper procedure."
