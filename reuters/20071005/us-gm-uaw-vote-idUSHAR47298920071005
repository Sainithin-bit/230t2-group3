 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Momentum has been building toward the United Auto Workers accepting a tentative contract with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), though members at some key locals backed it by narrow margins in results released on Thursday. 

 The UAW's more than 73,000 active members at GM are aligned in dozens of locals across the United States that must vote on the contract settlement reached last week that ended a two-day national strike against the largest U.S. automaker. A majority of workers casting ballots must approve for the contract to be ratified and the UAW has aimed to complete the vote by October 10. The UAW has yet to complete contract talks with Ford Motor Co ( F.N )> and privately held Chrysler LLC.
