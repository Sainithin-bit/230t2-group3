 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N said on Friday it would write down $5.5 billion for bad bets on subprime mortgages and leveraged loans, taking the worst hit yet among major Wall Street brokerages from turmoil in the credit markets. 

 Merrill said it would post a third-quarter loss of up to 50 cents a share after writing down $4.5 billion in collateralized debt obligations and subprime mortgage holdings. Merrill had been expected to earn $1.43 a share in the third quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. It is also taking writedowns, on a gross basis, of $967 million related to all non-investment grade lending commitments, regardless of the timing of funding or closing, the company said. Analysts were concerned that Merrill's losses might continue. "The core issue is whether or not it is going to be enough. Merrill had huge exposures to the mortgage sector, the CDO sector and the collateralized loan sector," said Sean Egan, managing director of independent credit ratings firm Egan-Jones Ratings Inc. Merrill Chief Executive Stan O'Neal said in a statement that the fourth-quarter outlook for revenues remains "difficult to predict," but he sees evidence of long-term growth trends in its global businesses. Merrill was expected to have earnings of $2.20 a share in the fourth quarter, and revenues of $8.8 billion, according to Reuters estimates. The firm said the writedowns primarily affected its fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) business. Merrill said it expects to report revenue growth "in excess" of 20 percent over the 2006 third quarter in each of its other business lines and "solid" revenue performance from the rest of its FICC businesses. OUSTERS AND CUTBACKS Merrill's announcement follows the ouster of two top executives from its fixed income business, an indication that more job cuts are likely, according to analysts. On Wednesday Wall Street's No. 3 brokerage by market value said Osman Semerci, global head of fixed income, currencies and commodities, and Dale Lattanzio of the company's structured credit unit, had left the firm. Merrill Lynch's subprime mortgage unit, First Franklin Financial, has cut jobs and closed branches this year as defaults and foreclosures on loans to borrowers with weak credit have escalated throughout the industry. Problems at First Franklin, the No. 3 U.S. subprime lender, could cut about $100 million from the brokerage's third quarter profit, Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said in late September. In early trading, Merrill's shares were up $1.02 or about 1.4 percent at $75.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt and  Mark McSherry )
