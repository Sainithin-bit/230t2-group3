 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N said on Friday it would write down $5.5 billion for bad bets on subprime mortgages and leveraged loans, becoming the only major Wall Street brokerage to take a loss from turmoil in the credit markets. 

 Merrill said it would post a third-quarter loss of up to 50 cents a share after writing down $4.5 billion in collateralized debt obligations and subprime mortgage holdings. Merrill had been expected to earn $1.43 a share in the third quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. It is also taking writedowns, on a gross basis, of $967 million related to all non-investment grade lending commitments, regardless of the timing of funding or closing, the company said. Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) and Sovereign Bancorp SOV.N issued warnings on Friday. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) have issued similar warnings. Moody's and Fitch Ratings lowered Merrill's outlook to "negative" from "stable." Their current ratings are the fourth-highest investment grade. "The core issue is whether or not it is going to be enough. Merrill had huge exposures to the mortgage sector, the CDO sector and the collateralized loan sector," said Sean Egan, managing director of independent credit ratings firm Egan-Jones Ratings Inc. But investors seemed satisfied with the Merrill announcement. "Once the institution comes clean and gives you some transparency ... the market can start to look ahead," said Bill Hackney, a managing partner at Atlanta Capital Management. Hackney said his firm, with $8.7 billion under management, was adding to its Merrill holdings as the subprime crisis unfolded. In late afternoon trading, Merrill shares were up $2.03 at $76.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. Merrill shares fell to $66.95 on August 16 from a January high of $98.68. Deutsche Bank analyst Michael Mayo said in a research note that while he was "somewhat frustrated" by Merrill, he had a "buy" rating on the stock. 'DIFFICULT TO PREDICT' Merrill Chief Executive Stan O'Neal said in a statement that fourth-quarter outlook for revenue remained "difficult to predict," but he said he sees evidence of long-term growth trends in its global businesses. Merrill was expected to have earnings of $2.20 a share in the fourth quarter, and revenue of $8.8 billion, according to Reuters estimates. "It's still going to end up being the second most profitable year in Merrill Lynch's history," said Chuck Carnevale, chief investment officer and co-chief executive at Great Companies Inc. "The company is not dying or going out of business." Merrill said the writedowns primarily affected its fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) businesses. In Friday's statement, O'Neal said he was disappointed with his company's performance in structured finance and mortgages. "We can do a better job of managing this risk, as we have done with other classes," he said. Merrill said it expects to report revenue growth "in excess" of 20 percent over the 2006 third quarter in each of its other business lines, and "solid" revenue performance from the rest of its FICC businesses. OUSTERS AND CUTBACKS Merrill's announcement follows the ouster of two top executives from its fixed income business. On Wednesday Wall Street's No. 3 brokerage by market value said Osman Semerci, global head of fixed income, currencies and commodities, and Dale Lattanzio of the structured credit unit, had left the company. Analysts said that could portend further job cuts. However, Merrill spokeswoman Jessica Oppenheim said the company was "not anticipating a significant scale-down of employees." She said Merrill would not comment further before its earnings report due Oct 24. Merrill Lynch's subprime mortgage unit, First Franklin Financial, has cut jobs and closed branches this year as defaults and foreclosures on loans to borrowers with weak credit escalated across the United States. Problems at First Franklin, the No. 3 U.S. subprime lender, could cut about $100 million from the brokerage's third quarter profit, Sandler O'Neill analyst Jeff Harte said in late September.
