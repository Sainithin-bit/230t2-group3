 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - State Street Corp ( STT.N ) may face legal action by the state attorneys general of Alaska and Idaho after pension funds in those states lost money in two bond funds managed by the asset manager, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 The pension funds thought these "enhanced index" bond funds were low risk, but instead they made aggressive bets in mortgage-backed securities, derivatives and other assets which lost money, the paper said. The state attorneys general are looking into possible legal action against State Street, the paper said. Earlier this week, a unit of Prudential Financial Inc. sued State Street over $80 million in losses in 165 retirement plans that were invested in State Street fixed income funds, the newspaper said. No-one at State Street could immediately be reached for comment.
