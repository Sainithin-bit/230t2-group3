 TORONTO  (Reuters) - BlackBerry maker Research In Motion RIM.TORIMM.O has entered into a settlement with the Ironworkers Ontario Pension Fund, which had sued the company over how it granted stock options in the past. 

 RIM said it will bulk up its corporate governance practices, which will involve excluding its independent directors from receiving stock options. As well, RIM co-CEOs Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis have agreed to pay $2.5 million each to the company to defray the costs it incurred.
