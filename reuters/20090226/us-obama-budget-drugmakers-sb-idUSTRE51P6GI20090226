 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's 2010 budget proposal takes direct aim at drugmakers and health insurers to help fund an overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. 

 His plan, outlined Thursday, calls for lowering Medicare payments to private insurers, allowing consumers to buy cheaper medicines from overseas and preventing drug companies from making deals that block generic competition. Shares of U.S. health insurers suffered, with Humana Inc down 19 percent, Aetna Inc off 11 percent, Cigna Corp down 7 percent, UnitedHealth Group Inc off 12 percent and WellPoint Inc down 9 percent in afternoon trading. Shares of drugmakers also fell. The American Exchange Pharmaceutical Index, which includes GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Merck & Co Inc and Johnson & Johnson, was down 3.6 percent, underperforming the broader market. Congress will consider the White House proposal as it spends the coming months crafting a spending plan for fiscal 2010 that begins October 1. While Obama could seek action on anti-competitive drug deals and drug imports without Congress, many other changes would need lawmakers to implement them through legislation. "Any time you contemplate major legislative changes in the health care system, you have something to worry about. I think the question is: At the end of the day how are they going to come out?" said Paul Heldman, a healthcare policy analyst at Potomac Research Group in Washington. "The Medicare managed care insurers are vulnerable to taking some sort of cut in their payments, as are the drugmakers," he said. Private health insurers, which play a huge role in providing benefits under the massive Medicare insurance plan, would take the biggest hit. Medicare covers about 44 million elderly and disabled Americans. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), which represents private insurers, rejected any move to reduce payments for Medicare Advantage plans. The plans from private insurers cover about a quarter of Medicare's beneficiaries and can provide greater benefits than government-run Medicare, but cost more. "A cut of this scale would jeopardize the health security of more than ten million seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage and would turn back the clock on innovative payment incentives to improve the quality of care that patients receive," AHIP president Karen Ignagni said. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) industry group said it understood the need to make tough choices to fund reforms. But, it added, "as Congress works through the budget process, we strongly urge against the adoption of policies that could undermine innovation and disrupt patient access to life-saving medicines." INSURERS TAKE BIGGEST HIT About 46 million Americans have no health insurance. Obama, a Democrat, has committed to expanding health care coverage to all Americans and providing better care while reducing wasteful spending for medical errors, fraud and unnecessary treatments. To help do that, his fiscal year 2010 budget calls for a 10-year, $634-billion reserve fund to help pay for changes. Insurers would use a competitive bidding system for their Medicare Advantage plans. The government would set Medicare Advantage payments based on an average of plans' bids submitted by insurers, saving more than $175 billion over 10 years, according to the Obama proposal. Currently, Medicare Advantage plans cost the government an average of 14 percent more than traditional fee-for-service Medicare coverage, according to the White House. Patient advocates welcomed the move. "In recent years, Medicare has become a cash cow for insurance companies... The President's budget finally ends that bonanza," Medicare Rights Center spokesman Paul Precht said. But House Republican Whip Eric Cantor said Obama's reforms rely on "old-style spending increases and government-knows-best approaches." He said Republicans believe the focus should be on preserving patient options and ensuring doctors can make critical decision free of restrictive government policies. Drugmakers could also feel a squeeze under Obama's plan, with the administration seeking to curb drug prices. The plan calls for drug companies to offer larger rebates to Medicaid, the joint federal-state insurance program for the poor. It would increase rebates to 22.1 percent from 15.1 percent of the average manufacturer price to help save nearly $20 billion through 2019. The White House also seeks to end deals between brand-name drugmakers and competitors that block cheaper generic drugs from entering the U.S. market. Americans would also be able to buy lower-priced medicines directly from other countries. Congressional Democrats say they support efforts to overhaul the healthcare system, but it is not clear when they will take up any bills or what changes they will seek. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries are likely to resist any efforts that would curb their revenues. Still, health insurers and drugmakers alike could eventually benefit if the savings are used to provide coverage to those currently without health insurance. "If the ultimate end-game means that 46 million more people will be covered ... that might be a trade-off they're willing to accept," said Washington Analysis Corp analyst Ira Loss.
