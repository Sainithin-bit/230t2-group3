 BEIJING  (Reuters) - U.S. insurer American International Group has sent senior executives to China to discuss the sale of its Hong Kong-based AIA unit, a top official with China's insurance regulator said on Thursday. 

 But Chinese firms' potential bids for the embattled U.S. insurer's Asian life insurance unit would be solely a corporate decision, saidLi Kemu, vice chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. "As a regulator, we care more about risks, or whether AIA's business in China is stable," Li told reporters. (Reporting by Langi Chiang; Writing by Michael Wei; Editing by  Ken Wills )
