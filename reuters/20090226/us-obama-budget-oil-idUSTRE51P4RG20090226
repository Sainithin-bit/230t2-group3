 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama's budget outline calls for eliminating substantial tax breaks and increasing fees for the oil and natural gas industry. 

 Obama's plan, which must still be approved by Congress, would levy an excise tax on Gulf of Mexico oil and gas that would provide the government with $5.3 billion in revenue from 2011 to 2019. The proposal would also place a fee on nonproducer energy leases on federal lands expected to raise $1.2 billion between 2010 to 2019. (Reporting by  Ayesha Rascoe ; Editing by John Picinich)
