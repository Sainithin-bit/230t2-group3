 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. orders for long-lasting manufactured goods fell for a sixth consecutive month to a six-year low in January, a government report showed on Thursday, as a global slump crimped exports and domestic spending faltered. 

 The number of U.S. workers continuing to claim jobless benefits notched a fresh record in the second week of February, Labor Department data showed on Thursday, while new claims for aid were at the highest level since 1982. KEY POINTS: DURABLE GOODS: * The Commerce Department said durable goods orders dropped 5.2 percent to $163.8 billion in January, the lowest level since December 2002. * Orders for the prior month were revised down to a drop of 4.6 percent, previously reported as a 3 percent contraction. * New orders excluding transportation dropped 2.5 percent in January, while motor vehicles and parts fell 6.4 percent. * Non-defense capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, fell 5.4 percent in January. * The previous month was revised to show a 5.8 percent plunge, previously reported as a 3.2 percent drop. * Analysts polled by Reuters had expected overall new orders to fall 2.5 percent in January and orders excluding transportation to drop 2.1 percent. JOBLESS CLAIMS: * The number of people remaining on the benefits roll after drawing an initial week of assistance increased by 114,000 to a more-then-forecast 5.112 million in the week ended Feb 14, the most recent week for which data is available. * Analysts estimated so-called continued claims would be 5.00 million. COMMENTS: JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK, CHICAGO: "On the jobs side, that is really disappointing but not unexpected. The problem with unemployment is it is like a cresting river: it tends to rise after the storms go through and so unfortunately it's a bad situation that's going to get worse. "Overall I expect the economy and consumer spending to pull back between 5 and 7 percent. About 80 percent of that pain will be felt in durable goods. "In the Treasury market, I think supply is overwhelming fundamentals, given the massive new issuance." DAVE ROVELLI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, U.S. EQUITY TRADING, CANACCORD ADAMS, NEW YORK: "It's basically much, much worse than expected. The futures are hanging in there but I don't know if they're going to continue to. "Initial jobless claims, continuing claims were worse, and durable goods were worse across the board. "The problem with initial jobless claims is it's a trend... It's still going almost hyperbolic, it's still going higher and higher and higher. "It's not plateauing and the trend is still in the wrong direction ... there's still no end in sight." JOHN BOO, DIRECTOR, EQUITY TRADING, FERRIS, BAKER WATTS INC, BALTIMORE: "It certainly shows the deterioration in the economy. It's hard to see a bright spot in there. The market isn't hanging and waiting and deciding what to do just on these indicators. The more critical factors are what is coming out of Washington. (Jobless claims) "At this point, anyone who is looking for a big upside surprise in anything employment-related is clutching at straws. (Durable goods)"They're going to be doing a lot less business and they're going to need fewer employees. The news confirms fears that we're not going to get any kind of immediate turnaround, at least in the manufacturing sector." NIGEL GAULT, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, GLOBAL INSIGHT, LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS: "I'm not surprised. Business investment around the world is falling very steeply... "We're seeing major cutbacks in production globally in manufacturing, which means major layoffs across the manufacturing sector, in the heavy durable goods industry. "It is very cyclical. It was not the leader in this cycle, the leader was consumption and housing. But now it is coming in with a vengeance and will be a big factor behind the deep global recession this year. (Jobless claims) "The evidence also here is that there is no sign that the rate of deterioration in the labor market is slowing down. If anything it is getting worse more rapidly. "We think the February jobless report will be the worst yet. In a sense it's part of the same story. When companies are slashing their capital spending budgets, they're also reducing hiring and laying people off. "So both the reports are showing the two aspects of the corporate cutbacks we're seeing around the word." TERRY MORRIS, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, SENIOR EQUITY MANAGER, NATIONAL PENN INVESTORS TRUST COMPANY, READING, PENNSYLVANIA: "Apparently it (jobless claims) unexpectedly rose, but that's just a continuation or confirmation that we're continuing to deteriorate. I'm not sure that it should mean a lot for the market. Unemployment is not a leading indicator, often its a lagging indicator. That it continues to rise shouldn't mean that we're continuing to deteriorate, though that's how it will be taken. "I'm not sure that it's a significant indicator of how the overall economy is doing right now. The economy could turn around and unemployment would still go up for a while until all 6 cylinders kick in. "The futures haven't been impacted, in fact they've risen since General Motors came out. I think the markets are going to be more focused on GM and Obama's budget today. That would be my logic." GARY POLLACK, HEAD, FIXED INCOME TRADING, DEUTSCHE BANK PRIVATE BANKING, NEW YORK: "The numbers this morning came in weaker than expected, implying that the downturn in the first quarter is continuing at a stronger pace than economists thought. It's not good for the equity markets. Bonds are getting a bid of a bid but that's capped by fears about the seven-year note auction coming up this afternoon. Historically, seven-year issues have not gone well. Once the supply is behind us though I think we could see bonds rally again." MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "The weak reports reinforce the view that problems in the U.S. economy are more significant than what had been priced in the market and  that's why we're seeing some bids in the dollar. For now, that should cap risk appetite in the market." CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "The data was weak across the board. "The bond market is getting a bit of a rally here. It is likely that it won't be sustained very long. I think dealers will probably use it as an opportunity to set some shorts ahead of the supply today." GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "Bonds trimmed early losses because the economic numbers were worse than expected. Job losses were higher than expected and orders were weaker than expected. Some of the weakness in orders was in transportation, as expected, but we also saw non-transportation orders decline another 2.5 percent, so it looks like we're still seeing significant reduction in manufacturing as companies try to bring production into line with weak sales. The upward trend in unemployment claims suggests that we haven't seen the worst in the labor market situation yet, probably leading to higher unemployment rates." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures pare gains after surprisingly weak durable goods data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare losses. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares losses versus euro.
