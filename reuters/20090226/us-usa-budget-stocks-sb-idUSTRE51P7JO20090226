 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The 2010 budget proposal that U.S. President Barack Obama unveiled on Thursday takes direct aim at drug makers and health insurers to help fund an overhaul of the U.S. healthcare system. 

 The student loan businesses and for-profit colleges are also in the firing line. Below is how key stocks in each of these sectors fared in Thursday's market session. *** MARKET LOSERS *** * INSURERS AND DRUGMAKERS: Obama's plan calls for cutting Medicare payments to private insurers and allowing consumers to buy cheaper medicines from overseas and preventing drug companies from making deals that block generic competition. Humana Inc: down 19.5 percent to $23.64 Aetna Inc: down 11.3 percent to $24.03 Merck & Co Inc: fell 6.7 percent to $26.04 * STUDENT LOAN BUSINESSES AND FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES: Obama's budget outline called for moving most student lending into the direct-loan program run by the U.S. Education Department. Sallie Mae: plunged nearly 31 percent to $5.80 Student Loan Corp: tumbled about 22 percent to $41.51 ITT Education: off 5.6 percent to $110.69 * DEFENSE CONTRACTORS: Defense companies continued their losing streak from Wednesday after the fiscal 2010 budget called for a reformation in the way the Department of Defense buys weapons. Lockheed Martin: off 1.4 percent at $68.93 Boeing: edged down 3.5 percent to $32.71 Northrop Grumman : down about 2.9 percent to $39.42 *** MARKET WINNERS *** * BANKS: Obama's plan could funnel up to $750 billion in fresh government aid to the battered banks, more than doubling a financial bailout approved last year. Optimism was tempered after a report showed the number of troubled banks soared in the fourth quarter. Huntington Banc: surged 19.3 percent to $1.98 JPMorgan & Chase: up 6.1 percent to $23.05 Wells Fargo: rose 7.1 percent to $14.40 SunTrust Banks: jumped 18.8 percent to $12.95 (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman ; Editing by  Jonathan Oatis )
