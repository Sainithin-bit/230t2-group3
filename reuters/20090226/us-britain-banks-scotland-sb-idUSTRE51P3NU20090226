 EDINBURGH, Scotland  (Reuters) - Its castle perches above the city as majestically as ever, its Georgian terraces look resplendent in the late winter sunshine, but Edinburgh's pride as a banking capital is in tatters. 

 For the past decade the financial services sector has been the most successful part of Scotland's economy. Its two biggest banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and HBOS, grew from provincial lenders to global heavyweights, making Edinburgh Britain's second-biggest and Europe's sixth-biggest financial center. The cost of this ill-fated expansion was laid bare on Thursday when RBS announced the biggest corporate loss in British history. Once Scotland's biggest contributor to the public purse, the bank is now being propped up by taxpayers' money. On the streets of Edinburgh, there were no noisy demonstrations but a stoic resignation that the city's historic reputation for financial prudence and honest banking would struggle to recover. The estimated 30,000 people employed in financial services in the city are increasingly anxious over their jobs. "This is a city that does not do much else except banking, insurance and a bit of tourism," said a 38 year old French fund manager working in the city. "A lot of well-paid people are going to be losing their jobs, and the impact will be enormous. Banking here was characterized by global ambition. It will never be the same again." ILL WILL FOR GOODWIN On Princes Street, the road is blocked by work on a new tram line, but a large store in the middle of this prestigious shopping boulevard lies empty, a victim of Britain's deepening recession, brought on by the global credit crisis. The mood is somber, and behind the Scottish stoicism there is anger and a deep sense of betrayal. There is particular anger that Fred Goodwin, the former chief executive of RBS and the man many blame for its downfall, will be entitled to an annual pension of 650,000 pounds. "The amount being talked about is obscene. Does this man have a conscience?" asked Derek Mortimer, a self-employed mortgage arrears councilor. "Banks have effectively been turned into gambling dens. The whole thing is symptomatic of human greed." "He doesn't deserve a penny," said Robert, a 55 year old hotel worker. "He should be paying back to people what he robbed them of, not the other way round. "This man brought this city to its knees, and he had to be forced to apologize." Nicknamed "Fred the Shred" for his ruthless approach to cost-cutting, Goodwin quit as head of RBS last October when the bank was forced to take 20 billion pounds of emergency state funds. He has since suffered death threats and been forced to remove his children from school. On Thursday a gaggle of photographers gathered outside Goodwin's house in a prestigious suburb just outside the city. But the man who epitomizes Scottish banking's fall from grace was nowhere to be seen. (Editing by Will Waterman)
