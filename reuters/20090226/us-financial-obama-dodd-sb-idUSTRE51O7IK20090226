 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senator Christopher Dodd, chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, pledged on Wednesday that Congress would work with President Barack Obama to craft comprehensive reform of financial sector regulations. 

 "Our intention is to work with the administration to try to put together a comprehensive, thoughtful modernization of our financial regulations that will give the country the confidence and the optimism that our financial services sector is going to be strong and vibrant and healthy," the Democratic lawmaker said. "Our intention is to try to get this done in the coming weeks and months," Dodd told reporters after Obama hosted a White House meeting on Wall Street re-regulation seen as crucial to preventing a repeat of the current financial crisis.
