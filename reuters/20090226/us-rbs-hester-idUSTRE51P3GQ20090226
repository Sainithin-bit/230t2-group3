 LONDON  (Reuters) - Stephen Hester, the investment banker with a keen eye for rare plants, started his 98th day in charge of Royal Bank of Scotland by pledging his bank was not a lost cause, despite posting the biggest-ever UK corporate loss. 

 The quietly spoken and analytical Hester is tasked with the toughest job in UK banking: reviving RBS by shrinking the bank to its core strength and reversing its long acquisition spree. If he succeeds, it will allow RBS to ditch its majority shareholder -- Britain's government -- at a profit for taxpayers. Since taking over in November Hester has had to declare a 24 billion pound loss, defend the payment of bonuses and try to reason with lawmakers, taxpayers, investors and staff in the eye of a public backlash against bankers. The 48-year-old has even been derided for his fashion sense. That followed his arrival for talks with the government in January wearing a tweed shooting jacket, but there may have been a message -- he'd spent his first few weeks dodging bullets and his predecessor had described a previous rescue plan as "less of a negotiation, more of a drive-by shooting". Hester has achieved his first task of distancing himself from past mistakes. Former CEO Fred Goodwin ran RBS for a decade and was respected and feared across the bank. Hester is keen to introduce a more transparent culture. A barrel-chested gardening enthusiast who keeps rare plants and trees at his Oxfordshire country home, Hester joined from property firm British Land, where he had been CEO for two years. His return to a high profile banking role had long been expected after a long career as an investment banker. The circumstances of his return were a shock, however. The government parachuted him in and told him to sort out the mess at the Edinburgh-based bank. Goodwin had overreached with a string of acquisitions and allowed his investment bankers to pile up too many risky loans and investments. CLEAN-UP Hester's priority is to slam on the brakes in investment banking and return to safer retail and commercial banking. He outlined his restructuring plans on Thursday. [nLQ259274] "The key building blocks for RBS's recovery are now in place. That doesn't mean we will recover successfully, there's a massive amount of hard work to do and obstacles to overcome, but we now have the job of execution," he told reporters. RBS will exit or significantly downsize in 36 of the 54 countries it operates it, create a division of possible assets to sell, and may cut 20,000 jobs. Hester spent 19 years as an investment banker at Credit Suisse, but showed during a subsequent stint as finance director at Abbey in 2002 he could purge a troubled bank of complex assets. That clean-up paved the way for Abbey's takeover by Spain's Santander's, although he has been criticized for selling assets too cheaply. The son of an academic, Hester joined Credit Suisse after graduating from Oxford and quickly moved up the ranks to head fixed income. But he lost out in a management reshuffle by his boss John Mack. "A new CEO got rid of all the rivals for his job, and I was one of them," he has been quoted as saying. Hester's move into property was unexpected and was helped by a chance meeting with British Land's boss John Ritblat and a shared passion for skiing. His return to banking was less surprising, but he acknowledges his turnaround task at RBS could take five years. There's plenty of incentive for him to get it right. Hester was given 10.4 million RBS shares worth 65 pence each when he arrived to compensate benefits he forfeited from British Land. With the shares trading at 28p, he is currently sitting on a paper loss of 4 million pounds ($5.7 million).
