 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration announced plans on Thursday to boost the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's budget by 13 percent to help the investor protection agency police markets and better detect fraud. 

 "This past year, the consequences of poor market oversight became abundantly clear," the administration said in its first budget proposal. Under Obama's plan, the SEC's budget for fiscal 2010 would increase by more than 13 percent compared with the agency's 2008 budget of $906 million. The document gives broad outlines of a more detailed one to be released in April. Congress must approve the budget for fiscal 2010, which begins October 1, and usually makes substantial changes. Some lawmakers have called for more SEC funding, citing Bernard Madoff's alleged $50 billion fraud, weak oversight of complex derivatives and the unraveling of investment banks. The Obama budget plan said the SEC would build staff and technology resources in 2010 and pursue a risk-based regulatory structure to better detect fraud and strengthen markets. For the current year, ending September 30, the SEC is expected to spend a total of about $914 million. The agency has been criticized for not chasing tips on the Madoff fraud. New SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro has told Congress she needs resources and support to catch lawbreakers. (Reporting by  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
