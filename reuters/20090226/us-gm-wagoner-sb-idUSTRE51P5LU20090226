 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A meeting between the chief executive of General Motors Corp and the Obama administration's autos task force began on Thursday and was expected to be lengthy, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 CEO Rick Wagoner was joined at the Treasury Department by Ray Young, GM's chief financial officer, and Fritz Henderson, the company's chief operating officer, the source said. Chrysler CEO Bob Nardelli and other company officials met with the task force on Wednesday. GM is seeking more than $16 billion in government aid on top of the $13.4 billion approved for the automaker in a December bailout. GM declined comment on its expectations for the meeting. But Young told reporters on a conference call earlier in the day on GM's dismal fourth-quarter financial results the task force is "in a fact-gathering mode" and "we are here in order to respond to their questions." The task force has until March 31 to determine whether GM and Chrysler, which is seeking $5 billion in new bailout funds on top of $4 billion already received, are commercially viable and deserve more help. The purchasing chief of Ford Motor Co also met with the government on supplier issues this week. Suppliers would also like billions in government aid. Dealers also want government help to finance floor plans. Ford has not sought government assistance but favors a line of credit, if its finances worsen more than expected in 2009.
