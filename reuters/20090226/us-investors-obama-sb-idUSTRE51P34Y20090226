 LONDON  (Reuters) - A global coalition of investors with assets of more than $1.3 trillion has urged United States President Barack Obama to establish a British-style corporate governance regime by the end of next year. 

 In a letter dated February 13, the group of 28 major investors call for a "comply or explain" system which adopts particular actions on remuneration, voting, and on the separation of roles at the head of companies. Obama has already signaled tough action to rein in companies and earlier this month set a salary cap for top bosses at companies receiving taxpayer funds. In their letter, made public on Thursday, the investors backed moves to allow formal objections at companies' annual meetings when there is a perceived misalignment of pay and performance. "We see adoption of such an advisory shareholder vote as a critical first step toward addressing the executive compensation problems that permeate the United States market," they said. Some U.S. firms -- including personal computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co and mobile phone maker Motorola -- have already installed a so-called 'say-on-pay' vote, or have said they will. However, the measure is not compulsory and was rejected by firms such as Citigroup and Morgan Stanley. Exxon even lobbied shareholders to vote against the proposal. The investors also urged Obama to support measures which would split the roles of CEO and chairman at U.S. firms. They said: "We see the absence of a strong, independent chair as a structural impediment to effective board oversight." BROKER VOTES Among other measures, the investors want to end the system which allows brokers to vote for shares on their accounts for which they have not received instructions from investors. "This amounts to legalized ballot stuffing... It is time for the SEC to take action," they said. The investors also want the right to easily put their own board candidates up for election. In raising these points, the investors highlighted regimes in the UK, Netherlands and Australia which might be used as models for a broad discussion to build a U.S. equivalent. "We would like to see this process led in the United States by an appropriate government entity, with a goal for implementation of a best practices "comply or explain" disclosure requirement by 2010," the letter said. The "comply or explain" model for corporate governance allows a company Board to deviate from stated best practice, but it must justify the decision to the satisfaction of investors. Signatories to the letter include giant U.S. pension funds CalPERS and CalSTRS, UK fund managers Aviva Investors and Standard Life Investments, and European pension funds such as Dutch scheme PGGM, Sweden's AP2 and Britain's USS. The investors said they represent the retirement savings of some 15 million people worldwide. (Reporting by Joel Dimmock; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)
