 By Alexander Smith LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland has bid farewell to the architects of its investment bank. It must now put the ill-fated venture out of its misery. RBS is reviewing its activities and is already touting its investment banking operations in Asia for sale, business it picked up with the purchase of ABN Amro in 2007. But this is not enough. It will go against the grain for new RBS Chief Executive Stephen Hester, himself a former investment banker, to exit the business but he should seek buyers for other parts of the Global Banking and Markets (GBM) empire which under fallen stars Johnny Cameron and Bryan Crowe became one of the world's biggest corporate lenders and a major player in credit markets. Cameron, Crowe and Symon Drake-Brockman, head of credit markets, have all gone. But while the chiefs are history, there are still around 18,000 people working under the GBM umbrella. RBS cannot afford GBM -- both financially and in terms of the management time it absorbs. The business is generating significant losses. True, this is partly because RBS is writing down assets it put on at the time of the boom, particularly credit instruments and leveraged loans. But when those losses have worked their way through the system, it is questionable whether GBM has a profitable business model. GBM was able to win business in the past by making free with its parent's balance sheet. This is no longer possible. And absent that, it is far from clear that the business has any significant competitive advantage in investment banking. Moreover, the costs of staying in the business look formidable. Citigroup estimates a cost/income ratio of more than 100 percent for the next three years for GBM. RBS is gritting its teeth and says it will concentrate on areas where it has market-leading competitive positions. The argument might be that there are now some decent franchises -- RBS has identified loans, bonds, foreign exchange, rates, commodities and equities -- which could provide the bedrock. But the danger of history repeating itself is high. Depositors' money would end up feeding more grandiose investment banking ambitions and given that the group has never had the management needed to make a long-term success of it, why should investors trust it now? You might have expected the British government, which now owns 70 percent, to put pressure on RBS to pull out of investment banking. After all, it is hardly in the taxpayer's interest to insure risky and unprofitable investment banking activities. But the state seems reluctant to exercise its ownership rights - fearing it will be accused of back seat driving. Moreover, the government doesn't seem to be pushing for a separation of retail and commercial banking from investment banking, perhaps because it fears this could undermine the City of London. While he has made some concessions, pulling back in structured real estate and leveraged and project finance, there's no real incentive for Hester to give up what have always been seen as the sexier bits of banking. For all the glamour and high wages of investment banking, it is possible the business could drive the RBS share price more quickly when the market does turn. And Hester has a fistful of shares in RBS he would like to see pay out. Hester must resist this temptation. True, the market is not great for selling investment banking assets and potential acquirers are few and far between, but RBS does have some jewels in its portfolio. It should be able to find buyers for the commodities joint venture Sempra and corporate broking business Hoare Govett while it can. For those businesses that cannot be sold, there is no choice but to close them and find other work for as many of the staff as possible. While it is unpalatable for the British government to cut financial services jobs at a time when the sector is already hurting badly, Hester must grasp the nettle now rather than risk more damage. -- At the time of publication Alexander Smith did not own any direct investments in securities mentioned in this article.
