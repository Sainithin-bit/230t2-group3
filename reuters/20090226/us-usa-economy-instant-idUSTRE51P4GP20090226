 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales of newly built U.S. single-family homes slumped to a record low in January, while prices fell to their weakest level in five years, according to a government report on Thursday that highlighted the continued distress in the housing market. 

 COMMENTS: JOSEPH LAVORGNA, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "New homes made another new record low, with sales down 10.2 percent to 309,000 units. Despite this reading, inventories relative to sales actually made a new high. The months' supply of unsold homes rose from 12.2 to 13.3, a new record high. This means that home prices will remain under downward pressure." TERRIN GRIFFITHS, ECONOMIST, CALIFORNIA CREDIT UNION LEAGUE, RANCHO CUCAMONGA, CALIFORNIA: "The drop in new home sales is not unexpected. Home buyers are remaining cautious as the current economic storm takes its toll on jobs and confidence and thus, home buying. Those forces against buying will remain strong so while there might be a slight boost ahead due to tax incentives, realistically things are going to remain weak for some time." LAWRENCE J. WHITE, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY'S STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS: "This is of course yet another indicator that the housing market is in shambles and we are not out of the woods yet. There is a glut of supply on the market and more people want to sell than buy and that is driving prices down generally. A lot of people are seeing bargains, but are not ready to buy. Rates have fallen, but home prices continue to fall. People think they will fall more, so they are staying on the sidelines." "Eventually we will get to a bottom and these people will kick themselves that they did not buy. At the very least, new home sales should continue to fall for the next few months." STEVEN A. WOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSIGHT ECONOMICS, DANVILLE, CALIFORNIA: "New home sales peaked in July 2005 and have fallen persistently ever since then. Although the actual inventory of unsold homes is falling, it is declining at a slower rate than sales, leaving a large overhang of unsold homes given the current sales rate. This combination of a substantial inventory overhang and mounting foreclosures is pressuring home prices lower. The new home market is a bad as it has ever been." DAN COOK, SENIOR MARKET ANALYST, IG MARKETS, CHICAGO "Because things have been so bad -- unemployment, home sales, you name it -- the market has not been reacting too much. Each economy is struggling so much right now. And even with bad data, the U.S. dollar is still a safe-haven play. If the U.S. were alone in this crisis, the euro would be trading two-to-one to the dollar. But this is a global crisis." BRIAN DOLAN, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "Details of new home sales report are bleak, as the annual rate of prices plunged 13.5 percent from a modest 2.0 percent the prior month. The month's supply, meanwhile, worsened to 13.3 from 12.2 and a new record high back to 1963. So despite the capitulation in pricing, this failed to entice enough buyers to bring down the massive inventory overhang. With a decline supply necessary to stabilize the market, it looks as if any bottom in housing will remain elusive for some time. Equities continue to shrug off the weak data as the government is willingness to throw money at the problem continues to support nominal returns to risk assets." THOMAS NYHEIM, VICE PRESIDENT AND PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT CHRISTIANA bANK & TRUST CO. IN gREENVILLE, DELAWARE. "It was quite poor, down 10 percent. If you're concentrating specifically on new home sales, January, December, the winter months are the worst. The best months are supposedly March, April, May because there's a lag time for new homes so I would tend to think it's already in the market."
