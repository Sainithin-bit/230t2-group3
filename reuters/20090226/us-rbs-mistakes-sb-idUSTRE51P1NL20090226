 LONDON  (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland on Thursday posted a 2008 loss of 24.1 billion pounds ($34 billion), a record for a British company. 

 The 282-year-old Edinburgh-based bank has been hit by a string of problems in the past year, mainly due to problems linked to past takeovers and losses in its investment bank. Here are key events in its fall from grace: CHARTER ONE, M&A: After widespread praise for the acquisition of NatWest in 1999, Chief Executive Fred Goodwin led a series of takeovers, including a $10.5 billion deal for U.S. bank Charter One in 2004. Goodwin was criticized for overpaying, prompting one analyst to accuse him of megalomania. RBS on Thursday took a goodwill impairment of 16.2 billion pounds, and said about a quarter of that was due to past U.S. deals, notably Charter One. About half of the goodwill reflected the collapse of ABN's valuation. ABN AMRO PURCHASE: RBS led a European consortium that also included Santander and Fortis to buy Dutch bank ABN AMRO for 70 billion euros in October 2007, outgunning Barclays to land the deal by paying a higher price mostly in cash. RBS paid about 10 billion pounds for its portion, mainly investment banking business. The consortium was criticized for not cutting its offer as the financial crisis began before the deal was sealed, and bank valuations have crashed since. INVESTMENT BANK BUILD-UP: RBS ramped up in investment banking over a number of years, and its global banking and markets arm delivered a 3.8 billion pound profit in 2006, 40 percent of the group total. But the financial crisis has highlighted the risk of the aggressive strategy, and RBS has written down billions on the value of structured credit and other assets. "RBS leveraged itself up too much in the good times," Chief Executive Stephen Hester said in January. The bank is expected to sell at least a quarter of the assets on its balance sheet, many in capital markets, but more losses are expected to feed through. CAPITAL CUSHION: RBS carried less capital than most banks, preferring to run a lean and efficient balance sheet. This included buying back shares and bumping up the dividend in 2006. It has since said its capital cushion was too thin. RIGHTS ISSUE: RBS in June raised 12 billion pounds in the biggest ever rights issue, to repair a balance sheet weakened by the ABN deal and writedowns. Investors subscribed to 95 percent of the shares at 200 pence each. GOVERNMENT RECAPITALISATION: Britain injected 20 billion pounds into RBS as part of a recapitalization of the sector in October following a confidence crisis after Lehman Brothers' collapse. It gave the state a 58 percent stake after existing shareholders largely shunned a rights issued priced at 65.5 pence per share. Goodwin resigned and was replaced by Hester. BRITAIN INCREASES STAKE: The government is swapping up to 5 billion pounds of preference shares for ordinary shares, potentially increasing its stake to 70 percent. It was part of a second phase aimed at kick-starting lending by banks to the broader economy. ASSET PROTECTION SCHEME: RBS is putting 325 billion pounds of assets into a UK scheme to cap its exposure to future losses. That could see the government's voting stake rise to 75 percent, and its economic stake in the bank rise to 95 percent, Hester said. (Compiled by Steve Slater)
