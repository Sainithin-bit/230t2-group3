 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. government officials said on Wednesday that there is no explicit limit on how much capital the Treasury Department will give to big banks that undergo regulatory stress tests. 

 The officials also said the government will not make public the results of the stress tests for U.S. banks with assets over $100 billion, but said they expect the banks will disclose the results themselves. The officials declined to say whether they expect the government will need more money beyond the remaining funds in the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program to fund the new capital assistance program. But they said the U.S. government stands ready to provide the necessary capital to the banking sector so it can be a contributor to the economy. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski )
