 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland on Thursday reported a loss of 24.1 billion pounds ($34.3 billion) for 2008, the biggest in UK corporate history. 

 Following are details of some of the biggest corporate losses in Britain, in descending order: * ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND -- RBS said the record deficit reflected a 16.2 billion pound writedown against acquisitions, including its takeover of parts of Dutch rival ABN Amro in 2007, plus a further 7.9 billion pounds in operating losses. The group was originally founded in 1727. * VODAFONE GROUP -- Mobile phone operator Vodafone announced a net loss of 21.8 billion pounds ($41 billion) on May 30, 2006, largely on the back of previously disclosed write-offs related to past acquisitions. -- Vodafone had also reported a 13.5 billion pound ($19.6 billion) pre-tax loss on May 28, 2002. * LLOYDS BANKING GROUP -- Part-nationalized Lloyds Banking Group said on February 13 its HBOS unit made a pretax loss of 8.5 billion pounds ($12.3 billion) for 2008, driven by 7 billion pounds in bad corporate loans and 4 billion pounds in asset writedowns. * CABLE & WIRELESS -- Telecoms group Cable & Wireless Plc said on June 4, 2003 it plunged to a record 6.5 billion-pound ($10.6 billion) annual loss. It also said it would cut 1,500 jobs, bail out of the U.S. and suspend its dividend for a year. * MARCONI -- The Telecom equipment maker reported a first-half pre-tax loss of 5.12 billion pounds ($7.4 billion) on November 13, 2001 as it slashed the value of assets it bought before its markets collapsed. * LLOYD'S -- The Lloyd's of London insurance market announced losses of a record 2.9 billion pounds in 1990. It made a 2.06 billion pounds loss in 1989 and 2.048 billion pounds loss in 1991. * INVENSYS -- British engineering firm Invensys ISYS.L announced on May 29, 2003 a bottom line loss of 1.44 billion pounds for the year to March 31. * BRITISH AEROSPACE -- British Aerospace Plc reported a record 1992 pre-tax loss of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.75 billion) on February 24, 1993. The company had axed 13,000 jobs in 1992 and agreed to put its regional aircraft business into a new joint venture with Taiwan. * QUEENS MOAT HOUSES -- The hotels group reported a 1.04 billion pound ($1.54 billion) pre-tax loss for the year to December 31, 1992. -- Queens Moat's losses were the biggest by a British company since British Aerospace set the record earlier in 1992 with a loss of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.8 billion). * ABBEY NATIONAL -- Mortgage lender Abbey National declared a pre-tax loss of 984 million pounds ($1.55 billion) for the year ending 2002.
