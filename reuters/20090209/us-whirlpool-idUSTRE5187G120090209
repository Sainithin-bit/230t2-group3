 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp ( WHR.N ) reported a 76 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit as sales crumbled in the global slowdown and the world's biggest appliance maker said earnings would also fall in 2009. 

 The company's shares turned positive in afternoon trading on Monday after falling 11 percent earlier in the day. Laura Champine, an analyst with Cowen & Co, said investors may be relieved after Whirlpool said during a conference call that its pension contribution would be funded at levels that allow it to pay its dividend. She also said results could improve as cost pressures ease. "As people look at commodity prices which ... at some point should be coming down and you look at demand in the United States at 1998 levels, its easy to see that you might have earnings power in 2010" beyond the levels forecast for this year, Champine said. The maker of Maytag and KitchenAid appliances said it was in talks with banks about renewing credit lines and added it had frozen salaries, reduced its contribution to 401(k) retirement plans and taken other steps to hold down costs. Fourth-quarter profit fell to $44 million, or 60 cents a diluted share, from $187 million, or $2.38 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted for one-time items including $43 million in asset sale gains, profit came to 44 cents a share, compared with 78 cents expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales fell 19 percent to $4.3 billion. "The results were brutal," said Mirko Mikelic, a senior portfolio manager with Fifth Third Asset Management. "This year will be a particularly stinging year." LOSS IN NORTH AMERICA In North America, sales fell 18 percent to $2.5 billion as industrywide shipments of appliances dropped about 10 percent. Whirlpool said it expected U.S. industry shipments, an important gauge of sales, to fall about 10 percent this year. The North American unit had an operating loss of $20 million, against a year-earlier profit of $175 million, hurt by the lower sales, product recall costs and higher material and oil expenses. Fourth-quarter sales fell 16 percent in Europe, 26 percent in Latin America and 10 percent in Asia. Whirlpool expected price increases and headcount reductions to help margins this year, even as the recession hammers sales. In October, the company said it would cut 5,000 jobs as it closes plants. The Benton Harbor, Michigan, manufacturer tapped into its $2.2 billion credit facility during the fourth quarter and said it had $247 million outstanding on that line at year's end. It added it was in full compliance with bank covenants. In recent weeks, major debt ratings agencies downgraded Whirlpool to a notch above speculative, or "junk," status, a move that could make raising funds through the credit markets more expensive. Whirlpool said it expected 2009 profit of $3 to $4 a share from continuing operations, down from $5.50 for 2008. Analysts have forecast $4.07 a share for this year. The company's shares closed up 74 cents, or 2.03 percent, at $37.13 on the New York Stock Exchange after trading as low as $32.15 earlier in the session. (Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Matthew Lewis )
