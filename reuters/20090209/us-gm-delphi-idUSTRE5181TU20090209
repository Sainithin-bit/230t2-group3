 NEW YORK/DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp is in talks to buy back parts of bankrupt auto supplier Delphi Corp, a source with direct knowledge of the talks said on Monday. 

 The discussions are part of GM's sweeping restructuring plan aimed at lining up additional federal support as it faces a February 17 deadline to prove to the U.S. government it can be made viable, the source told Reuters. GM, which was granted $13.4 billion of government loans in December, intends to submit the discussions with Delphi as part of its viability plan, said the source, who was not authorized to discuss the private talks. GM started talking with Delphi last month about buying back parts of the supplier, including some plants, the source said. GM spun off Delphi a decade ago. GM could not immediately be reached for comment but said last month it was in discussions with Delphi and Delphi's stockholders to resolve financial troubles at the bankrupt supplier as part of its own restructuring plan. Delphi spokesman Lindsey Williams said the company was in ongoing discussions with its creditors and GM in an effort to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He declined to comment on the specifics. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in 2005, has been a major financial drag on GM at a time when the U.S. automaker is struggling to survive a deep downturn in global auto demand. U.S. auto sales plunged 18 percent to 13.2 million vehicles in 2008, with the brunt of the declines felt in the last few months of the year with the nation mired in a recession. GM has taken more than $11 billion in charges for Delphi's reorganization. GM agreed when it spun Delphi off in 1999 to assume pension and health-care obligations for thousands of union workers should the supplier be unable to do so. Delphi has been trying to complete a revised reorganization plan since investors, led by Appaloosa Management, backed out of a $2.55 billion equity plan to support its re-emergence last April. The financial strains at parts suppliers have put a tighter squeeze on U.S. automakers, which themselves are struggling to restructure and cut costs. Analysts estimate that up to 90 percent of U.S. auto suppliers serve multiple customers, meaning that a shutdown at one key supplier carriers a risk of wider production disruptions across the industry. A trade group representing some 400 auto-parts suppliers is currently in discussions with the U.S. Treasury to secure emergency funding to avoid a wave of bankruptcies and a deeper crisis for cash-strapped automakers.
