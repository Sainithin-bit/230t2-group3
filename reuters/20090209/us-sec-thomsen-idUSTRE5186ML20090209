 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's top enforcement official, Linda Thomsen, plans to leave the agency and return to the private sector, the SEC said on Monday. 

 The SEC did not say exactly when Thomsen would leave or who would replace her. An SEC spokesman said she would stay for some time to ensure a smooth transition. The SEC's enforcement division has been harshly criticized by lawmakers for how the Bernard Madoff case was handled. (Reporting by  Karey Wutkowski ,  Rachelle Younglai ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
