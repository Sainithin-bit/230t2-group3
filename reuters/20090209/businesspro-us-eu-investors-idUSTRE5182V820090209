 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission said on Monday it was reviewing a set of rules that compensate investors unable to get their assets back, a situation faced by Europeans caught out by the $50 billion Madoff scandal. 

 The European Union executive said the investor compensation schemes rules aim to protect investors against the risk of losses if an investment firm is unable to repay money or return assets held on their behalf. Investors in Luxembourg, France and other EU states have been unable to recover assets caught up in an alleged fraud by Bernard Madoff that was uncovered in December. Market watchdogs in the 27-country bloc have already begun reviewing how separate EU rules on investment funds are applied in member states, particularly those relating to assets held by sub-custodians.
