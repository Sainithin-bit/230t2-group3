 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp ( SBUX.O ) said on Monday that Gerardo Lopez, president of global consumer products, is resigning for personal reasons on February 20. 

 The Seattle-based company said John Culver, senior vice president of Starbucks Coffee Asia Pacific, will succeed Lopez, who also oversees Starbucks' food and Seattle's Best Coffee businesses. The coffee chain said Lopez led global strategy to support Starbucks growth and expansion of its consumer products worldwide. The company's consumer product business includes Starbucks brand ice cream, canned coffee drinks popular in Japan and ready-to-drink Tazo tea drinks in the U.S. and Canada. Culver, 48, has been a Starbucks employee since 2002, and has held leadership roles in the company's foodservice and Starbucks Coffee International business units, the company said. Starbucks is closing nearly 1,000 stores globally as overbuilding and a global economic downturn batter results at the formerly fast-growing chain. As it works to turn around its business, Starbucks has had turnover in its top management. Howard Schultz returned as chief executive early last year and in November the company announced that the then chief financial officer, Pete Bocian, was leaving for computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ).
