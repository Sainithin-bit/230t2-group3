 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co, Japan's third-largest carmaker, on Monday forecast its first annual operating loss under the baton of Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn as a rapid downturn in the global car market and a strong yen take their toll. 

 Ghosn, known as a master cost-cutter, arrived from France's Renault SA in 1999 to help turn around Nissan, which was on the verge of collapse. Renault, which Ghosn also heads, has a 44 percent stake in Nissan. Below are the main points Nissan announced at a news conference on its third-quarter results.
