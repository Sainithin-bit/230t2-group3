 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.PANYX.N, operator of the New York Stock Exchange, reported a quarterly loss on Monday as it took a $1.59 billion charge to write down the value of its transatlantic merger, sending its shares sharply lower. 

 Excluding the goodwill charge and other one-time items, the company reported a 20 percent profit drop, missing Wall Street estimates, as rivals forced it to cut prices and currency changes further dented its business. The company's shares fell 9 percent after it announced the big charge -- a balance sheet adjustment meant to reflect last year's global market drop. NYSE Euronext was the biggest weighted decliner in the S&P index .GSPF of financial stocks. The charge "certainly involves a close examination of future cash flows, (but) in my view it tells us more about the psychology of current market conditions than it is an indicator of underlying growth prospects of our businesses," said Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer. The bourse, which has struggled to streamline a flurry of acquisitions, also said it would halt a share buyback program to preserve capital. However, it will maintain its quarterly dividend of 30 cents a share through 2009. "With these two actions, we are attempting to strike the right balance between capital management and shareholder value," the CEO told analysts and media on a conference call. Niederauer's predecessor, John Thain, steered the NYSE's takeover of European exchange group Euronext in 2007. Niederauer took the reins at NYSE Euronext in December 2007 after the $14 billion deal was complete. For the fourth quarter, NYSE Euronext posted a loss of $1.34 billion, or $5.06 per share, due to the charge, which the company said would have no impact on day-to-day operations. Excluding one-time items, it earned $137 million, or 52 cents per share, down from $173 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue grew 21 percent to $1.18 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates expected, on average, a profit of 56 cents per share before one-time items on revenue of $1.33 billion. Analysts dropped their earnings estimates substantially in last couple weeks. "Overall, results were disappointing, but the company averted a probably 'most negative' outcome -- a widely-feared dividend cut," Edward Ditmire, analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton, wrote in a note to clients. CURRENCY IMPACT A recent decline in the euro and British pound helped to shave $55 million from the New York-based company's European trading revenues, which are billed in local currencies. NYSE Euronext said currency fluctuations reduced earnings by 7 cents a share, while planned investments and operating losses at its NYSE Amex U.S. equity unit cost it 6 cents a share. Revenues were hurt by price cuts amid a frantic battle with rivals over market share. In November, the company announced a new pricing model, the Designated Market Maker, aimed at attracting liquidity. The model was adjusted last week after it led to negative spreads at the stock exchange operator. The adjustment takes effect March 1. "While they are helping to stem some of their market losses, it's coming at a cost to them," said Patrick O'Shaughnessy, analyst at Raymond James and Associates. He also said halting the share buyback program "shows that perhaps they have a relatively pessimistic outlook for 2009, and they're going to play a little more safe with their cash." Looking ahead, NYSE Euronext said a slew of new initiatives -- including derivatives, options and the clearing of credit default swaps -- should boost revenue by $250 million to $325 million in 2009. It also sees a decline in expenses of $80 million to $100 million from 2008's $1.74 billion. The company benefited from higher trading volumes in the fourth quarter, which included the steepest phase of the recent stock selloff. Volatile markets mean higher trading volumes, which generate fees for exchanges. Revenue derived from cash trading jumped 43 percent from a year earlier. NYSE Euronext said it expects "continued volatility" and "challenging market conditions" in 2009. Separately, the company said trading volumes in January were down 8.3 percent in the United States and down almost 30 percent in Europe as activity from financial institutions and individual traders lessened. NYSE Euronext shares were down $2.06 to $20.84 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They fell 68 percent in 2008. (Editing by Sharon Lindores and John Wallace)
