 (Reuters) - Abby Frucht's parents lost their $1 million in life's savings with the collapse of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC. Her parents lived off the money in a retirement home in Sante Fe, New Mexico. Reuters spoke with Frucht. Below are excerpts from the interview. 

 My dad is 85 and my mom is 79. We don't know how long they can stay there. We're working that out now. We're waiting to see what happens with SIPC (the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which maintains a reserve fund authorized by Congress to help investors at failed brokerage firms). It's remotely possible that we will get some money back and we will keep them in their assisted living facility for as long as we possibly can. My sisters and I have power of attorney over them so we have been putting our heads together to try and find a way to keep our parents comfortable. They have a couple of months where they have some cash in a checking account. But that's not very much money. We're sort of doing two things at once. We're looking at what our options might be to try and keep them where they are. But we are also waiting with our fingers crossed for some word from the SIPC. They are very elderly they can't possibly go back to work. They are very comfortable and happy where they are. They both have health issues. And they've made friends there. That's where they have live for about 15 years. It may have been longer than that. They retired there. My dad was a doctor on Long Island before he retired. A friend of his introduced him to Madoff. Unfortunately, it went on from there. The reason it's so surreal is that my parents have been using this money to support themselves and not living high off the hog. They have had a serene and comfortable retirement. And they have also managed to take care of the family. I have two sisters and their four grandchildren. They would take everyone on little trips now and then. We went to California six years ago. We had nice dinners and a lot of fun. Looking back on that kind of thing, it's surreal to imagine that money that we were using to fund those trips was basically monopoly money. In a way I feel fortunate that this happened now rather than 10 or 15 years ago when my parents were still useful, and they would have really suffered the loss of their money. Right now, they live a very sedate life. Basically my mom reads the paper all day and my dad is in the early stages of Alzheimer's. It's difficult to know even how much he realizes what's happening and that's a blessing. I think he would be really hurt by it. He was very proud at the fact that he had managed to save up some money and look after himself and my mom so well and help out with our kids when we needed it, which wasn't that often. But there were times when he did -- for education expenses, medical expenses, things like that. So I think it's a good thing he's at the stage he's in now rather than having him be at the stage he was six years ago when he really would have been much more devastated by the news than he is now. But what hurts too is that he was a really good man, my dad. He did everything that he felt he was supposed to do to provide for his family in a respectable way. And he trusted Bernard Madoff. To think that all those years back he was being lied to. Not only lied to, but robbed. And not only robbed, being inadvertently forced to participate in an illegal activity, which my dad never ever would have either imagined or condoned. It's been a fairly harrowing experience for me and my sisters.
