 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's defense ministry said on Tuesday it would pay 8.9 billion yen ($114 million) for each of Lockheed Martin's ( LMT.N ) F-35 jet fighters in the initial stage of procurement. 
 The per-unit cost will come to 9.9 billion yen if backup parts are included, the ministry said. The ministry plans to buy 42 of the radar-evading jets. (Reporting by  Kiyoshi Takenaka ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
