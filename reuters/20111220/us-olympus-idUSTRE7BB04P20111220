 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors are set to raid the offices of Olympus Corp ( 7733.T ) as well as homes of its former executives later on Wednesday in connection with a huge accounting scandal that has threatened the existence of the 92-year-old maker of cameras and medical equipment, domestic media reported. 
 Tokyo prosecutors, police and the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission will join in a joint probe of the 13-year, $1.7 billion scheme to hide investment losses stretching back two decades, media said. (Reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
