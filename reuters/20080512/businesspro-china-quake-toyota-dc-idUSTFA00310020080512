 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) on Monday 
suspended production at a 13,000 units-a-year joint-venture 
factory in Chengdu, southwestern China, after a powerful 
earthquake struck, killing at least 107 people. 

  A spokeswoman in Tokyo said operations at the factory, held 
jointly with China's FAW Group, would be halted at least for 
the first shift on Tuesday, from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., for 
inspection.  It will decide when to resume operations after inspecting 
any damages at the factory, which builds the Prado SUV and 
Coaster microbus, she said.  None of its employees working at the time was hurt, she 
added.  (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
