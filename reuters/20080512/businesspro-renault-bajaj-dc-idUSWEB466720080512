 PARIS  (Reuters) - Renault-Nissan and Indian carmaker Bajaj 
Auto said on Monday they would form a joint venture company to 
develop a low-cost car model with a wholesale price range 
starting from $2,500. 

  The new joint-venture company will be 50 percent owned by 
Bajaj Auto, 25 percent by French group Renault and 25 percent 
by Japanese automaker Nissan.  The new car has been code-named ULC and it will target the 
growing Indian vehicle market.  Initial planned capacity will be 400,000 units per year. 
Sales will start in early 2011 in India, as a primary market, 
with growth potential in other emerging markets around the 
world.  (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta ; Editing by Rory Channing)
