 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) said on Monday that it received a notice from federal regulators indicating that one of its units may face an enforcement action related to "the bidding of various financial instruments associated with municipal securities." 

 Last month, Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, which JPMorgan is buying, also got a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating possible civil charges, stemming from anti-competitive activity relating to bidding for municipal securities. It was unclear whether there was any relationship between the two investigations. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
