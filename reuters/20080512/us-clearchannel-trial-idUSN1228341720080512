 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The banks that had been trying to pull out of the funding for the $20 billion buyout of Clear Channel Communications ( CCU.N ) have reached a settlement with the private equity firms that had sued them, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 

 Under the terms of the deal, the banks will fund a takeover at a price of $36 a share, the newspaper said in its Web site. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb )
