 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday the U.S. central bank would move to normal monetary policy depending on the health of the economy, independent of the fiscal situation. 

 Responding to questions at the Economic Club of New York Bernanke said the country's high twin deficits could not be maintained and there was a need to find a sustainable fiscal route. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke ; Writing by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
