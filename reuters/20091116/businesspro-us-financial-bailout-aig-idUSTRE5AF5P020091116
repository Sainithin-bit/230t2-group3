 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York used a weak negotiating strategy to try to wring concessions from AIG counterparties last year, costing U.S. taxpayers potentially billions of dollars, according to a government watchdog's audit report released on Monday. 

 The report from the Trouble Asset Relief Program's Special Inspector General Neil Barofsky said the New York Fed and the Federal Reserve Board refused "to use their considerable leverage" in negotiating haircuts on assets underlying AIG ( AIG.N ) obligations.
