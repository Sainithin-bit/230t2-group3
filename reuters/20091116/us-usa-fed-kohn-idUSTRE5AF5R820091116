 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's low interest rate policy was meant to encourage investors to move into riskier assets and there are no signs currently that an asset bubble is building in the United States, the central bank's number-two official said on Monday. 

 Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn said the recent rise in asset prices reflects several factors: the reversal of the "extreme panicky conditions" of late 2008, the turnaround in economic prospects, and ultra-low interest rate policies in the United States and other key economies. "One of the purposes of these policies is to induce investors to shift into riskier and longer-term assets in order to lower the cost and increase the availability of capital to households and businesses," Kohn said at an event co-sponsored by the Kellogg School and Northwestern University in Chicago. The resulting easier credit is designed to encourage spending during a period when output is expected to remain well below economy's capacity for a prolonged period, he said. The Fed lowered the overnight federal funds rate to near zero percent last December and has kept it there since. After its last policy meeting in November, the U.S. central bank reiterated its expectation that rates could be kept unusually low for "an extended period." Kohn said it is difficult for policy makers to spot asset price bubbles, but said prices in U.S. financial markets "do not appear to be clearly out of line with the outlook for the economy and business prospects, as well as the level of risk-free interest rates." Kohn said that current circumstances illustrate the complications of using monetary policy as ammunition against a potential bubble. "Tightening financial conditions at a time when an economic recovery has just begun, when labor markets are continuing to weaken, when inflation is below its optimal level for the longer run, and when significant strains persist in the financial system would incur a considerable short-run cost in order to achieve possible long-run benefits whose extent is, at best, quite uncertain," he said. That said, the Fed needs to "be alert to any tendencies for movements in prices for commodities and assets to result in a sustained increase in inflation and inflation expectations," he said. Kohn, like Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, said monetary policy was a blunt tool for tackling asset bubbles. Given "the side effects of using policy for this purpose, and other difficulties, such circumstances are likely to be very rare. I continue to believe that the best approach is to promoting financial stability is to strengthen supervision and regulation," Kohn said. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
