 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Regulatory reform has to address the too-big-to-fail issue and it must be possible for financial firms to fail without dragging the broader system with them, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday 

 Responding to questions after addressing the Economic Club of New York Bernanke said systemically important banks should be closely supervised and there should be an alternative to government bailouts. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke ; Writing by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
