 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N forecast 2008 earnings on Thursday that fell short of most Wall Street estimates, due in part to its expectation raw material prices such as corn and aluminum will keep rising. 

 The news from Pepsi Bottling, whose shares were down nearly 3 percent, comes a day after rival soft drink bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc ( CCE.N ) issued a forecast implying 2008 earnings would exceed Wall Street expectations. "(Pepsi Bottling's) '08 guidance is a negative as it implies a slower operating profit and earnings per share growth rate than we and the market had anticipated, driven by cost pressures and inability to fully recoup via increased revenue per case due to tough competitive environment," wrote Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello in a research note. Pepsi Bottling expects 2008 earnings of $2.30 to $2.38 per share, excluding charges related to realigning its business and disposing of some of its full-service vending machines. Excluding items, analysts on average are expecting $2.40 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. On a net basis, the largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ) drinks said earnings would range from $2.21 to $2.36 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.33 per share. "We think our guidance next year is, on most indicators, right in line with long-term guidance. I think we see some continued challenges on the commodity front, but overall we think the future is very promising and we are very confident in our ability to deliver against the guidance," Chief Executive Eric Foss said in an interview. The Pepsi bottler said cost of goods sold per case should rise 5 percent to 6 percent next year, as costs for raw materials such as aluminum and plastic -- used in packaging -- and corn for sweetener continue to increase. DELIVERING ON TARGETS Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg called the company's forecast "a likely outcome" and noted the stock experienced a recent run-up in short interest, meaning many investors were already expecting bad news. Short-sellers borrow shares and sell them, betting the price will fall. They then buy them back at a lower price to repay the debt and pocket the difference. "In our opinion, management is effectively saying, 'We'll keep delivering on our targets and let you know early if we see a big departure from doing so'," Swartzberg wrote in a research note. "The company has a history of starting the year a bit below the sell-side consensus and meeting or beating its initial view as the year progresses. We think '08 is likely to be no exception." Pepsi Bottling, which bottles and distributes drinks such as Pepsi-Cola, Lipton tea, Aquafina water and Gatorade in North America and parts of Europe, also said on Thursday it expects 2007 adjusted earnings per share of $2.17 to $2.20, up from its prior range of $2.15 to $2.18. Pepsi Bottling will record a fourth-quarter charge of 5 cents to 8 cents per share related to the vending equipment and plans to take additional charges related to it in 2008. Through 2010, the bottler expects revenue growth of about 6 percent, operating profit growth of 5 percent to 7 percent and earnings per share growth in the high-single-digit percentage range. The shares of Pepsi Bottling, based in Somers, New York, were down $1.12, or 2.8 percent, at $39.54 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
