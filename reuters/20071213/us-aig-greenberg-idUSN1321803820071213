 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York State Insurance Department would be "happy" to meet with former American International Group ( AIG.N ) Chief Executive Hank Greenberg to discuss his plans for the world's largest insurer, a spokesman for the regulator said on Thursday. 

 The insurance department, the most powerful in the United States, had expressed concern late on Wednesday that a group led by Greenberg and others might be violating state laws concerning entities seeking to control insurance companies. AIG shares were down nearly 4 percent in afternoon trading. Greenberg had said on November 2 that he was considering strategic alternatives for the company. AIG later said those "code words set off a frenzy of market and media speculation" that the ousted executive wanted to see the company broken up or acquired. "The insurance department announcement "puts at least a large detour into what Greenberg was trying to achieve, and this market does not have patience for detours," said Celent LLC analyst Donald Light. Greenberg had no further comment, according to his spokesman, Ken Frydman. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Wednesday, a lawyer for Greenberg disagreed with the insurance department's determination that Greenberg might be violating state laws, and asked for a new meeting to discuss the matter. The filing contained a Friday letter from New York Insurance Department First Deputy Superintendent Kermitt Brooks. Brooks told lawyers for Greenberg that a group of Greenberg-controlled entities collectively owns more than 10 percent of AIG. That, he wrote, makes the Greenberg group a "controlling person" under New York insurance law, which must seek permission from the state's insurance superintendent to "possess control" of the company. If the group does not seek permission, it must "cease and desist immediately from engaging in any further activities aimed at exercising a controlling influence over AIG," the letter said. While no individual member of the Greenberg group owns more than 10 percent of AIG shares, these entities are acting in concert, and therefore are viewed as a "person" in "control" under New York law, Brooks wrote. 'ERRONEOUS VIEW' Beside Greenberg himself, the investor group agitating for change at AIG includes investment vehicles under his control -- Starr International Co, C.V. Starr & Co and his family foundation -- and Edward Matthews, a former AIG executive. This group held 12 percent of AIG shares as of Oct 31. AIG spokesman Chris Winans declined to comment. Greenberg lawyer Marcia Alazraki of Manatt Phelps Phillips, in a Dec 12 letter also contained in the filing, responded that the insurance department's conclusion was "based on the department's erroneous view" that the group constitutes a controlling person. None of the Greenberg group members has the power to direct the management or policies of AIG, she argued. Alazraki had asked Brooks for another meeting to discuss the matter. Greenberg, an octogenarian businessman who built AIG into the world's largest insurer, was ousted by AIG's board in 2005 during an investigation into fraud by then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. In his November 2 filing, Greenberg said he anticipated holding discussions with other shareholders and third parties that would boost AIG's stock price. AIG shares were down $2.16, or 3.7 percent, at $56.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins  and  Joseph Giannone ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
