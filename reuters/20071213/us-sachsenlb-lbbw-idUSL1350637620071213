 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The German state and public banks clubbed together for the second time in five months to save subprime-stricken SachsenLB from collapse, heading off a fresh blow to confidence in the country's financial system. 

 SachsenLB is one of Germany's highest-profile casualties in the crisis triggered by defaults on subprime U.S. mortgages. A rescue deal to sell the bank to Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg (LBBW) was first struck in August but rising losses threw those negotiations into disarray. Now the state of Saxony, which partly owns LBBW has hammered out a deal with other regional lenders to pay for SachsenLB's dud investments in subprime mortgages. The result of the last-minute talks, overseen by German financial watchdog Bafin and the Bundesbank central bank, was announced by Saxony's government on Thursday. Sources told Reuters the trio rescuing SachsenLB have agreed to divide up responsibility for 17.5 billion euros ($25.7 billion) of the bank's investments in subprime and related debt. These investments -- part of SachsenLB's programmes which had a value of about 43 billion euros -- could throw up billions of euros in losses. LBBW said that this 17.5 billion euros of investments in structured products would go into a new off-balance sheet vehicle. A further 11 billion euros would stay with SachsenLB. CLEANING UP The lion's share of this risk will now be taken by LBBW and other state regional lenders known as landesbanks. These landesbanks -- partly owned by local government and community savings banks -- would have been obliged under an industry guarantee scheme to step in to clean up the mess had SachsenLB collapsed. A meltdown in U.S. subprime mortgages has set in train a global credit crisis, forcing banks to sift through their portfolios of complex mortage-backed securities where value has been wiped out by rising defaults on risky U.S. home loans. Global banks including UBS, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch have been among the biggest casualties, totting up billions of dollars in charges. Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has taken an especially hard beating. Two of its banks nearly collapsed under the subprime strain. The other was IKB IKBG.DE, a formerly little-known small-business lender which has become a byword in Germany for the subprime crisis. Earlier in the week, the owners of battered German landesbank WestLB WDLG.UL emerged from crisis talks saying that they would be happy to sell a stake in their subprime-hit bank but would also enter merger negotiations with neighboring rival Helaba HDLG.UL. The finance minister of North-Rhine Westphalia state said on Thursday those talks should start soon and could create the nucleus for further consolidation of landesbanks.
