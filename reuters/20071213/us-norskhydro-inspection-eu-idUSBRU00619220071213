 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Commission confirmed on Thursday it had raided SPVC manufacturing plants in Britain in connection with the planned sale of the unit by Norwegian aluminum producer Norsk Hydro ( NHY.OL ). 

 "The European Commission can confirm that it undertook an unannounced inspection in the UK," said Jonathan Todd, spokesman for the European Union's competition regulator. The Commission raided two SPVC manufacturers on December 11, looking into whether "a merger had been implemented before approval by the Commission," Todd said.kl He said that Article 7 of the merger regulation prohibits merger from being implemented before they receive approval. The Commission is due to complete its review of the planned purchase by British chemicals group Ineos INEO.UL by February 18. "The inquiry is also aimed at establishing whether there may have been an exchange of information between the companies in possible breach of EC treaty rules outlawing cartels and restricted business practices," Todd said. The proposed transaction had raised competition concerns given the strong market position that Ineos would achieve on the suspension PVC market in some countries, particularly Britain. The price of the planned transaction was $1.01 billion, including debt as of December 31, 2006, subject to adjustments until the close of the transaction. Norsk Hydro said earlier it was unaware of any irregularities related to the planned transaction and is assisting the European Commission with its inspection. It said it expects the planned transaction with Ineos to be completed in the first quarter of 2008, in line with previous announcements. (Reporting by  David Lawsky )
