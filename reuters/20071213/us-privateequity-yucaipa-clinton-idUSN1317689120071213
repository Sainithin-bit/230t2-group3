 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Former president Bill Clinton may reduce his business relationship with Ron Burkle's Yucaipa private investment firm if his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, wins the Democratic nomination for president, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday. 

 Clinton has been a senior adviser to Yucaipa over the last five years, but he could curtail his work there as part of an effort to reduce possible conflict of interest controversies that could hurt his wife's presidential bid, the Journal said. Yucaipa is the investment vehicle of Burkle, who amassed a fortune through deals in the supermarket business, including Kroger Co.'s $13 billion takeover of Fred Meyer Inc. in 1999, creating the largest U.S. supermarket chain. Burkle is a friend and financial backer of the former U.S. president. Clinton served as an advisor to funds including the Yucaipa American Fund and the Yucaipa Corporate Initiative Fund, and worked with the firm on developing investments in urban and rural areas that are considered emerging markets of the United States.
