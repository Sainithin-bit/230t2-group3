 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investor delight at a concerted central bank effort to relieve jammed money markets fizzled out on Thursday with experts saying the credit crisis would only end when commercial banks trusted each other again. 

 Interbank lending rates eased only a little from sky-high levels in response, although they edged down for the first time in over a month. The Federal Reserve and counterparts in Europe, Canada and Britain banded together on Wednesday to cough up funds to boost liquidity in their first coordinated action since terror attacks shut U.S. financial markets on September 11, 2001. The Fed said it would launch a "temporary term auction facility", expanding the number of banks allowed to borrow money at favorable rates. The deal, hammered out in Cape Town at a meeting of the Group of 20 last month, also catered for affected foreign investors -- the Fed will open foreign exchange swaps for up to $20 billion with the European Central Bank and up to $4 billion with the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Welcome but not enough, was the broad verdict. Even the SNB said central banks alone could not solve the crisis, as it kept interest rates on hold. "As long as uncertainty with respect to the scope of the credit problems exists the disruptions on the money market are likely to persist," the SNB's Thomas Jordan said. "Central banks cannot compensate for this lack of confidence simply by injecting additional liquidity. On the contrary, the financial market participants themselves must take the fundamental steps needed to restore this confidence." New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy Geithner told a conference the plan would reduce risks that liquidity problems would hurt the broader economy but said the conditions that prompted the credit crisis would take time to resolve. Three-month euro Libor edged down to 4.94938 percent from 4.95250 percent, while one-month euro rates shed just one basis point from Wednesday's level, which was the highest since December 2000. "Going forward, the measures will ease some of the recent tensions but are unlikely to result in a major improvement in liquidity unless financial counterparts begin to trust each other," Calyon strategists said in a note to clients. "This will require transparency and a clear assessment of the extent of credit losses held by such institutions. This could be a long way off, implying that central banks will have to remain active participants for some months yet." U.S. subprime mortgages -- lent to people ill-equipped to pay them back -- were bundled up into complex financial products and sold on around the globe. Uncertainty about where the exposure lies remains intense, causing interbank lending to wither. BANKS STILL SUFFERING There is no sign yet of an end to damage to bank balance sheets despite colossal write-offs in America and Europe. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N said on Thursday that quarterly earnings fell 11 percent, hurt by writedowns in bond trading, although results beat analysts' average expectations. Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N, the largest U.S. home loan lender, said mortgage loan funding tumbled 40 percent to $23 billion in November, sending its shares tumbling. On Wednesday, Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and Wachovia Corp WB.N warned of further write-downs for the fourth quarter. HBOS Plc, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, said it would take a 180 million pound ($367.7 million) hit and expected market turmoil to continue in the short-term. HBOS, which is also Britain's fourth biggest bank, insisted however that 2007 underlying earnings were on track to meet analysts' forecasts. German state politicians and banking officials hammered out a late-night deal to secure the rescue of troubled state-backed lender SachsenLB, they said on Thursday, allowing for its complete takeover by state-backed peer LBBW. SachsenLB ran into financial difficulty in the wake of global credit market troubles because of its investment programmes using complicated financial products. Questions have also been posed about a planned "superfund" to bail troubled investment vehicles tied to the U.S. subprime mortgage market. The Wall Street Journal reported that some banks which were expected to contribute to the fund to bail out securitized investment vehicles (SIVs) were losing interest as they doubt its ability to provide a solution to the credit crunch. Japanese banks are belatedly being approached to lend a hand, the newspaper said.
