 LONDON  (Reuters) - Reuters Group Plc RTR.L and Thomson Corp TOC.TO are "increasingly optimistic" that regulatory reviews into Thomson's proposed acquisition of the British group will be completed in the first quarter of 2008. 

 "Ongoing discussions with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have made both companies increasingly optimistic of completing regulatory reviews within the timeframe previously described," Reuters said in a statement on Thursday. Reuters also said it would resume its share buyback program with immediate effect. The two companies temporarily suspended their respective buyback programs when they announced the 8.3 billion pound ($17 billion) deal in May. Reuters shares were trading at 595 pence at 0522 EST, a discount of around 9 percent to the value of Thomson's cash and share offer, based on Thomson's closing price on Wednesday. Thomson TOC.N said on November 23 it would resume its share repurchase program and Reuters has decided to do the same, entering into an irrevocable arrangement with its brokers Citigroup and JP Morgan Cazenove to repurchase up to 50 million ordinary shares in Reuters. The buyback program will start on Thursday and end when all regulatory pre-conditions for the proposed transaction have been satisfied or waived. The European Commission is investigating the proposed takeover of Reuters and has until February 25 to decide whether the deal would significantly impede competition. The Department of Justice in the United States is expected to make its decision by mid January. (Reporting by  Kate Holton ; editing by  Alexander Smith )
