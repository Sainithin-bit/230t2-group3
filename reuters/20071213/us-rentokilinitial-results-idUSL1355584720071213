 LONDON  (Reuters) - British services group Rentokil Initial Plc issued a warning on Thursday that weak retail trading would hit its quarterly profit, sending its shares down 14 percent to seven-year lows. 

 It said business to business operations at its express parcels delivery business City Link had been significantly ahead of last year, but the business to consumer segment had slipped due to weaker consumer spending. "As a result, fourth quarter profits from City Link are likely to be up to 10 million pounds ($20.4 million) below our expectations. This will have a similar impact on the results for the group as a whole," it said in a statement. The warning came just one month after it said that City Link had continued its strong performance with 140 percent growth in revenue, buoyed by robust business to business operation and acquisition of Target Express in late 2006. City Link derives around 70 percent of its annual revenues from the business to business market and the remaining from the business to consumer segment. At 0325 EST, shares in Rentokil, whose businesses range from rat catching to tropical plant hire, dropped 14 percent to 126-2/5 pence to seven-year lows, as analysts' downgrades followed. "The company has today unexpectedly announced that profits in parcels division will be ... below expectations and this is not good news and the shares are expected to react negatively," Seymour analyst Kevin Lapwood said, reducing its ratings to "hold". Cazenove analysts also cut their 2007 earnings per share estimates for Rentokil by 2 percent to 9.9 pence and pretax profit forecast to 215 million pounds from 225 million. In November, Rentokil had said its forecast for 2007 underlying profit would be broadly in line with last year's 209 million pounds, and for 2008 underlying profit to grow by a mid-to-high single digit percentage. Rentokil, which will report its preliminary results on February 26, said on Thursday trading in other divisions remained in line with its expectations. Before the trading update, analysts had expected Rentokil to report 221 million pounds in pretax profit for the year. (Reporting by Miyoung Kim; Editing by Paul Bolding)
