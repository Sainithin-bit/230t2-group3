 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - First-time claims for U.S. unemployment benefits eased by a slightly more-than-expected 7,000 last week, a Labor Department report showed on Thursday. 

 New applications for state unemployment insurance benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 333,000 in the week ended December 8 from an upwardly revised 340,000 the week before. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting claims to ease to 335,000 from the previously reported 338,000. The four-week moving average of new claims, which smoothes out week-to-week fluctuations, fell slightly to 338,750 from a revised 340,750 the prior week. The number of people continuing to receive jobless benefits after an initial week of aid rose to 2.64 million in the week ended December 1, the most recent week for which statistics are available. Analysts had forecast claims would hold steady at 2.60 million. The four-week moving average of continued claims rose to 2.61 million, the highest level since the week ended January 7, 2006.
