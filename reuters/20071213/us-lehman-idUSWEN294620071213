 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N said on Thursday fourth-quarter earnings fell 12 percent, as the credit market crisis triggered write-downs, and the company said further write-downs were possible. 

 Lehman beat analysts' expectations, but the results were a reminder that a number of U.S. investment banks could take write-downs in the fourth-quarter as the value of mortgages and other securities declines and debt-trading volumes remain low. "I don't think anybody can think we've seen the last of the write-downs here," said Adam Compton, co-head of global financials research at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco. Lehman shares fell 2.8 percent amid broad declines in financial stocks. Lehman recorded an $830 million net writedown during the quarter, and was cautious about the market environment. Before hedges and other items, the total write down was $3.5 billion. "We're trying not to be too optimistic ... that this is the bottom," Lehman Chief Financial Officer Erin Callan said on a conference call, adding that asset price declines could continue for several more quarters. Last quarter, then-CFO Chris O'Meara said: "I think the worst of this credit correction is behind us." Lehman, the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank, said fiscal fourth-quarter earnings were $886 million, or $1.54 a share for the quarter ended November 30. That was down from $1.004 billion, or $1.72, in the same quarter last year. Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of $1.42 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Results were helped by several items, including gains of $500 million from private equity investments and increases in the value of its stake in hedge fund manager GLG Partners. The company also had $320 million of gains from the weakening of bonds Lehman issued. Gains from GLG helped lift equities trading revenue to $1.87 billion from $900 million last year. Equities trading revenue was more than double bond trading revenue in the fourth quarter. Bond trading revenue fell 60 percent to $860 million. Lehman, traditionally regarded as a bond house, has been making significant investments in recent years in merger advisory, stock underwriting and equity trading. The investment bank has also tried to generate more business internationally. A record 62 percent of revenues for the fourth quarter came from outside the United States. Lehman's revenue fell 3 percent to $4.39 billion. Lehman shares were down 1.65 percent, or $1.02, at $60.80 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N shares fell 4.09 percent, or $4.12, to $96.72, while Goldman Sachs Group ( GS.N ) shares were down 3.26 percent, or $6.92, at $205.66. MORE TO COME Lehman's $830 million of write-downs were mainly in its real estate businesses and repackaged debt known as asset-backed securities. Declines in asset values are not a positive, but Lehman's write-downs are much lower than many Wall Street competitors. Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N, for example, recorded $8.4 billion of write-downs in the third quarter, which cost then-chief executive Stanley O'Neal his job. Lehman CEO Richard Fuld, meanwhile, was awarded about $35 million of stock for 2007. Wall Street firms are broadly bracing for write-downs amid weakening mortgage and credit markets. Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) CEO Ken Lewis said on Wednesday that fourth-quarter results would be disappointing due to write-downs and lower trading revenue. Wachovia Corp WB.N CEO Ken Thompson said the bank was likely to set aside $1 billion for loan losses. Next week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley, ( MS.N ), Bear Stearns Cos Inc are due to report fiscal fourth quarter results. Lehman's shares have fallen about 20 percent this year, underperforming the Amex Securities Broker Dealer index, .XBD which has fallen about 13 percent, but outperforming competitors including Merrill Lynch.
