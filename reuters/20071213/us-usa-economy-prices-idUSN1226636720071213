 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Producer prices surged 3.2 percent in November, the biggest rise in 34 years, on a record rise in gasoline prices, the Labor Department said on Thursday. 

 Excluding food and energy prices, the producer price index rose an unexpectedly large 0.4 percent, the heftiest gain since February, the report showed. When cars and light trucks also were stripped out, core producer prices rose 0.1 percent. The rise in prices paid at the farm and factory gate was the largest since August 1973 and was well ahead of analysts' expectations of a 1.5 percent gain. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast core prices to rise 0.2 percent. The 7.2 percent increase in producer prices from November 2006 was the largest 12-month gain since November 1981. Gasoline prices rose 34.8 percent in the month, eclipsing the previous record gain of 28.8 percent in April 1999. Prices for all energy goods also rose by a record 14.1 percent, surpassing the previous high of 13.4 percent recorded in January 1990. Prices for crude goods - products entering the market for the first time - rose 8.7 percent, the sharpest gain since February. At the same time, prices for intermediate goods, which have been processed but require finishing before being sold, climbed 3.7 percent, the steepest jump since August 1974. Stock futures fell on the report, which suggested a pickup in inflation that could weigh against any future interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Treasury debt prices fell. "Excluding food and energy prices, we are still seeing intensifying inflationary pressures," said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.
