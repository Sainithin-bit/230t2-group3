 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) on Thursday forecast 2008 profit growth of 16 percent to 21 percent, broadly above Wall Street estimates, with strength in its aerospace business and continued growth in emerging markets offsetting a slowing U.S. economy. 

 The diversified manufacturer described the outlook, which called for stronger growth than other blue-chip conglomerates have forecast this week, achievable even in the face of a slowing economy. Its shares rose 3.6 percent. Honeywell said it expected 2008 profit of $3.65 to $3.80 per share. That's largely ahead of the analysts' average forecast of $3.67, according to Reuters Estimates. "Overall, we're planning for a softening global economy, and we expect some spillover of the weakening in the U.S. residential and credit markets," Chief Financial Officer David Anderson told investors on a conference call. "But on the other hand, we expect that to be offset by the relative strength that we're experiencing in emerging regions." Anderson said Honeywell expected energy prices to remain high, although the slowing world economy would lead to more stable pricing for other commodities. Honeywell reiterated its 2007 earnings outlook of $3.14 to $3.16 per share, in line with the analysts' average estimate of  $3.16. The world's largest maker of cockpit electronics said it expected revenue to rise 5 percent to 7 percent in 2008, to a range of $36.1 billion to $36.7 billion. Analysts were expecting $36.26 billion, on average. MARGINS SEEN UP Honeywell said segment profit margins would rise to 14 percent to 14.3 percent of sales next year, up from an expected 13.5 percent of sales in 2007. It forecast margin improvement at each of its four units, with the strongest coming at its aerospace operation. "The revenues are doing well, we expect that to continue because of the end markets that they're positioned towards, but the main thrust of the story is margin expansion that they can do in a slower economic environment," said Tom Leritz, portfolio manger at Argent Capital Management, which oversees $1 billion in assets and counts Honeywell among its holdings. He said the margin improvement would be vital to Honeywell meeting its profit target in a slowing economy. The 21 percent high end of Honeywell profit growth forecast is about double what some of its fellow blue-chip conglomerates are expecting. Earlier in the week, General Electric Co ( GE.N ) said it expected 2008 profit to rise at least 10 percent, and 3M Co ( MMM.N ) forecast a double-digit earnings increase. United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ), which plans to provide details on its 2008 outlook late Thursday, has said it is looking for 10 to 14 percent profit growth next year. Anderson acknowledged that the economic outlook is uncertain. "This is the greatest period of uncertainty that Dave (Cote, Honeywell's chief executive) and I have faced in our recent memories and as a result, we've taken a cautious and conservative approach," Anderson said. "Within a reasonable range of global economic conditions, we're highly confident in our ability to execute and deliver this plan." Morris Township, New Jersey-based Honeywell has benefited from strong demand for aircraft components amid a commercial aerospace boom over the past three years. It also makes thermostats, security systems and other products to help manage large buildings. Sales of those products have climbed as fast-growing China and India spend heavily on development. Honeywell shares were up $2.07 at $59.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier, they had traded as high as $60.58. Honeywell shares are up 32 percent year to date, outpacing gains of 4 percent in the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  and 8 percent in the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI .
