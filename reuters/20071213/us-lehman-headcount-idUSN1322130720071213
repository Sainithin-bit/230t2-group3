 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N employees are likely to be comfortable with their 2007 bonuses on the whole, the company's chief financial officer told Reuters on Thursday. 

 "I think this will be a bonus year that people are comfortable with," CFO Erin Callan said. Lehman generally leaves compensation decisions to business units. The company has not made an across-the-board decision regarding how to compensate employees, Callan said. Lehman set aside $9.49 billion for compensation and benefits in 2007, up from $8.67 billion in 2006. But headcount has also risen: Lehman had 28,556 employees at the end of November 2007, compared with 25,936 a year earlier. Separately, Lehman does not currently have plans to lay off employees in 2008, Callan said. Headcount at the company is likely to be more or less unchanged in 2008, he said. For the most part, if Lehman scales back in some business lines, it will try to redeploy employees elsewhere, Callan said. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; editing by John Wallace)
