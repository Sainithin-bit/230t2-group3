 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will barely grow this quarter and have a lackluster 2008, according to forecasts by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N delivered on Thursday. 

 Lehman expects the U.S. economy to post a sluggish growth rate of just 0.4 percent in the final three months of this year, said the firm's Chief Financial Officer, Erin Callan. For full-year 2008, the U.S. economy as measured by gross domestic product is expected to grow just 1.8 percent, Callan said in a conference call following an announcement of the company's results. Lehman's outlook is a bit more grim than the median forecast of economists, according to a Reuters survey in November. That poll produced a 1.4 percent projected U.S. growth rate this quarter and 2.2 percent for full-year 2008. Callan said the firm sees global GDP growth at 2.7 percent in 2008.
