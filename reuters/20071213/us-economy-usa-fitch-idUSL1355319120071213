 LONDON  (Reuters) - There is a 40 percent chance that the United States economy will fall into recession next year, a senior analyst at Fitch Ratings said on Thursday. 

 "Our judgment is that it's hard to see the slowdown we've seen in the housing sector won't spill over in a more powerful way to consumer and domestic demand broadly," Brian Coulton, Fitch's head of EMEA sovereigns and global economics said. "We don't agree that a degree of financial stress has peaked in the U.S. housing sector," he told a briefing in London. (Reporting by  Natsuko Waki )
