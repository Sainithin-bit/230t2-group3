 LONDON  (Reuters) - The concerted central bank effort to ease the liquidity crisis may do no more than shine a spotlight on the other problems faced by the financial markets -- including a growing concern about fundamental asset quality. 

 While the move has undoubtedly eased tensions into year-end and will allow frazzled nerves some respite over the Christmas and New Year period, bankers and investors will return in January to face largely the same problems. The decision by central banks to broaden the range of collateral acceptable as loan security will help -- it turns illiquid securities stuck on balance sheets into useful assets -- and did boost some of the most beaten-down asset prices. The ABX subprime mortgage index posted strong gains on Wednesday, helping those banks who use the index price as part of their valuation model. But markets have been quick to reel back the initial euphoric reaction to Wednesday's 9 a.m. ET announcement. European stocks are sharply lower and European credit spreads have widened on Thursday. The central banks may have raised more questions than they answered. "The next leg of bad headlines will be real losses," credit analysts at Royal Bank of Scotland warned on Thursday. "Forget mark-to-market on CDOs, CDO of ABS, RMBS and the like, 2008 will see real losses." They warned of losses on real estate, credit cards, and consumer assets in general. "You have a slowing U.S. consumer," Jeffrey Immelt, CEO of General Electric ( GE.N ) said this week. "I'm not going to put a happy face on this ... clearly consumer delinquencies in the United States are increasing." Analysts at UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) asked whether central banks had a realistic chance of fighting the crisis with the measures announced. "It is becoming more and more apparent that this is not the case," they wrote. "The stressed liquidity situation is not the reason for the crisis, it is just one symptom ... The liquidity the central banks provide is absorbed quickly by banks that pile up cash on their balance sheets." This does remove pressure from the market to provide funding, and is highly welcome in stabilizing those institutions that might face liquidity risk. "But funding a bank's balance sheet is truly not the business of a central bank," they said. RISING DEFAULTS SEEN, ABS STILL STUCK Fundamental pressures are building. Analysts have agreed, for instance, that one of the few bright spots in the second half of this year has been that the global "junk"-bond default rate has remained extremely low -- at 1.0 percent in November, the lowest level for 26 years, according to Moody's Investors Service. But nearly everyone agrees that this agreeable state of affairs cannot continue next year. Moody's predicts that defaults will more than quadruple next year to 4.2 percent. Others are more pessimistic, citing forecasts of over 5 percent, above the long-term historical average and some are apocalyptic. London-based fund of hedge funds Key Asset Management sees defaults returning to 2002 levels of 8.2 percent. In the asset-backed market, meanwhile, bankers are still scrambling to solve the SIV problem and issuance has dropped off a cliff since July. According to Deutsche Bank, issuance since September in Europe is just 70 billion euros, down from 219 billion euros in the same period of 2006. Of that, the bank estimates only 20 percent has been sold into the market; the rest retained on balance sheet to be used as collateral for central bank borrowing. The asset-backed markets have been the indirect route for consumers to tap the international capital markets as they have provided a means for banks to fund portfolios of mortgages, credit cards and auto loans. Many bankers and investors forecast it will take until the second half of 2008 for new issuance even to start flowing regularly again as battered ABS investors recover some poise. So there are many problems still to be solved that the central banks' effort may only have highlighted. "Markets should understand it for what it is: a measure to avoid a systemic shock," said UniCredit's analysts. "It's like in an emergency room: here, doctors try to stabilize the condition of the patient. The therapy has to be done elsewhere." (Reporting by Richard Barley)
