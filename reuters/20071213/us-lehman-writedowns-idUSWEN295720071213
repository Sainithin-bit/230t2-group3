 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings LEH.N said on Thursday it had gross writedowns of $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter, including $2.2 billion from mortgages. 

 The writedowns were partially offset by $2 billion of hedge gains. The Wall Street firm also said it recorded about $500 million in gains from its GLG stake and private equity investments. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill , editing by Dave Zimmerman)
