 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Inventories at U.S. businesses rose a smaller-than-expected 0.1 percent in October, failing to keep pace with sales during the month, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 Wall Street analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a 0.3 percent rise in inventories after a 0.4 percent rise in September. Total business sales rose in October by 0.7 percent following an upwardly revised 0.7 percent gain in September, according to the Commerce Department report. The number of months it would take to deplete stocks at the current rate of sales fell to 1.26 months' worth, from 1.27 months in September, a lean level suggesting deep inventory cuts might not be needed beyond the fourth quarter. Inventories of motor vehicles and parts fell 0.4 percent in October after slipping 0.2 percent in September. Business inventories are a component of gross domestic product. The smaller-than-expected October inventory rise may prompt economists to reassess their estimates for fourth quarter economic growth. Showing the impact of the housing slump, retail inventories of building materials and garden equipment and supplies rose 1.1 percent in October after falling 0.6 percent the previous month. In addition, stockpiles at furniture, home furnishings, electrical supplies and appliance stores rose by 2.1 percent, the biggest monthly gain since a 2.5 percent jump in October of 2003.
