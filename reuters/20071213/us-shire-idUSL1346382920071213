 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shire Plc ( SHP.L ) has named Chief Financial Officer Angus Russell, 51, as chief executive-designate, replacing Matthew Emmens at the helm of Britain's third-largest drugmaker from June 2008. 

 Emmens, who is 56, will succeed James Cavanaugh as non-executive chairman, the group said on Thursday. Cavanaugh, 70, is retiring after chairing the board since 1999. The management changes are the latest in a wave of new appointments at the top of Europe's pharmaceuticals sector. Emmens joined Shire in 2003 and has led the company -- best known from its drugs to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- through a successful expansion, including a move into more complex biotech medicine. Russell has long experience at the specialty pharmaceuticals group, where he has been CFO for the past eight years and a leading member of the management committee. Before that he worked for ICI ICI.L, Zeneca and AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ) in finance, strategy and marketing. Shire said it would seek a replacement for Russell in his current finance role to ensure an orderly succession. (Reporting by  Ben Hirschler , Editing by Erica Billingham)
