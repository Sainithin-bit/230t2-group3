 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Top U.S. tax preparer H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ) said on Thursday its borrowing capacity may not be sufficient to meet its financing requirements and it may have to issue additional debt or equity. 

 The company, whose shares were down 3.5 percent, said in a regulatory filing that it had been "significantly and negatively impacted" by the subprime mortgage meltdown. It said it does not expect to be in compliance with a plan for a minimum capital ratio that it set with the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) in July. It had previously said it expected to hit the target by April 30, 2008. Failure to meet the requirements of the plan could impair its ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock, and the OTS could impose monetary penalties or force the company to sell assets, it said in the filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. H&R Block said it would take a $74.8 million pretax charge for the previously announced shutdown of its Option One Mortgage Corp subprime lending unit. The company had expected to sell the money-losing unit, a lender to people with poor credit, to private equity firm Cerberus, but the deal fell through earlier this month. Half of the restructuring charge was taken in the fiscal second quarter ended October 31, and the rest in the current quarter, the filing said. DISAPPOINTING RESULTS The company also said it lost a bigger-than-expected 42 cents per share from continuing operations in the second quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 35 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said its net loss was $502.3 million, or $1.55 a share, compared with a net loss of $156.5 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. H&R Block shares were down 68 cents to $18.74 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. On November 20 the company replaced Chairman and Chief Executive Mark Ernst following mounting subprime mortgage losses and criticism that the company had strayed far beyond its roots. Richard Breeden, a former SEC chairman who won three H&R Block board seats in September after a proxy fight, was named chairman. Breeden argued that H&R Block should quit banking and subprime mortgage lending and focus on tax preparation. Lawsuits have accused H&R Block of marketing costly loans to people awaiting tax refunds, and retirement accounts that cost money for hundreds of thousands of lower-income clients. In a big embarrassment, H&R Block admitted in February 2006 that it had underreported its own state taxes. (Reporting by Christopher Kaufman and Ed Leefeldt; editing by  Derek Caney  and John Wallace)
