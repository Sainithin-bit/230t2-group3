 LONDON  (Reuters) - Northern Rock said it had taken a 281 million pound ($574 million) hit, or two-thirds of its market value, from its exposure to the credit crisis, adding to its woes as it brought in a new chief executive. 

 In a long-awaited update for investors, the battered lender said Andy Kuipers, a director who stood down from the board last month, would replace veteran Adam Applegarth, who leaves the company on Thursday. Applegarth announced last month he would step down but had not been expected to leave until next year. Northern Rock is being auctioned off by its advisers after it became Britain's highest profile casualty of the credit crisis, but the future of that process has been thrown into doubt in recent weeks, with two suitors withdrawing. On Thursday, the bank faced the prospect of being left with only one bidder -- its preferred suitor Virgin Group -- after investment group Olivant said it had been rebuffed by the bank and threatened to withdraw. It called for the timetable to speed up and to be given access to the financing banks involved, a source close to the matter said. Olivant's proposal is backed by several leading Northern Rock shareholders, including hedge funds RAB Capital and SRM Capital, who together own more than 15 percent in the lender. The prospect of a single bidder and news of the hit from collateralized debt obligations (CDO) and other structured debt investments weighed on Northern Rock's shares, which fell as much as 9 percent lower early on Thursday. The bank's volatile shares were down 4.7 percent at 94.5 pence by 1002 GMT, having touched 90p. CREDIT CRUNCH Northern Rock said the 281 million pound writedown included a 118 million pound hit from its investment in structured investment vehicles (SIVs) and a further 32 million pounds from its investment in the more highly leveraged SIV-lites. That compares with the bank's forecast 2007 profit before tax of 467 million pounds, according to Reuters Estimates. "We still have such little clarity on where profit before tax was traveling pre these hits. However, it is fair to say that the impact is significant whatever the profits were likely to be," analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said in a note. In an update on the rescue process underway since the bank's near-collapse in September, Northern Rock said it remained in "accelerated" discussions with a bidding consortium led by Virgin Group and was "engaged" with parties including Olivant. It also confirmed it expects to complete its strategic review by February. Olivant is pressing for a decision before Christmas. Its proposal would keep Northern Rock as a going concern rather than entail a sale or break-up. The investment group is expected to demand a response from Northern Rock by the end of this week, or it will withdraw. Northern Rock was engulfed in a funding crisis in September and has since been forced to borrow 25 billion pounds ($51 billion) from the Bank of England. Northern Rock's departing chief executive Applegarth will receive up to 380,000 pounds when he leaves the bank on Thursday, a person familiar with the matter said last month. Kuipers was appointed to the board in January 2005 and is responsible for the co-ordination and direction of sales, marketing, products, pricing and retention activities. He owns 174,000 shares in the bank, now worth 165,000 pounds, down from around 1.9 million when the holding was topped up in May. (Editing by  Louise Ireland )
