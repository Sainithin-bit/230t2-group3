 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's media regulator Ofcom said on 
Thursday it would conduct an auction for the highly 
sought-after radio spectrum that will be freed up through the 
digital television switchover. 

  The "digital dividend" spectrum is in the UHF band 
currently used by the terrestrial television broadcasters.  Ofcom said the overall benefit from the use of the digital 
dividend was estimated to be between 5 billion pounds ($10.2 
billion) to 10 billion pounds of added benefit to the economy 
over 20 years.  "To maximize these benefits, Ofcom plans to auction most of 
the digital dividend in 2009, offering licenses that allow 
users to decide the technology and service, and that can be 
traded after award," it said in a statement.  Ofcom said transmissions in this band covered large 
geographical areas with relatively few transmitters, and 
penetrated buildings well.  "This makes the digital dividend the highest quality 
spectrum likely to be released in the UK in the next 10 or 20 
years," it said.  It will be suitable for a wide range of uses including 
ultra-fast wireless broadband services, mobile television, 
local television and more digital terrestrial television 
channels in either standard or high-definition.  (Reporting by  Kate Holton ; Editing by  David Holmes )
