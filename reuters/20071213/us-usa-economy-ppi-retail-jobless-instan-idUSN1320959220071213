 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Government reports on retail sales and producer prices came in squarely above Wall Street's forecasts on Thursday. 

 A separate report showed a modest drop in the number of people seeking initial unemployment benefits.  COMMENTS: MARK VITNER, ECONOMIST AT WACHOVIA SECURITIES, NORTH  CAROLINA: "In terms of the inflation numbers were knew that there was going to be a big increase in the overall number because of the big jump in energy prices that we saw. Excluding food and energy prices, we are still seeing intensifying inflationary pressures and that's one of the reasons why the Fed is having to be as cautious as it has been in terms of not cutting by half a percentage point everytime like the financial markets seem to want it to. It explains why they went to great lengths to target the liquidity as best as they could instead of making a bolder interest rate cut. "In terms of the retail sales, these numbers should put some of the fears to rest that consumers are going to stay at home this holiday season. That's absolutely not going to happen." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW  YORK: "Retail sales showed great unexpected strength in November and in upward revisions to critical components of retail sales in the two previous months which has a big impact on the trend into the fourth quarter. There is an issue of whether November is overstated because of the early Thanksgiving, but the report still showed a stronger consumer trend than had generally been perceived, stronger than the Fed has been perceived. There's a question as to how much of the gain is pure inflation; gasoline is surly part of it. Still, real consumer spending growth is likely to be much firmer than generally thought. The economy is not slipping into crisis but the outlook is still cloudy." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC.,  TOLEDO, OHIO: "Basically this is the main reason the Fed didn't cut more on Tuesday. The reason the Fed gave us 25 basis points give them flexibility to do more. But if the numbers continue to look this way they might not do more. There's so much uncertainty right now." MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM, WEST  CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA: RETAIL SALES: "It suggests Christmas will be okay for retailers which means sales will be up 4.5 percent from a year earlier. That's passable. But it doesn't measure to prior years. I wouldn't cheer too much with the November increase due to very aggressive discounting by retailers on Black Friday. Sales have since weakened. This dispels concerns that the economy was in recession in November." PPI: "That's a stronger number. It's a little hotter than I expected. The headline number is energy related, but commodity prices have cooled in December. The 0.4 percent core increase is likely from the swings in vehicle prices. Underlying vehicle prices are weakening." JOBLESS CLAIMS: "The job market is the most optimistic area of the economy. It's holding up well despite layoffs in construction and financial service industries. It's not recession. It's a good number, providing solace that the economy is intact." OMER ESINER, A MARKET ANALYST AT RUESCH INTERNATIONAL IN  WASHINGTON, D.C.: "The data is definitely dollar positive. Retail sales came as a strong upside surprise and it's a clear indication that consumer spending in the U.S. is not falling off the cliffs as many economists were fearing. Today's numbers in conjunction with yesterday's actions by the central banks, should help support some dollar buying."
