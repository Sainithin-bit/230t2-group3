 LISBON  (Reuters) - European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso said on Friday he did not believe in a conspiracy against the euro, blaming a market attack on some EU member states' debt for the currency's recent slide. 

 Portuguese Prime Minister Jose Socrates and some other European leaders have earlier blamed "a speculative attack on the euro" for soaring funding costs in the peripheral euro zone and the need to impose painful austerity measures like tax hikes and public sector wage cuts. But, speaking at an event in Lisbon, Barroso said: "I don't believe in a conspiracy against the euro." "There is an attack on the sovereign debt of some states ... which has to be faced with an enormous determination," he said. Barroso said the response of European states so far has been positive, acknowledging though some slowness in decision-making and passing the legislation after the Greek debt crisis. Still, he said it was natural since all member states needed time to assess the "unprecedented situation." Barroso said the crisis was giving the European Union a signal "that we have to be better organized," adding that he believed that a better integration in Europe could come from this crisis. He acknowledged there were serious economic and social risks, but said Europe was going to give a positive response and should be able to overcome them. "We are at one of the most critical moments in the process of building Europe ... It is true that there are serious economic and social risks, risks of populism and defeatism. But I think Europe will overcome those," Barroso said. Calling competitiveness one of Europe's main problems as it competes against countries with much lower costs, he said that to preserve its social system, Europe will have to "make some reforms to maintain the levels of social cohesion that we have." He said no single country could compete against countries like the United States, Russia and China and "that's why we need a strong European Union." "The solution is more Europe," he said, reiterating his call for a greater coordination of economic policies among member states.
