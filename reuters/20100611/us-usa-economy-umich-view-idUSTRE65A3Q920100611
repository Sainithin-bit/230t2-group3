 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment improved in early June to its strongest level in nearly 2-1/2 years, bolstered by hopes of better job and credit conditions, a survey released on Friday showed. 

 KEY POINTS: * The preliminary June reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment rose to 75.5 from 73.6 at the end of May, according to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers. * The figure was above the median forecast of 74.5 among economists polled by Reuters. * The latest survey also showed consumer intention to buy durable items like cars has not flagged, although government data released earlier on Friday showed a 1.7 percent drop in vehicle sales last month. * The disparate data on consumer sentiment and spending underscored lingering anxiety about the economy and caution over consumers' personal finances. COMMENTS: ALAN RUSKIN, HEAD OF CURRENCY STRATEGY, RBS GLOBAL BANKING & MARKETS, STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT: "Quite a pleasant surprise to see the Michigan sentiment data hang in, with no sign of any hit from recent equity weakness/volatility. Lower mortgage rates and lower oil prices (not that it shows up much in gas prices in the summer) have been offsetting factors, and perhaps most important there is a perception that the labor market is still probably improving albeit not as quickly as April data suggested." "The risk trade is hanging in quite nicely after the retail sales data and this latest sentiment number will reinforce this relative resilience." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "(Sentiment was) stronger than expected... We had a nice one-day advance yesterday, and this will kind of relieve some of the pressures. "I think the (stock) market is looking for reasons to stabilize, and this provides some of that." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "Consumer sentiment was a good number. There was an outside risk that weakness in the financial markets might hurt sentiment, but it appears consumers are feeling better about the underlying economy. Perceptions of the present and the future improved and inflation expectations decreased. There are problems in the world, but it looks like consumers are taking them in stride." CHRISTOPHER LOW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, FTN FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "The outlook of a slowdown seems justified by the payroll and the retail sales reports, but these pieces were undermined by other data. "Hours worked were up strongly so output is actually growing faster in the second quarter than the first quarter. "Retail sales were awful in May but people forgot how strong they were in March. "Confidence continues to rise and output continues to grow. The double-dip scenario is more compelling after this morning's retail sales report, but it is still probably wrong. "Investors are in no mood for excuses. There is still a lot of fear in the market." GREGORY SALVAGGIO, VP PRESIDENT FOR TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: "The (UMICH) numbers are good but we had a pretty bad report earlier, with retail sales, which was very disappointing and will keep a lid on any real gains in the dollar. Still, there's been a minor move here against the yen. The dollar will need bigger economic indicators such as housing and labor reports to move." NIGEL GAULT, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, GLOBAL INSIGHT, LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS: "It's a good number and could provide reassurance after the retail sales number, which was particularly weak. After that, the first question on everyone's mind was whether consumers were pulling back in a major way. According to this survey, they're not, at least not in a major way. This reinforces the view that what moved sales in May was the unwinding of incentives to buy energy-efficient appliances, and other issues like weather, the price of gas, and so forth. If consumers were getting panicked, you'd expected to see more worry showing up here. Sentiment isn't high by historical standards, but it is moving higher."
