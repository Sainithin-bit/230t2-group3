 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) board member Jerry York was hospitalized on Wednesday near his home in Detroit after suffering a collapse, a person familiar with the matter said. 

 Details on York's condition were not immediately available. Jerry York once worked as chief finance officer at Chrysler and as a director of General Motors, but is best known as an adviser to billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian. He also serves as president and chief executive of Harwinton Capital. "Jerry is a very dear friend and a trusted business associate and our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family," Kerkorian said in a statement. York, who also served as IBM Corp's ( IBM.N ) CFO, was involved in Kerkorian's failed bid for Chrysler in 2007 and the billionaire's investment in both GM and Ford Motor Co ( F.N ). Known as a straight-talking executive, York was a persistent critic of GM during his board tenure from February to October 2006, advocating brand cuts the automaker opposed but ended up executing in bankruptcy. York resigned from GM's board following a spat with the automaker's executives after they blocked his proposed alliance with French-Japanese automaker Renault-Nissan.
