 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) said on Thursday it drew down $7.3 billion of bank lines to help fund daily operations, highlighting the commercial finance company's struggle to raise cash to pay off debt. 

 CIT shares plummeted 17.3 percent to close at $9.63 a share. The shares are more than 80 percent below their record high of $61.46 set last June 1. The bank lines should satisfy CIT's financing needs for the rest of the year, assuming it can sell off and manage assets as expected, said Joe Leone, CIT's chief financial officer, on a conference call. "It is comforting to hear CIT say that, but a lot depends on what assets they sell and if they get decent prices for the assets they sell. If they can't get good prices, it would weaken their capital base," said David Chiaverini, analyst at BMO Capital Markets in New York who rates CIT "market perform." "The concern is their ability to fund their business in this environment." The stock market has stabilized since the Federal Reserve cut rates and made financing available to investment banks, but U.S. Treasury bill rates are at their lowest levels since the 1950s, signaling that investors are still jittery. CIT is one of a legion of finance companies that have struggled to issue debt as the U.S. credit crunch wears on. The company has $90 billion of assets, of which more than $9 billion is subprime mortgages. CIT, a 100-year old company, finances everything from aircraft to businesses' unpaid client bills to telecommunications equipment. CEO Jeff Peek is scaling back CIT's exposure to consumer lending and focusing on its commercial lending business. The company has about $15 billion of debt to pay back in 2008, and expects to generate some $24.7 billion of cash from leases and other assets. It also hopes to sell about $5 billion to $7 billion of assets, Chief Executive Jeff Peek said. To some investors, the large decline in share price signals there may be an opportunity in CIT shares. "They have been survivors, and if history is any guide, they can get through this," said James Palmisciano, chief investment officer at Gracie Credit Opportunities Fund, which is considering buying CIT shares. CIT is trading at a severe discount to its tangible book value as of Dec 31 of $28.42 per share. CIT is also looking at finding a financial institution, such as a smaller bank, to fund CIT commercial loans and leases, Peek said. One potential partner was far along in conversations with CIT but "the environment backed away a little bit," Peek said. RATINGS CUTS Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this week cut CIT's long- and short-term debt ratings, citing concerns about the company's funding model. The downgrades weighed on CIT's ability to sell commercial paper, a form of short-term debt. CIT had about $2 billion of commercial paper outstanding as of this week. In January, the company reported a $130.7 million fourth-quarter loss after boosting reserves for mortgages and writing down part of a student loan investment. Losses from consumer lending are likely to continue in 2008, it has said. Other companies in the financial sector are struggling now, too. Thornburg Mortgage Inc TMA.N, a "jumbo" mortgage lender, said on Wednesday it had to raise nearly $1 billion of capital to keep five lenders at bay and avert a possible bankruptcy. Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N, once the fifth-largest U.S. investment bank, was forced to strike a deal to sell itself to JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) on Sunday for a pittance, after experiencing a run on the bank. Drawing on bank lines is often seen as an emergency action for companies unable to get financing elsewhere. Over 40 banks are part of CIT's bank lines, with the biggest lenders including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup ( C.N ), Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) and Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ). The cost to insure CIT debt with credit default swaps is trading at distressed levels, costing 27 percent of the sum insured as an upfront payment, in addition to annual premiums of 500 basis points, according to broker Phoenix Partners Group. That means it would cost $2.7 million in one lump sum to insure $10 million in debt for five years, in addition to annual premiums of $500,000 per year. An upfront payment is usually demanded for insurance on companies with significant credit risk. (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick/Andre Grenon)
