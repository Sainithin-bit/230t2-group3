 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) Chief Executive James Dimon visited Bear Stearns' BSC.N offices on Wednesday evening to speak to more than 400 senior executives, according to reports in the New York Times and Financial Times. 

 The New York Times said Dimon made it clear that he hoped to retain the best employees at Bear, but also made it plain many of the 14,000 employees would lose their jobs if his bank completes a deal to buy Bear Stearns for $2 a share. The Financial Times reported JPMorgan is moving swiftly to retain Bear's top performing bankers and brokers and is preparing to deliver retention package offers for top employees as soon as Thursday, citing people close to the situation. The FT said the move comes as JPMorgan's rivals, such as Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), have begun making efforts to pick off top Bear brokers with large bonus offers.
