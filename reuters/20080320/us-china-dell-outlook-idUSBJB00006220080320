 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Dell Inc DELL.O plans to buy $23 billion worth of components from China this year, 28 percent more than in 2007, the world's second-biggest personal computer maker said on Thursday. 

 Rivals including Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) and Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) have benefited recently from falling prices for computer components such as memory, monitors and disc drives. "Including last year, this year and expected purchases next year, Dell will purchase $70 billion worth of computer-related supplies and equipment from China," Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell told reporters. Dell was speaking at an event to celebrate 10 years of operations in China. "China is one of the most dynamic and fastest-growing economies in the world, and we've made significant business and social investments here in the last 10 years." he said. Dell said the company's China sales grew 54 percent in the fourth quarter of last year. ($=7.06 yuan) (Reporting by  Kirby Chien ; Editing by  Ken Wills )
