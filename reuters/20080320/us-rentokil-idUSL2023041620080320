 LONDON  (Reuters) - Rentokil Initial Plc ( RTO.L ) has hired the management team that turned around chemicals group ICI, sending its shares over 25 percent higher on hopes of a break-up of the troubled pest control to parcel delivery firm. 

 Rentokil, which has issued two profit warnings since December, said on Thursday that chief executive Doug Flynn was leaving with immediate effect, following chairman Brian McGowan who announced his resignation last month. John McAdam, chief executive of ICI before its purchase by Dutch rival Akzo Nobel ( AKZO.AS ) earlier this year, will become chairman. Alan Brown, former ICI finance chief, will be chief executive, while Andy Ransom, another former ICI executive, will be responsible for corporate development. At 6:45 a.m. EDT, Rentokil shares were up 20 percent at 88 pence, after trading as high as 92.1 pence. "Quite clearly these chaps have gone in there with a view to breaking this business up," said Seymour Pierce analyst Kevin Lapwood, who has a break-up value for Rentokil shares of 117 pence. McAdam sold off several ICI businesses, such as oleochemicals unit Uniqema, before selling the whole business to Akzo Nobel for 8 billion pounds ($16 billion). However, Rentokil's senior independent director, Peter Long, said the new team was not looking to split the company up. "We're not interested in talking to bottom feeders thinking they can come and buy some Rentokil assets on the cheap," he told reporters on a conference call, adding that the ICI team had a great track record of improving business performance. Under McAdam's stewardship, ICI's market value rose more than sixfold, which Long described as "one of the greatest corporate turnarounds of the past decade." PAY DEALS AND PAY OFFS Best known for its rat-catching roots, Rentokil offers a range of services to businesses and consumers, ranging from cleaning to the hire of workwear and tropical plants. A botched integration of an acquisition in its parcel delivery business, however, led to profit warnings in December and February and a halving of its share price. Long said stabilizing the parcels business would be the top priority of the new management team. Brown and Ransom will receive base salaries of 775,000 pounds and 450,000 pounds respectively, with a maximum potential bonus equivalent to the same amount. McAdam will be paid 350,000 pounds a year, with no bonus. All three new executives will also be awarded a 5-year incentive plan, which gives them a potential 7.5 million shares each if Rentokil's stock price reaches 180 pence, and a possible increase of up to 50 percent if the stock reaches 280 pence. Long said he had received strong support from shareholders for the incentive package. He also said outgoing chief executive Doug Flynn would receive a severance package worth around 1.2 million pounds. Alan Brown will take up his post on April 1, while Andy Ransom will join on May 1 and John McAdam on May 14. (Editing by  David Holmes  and  Keith Weir )
