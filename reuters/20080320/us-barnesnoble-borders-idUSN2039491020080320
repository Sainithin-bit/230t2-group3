 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Top bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ) said on Thursday that it had not been approached by Borders Group Inc BGP.N representatives regarding a purchase of its rival, but would take a look if it were contacted. 

 "We haven't been approached by Borders investment bankers, and if we are, we'll certainly take a good look at the company and put it under review," a Barnes & Noble executive said during its earnings conference call. Borders said earlier Thursday that it was mulling possible options including a sale or some of all of its businesses. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs )
