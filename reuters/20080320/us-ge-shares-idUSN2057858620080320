 BOSTON  (Reuters) - For most of the past three years, investors looking at General Electric Co ( GE.N ) have had a common complaint -- the shares were "trading sideways," showing little movement of any kind. 

 But with financial markets in turmoil -- major U.S. indices have lost about 10 percent so far this year amid a severe credit crunch and feared U.S. recession -- trading sideways is not looking that bad, investors said. Shares of GE, the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, rallied as much as 4.6 percent on Thursday after an upgrade by Merrill Lynch and following strong gains in two of the past three trading days. "It's nice to see that the stock is getting some respect," said Peter Sorrentino, senior vice president and portfolio manager at Huntington Asset Advisors, which manages about $6.5 billion in assets and counts GE among its holdings. GE shares were up 4.3 percent, or $1.54, at $37.13 on the New York Stock Exchange at midday. That left them about flat for the year at a time when the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  is down about 8 percent and the broad Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX  is off 11 percent. Over the past 52 weeks, the stock has touched a low of $31.65 in March and hit a high of $42.15, part of an October rally that saw GE shares cross the $40 mark for the first time in more than five years. LESS WORRIES ON FINANCE Merrill Lynch said on Thursday it upgraded the stock to "buy" from "hold." "We think GE's defensive conglomerate positioning can allow the stock to further outperform near term," wrote analyst John Inch in a note. Inch also said any risks in the portfolio of GE's financing arms -- which last year accounted for well over one-third of the Fairfield, Connecticut-based conglomerate's profits -- likely could be "contained." Amid a credit crunch that most recently brought investment bank Bear Stearns Co Inc BSC.N to near collapse and thousands of job cuts at giant banks like Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), analysts and investors have cited concerns about GE's financing arms -- which do everything from financing the purchase of jet engines to consumer banking in the developing world -- as likely holding back its shares. Last year the company exited the subprime lending business as that market dried up and put its Japanese consumer-lending arm on the block after a regulatory change. Its solid balance sheet leaves it well positioned to take advantage of a tough credit environment that claims other firms, Inch wrote. "The company should be able to take advantage of its AAA-rating and position as opportunistic lender to pursue new revenue sources and acquire financial assets at discount prices," he wrote. Investors also noted that GE's international exposure -- it generates about one-half of its revenue outside the United States -- will make it more attractive as the domestic economy cools. "They're globally oriented. The U.S. market is slowing, maybe the global markets are slowing a little bit, but you're not going to see much downside," said George Padula, president of Danforth Associates, which manages about $100 million in assets and holds GE shares. "Where do you go for some relative security in a tough market?" Padula continued. "Your blue chip dividend-paying large-cap stocks are there." (Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
