 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ) on Thursday reported a lower quarterly profit as a deteriorating economy hurt sales. 

 The world's largest specialty book retailer said net income in the fiscal fourth-quarter ended February 2 was $115 million, or $1.79 a diluted share, compared with $126.7 million, or $1.83 a share, a year earlier. Rival Borders Group Inc BGP.N earlier on Thursday suspended its dividend and said it would explore options including a possible sale of the company. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs , editing by Gerald E.
