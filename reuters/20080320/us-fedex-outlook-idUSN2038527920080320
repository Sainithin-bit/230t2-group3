 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Oil price volatility has made FedEx Corp's ( FDX.N ) earnings outlook less certain than usual and the company could end up either above or below the stated range, a top executive said on Thursday. 

 "I don't have as much confidence (in that outlook) as I usually do due to oil volatility," Chief Financial Officer Alan Graf said in a conference call with analysts. Graf said that oil price volatility means that FedEx could miss its forecast "on either side" of its earnings per share range of $1.60 to $1.80 for the current quarter.
