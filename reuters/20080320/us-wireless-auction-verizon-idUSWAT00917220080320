 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Verizon Wireless, a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc and Vodafone Group Plc, won a nationwide wireless license known as the "C" block in a government auction, the U.S. Federal Communications Communication said on Thursday. 

 Verizon Wireless made a top offer of $4.74 billion for the C block spectrum, giving it control of a major piece of the airwaves being vacated by television broadcasters as they move to digital from analog signals in early 2009. The FCC also said that AT&T had won 227 licenses from among the "B" block of regional licenses. (Reporting by  Peter Kaplan ; Editing by  Leslie Gevirtz )
