 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) is unlikely to meet its global sales target of 9.85 million units this year due to slowing sales in major markets amid the yen's strengthening, an executive vice president said on Thursday. 

 "Frankly speaking, sales in the U.S., Europe and Japan are showing signs of slowdown. It will be difficult to meet the group's sales target of 9.85 million, although emerging markets such as China and Russia are active," Uranishi Tokuichi, executive vice president of Toyota, told reporters in Seoul.
