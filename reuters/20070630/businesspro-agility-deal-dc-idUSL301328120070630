 KUWAIT  (Reuters) - Kuwaiti logistics provider Agility 
( AGLT.KW ) said on Saturday it was part of a group with U.S. 
firm Dyncorp International DCP.N which won a $50 billion deal 
from the U.S. military. 

  Agility shares rallied 6.6 percent after the news.  Agility said in a statement on the Kuwait bourse Web site 
it would provide various logistics, supply and warehousing 
services as part of the deal.  The contract would run 10 years, of which 9 were optional, 
and would have a value of $50 billion for the whole period, it 
added. The deal, which included food and oil supply services, 
would be worth $5 billion for each year.  Agility, which is diversifying its business and expanding 
abroad, said it could not currently determine its exact share 
of the deal.  The total deal also includes U.S. firms KBR ( KBR.N ), a 
former unit of Halliburton Co. ( HAL.N ), and Fluor Corp ( FLR.N ) 
with a combined potential value of up to $150 billion to 
provide services to the U.S. military in the Middle East.
  EXPANSION  Agility said on June 16 the U.S. military had renewed a 
5-year deal worth $1.5 billion, extending the deal to its third 
consecutive year. The contract is up for yearly renewal.  The U.S. government said on June 1 it had awarded Agility 
another supply and food deal worth up to $2.8 billion.  Agility has said it was expanding in the Middle East, 
Africa or Eastern Europe to diversify its business and lower 
its exposure to U.S. military deals, a key source of income.  Agility, previously known as Public Warehousing Co., has 
bought at least seven smaller rivals this year including New 
Zealand-based LEP International and Chinese freight company 
Guangzhou Runtang International Transport Company Limited.
