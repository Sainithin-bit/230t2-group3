 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) has been awarded an 11-year, $2.02 billion contract for 242 wing sets for the Air Force's A-10 fleet designed to support ground troops, the Pentagon said on Friday. 

 Work is to be wrapped up by September 2018, the Pentagon said in its daily contract summary. Chicago-based Boeing said the program calls for the replacement wing sets to be delivered in parts and kits for easy installation. "We are pleased that the Air Force has recognized that Boeing has the skilled expertise, engineering know-how and the affordable solution to address the needs of the A-10 program," Charles Robertson, a vice president of Boeing Support Systems, said in a statement. The A-10, introduced in 1976, is a single-seat, twin-engine jet that can be used against all ground targets, including tanks and other armored vehicles.
