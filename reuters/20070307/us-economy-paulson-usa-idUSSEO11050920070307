 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's finance ministry said U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sounded optimistic on Wednesday about sustained growth in the U.S. economy, despite concerns about the country's housing market. 


 The ministry also said in a statement, issued after his meeting with South Korean Finance Minister Kwon O-kyu in Seoul, that both officials agreed to cooperate over an early and smooth conclusion in free trade agreement negotiations. "Secretary Paulson assessed that the U.S. economy was successfully entering into a stable growth path, despite a slump in the U.S. real estate market," the ministry said in the Korean-language statement.
