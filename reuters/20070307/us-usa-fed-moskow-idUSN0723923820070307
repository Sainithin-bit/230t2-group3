 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chicago Federal Reserve President Michael Moskow on Wednesday did not rule out another interest rate increase to tamp down inflation, even after a recent run of soft economic data. 


 The risk of high inflation is still greater than the risk of economic growth falling too low, Moskow said in comments to the Jewish United Fund similar to his most recent speech last month. Moskow said that recent financial market volatility "imparts more uncertainty to the outlook" but did not shake his generally upbeat view on the economy. Moskow is a voting member of the policy-making Federal Open Market Committee this year but will retire in August. Recent data on the U.S. economy "on balance have come in on the soft side," Moskow said. He later termed the economy "quite strong" and operating with little slack. Gross domestic product growth, the broadest measure of the U.S. economy, is still likely to be slightly below potential in 2007 but near potential in 2008. "I expect the economy to continue to operate at a high level relative to its potential, which could eventually lead to the emergence of increased inflationary pressures," he said. "It is much too early to say that inflation is no longer a concern." The FOMC has left key short-term rates at 5.25 percent since June after a two-year string of rate increases. Financial markets see almost a 75 percent chance that the central bank will lower rates by its June 27-28 policy-setting meeting, and were unmoved by Moskow's comments. The market's assessment of the Fed outlook shifted toward rate cuts last week following a drop in global share prices and widening of credit risk spreads. Moskow said markets were "operating well" after last week's volatility, and that spreads had widened from levels that were very low by historical standards. Moskow told reporters that the residential housing market "is in the process of stabilizing, and the likely outlook is that it will be stabilizing this year." The risks of housing weakness cascading over to other sectors of the economy or dragging down consumer spending do not seem unduly large, he said. However, "there also are financial risks associated with the declines in housing markets. Notably, defaults on subprime mortgages could have a larger-than-expected effect on households and lenders." INFLATION HAWK In February, the FOMC forecast inflation, measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, at between 2 percent and 2.25 percent in 2007 and between 1.75 percent and 2 percent in 2008. Moskow said that inflation at the middle or bottom of those ranges "would represent reasonable progress toward price stability." His preferred range on inflation is 1 percent to 2 percent. Inflation risks have eased in recent months and continue to be helped by the fall in energy prices, he said. Still, healthy labor markets and solid productivity growth should continue to support consumer spending and keep consumption growth in line with longer-run trends, he said. Unemployment is likely to change little this year from its current low level, maintaining the risk of wage inflation as employers bid up to attract and retain workers. "If actual inflation does not show clear enough signs of returning to the center of the range I associate with price stability, there is a danger that expectations of inflation could run too high, which would likely be a self-fulfilling prophecy," he said.
