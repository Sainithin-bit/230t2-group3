 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Publicis ( PUBP.PA ), the world's fourth-largest advertising group, said on Wednesday it would acquire Pharmagistics, a pharmaceutical services company, in an effort to boost its health-care communications business. 


 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Pharmagistics, based in Somerset, New Jersey, specializes in marketing, distributing samples and literature to pharmaceutical sales teams, and logistical services. The company has 120 employees. "In order for us to maintain our leading position in health-care communications, we need to continuously increase our range of services," Publicis Chief Executive Maurice Levy said in a statement. Publicis' health-care communications division is the world's largest, with businesses ranging from advertising to medical education. Pharmagistics will remain a separate unit within the division.
