 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Tokyo Stock Exchange TSE.UL is likely to decide to delist scandal-hit Japanese brokerage Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T on Friday, the Nikkei business daily reported. 


 The newspaper said in its Wednesday edition that the TSE had found Nikko's past accounting problems to be systemic and fraudulent, meeting the criteria for delisting. Japan's third-biggest securities firm has admitted forging documents and booking about $300 million in excess profits over two years. The Tokyo bourse said in a statement that it had not yet decided whether to delist Nikko stock. It added that it has been reviewing the case and aims to make a decision in mid-March. The TSE put Nikko under review for delisting in December. Nikko's shares would be allowed to trade on the TSE for one month after a delisting announcement. After that, investors would only be able to buy and sell the shares in the illiquid over-the-counter market. The Nikkei report came a day after Citigroup ( C.N ) announced that it would launch a $10.8 billion bid for Nikko, aiming to lift its stake in the broker to at least 50 percent from just under 5 percent. The largest U.S. bank said it would go through with the tender offer even if the TSE delisted Nikko. Citigroup could have scooped up Nikko more cheaply had it waited for a delisting, but analysts have said that strategy would also have carried risks. Nikko's clients and staff might have abandoned the firm had it been delisted before securing a buyer, and private equity funds might even have made a grab for its assets, such as its profitable mutual fund business and companies held by its merchant banking arm. Citigroup would also have risked being checked by rivals such as Mizuho Financial Group ( 8411.T ), Japan's second-biggest bank, which like Citigroup, owns about 5 percent of Nikko. Nikko shares were up 1.1 percent at 1,355 yen as of 0122 GMT, slightly higher than the 1,350 yen apiece that Citigroup offered. If Citigroup buys all shares tendered, that would cost it about 1.253 trillion yen ($10.75 billion). The deal is Citigroup's largest in Asia to date, eclipsing its $2.8 billion acquisition of South Korea's KorAm Bank in 2004 and the first under Chief Executive Charles Prince, who took over after regulators shut down Citigroup's Japanese private bank over a series of compliance problems. It would also be the largest takeover of a Japanese company by a non-Japanese firm, eclipsing Vodafone Group's ( VOD.L ) $7.6 billion buyout of Japan Telecom and its mobile unit J-Phone in 2001.
