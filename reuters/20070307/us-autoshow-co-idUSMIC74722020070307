 GENEVA  (Reuters) - The issue of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from cars has lodged in the brains of car industry executives, but the evidence under the bonnet at the Geneva car show is less conclusive. 


 "Everyone wants to be perceived as working on reducing CO2 emissions," Sabine Bluemel, automotive analyst at Banca IMI in London, said on Wednesday. "But at the same time they are marketing their cars based on engine performance, and you just cannot have low CO2 emissions and powerful performance at the same time," she said. At the Geneva show, which opens to the public on Thursday, a plethora of existing or planned vehicles contain technologies to curb CO2 emissions, which are contributing to global warming. There are cars running on natural gas, electricity, biofuels, batteries and solar power. Several carmakers, such as Toyota of Japan, are investing in hybrid cars that combine internal combustion engines with batteries that power low-speed driving. "Global issues, such as CO2 reduction and energy conservation, require more than just improved technology," Toyota President Katsuaki Watanabe said, calling for improved fuels and the infrastructure to deliver them to consumers. POWER POLLUTES Germany's BMW presented its Hydrogen 7 car, a luxury 7 Series with a V12 engine that runs on petrol and on hydrogen. Its engine, limited at 230 km per hour, can run 200 km on pure hydrogen plus 500 km on petrol, so drivers aren't stranded between rare hydrogen filling stations. It is no surprise that German carmakers are scratching their heads about reducing CO2. BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi make a range of powerful cars that guzzle gas and spew out fumes through two or more exhaust pipes. In February, the European Commission proposed cutting CO2 emissions from cars as a way to counter global warming but has left open many of the details on just how to do this. Average industry-wide CO2 emissions from new passenger cars are not to exceed 120 grams per kilometer (g/km) by 2012, down from an average of 186 g/km in 1995 and 163 g/km in 2004. Luca De Meo, head of Fiat Auto, told Reuters that its specialty in small cars would work in its favor. "Fiat is in a good position," he said. "It will be a competitive advantage." Thomas Weber, head of research at DaimlerChrysler, acknowledged the challenge for big cars but said all classes of cars should have to make a contribution. "To reach these targets, a Smart -- which is the CO2 champion today -- has to contribute maybe 5 percent in the next years, and we with the large cars have to contribute 20 percent, or whatever," he said. His boss, Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche, coined a slogan for the group's efforts: "More power, less fuel". Ford of Europe head John Fleming said customers want it all. "I believe if you go forward five or six years you'll see our vehicles with probably smaller engines which are more CO2 and fuel efficient, but people want performance, too," he said. Al Bedwell, senior manager at J.D. Powell Automotive Forecasting, said big cars would continue to exist and find willing buyers. "In terms of people suddenly going out and buying small vehicles just to save the planet, (it is) not really (happening). People are not interested in those kinds of moves. It is only going to happen through fiscal and regulatory measures," he said. At France's Renault, strategy chief Patrick Pelata said a lot of hybrid petrol engines gave only limited CO2 reduction for a high price, and in the end they still performed worse than a diesel. "In Europe, a hybrid engine offers no improvement compared with a good diesel engine. With a hybrid engine, it costs you 1,000 euros to save a ton of CO2, while the quantity is priced at 30 euros on the CO2 derivatives market," Pelata said.
