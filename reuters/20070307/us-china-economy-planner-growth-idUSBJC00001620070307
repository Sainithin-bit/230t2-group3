 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China will keep to a path of rapid but stable economic growth in 2007, the head of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top planning agency, said on Wednesday. 


 Ma Kai told a news conference during the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, that the 10.7 percent growth in gross domestic product that China achieved last year was within a normal range. "There were no big ups or downs, meaning the stability of the economy improved," Ma said. Ma said that while fixed-asset investment had been brought under initial control, there was still pressure for a rebound in the pace of capital spending. To that end, Beijing would keep a tight grip on credit and land use as well as tightening environmental protection and energy-use standards for industry. "The main problem is that there's still a lot of projects under construction," Ma said. "There are also many newly started construction projects. And loopholes in the system that could trigger a new wave of excessive investment have yet to be plugged," he said. Ma added that the 8 percent growth target outlined by Premier Wen Jiabao on Monday at the start of the parliament session was not cast in stone, and could be adjusted. He said the property market was basically healthy, and that overall property price inflation was trending down. However, prices in some large and medium-sized cities were still too high and there was not enough affordable housing. The NDRC would take appropriate steps this year to address those issues, Ma said without providing details. Ma said the government was determined to cut pollution and save energy, but it had not set numerical targets for this year because the results would be seen only over the course of China's 2006-2010 five-year plan, as policies bear fruit. The government missed its 2006 targets for cutting the amount of energy needed to produce each unit of national income by 4 percent and for trimming key pollutants by 2 percent. Ma said China would adopt a gradual, cautious approach to reforming the way prices for natural resources such as oil, gas and water are set. The reforms were important because current prices did not reflect the true scarcity of the resources, he said. But Beijing had to proceed with caution because of the impact that higher prices would have on poorer Chinese. Ma also said that China's growing demand for energy to feed its rapid industrialization and urbanization posed no threat to global energy security, because it met about 90 percent of its needs on its own. China, the world's second-largest energy consumer, relies on its own reserves of coal to provide about 70 percent of its energy.
