 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - When you get to the bottom-line number on your tax forms, you may think you're done with all the strategizing, but that's not quite true. 


 There are still decisions to be made about how to handle the money that you either owe the Feds or the money they owe you. This year, you have more choices than ever in how to take refunds and how to pay taxes. In fact, you have enough choices to get into trouble -- if you do it wrong. Here's what you need to know now about paying and receiving that tax money. If you're getting a refund, file electronically for the fastest payout, and authorize the Internal Revenue Service to deposit it directly into your checking account. Be disciplined and use this "windfall" to pay down credit card debt or add to your savings. This year, for the first time, you can split your refund among up to three accounts, including investment accounts and your Individual Retirement Account, but that may unnecessarily complicate your financial life and cause problems, particularly if you opt for direct deposit into an IRA. That's because IRA deposits must meet strict deadlines and caps. If you're making a deductible contribution to an IRA for 2006, don't file your tax return as if you've already made the contribution and count on getting the refund deposited into the account by April 17, on time to qualify. That's a little too circular and could really mess you up. Even if you're not deducting your deposit, don't count on a direct-deposited refund to fund your 2006 deposit; you might miss that boat. Sending your refund directly into your IRA for a 2007 contribution could prove problematic, too. If there's a mistake in your tax forms and the IRS adjusts your refund up or down, you could end up with too little or too much in your IRA. Too little isn't a problem if it's your 2007 contribution; too much could invalidate your contribution. Several banks are promoting new "tax refund" accounts. They promise to open a new IRA or college savings account for you with your refund. But that might really limit the account you'd want to open. It's good to use your refund to fuel your savings, but just take the extra step of researching where you actually want to open that account and then send them a check, after your refund gets sent to your checking account. Don't sign up for any kind of "instant" refund from your tax preparer. Those are technically refund anticipation loans, and they carry bank-breaking interest rates and fees. Just wait for your refund; if you take advantage of e-filing and direct deposit, you'll have it in a few weeks. -- If you owe, you might as well wait for April 17th to send in your return and post your check. This is the cheapest way to pay your tax bill and keeps the money in your account the longest. At www.IncomeTaxPayment.com you can make your payment electronically and have your bank account debited instantly. You'll pay a service fee of $2.95, but if you'd rather go all-electronic, it's an option. Don't pay your bill by credit card; you'll have to eat a convenience fee for the transaction that can be as high as 3 percent of the total charge. If you owe more than you have, use a home equity check to bridge the gap. If you owe a lot more than you have, pay what you can now, and wait for an IRS invoice for the rest. If you still can't pay, file an IRS form 9465 to get a government-approved installment plan to pay the rest of what you owe.
