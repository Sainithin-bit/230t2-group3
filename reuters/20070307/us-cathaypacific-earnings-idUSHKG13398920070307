 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. ( 0293.HK ), Asia's third-largest carrier, posted a better-than-expected 49 percent rise in second-half earnings as passenger revenue rose and said it would increase fuel hedging to combat oil price volatility in 2007. 


 From 2007, analysts say the carrier could realize some HK$1.6 billion in annual profits from its purchasee of smaller carrier Dragonair, partly through layoffs and increased revenue from China. It bought rival Dragonair for HK$8.22 billion in 2006. Asia's largest airline by market value after Air China ( 601111.SS ) ( 0753.HK ) and Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ) plans to increase the hedging levels on its fuel bill to 50 percent in 2007, up from 40 percent in 2006, Chief Operating Officer Tony Tyler told reporters on Wednesday. That could drop to 10 percent in 2008, he added. And Cathay planned to spend HK$10 billion per year for the next three years on capital expenditure, Tyler said. The airline reported HK$2.4 billion ($307 million) in second-half net profit, up from HK$1.6 billion in the same period of last year. Full-year earnings in the year to December came in up 24 percent at HK$4.09 billion. "We expect competition to remain keen in 2007 and the high, volatile fuel price will continue to have a major impact on our business," Chairman Christopher Pratt said in a statement. "We will work to optimize the significant commercial opportunity provided by our purchase of Dragonair. Shares in Cathay closed up 1.8 percent at HK$19.20, outperforming a 0.7 percent dip in the market. Cathay began booking results from Dragonair as well as from a stake in mainland rival Air China in 2006. It posted a net profit of HK$4.09 billion ($524 million) for the year ended December 31, compared with HK$3.3 billion a year earlier. The earnings result beat an average forecast of HK$3.75 billion by 13 analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. "It's higher than expected, and comes mainly on the back of passenger yield," said Jim Wong, a Hong Kong-based analyst for BNP Paribas. It is still unclear if Cathay can sustain similar passenger yield going forward, Wong added.

But oil prices are firming. They climbed toward $61 a barrel on Wednesday, drawing strength from forecasts for a drop in U.S. gasoline inventories. A Reuters poll of analysts forecast U.S. oil at $61.37 this year and at $59.89 for 2008  <O/POLL>. The firm's passenger revenue increased by 10.9 percent to a record HK$33.6 billion, and cargo rose by 7.2 percent to 1,199,000 tonnes, the company said. Fuel costs increased due to an 18.5 percent rise in the average fuel price to US$86 per barrel and a 5.8 percent increase in consumption to 29 million barrels, the company said. Fuel surcharges increased from HK$3.9 billion to HK$6.5 billion. Fuel hedging gains -- including unrealized mark-to-market gains of HK$158 million -- increased by HK$181 million. Cathay -- which is 40 percent-controlled by Hong Kong conglomerate Swire Pacific Ltd. ( 0019.HK ) -- also plans to set up a cargo venture with partner Air China this year. (US$1=HK$7.8)
