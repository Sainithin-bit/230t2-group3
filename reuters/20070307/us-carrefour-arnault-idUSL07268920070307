 PARIS  (Reuters) - French billionaire Bernard Arnault said on Wednesday he had taken a 9.1 percent stake in supermarket giant Carrefour ( CARR.PA ) jointly with U.S. private equity group Colony Capital. 


 In a statement with Colony, Groupe Arnault said together with a 0.7 percent stake in Carrefour held by investment group Axon Capital, the consortium now controlled 9.8 percent of the world's second largest retailer. "This is a strategic, industrial and long-term investment," the group said. "Colony Capital and Groupe Arnault consider that Carrefour, a world leader in its sector, has strong potential for growth." Shares in Carrefour - which have been the focus of takeover speculation in recent weeks amid disagreements between Chairman Luc Vandevelde and the Halley family, the firm's largest shareholder with 13 percent of its stock and 26 percent of voting rights - rose sharply on the news. At 0838 GMT, Carrefour shares were 3.30 percent higher at 55.68 euros, making them the biggest gainer in France's CAC-40 index  .FCHI  of leading shares. A spokesman for Groupe Arnault said the consortium was happy for now with its 9.8 percent stake. He declined to comment on whether it intended to raise its holding further. Under French stock market law, a declaration of intentions has only to be made if a threshold of 10 percent is breached, he noted. He said the share purchases - which he said started several weeks ago - were not related to Carrefour's management spat. "The (Halley) family was told after the acquisition of the shares," the spokesman said. "There are no links to the family," he said, adding the decision to invest was taken "totally independently" from the ongoing management discussions at Carrefour. Colony Capital specializes in buying firms to actively manage their underlying real estate, something it has been instrumental in achieving at French hotel group Accor ( ACCP.PA ). Accor said on Wednesday it expected Colony to soon exercise convertible bonds it holds in the hotel and services group, which would give Colony a share in a planned Accor bonus dividend as well as potential capital gains if it chose to sell its stake.
