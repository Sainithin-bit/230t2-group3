 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Upscale retail chain Saks Inc. SKS.N posted a fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday, reversing a year-earlier loss, as improved merchandise drove better-than-expected sales, and its shares rose more than 5 percent. 


 The company also said sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of retail strength, jumped nearly 25 percent in February, a much bigger rise than analysts had expected. "You're getting a lot of things good happening at one time for the company," said Rusty Robinson, founder and president of Robinson Investment Group, a Brentwood, Tennessee, value equity firm. "The market is rewarding that." Selling mid-tier chains such as Parisian's has "allowed Saks to become extremely focused on what they know in the major metropolitan markets," Robinson added. The operator of Saks Fifth Avenue stores earned $21.5 million, or 14 cents a share, in the fourth quarter ended February 3, compared with a year-earlier loss of $2.2 million, or 2 cents a share. The latest quarter included an extra week. Excluding special items, profit in the latest period came to 19 cents a share, compared with 22 cents a share expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Saks, which is focusing on its high-end Saks stores after selling off other department store chains, said results were helped by a 9.9 percent rise in sales at stores open at least a year, gross margin improvement and expense control. Same-store sales rose 24.7 percent in the four weeks ended March 3. Analysts, on average, were expecting a rise of 6.8 percent for February. Total quarterly sales rose 17 percent to $955 million, better than the $911.9 million analysts had expected. Saks said sales in New York as well as in smaller markets such as Birmingham, Alabama, were strong. Saks, which carries high-end brands such as Gucci and Chanel, said it was selling more full-priced merchandise, and customer traffic and average sale trends improved during the quarter. Online sales were up nearly 40 percent. "We've made much progress on understanding our core customer by trade area," Saks Chief Executive Steve Sadove said during a conference call. The company said gross margin improved to 37.9 percent of sales from 33.6 percent a year earlier. Saks said it believes an 8 percent operating margin could be reached within the next three years or so. For 2007, it said operating margin excluding certain items should approach 4 percent. "Here's a company that has long been a value stock," said Robinson, who added that improving same-store sales could spur investor interest in Saks and perhaps a buyout. "All of a sudden, it may become a growth stock," he said. Saks has 54 Saks Fifth Avenue stores, 49 Saks Off 5th outlets, and 62 Club Libby Lu specialty stores for young females. Saks shares were up $1, or 5.3 percent, to $19.74 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as much as 9 percent earlier in the day. So far this year, the stock is up about 10 percent.
