 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. factory orders suffered the steepest drop in six years last month and an index of homes sales fell, according to data on Tuesday highlighting weak spots in the economy that could derail its recovery. 


 Separately, fourth-quarter U.S. worker productivity was revised sharply lower and unit labor costs soared, suggesting inflation pressure that might make the Federal Reserve wary of cutting interest rates despite worries about growth. U.S. Treasury bond prices declined over the session in the face of an advancing stock market and largely ignored the data, which included a warning that manufacturers might hold back from spending while waiting for signs of stronger demand. "That's what got the market more excited, that there may be a more broad-based slowdown in business activity, which could transfer into (weaker) employment," said Cary Leahey at Decision Economics in New York. The Commerce Department said U.S. factory orders fell 5.6 percent last month and that durable goods orders were revised to an even steeper 8.7 percent decline, compared with the 7.8 percent retreat announced last week. "The orders report ... suggest that there is a significant loss of confidence in companies regarding new investments," Leahey said. Non-defense capital goods spending excluding aircraft, seen as a good proxy for business investment, slumped 6.3 percent in January for the deepest decline in three years. Worry that weakness in manufacturing and housing could spill into the wider U.S. economy were among the factors that spooked equity investors last week and sent markets tumbling. Wall Street had a much better day on Tuesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  closing up 157 points at 12,207. The Fed expects both sectors to recover this year, helping lift growth gradually from a tepid 2.2 percent fourth quarter pace, and had seen early signs housing was stabilizing. Pending sales of existing homes fell a steeper-than-expected 4.1 percent last month, according to the National Association of Realtors, though some analysts thought this might be related to cold weather in some U.S. regions. "All home sales slowed in January with the return of cold winter weather," said Christopher Low at FTN Financial. LABOR COSTS Alongside a recovery in housing, the Fed, which has held interest rates steady at 5.25 percent since June, also expects inflation to moderate slowly this year and will scrutinize the latest revision to U.S. productivity growth. The Labor Department said nonfarm business productivity slowed sharply to a 1.6 percent annualized pace in the fourth quarter from the 3.0 percent previously reported. This trimmed productivity gains for 2006 as a whole to 1.6 percent, the weakest rise since a matching pace set in 1997. The slippage also sent unit labor costs, a gauge of inflation and profit pressure watched closely by the Fed, up by a hefty 6.6 percent annualized rate in the fourth quarter. For the year as a whole, unit labor costs rose 3.2 percent, the largest gain since 2000. "This data will likely continue to keep the Fed focused on the risks of rising inflation. Labor costs make up close to 70 percent of total firm costs," economists at Lehman Brothers wrote in a note to clients. On the other hand, some said the fourth-quarter unit labor cost rise might have been skewed by bonus payments and forecast a slowing in labor cost gains in the first quarter of 2007. "It's not friendly to see unit labor cost jumping like this. But it is profit-based compensation rather than hourly labor costs. You have a lot of noise based on the variability with the bonuses and profit-based compensations," said Keith Hembre at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis. Federal Reserve officials worry slowing productivity could push up wage inflation amid tight labor markets. But they also have said that the decline will probably prove to be a temporary, cyclical phenomenon, and do not see it as a warning that the United States is losing its competitive edge. In addition, analysts had anticipated productivity would be revised down after fourth-quarter economic growth was trimmed back, while U.S. employment stayed strong. Other data released on Tuesday showed U.S. chain store sales slipped 0.4 percent in the week ending March 3 but were up 1.5 percent year-on-year, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers and UBS Securities. Separately, U.S. chain store sales calculated by Redbook Research showed a 2.9 percent rise last week, versus the same week in 2006.
