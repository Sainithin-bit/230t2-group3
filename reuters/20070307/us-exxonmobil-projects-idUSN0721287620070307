 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) plans to start 25 new global projects in the next three years, adding about 1 million barrels of oil equivalent per day to its base volumes when they reach their peak, the world's largest publicly traded oil company said on Wednesday. 


 The company said its current project inventory is expected to produce 24 billion oil-equivalent barrels over the life of the projects. Exxon Mobil Senior Vice President Stuart McGill said the company plans to start production at seven new projects in 2007 that will add about 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to the company's base volumes. The projects the company plans to bring on line this year include four projects in Europe, two projects in Angola, and a liquefied natural gas (LNG) unit at its RasGas project in Qatar. It plans to startup 18 additional projects over the course of 2008 and 2009, including the company's Thunder Horse joint venture with BP Plc ( BP.L ), several projects in Qatar and West Africa, and three LNG terminals. The company also said it has more than 30 other major projects it plans to start up in 2010 or later. Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive, also said he expects the company's capital spending to be around $20 billion a year through 2011. "I expect very active levels of investment beyond the end of the decade," Tillerson, speaking at the company's analyst meeting in New York. Shares of the Irving, Texas-based company were up 30 cents at $71.30 in late morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Euan Rocha  and  Michele Gershberg )
