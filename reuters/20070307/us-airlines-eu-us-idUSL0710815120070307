 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - A draft U.S.-European Union agreement on liberalizing transatlantic air travel requires the unanimous backing of the 27 member states, according to the EU Council's legal service, an EU diplomat said on Wednesday. 


 The legal opinion gives Britain a potential veto over the pact clinched last Friday by EU and U.S. negotiators, which British Airways BAY.L and Virgin Atlantic VA.UL have attacked as unfair. The diplomat said while the EU decides on most transport issues by qualified majority voting, the "open skies" accord was a so-called mixed agreement, involving the competencies of both the Union and the member states, "so it requires consensus".
