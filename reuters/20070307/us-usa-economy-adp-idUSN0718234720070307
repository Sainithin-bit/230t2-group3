 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers likely added 57,000 new jobs in February, about half of what economists had expected, according to a report released on Wednesday, indicating weakness in the labor market and a slowing economy. 


 The reading was lower than a median forecast of 100,000 for the ADP survey from economists polled by Reuters, and followed a revised 121,000 increase in employment shown by the series in the previous month. "The deceleration of employment is consistent with the slowdown in GDP growth we've had in the last year," said Joel Prakken, Chairman, Macroeconomic Advisers, LLC. Industries producing physical goods lost 43,000 jobs in February, with the manufacturing sector alone shedding 29,000 jobs, according to the report by ADP, a private employment service. The services industry added 100,000 jobs. The revision was due to a change in methodology for all data going back to January 2001 for the monthly report done by ADP and Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. The February 2007 report is the first regularly released ADP Report to incorporate those key methodology changes, ADP said. The changes in report methodology include: a larger sample of payrolls; improved procedures for seasonal adjustment; better detection of anomalies and additional detail on private nonfarm employment by select industry and by size of payroll. Automatic Data Processing, based in Roseland, New Jersey, is the parent of ADP Employer Services and is a large payroll services company. Macroeconomic Advisers LLC is based in St. Louis, Missouri. The ADP National Employment Report is released each month, two days prior to the government's own job survey. According to the latest Reuters poll of economists, the U.S. Labor Department's closely watched employment report on Friday is expected to show that 100,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were created in February, down from 111,000 in January. Based on the latest derivatives auction conducted on Wednesday by Goldman Sachs, interdealer broker ICAP and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, traders' median expectation for the February payrolls report was for a gain of 93,100 jobs. The dollar was little changed after the data which came ahead of a release on U.S. consumer credit and the Beige Book, the round-up of business conditions from the 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks produced before every FOMC meeting. U.S. Treasuries initially extended gains but then eased back.
