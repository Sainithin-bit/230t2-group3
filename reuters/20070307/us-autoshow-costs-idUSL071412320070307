 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Faced with a growing number of models and mounting pressure to reduce emissions, European car makers are forming alliances to share parts, factories and research to cut costs in the highly competitive industry. 


 Not only are they doing it to keep down the retail price of their cars, but also to share the cost of developing new technologies such as hybrid engines. "That is the biggest challenge for the industry: how to boost the quality and to multiply the number of models," PSA Peugeot Citroen Chief Executive Christian Streiff said at the Geneva auto show. "For us, it is a matter of a shared platform policy and the use of common parts." Despite having shunned the idea for fear of diluting its premium brand, Porsche has also begun to show an openness to the idea. "We have no fear of contact," Chief Executive Wendelin Wiedeking told reporters at the show. He did not elaborate. Renault has the ultimate alliance with Nissan, in which the French automaker owns about 44 percent. But in terms of the number of alliances formed, PSA and Fiat lead the way. For example, Fiat is building its new Cinquecento model on a platform for small cars being jointly developed with Ford Motor, while PSA is making engines with Ford Motor and relies on Mitsubishi Motors for its SUV vehicles. Fiat and PSA even make a van together. Although it has more than 10 alliances, Fiat Auto brand head Luca De Meo said he was always ready to consider forming more. "If there's an opportunity that would be benefit us and would be consistent with our strategy, we will look at it," he told Reuters. Alliances are also helping them enter new markets, such as China and India, two burgeoning markets where local expertise is essential. On February 26, Nissan said it would join Renault and Mahindra & Mahindra to build a car factory in India. Renault and Nissan had held talks with General Motors but its talks with the U.S. giant got nowhere. MAKING A LIVING Banca IMI analyst Sabine Blumel said alliances were an urgent matter for makers of small and medium-sized cars as their margins are tighter than for premium brands such as Porsche. "They are under pressure to make a living in Europe," she said. "There will be more players, and the size of the cake is not getting bigger," said Deutsche Bank analyst Gaetan Toulemonde, referring to the arrival of Chinese and Indian cars in Europe. Blumel did not expect alliances to lead to mergers among European manufacturers because they wanted to avoid the political fall-out from job cuts and plant closures. "Grand mergers in Europe -- you can rule them out because it is a political issue," she said. The problem with partnerships was that it made it difficult to judge whether one member was losing sales to the other on the same model they worked on together, according to Nicla Di Palma at Sanford Bernstein. "You have to compare ... the savings you get forming an alliance ... against the possible loss of sales," she said. Di Palma said alliances formed among members of the same group such as Volkswagen and Porsche appeared to be more viable than those formed between competitors. Deutsche's Toulemonde said he preferred alliances like that between Renault and Nissan. "Renault and Nissan can share information a lot more than Fiat and PSA can on a van project," he said. "I prefer to have one wife than five mistresses," he added. (Additional reporting by Marcel Michelson, Benoit Overstraeten,  Christiaan Hetzner )
