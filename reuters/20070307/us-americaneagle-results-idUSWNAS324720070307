 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Eagle Outfitters Inc. AEOS.O posted quarterly profit that met expectations but its outlook failed to impress investors, who sent the shares down more than 3 percent. 


 The teen clothing retailer said it expects to earn between 31 cents a share and 33 cents a share in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. Analysts expect 33 cents a share. The company's stock fell 97 cents, or 3.27 percent, to $28.86 in morning Nasdaq trading. Sales at stores open at least a year, a key measure called same-store sales, increased 16 percent to $166.3 million in February, helped by the popularity of its early spring fashions, the company said. Fourth-quarter profit was $150.2 million, or 66 cents per share, compared with $107.5 million, or 47 cents per share a year ago. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings per share of 66 cents on sales of $940.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales increased 27 percent to $973.4 million. Same-store sales increased 14 percent in the quarter compared with the year-ago period. Results were based on 14 weeks of sales compared with 13 weeks a year earlier. The company's board authorized the repurchase of 7 million shares on Tuesday, and the company set a quarterly cash dividend of $0.075 a share payable on April 13.
