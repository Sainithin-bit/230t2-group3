 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China's growing demand for energy poses no threat to global energy security, the head of the National Development and Reform Commission, China's top economic planning agency, said on Wednesday. 


 Ma Kai told a news conference during the annual session of the National People's Congress, China's parliament, that while the country did need more energy to fuel its industrialization, it was about 90 percent self-sufficient. China is the world's second-largest energy consumer. It relies heavily on its own reserves of coal to meet that demand. Ma said China not only imports oil and gas but also exports energy. Last year, coal exports were at 63.3 million tonnes and that of coke more than 13 million tonnes. China also exports energy indirectly, he said, such as 40 million tonnes of steel and 1.2 million tonnes of primary aluminum, both products that consume energy in making. "So we are contributing to the world's energy," he said. Beijing has removed or reduced tax rebates on some metals and petroleum exports to curb excessive investment in energy-intensive sectors.
