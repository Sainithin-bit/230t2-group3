 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nikko Cordial Corp.'s 8603.T biggest shareholder, Harris Associates LP, dismissed Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) $10.8 billion takeover offer for Japan's third-largest brokerage as too low, Bloomberg reported. 


 Harris Associates, which owns about 7.5 percent of Nikko, won't accept Citigroup's bid of 1,350 yen ($11.60) per share, David Herro, chief investment officer of international equities at the $75 billion fund, said in an interview, according to Bloomberg. "It's worth substantially more than that," said Herro, adding that Nikko is worth at least 2,000 yen a share. "We welcome Citigroup's involvement but certainly not at that price," Bloomberg said.
