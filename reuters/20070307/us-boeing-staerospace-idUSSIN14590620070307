 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Boeing ( BA.N ) and Singapore's ST Engineering ( STEG.SI ) said on Wednesday that they will jointly convert Boeing 767 passenger planes into freighter aircraft in a deal worth $136 million over 10 years. 


 The deal reflects strong demand for cargo aircraft and as airlines phase out 767s from their fleets, replacing them with more modern, fuel-efficient planes such as Boeing's hot-selling 787 or Dreamliner. Confirming a Reuters report from Tuesday, ST Engineering said its ST Aerospace division would perform aircraft maintenance and passenger-to-freighter conversion with data provided by Boeing. The first conversions will be carried out in Singapore for Japan's All Nippon Airways ( 9202.T ), which has an order for five of its 767s to be converted, with options for two more. ST Aerospace expects the first converted 767 to take off by the middle of next year. Boeing has made more than 900 of the 767, which started flying in 1982. Marco Cavazzoni, vice president at Boeing Commercial Airplanes, told a news conference that he was in talks with other potential customers but declined to be more specific. The potential global market for 767 conversions is around 600 planes. The plane can carry around 50 tonnes of cargo on 24 pallets. Turning a passenger plane into a freighter takes three months and includes strengthening of the main deck floors, remodelling cabin interiors and installing a large cargo door near the front of the plane. Freighter conversions are an easy way for airlines to extend the lifespan of aircraft that are due to be replaced, allowing them to earn revenues from planes that are no longer suitable for passenger use. The conversion costs a fraction of the price of a new cargo plane and carriers that turn their planes into freighters can either add them to their own cargo fleet or sell them to other operators. Shares in ST Engineering were unchanged at S$3.22 by 0333 GMT, underperforming Singapore's stock market index .STI.
