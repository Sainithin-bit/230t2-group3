 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy generated 93,100 jobs in February, if wagers in the derivatives market on Wednesday have it right. 


 The results were below forecasts from Wall Street economists, which hovered around the 100,000-mark. Economic derivatives are offered by Goldman Sachs, interdealer broker ICAP and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  CME.N. The U.S. Labor Department will issue the January non-farm payroll report on Friday at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT). A separate report of U.S. private employers out on Wednesday showed a more subdued gain of 57,000.
