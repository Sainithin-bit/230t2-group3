 GENEVA  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will consider adding production capacity in Russia to meet rising demand in Europe's fastest-growing major market, the head of the automaker's European operations said on Wednesday. 


 If Ford succeeds with a bid it is now readying for the Romanian assets of the former Daewoo Motor, that would also open the way for expanded sales in eastern Europe, Ford of Europe Chief Executive John Fleming told reporters. Ford's cautious expansion in Europe, where the automaker expects to post a fourth consecutive profitable year, is a contrast to North America, where the Detroit-based automaker is shedding jobs and closing plants after a record loss. Ford expects sales in Russia this year to top the roughly 118,000 vehicles it sold in 2006 and will consider adding manufacturing capacity there over the next year or so, said Fleming, speaking on the sidelines of the Geneva auto show. "Probably in the next six to 12 months we'll start to firm up on what we want to do," Fleming said. "I think we can sell more vehicles in Russia this year than we did last year, and that's what I'm looking for -- continuous improvement." Ford, which entered the Russian market in 2000, has a single Russian plant dedicated to its entry-level Focus sedan. That St. Petersburg facility is running near its full capacity of about 75,000 vehicles annually with three shifts. About half of the cars Ford sold in Russia last year were made there, leaving the rest subject to import duties. Ford plans to roll out its new and more upscale Mondeo sedan for Russia this year, and Fleming said Ford would have to weigh the benefits of expansion against other opportunities. "We don't have an open checkbook to just do anything we want. So we continue to look at what makes sense for the business," Fleming said. "Yes, it would be nice to expand in Russia, but it's nice to bring a new Mondeo to the market as well. We'll have to look at that balance." Fleming said that if Ford succeeded in buying the Romanian government's majority stake in carmaker Daewoo Automobile that could also free up more vehicles for the Russian market. "It's a consideration. The lower we can make the manufacturing costs, the more opportunities there are in the emerging markets," Fleming said. But he added that was not the only factor for Ford. "I think there's a huge opportunity in Eastern Europe," he said. Fleming said Ford's focus was on sustainable growth in a European market where overall sales for the industry are expected to be almost flat this year. "I just want to build the business and the quality of the business rather than just aggressively rushing for volume, or rushing for share," he said. The Romanian government has said it hopes to wrap up the process by June, after it bought back the majority stake in the company from its bankrupt owner late last year. So far, Romania has received four letters of intent from General Motors Corp and Ford, Tata and China's Chery Automobile. Daewoo Motor collapsed in 2000. Many of the Korean automaker's other assets were purchased by GM in 2002, which is using its GM Daewoo unit as a hub for global small car development. Ford, which lost a record $12.7 billion in North America last year, is closing 14 North American plants and cutting 37,000 factory jobs and 14,000 salaried workers as part of a plan to return to profit by 2009.
