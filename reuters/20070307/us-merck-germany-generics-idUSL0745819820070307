 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Nonbinding offers for the generics business of Merck KGaA ( MRCG.DE ), worth at least 4 billion euros ($5.3 billion), are due on Monday, a source close to the sale process told Reuters, confirming a newspaper report. 


 In an advance copy of an article to be published on Thursday, the Financial Times Deutschland said Bain and Apax were preparing a joint bid, as were KKR and Warburg Pincus. It said Carlyle was also mulling a bid, citing banking sources. The German newspaper said Merck's Chief Financial Officer Michael Becker expected to make 5 billion euros from the sale, citing an insider. Apax declined to comment on the report and KKR was not immediately available. Merck's generics business was the world's third-largest in 2006 with sales of some 1.8 billion euros. People familiar with the situation have told Reuters that first-round offers are due by mid-March, with U.S.-based Mylan Laboratories MYL.N among the potential bidders. Iceland's Actavis ACT.IC and Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd RANB.O of India have both said publicly they are keen to acquire the business. Industry sources have also told Reuters that Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd TEVA.O and Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd ( REDY.BO ), along with several private equity houses, are also eyeing the operation.
