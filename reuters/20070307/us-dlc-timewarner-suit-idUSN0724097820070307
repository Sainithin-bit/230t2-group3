 CLEVELAND  (Reuters) - The state of Ohio said on Wednesday that it had reached a $144 million settlement with Time Warner Inc. on behalf of six state funds that claimed they were defrauded after the media conglomerate merged with the online service AOL. 


 The Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation and five state pension funds claimed they lost nearly $400 million in the wake of the 2001 deal when the stock of the merged company plunged to less than $10 from $48 a share. The bureau and the pension funds claimed the company had misrepresented sales and subscriber figures ahead of the merger. Keith Cocozza, a spokesman for Time Warner, said the company had not admitted any wrongdoing or liability as part of the agreement. In announcing the settlement, the largest of its kind in Ohio history, Marc Dann, the state's attorney general, told reporters "this sends a clear message that we will not, as citizens or investors, tolerate fraud, stock manipulation or deceit." Ohio still has a pending case against Ernst & Young, AOL's accountant. "I don't believe our recovery will be anything near the hundreds of millions of dollars," Dann said of the ongoing litigation against E&Y. "But the case is out and we will continue to pursue it." Ohio's settlement is the latest in a series stemming from cases brought by investors, who watched some $200 billion in shareholder value in Time Warner stock disappear following the merger of AOL and Time Warner. Time Warner settled suits brought by U.S. prosecutors over accounting problems at its AOL Internet division from inflated sales figures from transactions that occurred prior to the merger. Dann's predecessor, Jim Petro, had opted out of a federal class-action lawsuit against the company -- a decision that Dann said yielded the state an extra $135 million.
