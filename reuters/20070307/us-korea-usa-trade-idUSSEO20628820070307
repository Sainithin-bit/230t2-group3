 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korean and U.S. negotiators start a round of crunch trade talks on Thursday, hoping to reach agreement before an end-March deadline which could lead to the biggest U.S. free trade pact in 15 years. 


 The deal, which studies said could add about $20 billion to their annual $71.5 billion in trade, needs to be wrapped up by the end of the month in order to meet provisions of a U.S. trade law that allows the White House to negotiate agreements lawmakers can reject but not amend. "We will be pursuing discussions to reach agreement in all areas," the South Korean trade ministry said in a statement on Wednesday, adding it would exercise "maximum flexibility" to that end. Top U.S. and South Korean negotiators said last month there had been progress when they concluded the last round in Washington, but the two sides had chosen to sidestep the most politically sensitive areas of farm goods and trade remedies. "We will be seeking an agreement on all items in the negotiations for tariff concessions in the agricultural sector, except a few super-sensitive items," the ministry said. With time running out, the negotiators will be turning over any part of the proposed deal on which they fail to reach agreement to senior officials from the two sides to hammer out last-minute compromises, the South Korean ministry said. "In the event there are few unresolved contentious issues, we will seek a final agreement through high-level discussions by the end of March," the ministry said. U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, in South Korea on Wednesday as part of a three-country Asia trip, expressed a strong commitment to reaching a deal soon, South Korea's Finance Ministry said in a statement. Washington's chief agricultural negotiator Richard Crowder will be in Seoul immediately after the official talks to narrow gaps in market opening in farm goods, preceded by specialist negotiators in textiles and intellectual property rights. The deal could be the biggest U.S. free trade pact since the North America Free Trade Agreement was signed in 1992. South Korea's is the seventh-largest trading partner of the United States.
