 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) and Pioneer Corp. ( 6773.T ) said on Wednesday they would delay their annual earnings reports by a few weeks due to extra paperwork needed to comply with tougher U.S. accounting rules, joining other U.S.-traded Japanese companies such as Hitachi Ltd. ( 6501.T ). 


 In a sign that the effect of the more stringent standards could be limited, however, South Korean and Chinese firms with U.S.-traded shares, including flat panel maker LG.Philips LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ), said they have no plan to delay their earnings. This is the first business year that foreign companies will have to comply with the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which calls for a number of changes in corporate governance and the way financial results are reported. Sony, whose American Depositary Receipts ( SNE.N ) are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, said it would report its results for the year ending in March on May 16, instead of around the end of April. "We have a lot more paperwork to do in order to deal with the rules," said Sony spokeswoman Mami Imada. She said Sony might take the same amount of time again next year due to the amount of paperwork involved. Pioneer, a plasma TV and car electronics maker, said it is likely to announce its full-year earnings in mid-May instead of late April for similar reasons. Shares in Pioneer are not traded in the United States but it compiles results based on U.S. accounting standards. Among South Korean firms, POSCO Co. Ltd. ( 005490.KS ), the world's number three steel maker, Kookmin Bank 060000.KS, Shinhan Financial Group ( 055550.KS ) as well as LG.Philips LCD said they expect no earnings delays at the moment because of the new rules. Kookmin Bank is South Korea's top lender while Shinhan is the number two financial services firm. In China, PetroChina Co. Ltd. ( 0857.HK ) and Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. (Chalco) ( 2600.HK ), the world's third-largest oil producer and second-largest alumina producer respectively, said there will be no delays to their earnings release schedules. MIXED RESPONSES The Sarbanes-Oxley act was passed by U.S. Congress to combat corporate fraud in the wake of accounting scandals at Enron and WorldCom. Some aspects of the law, notably a section requiring company managers to disclose regularly how they keep their books in order, have attracted criticism from groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which say complying with it is too burdensome. Besides Sony and Pioneer, Japanese electronics parts maker TDK Corp. ( 6762.T ) plans to announce its full-year earnings on May 15, rather than late April, while Tokyo-based electronics conglomerates Hitachi and NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ) have said they will postpone their results reports to some time in May. NEC, dogged by accounting troubles, is also having to recalculate earnings results for the past business year, after an independent auditor asked it to document fair pricing of the company's maintenance services. Other Japanese companies whose shares are traded in the United States, including Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ), NTT DoCoMo Inc. ( 9437.T ), Canon Inc. ( 7751.T ) and Panasonic maker Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. ( 6752.T ), said they have no plan to delay their earnings announcements. Shares in Sony closed down 1.2 percent at 5,820 yen, and Pioneer was down 1.6 percent at 1,503 yen, while the Tokyo stock market's electrical machinery index .IELEC.T lost 1.24 percent.
