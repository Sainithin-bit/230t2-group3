 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Boeing ( BA.N ) and Singapore's ST Engineering ( STEG.SI ) will jointly convert Boeing 767 passenger planes into freighter aircraft in a deal worth $136 million, the two firms said on Wednesday. 


 Confirming a Reuters report from Tuesday, an ST Engineering statement said its subsidiary ST Aerospace would perform aircraft maintenance and passenger-to-freighter conversion with data provided by Boeing under the 10-year contract. The deal comes on the back of strong demand for cargo aircraft and as airlines phase out 767s from their fleets, replacing them with more modern, fuel-efficient planes such as Boeing's hot-selling 787 or Dreamliner.
