 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Men's Wearhouse Inc. ( MW.N ) posted a 60 percent rise in quarterly net income on Wednesday due to fatter gross profit margins and raised its quarterly dividend by a penny to 6 cents per share. 


 The retailer of men's fashions also posted a first quarter and fiscal 2007 outlook above Wall Street estimates, sending shares up nearly 4 percent in extended trading. Men's Wearhouse said net income -- helped by an extra week in the fourth quarter -- was $52.3 million, or 95 cents per share, compared with $32.7 million, or 60 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, excluding $4.5 million in discrete tax items, the company earned 87 cents per share. That compares to average Wall Street view of 75 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 12 percent in the quarter to $556.8 million. Better-than-expected store traffic in Canadian stores helped boost gross profit margins, together with a strong extra week in the year, the company said. Looking to the first quarter of 2007, Men's Wearhouse said it expects net earnings to range between 63 cents and 67 cents, with same-store sales growth to range between 1 percent and 2 percent in the United States. Three analysts polled by Reuters Estimates had been expecting, on average, first-quarter net earnings of 60 cents. For the full year, the company expects earnings to range between $2.80 and $2.91 based on the above same-store sales estimate. That compares with an average Wall Street view of $2.76, according to Reuters Estimates. Men's Wearhouse expects to close its acquisition of After Hours Formalwear, a $250 million tuxedo rental company, in the first half of fiscal 2007. The company's shares rose to $44.88, up 3.6 percent, in after-hours trading after closing at $43.30 on the New York Stock Exchange.
