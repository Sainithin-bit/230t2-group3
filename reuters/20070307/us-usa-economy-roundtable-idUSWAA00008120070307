 BOSTON  (Reuters) - U.S. chief executives and chief financial officers expect continued growth in the economy, even as major indexes wobble on investor anxiety, according to a pair of quarterly surveys released on Wednesday. 


 The Business Roundtable said its CEO Economic Outlook Index rose to 84.9 in March from 81.9 in December, which had been the lowest since 2003. Any reading higher than 50 indicates expansion. The survey was conducted between February 8-22, before last week's decline of over 4 percent in major U.S. stock indexes and prior to some recent data suggesting weak spots in the economy. Since last week's sharp drop, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  has largely remained above the 12,000-point level, which it most recently passed in November. "American CEOs are maintaining their generally favorable view of the economy, projecting a stable employment picture and modest increases in sales and capital spending over the next six months," said Harold McGraw III, president and chief executive of The McGraw-Hill Cos. Inc. MHP.N, who also serves as chairman of the Roundtable. The report tallied the views of 113 of the group's 160 member companies. Roundtable companies have an estimated total $4.5 trillion in annual revenue. The CEOs forecast 2.9 percent growth in U.S. gross domestic product this year, up from a prior outlook of 2.8 percent. CEOs were also upbeat on sales prospects for the next six months, with 73 percent expecting them to rise. However, they were more cautious on capital spending and employment, with 47 percent and 45 percent, respectively, expecting those measures to remain unchanged. But 44 percent of respondents said they saw capital spending rising while 33 percent expected to hire more people. CFOS SHARE OPTIMISM A separate survey of chief financial officers found that 35 percent of CFOs said they are more optimistic about the U.S. economy than they were three months ago, up from 30 percent who expressed that sentiment in the last quarterly survey and 20 percent who said they were optimistic in September -- a five-year low. The Duke University/CFO Magazine Business Outlook survey of 454 U.S. CFOs found that the number of CFOs who had become more pessimistic about the economy fell to 27 percent from 35 percent a quarter ago. That marked the first time in a year that optimists outnumbered pessimists in the survey. McGraw said the biggest risk factors CEOs are concerned about are the possibility that consumer spending would fall off its recent pace or inflation would rise. That could prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, investors fear. "Consumer spending continues at a rapid pace, and cost-of-living increases to the individual, whether it be gas pumps, credit cards, mortgages or whatever, are certainly factors, and the fact that the savings rate is negative is also not a good situation," McGraw said on a media conference call. "You've got a stretched consumer, and consumer demand is about two-thirds of the economy," he said, adding he did not believe last week's stock-market volatility had significantly changed CEOs' views. "They are less concerned about a downturn," McGraw said. "They are seeing it as part of the cycle. The growth is more solid, more steady." Concerns about a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy have prompted some companies to take a more cautious tone in their statements of late. In a presentation to investors on Wednesday, United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) Chairman and Chief Executive George David noted, "You ought to expect organic growth rates to sustain, as long as we have good economies."
