 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers likely added 57,000 new jobs in February, according to a survey by ADP Employer Services, a private employment service, released on Wednesday. 


 The reading was lower than a median forecast of 100,000 for the ADP survey from economists polled by Reuters, and added to a revised 121,000 increase in employment shown by the series in the previous month. The revision was due to a change in methodology for all data going back to January 2001 for the monthly survey done by ADP and Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. The February 2007 report is the first regularly released ADP Report to incorporate those key methodology changes, ADP said.
