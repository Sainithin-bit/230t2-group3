 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin said it expects a contract for a fourth batch of F-35 fighter jets it is building for the U.S. Defense Department to be profitable. 

 "We're early in the LRIP-4 (low initial rate production) contract right now but every so often we do calculate an estimate to complete and we expect to complete that contract with a profit," Tom Burbage, executive vice president for F-35 program integration at Lockheed, told a media briefing at the Paris Air Show on Tuesday. The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter is the world's largest weapons program, projected to cost more than $380 billion in the next decades. The fighter jet has come under scrutiny as pressure mounts to cut federal U.S. budget deficits. Some U.S. lawmakers have suggested the Pentagon think of alternatives to the program if costs cannot be brought down. Program managers said the F-35 program had improved on some measures and that flight tests were running ahead of schedule but conceded there were still challenges. "We're focused on every component of potential long-term cost," said Major General C.D. Moore, deputy program executive officer of the F-35. "On the production side, we've made progress in driving down the cost of the weapons system over the first four production lines," Moore said. "However, from a government perspective customer, we expect the cost to continue coming down." The radar-evading plane is being developed with eight foreign partners. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs )
