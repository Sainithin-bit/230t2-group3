 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's ruling Socialists lost more ground against the main conservative opposition party, paying the price for new austerity measures, two opinion polls showed late on Tuesday. 

 The ruling PASOK party's support has declined steadily since George Papandreou's government accepted a 110-billion-euro bailout from the European Union and International Monetary Fund last year and embarked on a belt-tightening campaign to save Greece from default. PASOK's declining popularity could complicate Papandreou's push to implement a new five-year austerity plan agreed with international lenders to secure further funding for his country. The poll by the GPO polling agency for Mega TV showed PASOK behind the conservative New Democracy, which ruled from 2004 to 2009, by 0.9 percentage points. In the pollster's previous survey in May PASOK lead New Democracy by 1.7 percentage points. In a bid to quell dissent for a new bout of austerity within his own party, Papandreou reshuffled his cabinet last week and his government is expected to survive a vote of confidence late on Tuesday. Asked about the new cabinet, about 35 percent of the respondents believed it would be more effective versus 63 percent who gave a negative response. A total of 55 percent of those surveyed said the government should complete its four-year term which expires late in 2013, while 39 percent were in favor of a snap election. Another poll for Alter TV showed the ruling party were 1.7 percentage points behind New Democracy, which had the support of 21.3 percent of those asked from 20.4 percent in a previous poll. Backing for PASOK fell to 19.6 percent from 20.7 percent. (Reporting by Angeliki Koutantou)
