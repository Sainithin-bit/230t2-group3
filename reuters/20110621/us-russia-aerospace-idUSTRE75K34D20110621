 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin will visit the Paris Air Show on Tuesday, where Russian companies will be displaying a wide range of both civil and military planes and technologies. 

 Below are key facts about Russia's aerospace industry: AIRLINES Russia's biggest airline is Aeroflot, 51 percent owned by the Russian government and just under 15 percent owned by wealthy businessman Alexander Lebedev. It operates a fleet of 98 aircraft and transported 11.3 million passengers in 2010, up 29 percent on the previous year. Its 2010 net profit tripled year-on-year to $253 million. The company flies both Airbus and Boeing planes and has announced orders for Boeing's delayed 787 Dreamliner and, more recently, 777 models. It is also a buyer of Russia's mid-size Superjet 100. Chief Executive Vitaly Savelyev said in April the airline may sign orders at the Paris Air Show. Russia's second biggest airline is Transaero, which carried 6.65 million passengers last year, 32.3 percent more than in 2009. It has a fleet of 64 aircraft, almost all of them Boeing models, while sources have told Reuters the carrier has plans to launch a $200 million initial public offering. CIVIL MANUFACTURING Russia delivered its first Superjet 100 mid-size airline to Armenia's Armavia in April, the first purchase of a Russian passenger plane since the fall of the Soviet Union. The much-delayed Superjet is a joint project led by Russia's state-owned aerospace firm Sukhoi in partnership with Italy's Finmeccanica and Boeing. The aircraft has 170 orders to date, and puts near-term future demand at 800. It can seat up to 98 passengers and is intended to compete with Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer. Superjet is also looking to bring a business jet version of the Superjet 100 to the market. State-controlled Irkut is building the MC-21 larger passenger jet to compete with the next generation of Boeing and Airbus models. At a far earlier stage of development, the airliner is hoping to win certification at around 2016. SAFETY CONCERNS Russian planes have been involved in two fatal crashes in the past 18 months, most notably the incident that killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 other passengers in April 2010. The most recent crash occurred when a passenger jet caught fire while trying to land in north-western Russia on Monday, killing 44 people and leaving eight survivors badly hurt. Both planes were Soviet-era Tupolev models. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has swapped his Tupolev Presidential plane for a French-made executive jet. MILITARY AIRCRAFT Sukhoi and Irkut are part of state-controlled holding company the United Aircraft Corporation (UAC), created by Putin during his 2000-2008 presidency to be a national champion for plane manufacturing. UAC, which also includes Irkut and Mikoyan (MiG) builds a range of fighter planes including a modernized Su-35 multi-role fighter and the MiG-35, potential competitors to Lockheed Martin's F-35. Russia has a long track record of selling fighter jets to India, but received a blow in April when the MiG-35 was rejected by India for a $11 billion fighter plane contract. HELICOPTERS Russia's government brought 11 regional helicopter manufacturers under single holding company Russian Helicopters last year in an attempt to revive an industry left in ruins by the Soviet collapse. The company builds a family of Mi-branded vehicles and plans to deliver 262 helicopters this year, up from 214 in 2010. Analysts estimate that around half of orders over the next decade will come from overseas buyers. Russian Helicopters attempted to raise around $500 million from a London initial public offering earlier this year, but was forced to cancel plans after failing to receive the desired valuation from investors.
