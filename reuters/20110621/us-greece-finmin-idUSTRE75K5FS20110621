 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's top priority after the new government wins a confidence vote will be a more just tax system, the new finance minister told parliament on Tuesday. 

 "Our top priority will be to implement a new tax system which will put an end to the provocative injustice that makes those who do not evade tax the ones who pay," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou's cabinet is expected to survive the confidence vote on Tuesday night but must rapidly approve an austerity package to get more EU/IMF aid and avoid default.
