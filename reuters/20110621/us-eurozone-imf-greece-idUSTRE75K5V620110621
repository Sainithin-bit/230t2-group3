 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund's acting head John Lipsky said on Tuesday that Greece's underlying fiscal system had broken down but could be fixed if the political will existed. 

 "The underlying Greek fiscal system is broken, but if it's broken, that implies it can be fixed. It's not that hard to figure out how to fix it. ...It's a matter of political will," he said in a speech in Berlin. Lipsky added that Greece's reform program could succeed if it were fully implemented. (Reporting by  Annika Breidthardt ; writing by  Stephen Brown )
