 WARSAW  (Reuters) - European Union solidarity, Greek austerity measures and private sector participation are the key elements for resolving Greece's sovereign debt crisis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Tuesday. 

 "These three components -- Greece's tasks, EU solidarity and the voluntary participation of banks -- are the solution. I am optimistic that we will successfully take this path," she told a news conference after talks with Polish leaders in Warsaw. "This is not about one country, it is about the whole euro zone," she said, speaking through an interpreter. (Reporting by Chris Borowski and Pawel Sobczak, writing by Gareth Jones)
