 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Airbus has sealed a record deal worth $16 billion at list prices to sell narrow-body aircraft to Indian carrier IndiGo, an industry source with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday. 

 The deal represents the biggest boost to date for the revamped A320neo and confirms an order provisionally announced in January after intense last-minute talks at the Paris Air Show. "It's in the bag," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The deal is expected to be announced on Wednesday. IndiGo in January announced plans to buy 150 A320neo aircraft and 30 of the existing A320 model. The order is a record for the number of planes involved in a single transaction.
