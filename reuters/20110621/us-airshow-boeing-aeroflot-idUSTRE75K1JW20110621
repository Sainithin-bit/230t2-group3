 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Boeing announced an order from Russian carrier Aeroflot for eight Boeing 777-300ER (extended range) jetliners worth $2.3 billion at list prices on Tuesday. 

 The orders, which were unveiled at the Paris Air Show, were previously attributed to an unidentified customer on Boeing's website, the U.S. planemaker said. (Reporting by Kyle Peterson; Editing by  James Regan )
