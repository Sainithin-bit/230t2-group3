 DEARBORN, Michigan  (Reuters) - June auto sales are on track to at least meet and perhaps exceed May levels, a top Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) executive told reporters on Tuesday. 

 The month is "off to a good start," said Mark Fields, who heads the No. 2 U.S. automaker's operations in North and South America. He said he expects the month to be "at least as good as May and maybe better." May was a weak month for overall U.S. auto sales, which fell 3.7 percent as higher vehicle prices prompted wary consumers to put off purchases. Ford's sales in the month were down 0.1 percent.
