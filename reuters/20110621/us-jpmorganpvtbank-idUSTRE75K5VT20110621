 VENICE, Italy  (Reuters) - Caution caused by the Greek crisis and sluggish consumer spending has led JPMorgan Private Bank's Europe, Middle East and Africa unit to be underweight on equities and bonds, its chief investment strategist said on Monday. 

 The EMEA unit recommends diversifying into hedge funds. Five percent of the model portfolio is in commodities, with 2 to 3 percentage points of that in gold, strategist Cesar Perez told Reuters. "I would say that given valuations, our models should have much more risk and much more equities," he said on the margins of an investment conference with clients. "We continue to be constructive, but we continue to be cautious in our underweight equities at the moment." JPMorgan Chase & Co's Private Bank has about $770 billion in assets under management, making it one of the biggest private banks in the world. Perez declined to give details about his unit's assets under management. Perez said he was cautious on equities and bonds because the European Union and Athens have failed to resolve Greece's crushing debt problem a year after the crisis first erupted. He added that Europe still faces nagging questions about the capital health of its banks -- worries that the United States eased about its own lenders through stress tests and capital injections. "We still need more capital to be at rest," he said." Key to the economic recovery will be consumer spending around the world, he said, with key numbers for a turnaround including U.S. payrolls. "Consumer confidence is going to make the recovery sustainable or not sustainable," Perez said. His unit is "very, very underweight" on European equities, he said. Most of its exposure is through Germany's shares index with mid-sized companies that prospered through an export boom and are likely to see an upturn as German consumer spending picks up. His biggest overweight pick is U.S. equities, since U.S. companies are flush with cash, meaning dividends, acquisitions and capital spending could pick up, he said. Perez likes big U.S. technology companies such as computer and phone maker Apple Inc and chip maker Intel Corp. "The corporate sector is the thing that can maintain the situation as we see it," he said. Perez is neutral on emerging market equities, with most exposure in that sector in Asia. Perez is underweight on government bonds, a position offset by high-yield corporate bonds. (Reporting by Ian Simpson, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
