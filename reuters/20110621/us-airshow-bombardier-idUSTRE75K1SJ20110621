 LE BOURGET, France  (Reuters) - Bombardier ( BBDb.TO ) won orders and commitments for up to 30 of its CSeries CS300 planes from Korean Air ( 003490.KS ) worth almost $2 billion, it said on Tuesday. 

 The letter of intent included 10 orders, 10 options and 10 purchase rights, the planemaker said. "This is our first CSeries aircraft customer in Asia and signals the aircraft program's entry into the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market," Gary Scott, president of Bombardier Commercial Aircraft, said at the Paris Air Show.
