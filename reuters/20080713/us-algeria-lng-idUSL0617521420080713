 ALGIERS  (Reuters) - A consortium of British-based oil services company Petrofac ( PFC.L ) and Indonesian engineering company IKPT provisionally won a contract to build an LNG plant in Algeria, government newspaper El Moudjhaid said on Sunday. 

 The award for construction of a liquefied natural gas plant in the western Mediterranean port of Arzew with a production capacity of 4.3 million tonnes a year was unveiled at an open tender ceremony on Saturday, the newspaper said. Petrofac and IKPT have 10 days to provide guarantees that they can build the plant within the price they offered of 55,000 dinars ($895) a tonne, or the contract will be awarded to the runner-up, a consortium of Italy's Snamprogetti SpA ( SPMI.MI ) and Japan's Chiyoda Corp. ( 6366.T ) the newspaper said. The contract requires the plant to be built within 50 months, with the work financed 100 percent by Algerian state energy company Sonatrach. The plant will be fed by gas from Algeria's Gassi Touil and Rhourd Nouss gas fields. ($=61.43 Algerian dinars) (Reporting by  William Maclean ; Editing by Louise Heavens)
