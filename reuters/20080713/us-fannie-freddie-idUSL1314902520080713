 Analysts in research notes argue that the U.S. government will be forced to help Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or face a dangerous financial and economic crisis. At the very least, the U.S. housing agencies must bolster their capital to stave off market concerns over failure. 

 Below are extracts from some of their reports, issued after worries over capital shortages to cushion against mortgage losses sent the agencies' stock plunging on Friday and pushed up debt prices. ----------------------------------------------------- GOLDMAN SACHS The key significance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the current economic climate is their ability to soften the impact of the credit crunch. Of the almost $25 trillion of lending capacity to the nonfinancial private sector -- roughly half on-balance-sheet lending by banks and quasi-banks plus private-label securitization --is either stagnant or shrinking at present. This means that the other half, of which the $5.3 trillion Fannie/Freddie book of business is the biggest component, needs to grow rapidly to generate at least some credit growth over time. In this environment, the federal government will not only need to stand behind the GSEs but will need to encourage them to continue growing their book of business. Should the market turmoil continue, the administration is therefore likely to continue escalating its signals of support, first with verbal measures beyond Treasury Secretary Paulson's brief statement Friday and proceeding to outright credit support if needed. The notion that bringing the GSEs onto the federal balance sheet would "raise government debt by $5.3 trillion" and thereby sharply worsen the US government's creditworthiness is misleading. The $5.3 trillion refers to the GSE's holdings of mortgages and loan guarantees, which is not at all the same thing as outright liabilities. The government would have to cover any GSE losses, but this would be a much, much smaller number under any reasonable set of assumptions. DEUTSCHE BANK It is becoming increasingly likely that taxpayer involvement (in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) will increase in 2009, since that seems to be the only way to break the vicious cycle and improve the (financing) flows through ... three channels. In the mortgage channel, the direct support for homeowners through the Frank-Dodd bill is looking at a higher likelihood of passage into law. The bill would provide a federal guarantee for refinanced mortgages where the principal had been written down below the value of the underlying property. Supporting the second channel and the banking system is the FDIC, which will likely take over more failing banks in the coming year, possibly necessitating taxpayer support as the $52 billion in net assets of the Deposit Insurance Fund is drawn down. Finally, the decline in the stock prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have raised the possibility that the government might be obliged to make the implicit guarantee more explicit, perhaps by injecting taxpayer money in to recapitalizing the GSEs, with the purpose of allowing a pickup in mortgage purchases and reversing the vicious cycle. We could also see large new financial institutions created with a massive capital commitment by the government. The result of greater governmental involvement is likely to be higher U.S. deficit projection for 2009. FBR CAPITAL MARKETS In an instance where equity capital is not raised and investors see a meaningful change in debt spreads, it is clear to us that government action would be undertaken to ensure that the institutions would not fail. We do not see any legislation on the horizon aimed at injecting any liquidity into the companies in an effort to shore up their capital positions, nor do we believe much consideration is being given to the idea of expanding the line of credit the companies have with the Treasury Department. If federal actions were required, we believe the Fed would provide financing, directly or indirectly, to the companies. Potential outcomes: The question in our minds is whether or not Fed financing would be provided directly, for example through the purchase of debt, or through a new public-private intermediary. Our conversations (in Washington policy circles) suggest that the Fed would like to act in a way that does not sound the explicit guarantee alarm. One such move would be to create an entity that would offer super-preferred equity to banks. Banks could pledge collateral at the Fed window in exchange for a non-recourse loan, which would provide the liquidity to participate in the offering. Once the new entity is adequately capitalized, loans could be made available to the entities as they work to ensure new equity capital adequately covers credit losses in the pipeline. Recognizing that any number of variations could be devised and the general lack of specifics do not portend eminent action, we have the strong sense that a consensus is being built around some sort of Fed action. It seems reasonable, given recent sentiment in the names and the range of questions and potential solutions postulated to us by investors, that a narrowing of possibilities is essential. The availability of time will likely lead to a more elegant solution, which would almost certainly be needed, given the complexities in devising a new financing structure.
