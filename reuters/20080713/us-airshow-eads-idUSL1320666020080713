 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) has signaled a more aggressive attempt to beef up its restructuring plans to catch up with a weakening dollar and said Mark II of the overhaul would be widened to the whole group. 

 The aerospace group is poring over a new version of its Power8 restructuring plan, which calls for 10,000 job cuts and other sources of savings at plane maker Airbus, after currency changes swamped the $1.35 level assumed in the original plan. EADS said earlier this year it would redesign the plan to reflect a euro which had by then risen to $1.45, implying 1 billion euros of new cuts to help reverse losses at Airbus. The European currency now fetches close to $1.60, hurting EADS finances at a time when soaring oil prices are also severely squeezing its airline customers, and raising questions over the company's ability to meet financial targets. Shares in Europe's largest aerospace group plunged over 10 percent to a record low on Friday fuelled in part by fears that it could issue a profit warning, but finance director Hans Peter Ring denied having hinted to a newspaper that goals may be cut. "We see risks and also opportunities and will provide an update of our guidance when we publish first-half results, but (saying) this should not be interpreted as a warning," he said. He said he had been misinterpreted by a German paper which reported that he had hinted at an imminent drop in guidance. Chief Executive Louis Gallois said EADS was moving fast to reinvent itself as an integrated, global company and was determined to tackle the issue of a weak dollar. He added that by doing so it would place itself in a position to deliver strong results in the long term. "Power 8+, concerning all parts of EADS, not only Airbus, will increase the security of the company vis-a-vis dollar fluctuation," he told journalists. "But what is more important for me in the long term, whatever the evolution of the dollar, is that we are reinforcing the global capacity of EADS to deliver strong results." Ring said the revised "Power8+" plan to be unveiled some time in the autumn would now assume a euro higher than $1.45. Adjusting the benchmark translates quickly into pressure for extra cost savings since the Franco-German-led group says every 10-cent swing in the exchange rate equates to 1 billion euros in operating income gained or lost. Airbus Chief Executive Tom Enders warned against overstating the amount of further efficiencies that can be wrung out of the plane maker's factories spread across four European countries. "There will be additional measures but I don't think we can sweat out another 2 billion (euros)," he said. The current four-year Power8 plan calls for 2.1 billion euros of recurring operating savings by 2010. LIMITED CANCELLATIONS The executives were speaking in media briefings on Saturday ahead of the July 14-20 Farnborough air show. The comments were embargoed for release on Sunday. EADS and its Airbus unit, which competes with Boeing for jetliner orders in dollars but reports in euros, goes into the showcase event confident of bagging new orders despite the woes of many airlines, but with its share price reeling. The company lost more than 1 billion euros in value when its shares fell to 10.74 euros on Friday. Boeing shares have also come under pressure and fell 4 percent to $63.28 on Friday. EADS sought to calm fears over cancellations from airlines weakened or driven out of business by the oil price spike, but disclosed it had drawn up a watch list of potentially troublesome airlines based on cash generation and profitability. "When I see the backlog, the cancellations have been very limited during the last six months. For the future, we have to be vigilant but I don't want to panic," Gallois said. "The traffic is still good. We are not in the situation of 1993, or 2001. We know that airlines have financial difficulties but we know the traffic is there." Airbus, which has a bulging book after several years of bumper sales, has acknowledged overselling aircraft compared to the number of planes it can produce in a bid to reassure investors that it will not suffer too badly if some cancel. The policy is similar to the common "overbooking" practice used on passengers by airlines themselves. Ring declined to say what proportion of the backlog as overcommitted in this way but said it was a significant number of aircraft, "not 20 or 30." EADS meanwhile said it was upbeat about winning a new tender for a $35 billion contract to sell mid-air refueling tankers to the U.S. Air Force. Boeing successfully challenged an earlier contract awarded to EADS and Northrop Grumman. (Editing by Louise Heavens)
