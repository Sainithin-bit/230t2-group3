 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury on Sunday may say it is prepared to take an equity stake in troubled mortgage financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac if requested, sources close to talks about the issue said. 

 Under the plan being outlined, the Treasury Department would give the two shareholder-owned but government-sponsored enterprises an equity infusion if they decided such an investment was required, the sources said. The Treasury Department declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal, citing sources, also reported that Treasury will discuss credit lines for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in a statement to be issued on Sunday. It will also repeat it has no plans to nationalize the companies, the report said. Their share prices have tumbled dramatically in recent days amid concern about their ability to withstand the U.S. housing downturn. The Federal Reserve is expected to make a separate statement about the companies, the report added. The Fed, the U.S. central bank, may have a consultative role in Fannie and Freddie, the Journal said. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
