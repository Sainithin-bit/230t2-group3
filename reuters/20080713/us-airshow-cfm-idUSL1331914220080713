 FARNBOROUGH  (Reuters) - CFM International, the jet engine joint venture between General Electric Co ( GE.N ) and France's Safran ( SAF.PA ), unveiled plans for a new engine on Sunday, which it hopes will power the next generation of single-aisle planes. 

 On the eve of the Farnborough air show, GE and Safran also said they would continue with the CFM joint venture -- which already supplies engines to most of the world's single-aisle airliners -- until 2040, well beyond the 2015 date when the 34-year-old partnership was set to expire. The venture, which is a 50 percent owned by each company, said its new LEAP-X turbofan jet engine will cut fuel consumption by 16 percent, going some way to meeting planemakers' demands for more efficient jets. The new engine uses lightweight, carbon-composite fan blades and new compressor technology, and will be ready for certification and use on airplanes by 2016, CFM said. As the price of oil reaches new highs, airlines are demanding more fuel-efficient planes from major manufacturers Boeing ( BA.N ) and EADS ( EAD.PA ) unit Airbus. But so far, neither has committed to replacing its strong-selling range of single-aisle planes -- Boeing's 737 line and Airbus's A320 family -- saying they need to see better-performing engines before they can justify a redesigned airframe. CFM is hoping its new LEAP-X jet will be the engine of choice for the new ranges of single-aisle aircraft, which are the workhorses of the global fleet and account for most of the planemakers' sales by units. "We are bringing this to them (the plane manufacturers), so they can do their design stuff," CFM executive vice-president Bill Clapper said at a media conference in London to unveil the engine. "The planemakers and their customers have to decide what to do next." (Reporting by  Bill Rigby  and Matthias Blamont; Editing by Quentin Bryar)
