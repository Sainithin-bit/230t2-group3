 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has filed a motion in a U.S. court seeking documents from Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd ( RANB.BO ) as part of an ongoing investigation, a Ranbaxy spokesman said on Sunday. 

 Indian newspapers said U.S. authorities have been carrying out an investigation related to sub-standard drug sales in the United States. The company spokesman said the filing was in the district court of Maryland. "A motion has been filed seeking certain documents. Ranbaxy strongly denies all allegations contained in the motion. No legal proceedings in the sense of a prosecution have been started," the spokesman said. "We will file a response in court tomorrow," he said. "An investigation has been underway for approximately three years. Despite this, no charges have been filed. During this period, Ranbaxy has been cooperating fully with the Department of Justice." Ranbaxy, India's largest drugmaker by sales, last month accepted a takeover offer from Japan's Daiichi Sankyo ( 4568.T ) which acquired 34.8 percent in the company and is making an open offer for a further 20 percent, in a deal worth up to $4.6 billion.
