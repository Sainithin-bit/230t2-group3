 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. October housing starts fell 14.6 percent after a 4.9 percent rise in September. 

 The annual rate of housing starts fell to 1.486 million, the lowest since July 2000. October building permits fell 6.3 percent, compared to a 5.2 percent fall in September. The 1.535 million annual rate for building permits was the lowest since December 1997.   COMMENTARY: BILL HORNBARGER, CHIEF FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, A.G.  EDWARDS & SONS, ST. LOUIS: "These are certainly soft numbers but I don't think there is any surprise there. Housing has certainly been one of the areas of the economy that has been very weak. Our economist has been using the term that housing is in recession." "It doesn't (change our Fed view) but we think that the Fed is done raising rates anyway. I don't think it brings (rate cuts) forward. I think they are going to need to see another couple months more of friendly inflation data." GARY SHILLING, PRESIDENT, A. GARY SHILLING & CO. INVESTMENT  RESEARCH FIRM. SPRINGFIELD, NEW JERSEY: "The housing market is literally collapsing. Why stocks have been ignoring this, I don't know. Builders have already panicked, but we haven't yet seen the big collapse in prices, because people believe their house is unique and they're unwilling to reduce prices to attract buyers. DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST AT 4CAST IN NEW YORK "Extremely weak. The permits are extending a severe down turn while starts having risen in September saw a steeper than trend fall to correct the increase. There have been a few tentative signs that the housing demand may start to bottom out, such as the home builders survey yesterday. Certainly the housing investment is not recovering yet. "The Fed is not really inclined to ease rates. I think the Fed is still debating whether to tighten or not. After yesterday CPI data and these and some other data, the case for tightening doesn't look very strong. I don't think they are yet starting to debate easing. I think there is a risk that the economy will underperform the Fed's expectations. We have seen some signs of manufacturing weakness as well as housing emerging." ROBERT MACINTOSH, CHIEF ECONOMIST, EATON VANCE MANAGEMENT,  BOSTON: "The raw number (housing starts) looks incredibly weak. As for the Fed -- everything else being equal -- this means they will cut pretty damn fast if this is what's happening to the housing and these numbers are real. Though the employment numbers from last week have postponed any cuts for a while." GEORGE DAVIS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL  MARKETS, TORONTO: "I think for the most part the market had been leaning towards a little weaker than expected outcome for both the housing starts and the building permits. But the numbers we got were much weaker than expected. As a result we've seen the dollar weaken marginally. But given there's no other major data releases today we'll probably see the dollar trade with a slightly negative bias for the rest of the session."  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices rose on the housing data with the benchmark 10 year note yield falling to around 4.62 percent. - The dollar slipped, with the euro firming to around $1.2785  EUR= , and the dollar down to 118.25 yen  JPY= . - U.S. S&P500 stock futures fell to around 1400.75.
