 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A judge gave bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK on Friday more time to meet with its unions, creditors and former parent General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) to resolve labor contract and parts issues. 

 Judge Robert Drain of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York granted the additional time after a private meeting with Delphi, its unions, GM and creditors on Friday to discuss progress in resolving the disputes. Drain has scheduled further conferences on the labor and parts contract issues for November 30. Delphi has been negotiating with the various parties to its reorganization for months to try to reach agreements on labor costs, the scope of its business and the eventual ownership of the Troy, Michigan-based parts supplier. Delphi in October 2005 filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. automotive history. It has outlined plans to cut wages and benefits of hourly workers, close U.S. union plants and drop several business lines to reorganize its operations. A hearing on a Delphi request for authority to impose wage and benefit cuts was suspended earlier in 2006 to allow for more talks, and Delphi has never proceeded to a hearing on its request to reject thousands of parts contracts with GM.
