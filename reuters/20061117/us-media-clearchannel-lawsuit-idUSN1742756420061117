 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Clear Channel Communications Inc. and its directors were sued in a Texas state court following the radio-station operator's $18.7 billion agreement to be acquired by its founding family and two private equity firms. 

 The lawsuit, which seeks class action status, was filed on Thursday in the District Court for the 166th Judicial District in Bexar County, Texas. A copy of the lawsuit was received by Reuters on Friday. The suit charges Clear Channel ( CCU.N ) and its directors with breaching their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company to the Mays family, Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and Bain Capital Partners LLC. The defendants "are acting contrary to their fiduciary duty to maximize value on a change in control of the company," the lawsuit said. The deal is unfair "because it will take Clear Channel private at a wholly inadequate price," the suit said. "The proposed transaction will, for inadequate consideration, deny (the) plaintiff and other members of the class the opportunity to share proportionately in the future success of the company and its valuable assets." The plaintiff, Lou Ann Murphy, seeks an injunction against the deal, or damages should the transaction be completed, the lawsuit said. Clear Channel, based in San Antonio, Texas, was not immediately available to comment. The company previously said its board of directors -- with the interested directors recused from the vote -- had unanimously approved the acquisition agreement. A special advisory committee consisting of disinterested directors unanimously determined the terms of the transaction to be fair, Clear Channel said. Under terms of the takeover pact, the No. 1 U.S. radio station operator can still solicit other bids through December 7, and then negotiate until January 5.
