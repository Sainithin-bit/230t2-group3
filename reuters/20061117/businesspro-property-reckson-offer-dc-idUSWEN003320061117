 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reckson Associates Realty Corp. RA.N 
said on Thursday that investors Carl Icahn and Harry Macklowe 
have offered to acquire the New York area real estate company 
for $49 per share in cash. 

  The $4.6 billion bid from Rome Acquisition Limited 
Partnership, formed by Macklowe and Icahn, comes less than a 
week before Reckson shareholders are scheduled to vote on a 
cash-and-stock offer worth roughly $4 billion from SL Green 
Realty Corp.
