 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global media conglomerate News Corp. NWSa.NNWS.N said on Thursday that its high-profile Internet division president, Ross Levinsohn, has resigned. 

 Fox Interactive Media President Levinsohn will be replaced by his cousin, Peter Levinsohn, who is currently president of Fox Entertainment digital media. Ross Levinsohn, whose deal-spotting savvy led him to convince News Corp. Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch to buy popular Internet social network MySpace and games Web network IGN Entertainment, will leave to pursue other ventures, he said in a statement. Murdoch's $580 million purchase of MySpace last year put a new shine on News Corp.'s stock and bolstered its reputation as one example of traditional media companies finding ways to reach new viewers, even the elusive youth market. Fox Interactive Media now employs 1,200 workers. Peter Levinsohn, an 18-year of Fox, has negotiated Internet and digital media deals including recent agreements to distribute the company's films and television shows on Apple Computer Inc.'s ( AAPL.O ) iTunes, Amazon ( AMZN.O ), and Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) MSN. "At this point in (Fox Interactive Media's) evolution, Peter's adept leadership, keen knowledge of the complexities of the digital space and ability to work skillfully across multiple business lines makes him the ideal person to lead this important asset into the future," Peter Chernin, News Corp. chief operating officer, said in a statement.
