 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) said on Friday that it has no plans to take cues from other retailers and sell its credit card business because it generates big profits and drives stronger store sales. 

 The discount retailer, which offers both a Target Visa and another card that can be used only at its stores, is among the top 10 credit card issuers in the United States. The business contributed nearly 22 percent of Target's third-quarter earnings before taxes, but some on Wall Street have urged the retailer to sell the business to reduce risk. Analysts have raised concerns that a slowing housing market and recent regulations that increased minimum credit card payment amounts could lead to an increase in bad debt. Chains including Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N and Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) have recently sold their credit card portfolios. "We have no intention of following this path," Doug Scovanner, Target's chief financial officer, said in a presentation to investors on Friday. "For those of you who perceive a high degree of risk in our operations (because of) this enterprise...selling these operations is not going to eliminate that perception," he said. Target said the credit card operations not only generate fat returns, but also encourage customers to shop more. The retailer said customers, on average, spend nearly $200 on their first purchase with the Target Visa card to take advantage of a 10 percent discount. Cardholders also receive 10 percent off coupons when they charge $1,000 at Target stores, or $2,000 elsewhere, and the overwhelming majority redeem them, generating sales growth. Target said it turns down some 45 percent of those who apply for a Visa card, and its cardholders have unusually high credit scores. Target's biggest rival, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) has applied to open a bank like Target's, but its application is on hold as Congress and federal regulators debate the potential risk of allowing non-banking companies to open banks. Target said that situation should have no effect on its financial services business.
