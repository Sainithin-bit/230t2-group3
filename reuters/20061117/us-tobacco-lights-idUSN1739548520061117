 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - A federal appeals court has decided to review a lower court ruling that let a $200 billion lawsuit filed by "light" cigarette smokers proceed as a class action, according to a court document. 

 The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also stopped proceedings in the suit. The stay in the case, sought by Philip Morris, was issued as of Thursday, the court order said. Defendants in the case include Altria Group Inc.'s ( MO.N ) Philip Morris USA unit; Reynolds American Inc.'s ( RAI.N ) R.J. Reynolds tobacco Co.; Loews Corp.'s LTR.N Lorillard Tobacco unit CG.N; Vector Group Ltd.'s ( VGR.N ) Liggett Group; and British American Tobacco Plc's ( BATS.L ) British American Tobacco (Investments) Ltd. In September, U.S. Senior District Judge Jack Weinstein in Brooklyn, New York, granted class-action status in the case, which would have allowed the suit to go forward on behalf of all U.S. "light" cigarette smokers. The suit argued that tobacco companies defrauded smokers into thinking light cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. Lawyers for the smokers argued that lights brought tobacco companies between $120 billion and $200 billion in extra sales. Attorneys for the tobacco companies countered that there was no way to tell how many people relied on the word "light" when choosing cigarettes, and said the smokers could not be grouped together as a class action. Shares of Altria, maker of the top-selling Marlboro brand, closed up $1.44, or 1.7 percent, at a new 52-week closing high of $85.01 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. "I expect the class will eventually be decertified; this is a first indication of that eventuality," said Charles Norton, co-portfolio manager of Mutuals Advisors Inc.'s Vice Fund, which owns shares in tobacco companies. Attorneys for the smokers could not be reached to comment on the appeals court ruling. Reynolds shares ended up 38 cents at $65.26, Vector was up 5 cents at $17.40, and Carolina Group was down 20 cents at $62.87.
