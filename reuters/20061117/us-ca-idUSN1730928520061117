 NEW YORK/BOSTON  (Reuters) - Business software maker CA Inc. is suing convicted former Chief Executive Sanjay Kumar, seeking repayment of $14.9 million it says it fronted for his legal defense, according to court documents. 

 A court agreed to lay claim to his house, sports cars, yacht and other assets as security that he would be able to repay the sum if he lost the suit. Kumar was sentenced on November 2 to 12 years in federal prison over criminal charges stemming from his role in a $2.2 billion accounting fraud at the computer software maker, formerly known as Computer Associates International Inc. The company filed a civil suit against Kumar on November 9 in New York State Supreme Court. Judge Stephen Bucaria on Wednesday granted CA a request for an order of attachment that covers a $9 million home, two Ferrari sports cars, Volvo and Land Rover sport utility vehicles, and a 57-foot Italian Azimut yacht, according to the order of attachment. The order also attaches funds on deposit with JPMorgan Chase Bank and an IOU for some $9 million that court documents say Kumar was owed by CA's founder, Charles Wang. The two men both owned stakes in the New York Islanders hockey team. Wang agreed to pay $9 million, in annual installments of $1 million, in exchange for Kumar's holdings in the team and other joint ventures, according to CA filings with the court, which cited an article in the Newsday newspaper. CA alleges that Kumar transferred more than $20 million to his wife and $5 million to his teenage daughters before the company filed its lawsuit against him. Sri-Lankan born Kumar pleaded guilty to charges including conspiracy, securities fraud and obstruction of justice in April, just two weeks before his criminal trial was due to start.
