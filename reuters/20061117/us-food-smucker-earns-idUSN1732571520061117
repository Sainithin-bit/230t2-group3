 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Peanut butter and jelly maker J.M. Smucker Co. ( SJM.N ) posted a larger-than-expected decline in quarterly profit on Friday, hurt by steep increases in the costs of ingredients like wheat, peanuts and soybean oil. 

 The maker of Jif peanut butter and Smucker's jelly, whose shares fell 3.5 percent, said products such as Crisco cooking oil and Pillsbury baking mixes were hit especially hard by higher costs. The company has announced price increases of 3 percent to 5 percent for its baking products and 5 percent to 7 percent for its oils. Rivals have instituted similar price rises in some areas, Smucker executives said in a conference call with analysts. Rising flour costs might require even more price increases, the executives said. Wheat hit a 10-year high last month at the Chicago Board of Trade amid projections for world wheat supplies to fall to a 25-year low. Net income in the fiscal second quarter, ended October 31, was $45.6 million, down from $46.4 million a year earlier. Per-share earnings rose to 80 cents from 79 cents because of a decrease in shares outstanding. Excluding restructuring costs, earnings were 83 cents per share, 3 cents below the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose 4 percent in the quarter, excluding results from businesses recently sold. Including those businesses, sales dipped to $605 million from $606.3 million. "Despite escalating raw material costs, we delivered earnings growth consistent with our sales growth," Tim Smucker, chairman and co-chief executive officer, said in a statement. "We expect this difficult cost environment to continue, and we remain focused on taking actions to mitigate these costs." Looking ahead, the company stood by its forecast for full-year earnings to be up 4 percent from the prior year's $2.65 per share, which excludes one-time items. Full-year sales are also expected to be up 4 percent, excluding $100 million in sales from businesses recently sold. Smucker shares were down $1.65 to $45.65 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchanges. At Thursday's close, the shares were trading at 17 times estimated fiscal 2007 earnings.
