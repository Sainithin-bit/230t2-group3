 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. expects its current pace of doubling Chinese sales to continue for the rest of the year and into 2007, as it prepares to add the award-winning S-MAX model early next year. 

 Sales at the No.2 U.S. automaker grew 106 percent to more than 118,000 units in January-October thanks to brisk sales of the Focus and Mondeo sedans. "We plan to keep this growth pace for the remainder of 2006 and beyond," Ford Motor China Chief Executive Mei-Wei Cheng told a news conference to unveil the all-new S-MAX in Beijing. Ford has promised to launch at least one new product in China every year. The S-MAX, which Ford calls an "SAV", or sports activity vehicle, will be built at its main joint venture plant in Chongqing and sold from early next year. The vehicle was voted European Car of the Year this week, joining both the Focus and Mondeo in receiving the prestigious award. Ford, whose North American operations have been hit by sliding market share and hefty incentives spending, is counting on China to take on a bigger role in its global operations to nurse the company back to health. To accelerate that, Ford will open a research and engineering center in Nanjing, in eastern China, investing an initial $27.5 million. The facility would support product development and parts procurement in China, and later serve other brands in product development globally, Cheng said. Ford said it would also expand its auto financing business, now operating in more than 70 Chinese cities after just 18 months. Combined with other brands in the Ford group -- including Mazda Motor Corp., Land Rover, Jaguar and Volvo -- sales in China are set to reach 300,000 units this year, Cheng said, giving it a 7 percent market share based on a forecast for passenger car sales of 4.1 million units this year. Japan's Mazda, one-third owned by Ford, has dragged on the group as sales of the once-popular Mazda6 sedan and Mazda 323 slowed. A seven-month output suspension of the Mazda3, a hot-selling sedan in other markets, also hurt. Mazda3 production resumed earlier this month, but a sales start is pending approval by local authorities. Mazda executives, speaking at a separate press conference, declined to provide further details. Mazda's January-October sales in China fell 7 percent to 101,000 units. Last year, they jumped 51 percent to 134,000. Mazda has targeted sales of 300,000 units in China by 2010, with plans to launch eight new products between 2005 and 2007, and at least one new model every year beyond that. To keep up with demand, Ford and Mazda's three-way local venture with Changan Automobile Co. Ltd., called Changan Ford Mazda Automobile, is expanding capacity in Chongqing to 250,000 units a year in 2007 from 200,000 units. In the second half of next year, the company will also build a 160,000 units-a-year plant in Nanjing, boosting its combined annual capacity to 410,000. The venture is also constructing a 350,000 units-a-year engine plant to start production next year.
