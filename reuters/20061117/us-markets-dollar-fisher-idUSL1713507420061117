 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher said on Friday he could not envisage a global shock big enough to knock the dollar off its pedestal as the world's top currency. 

 Nor did he expect the role of the dollar to be displaced among central bank reserves, Fisher told a panel discussion on the extended importance of the euro at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress. "The question is, is there going to be a large shock to the dollar? I doubt it," said Fisher, who is not a voting member of the U.S. Fed's interest rate setting committee this year or next. The dollar held near one-week highs against the euro and yen on Friday after a fall in October U.S. consumer prices on Thursday hardened expectations that the Federal Reserve would keep interest rates on hold. The Fed last month held the federal fund rate at 5.25 percent for the third month in a row at 5.25 percent, after breaking a string of 17 consecutive rate increases in the summer.
