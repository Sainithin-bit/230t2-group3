 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American International Group ( AIG.N ) on Friday said two of its subsidiaries received subpoenas, one from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice and one from the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

 AIG Financial Products Corp. received a subpoena from the Justice Department, and another subsidiary, SunAmerica, received a subpoena from the SEC, company spokesman Joe Norton said. He declined to comment further. In recent days, the Justice Department and the SEC have subpoenaed a number of companies in connection with ongoing investigations into municipal guaranteed investment contracts.
