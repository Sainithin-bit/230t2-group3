 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson's ( JNJ.N ) proposed $1.4 billion cash takeover of stent maker Conor Medsystems CONR.O is expected to bolster the diversified health care product maker's declining share in the market for cardiovascular devices, analysts said on Friday. 

 The deal, unveiled late on Thursday, comes amid growing debate about the safety of drug-eluting stents -- tiny wire mesh tubular devices that prop open surgically-cleared heart arteries and deliver medication to keep them from renarrowing from scar tissue growth. The worldwide market for these devices is about $6 billion. J&J and Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) are the only two companies approved to sell the devices in the lucrative U.S. market, but competition from Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ) and Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) is on the horizon. Both sell drug-eluting stents outside the United States and are gearing up for U.S. launches in mid-2007 or early 2008. "Why do a deal now? The real question is, why not?" said medical technology analyst Michael Barr of Victory Capital Management, which owns J&J shares. "Conor definitely has a novel technology -- using multiple drugs on a stent is attractive -- and now they're pairing with the company that has the deepest pockets. The ability to get Conor's products out of the pipeline and onto the market is clearly enhanced," he added. "BACK IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT" "We had viewed J&J as the incremental loser in the stent market," added Morgan Stanley analyst Glenn Reicin, "but this deal could put J&J back in the driver's seat." Without Conor's Costar stent, J&J was not expected to have a second-generation drug-eluting stent until 2009 in Europe and 2010 in the United States, noted Prudential Securities analyst Lawrence Biegelsen. He said Boston Scientific stands to lose the most from the deal because Conor's Costar may have safety advantages over Boston Scientific's Taxus stent. In addition, J&J's vast resources will improve the chances of Conor prevailing in intellectual property litigation with Boston Scientific. Steven Scruggs, portfolio manager of Bragg Financial Advisors, which also holds J&J shares, said he viewed the deal as a risky option. "It could be a high return deal or it could be worthless and completely fizzle, but a $1 billion deal is nothing for J&J," he said. "It does raise the question about whether they're doing a deal because there's a problem with their own stent system." Victory Capital's Barr said the relatively low price of $33.50 per Conor share that J&J is paying reflects litigation risk. The shares closed at $27.52 on Thursday before the deal was announced. Analysts said they did not foresee antitrust issues, but were eager to review the merger documents, which have not yet been filed. Michael Weinstein, an analyst with JP Morgan, said he assumes Costar will capture 12 percent market share in Europe and 15 percent in the United States in 2008 and 2009. "Buying Conor does, in our view, make for a stronger J&J. The deal strengthens the company's long-term competitiveness in drug-eluting stents and should, if Conor's first generation product Costar is able to make its way on the U.S. market, soften the blow of multiple new entrants in 2008," Weinstein wrote in a research note. "We note that it's still not a sure thing that Costar reaches the U.S. market, or at least in the timeline that the Street currently expects," he added. COUNTER-BID UNLIKELY Analysts said they did not anticipate a competitive bid. A counter-bid by Boston Scientific would likely raise Federal Trade Commission anti-trust issues, they said. "While a bid by Abbott or Medtronic is feasible, it is unlikely that either company would want to take on J&J. Boston may make its own arguments against the deal to the FTC, but in the end we think that the transaction goes through and J&J is in fact the winner," Weinstein said. Credit Suisse analyst Marshall Gordon said that if a counter-bid were to emerge, it would most likely come from Medtronic. Medtronic spokesman Scott Papillon declined to comment on a possible bid. Boston Scientific and Abbott Labs were not immediately available for comment. J&J's bid, he said, "sends a strong signal about its own concerns about (J&J's drug-eluting stent) Cypher being able to compete." Shares of J&J were up 82 cents to $67.35 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trade, while shares of Conor jumped $5.20, or 19 percent, to $32.72 on the Nasdaq. They earlier rallied as high as $32.85, a record.
