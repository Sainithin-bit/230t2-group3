 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Friday that it would be no surprise if euro holdings grew, but did not see this knocking the dollar from its perch as the world's reserve currency. 

 "It would be very difficult to displace the dollar as a central holding of central banks," Fisher told a panel discussion at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress. "However, I would not be the least bit surprised, and in fact I would encourage, increased depth and breadth to euro holdings as well. It's good for us ... two authorities to compete with each other, to encourage discipline," he said. Fed officials rarely comment on the dollar and generally leave it to the U.S. Treasury to make remarks that can influence its value on foreign exchange markets. From time to time, however, central bank officials have noted that a rebalancing in global portfolios in favor of the euro was to be expected. Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said last month he believed the portfolio shift from the dollar into the euro  EUR=  was likely on the cards and may already be under way. Fisher acknowledged that the desire of investors to diversify their portfolio risks was a powerful force. "Such diversification seems likely to occur gradually, and the option to diversify is surely a benefit to the world as a whole," he said. But he saw no need for this trend to be the trigger for a sharp drop in the dollar's exchange rate value. "I don't think it's unhealthy for the euro to have increasing acceptance in central banking reserves. It does not mean you have to sell dollars to buy euros. I don't think you precipitate a crisis by a buildup of reserves," Fisher said. "The question is: 'Is there going to be a large shock to the dollar?' I doubt it," he said. "An eclipse of the dollar is very unlikely in the near term. Even so, the Fed must be ever vigilant in preserving the value of the dollar." INFLATION WATCH Asked about the inflation climate in the United States, after another sharp fall in the consumer price index last month thanks to lower energy prices, Fisher stressed that the Fed had "no tolerance for inflation above 2 percent." "We've made it clear that we become uncomfortable above the 2 percent level. The issue is not where inflation is now, it's where it's going," said Fisher, who is not a voting member of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee this year. U.S. consumer price inflation dropped 0.5 percent in October as energy prices tumbled. CPI rose 1.3 percent year-on-year on an unadjusted basis. But core consumer prices, which strip out volatile food and energy costs, were up 2.7 percent year-on-year, above the "comfort zone" of Fisher and many other Fed officials. However, the increase in core prices over the 12 months through October marked a deceleration from the 2.9 percent rise in the year through September, raising the prospect that core inflation had peaked. But Fisher told reporters that it was too early to tell. "We must be constantly vigilant," he said. While the data were encouraging, he said "one month's data does not make a trend." At their last rate-setting meeting in October, Fed officials said their greatest concern was the risk that inflation might not fall as hoped, prompting markets to scale back bets that the Fed's next rate move could be a cut. The Fed has held the benchmark federal funds rate at 5.25 percent since June, deciding at its last three meetings to sit tight to watch if inflation eases amid slower economic growth.
