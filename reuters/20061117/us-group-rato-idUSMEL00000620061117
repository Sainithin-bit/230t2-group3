 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said healthy global economic growth remains on track, but he warned central bankers must be on high alert to tackle inflationary dangers. 

 "We see a need for central bankers, not only in industrialized countries but certainly in emerging ones, to be extremely vigilant on inflationary pressures," Rato told a briefing ahead of a meeting of finance ministers and central bank chiefs from the Group of 20 countries. Rato said he sees no sign that oil prices will fall any time soon and the scope for excess production capacity in the world economy is becoming more limited. These factors together present potential inflationary pressures in a world in which liquidity is abundant, he said. Rato said one of the risks to global output is an abrupt decline it the U.S. economy trigged by this U.S. housing slowdown, but currently he does not expect that to happen. "What we see right now is not a sharp deceleration. For the Federal Reserve there is still a risk of inflation and for this (risk) to materialize," he said. "We see a need for the monetary authority in the U.S. to remain vigilant at this time." The Fed has raised interest rates by 4.25 percentage points to 5.25 percent over the past two years. But since the last of its string of quarter-point increases in June of this year, the Fed has paused to evaluate the state of the economy. As for the euro zone, Rato said stronger-than-expected growth was helping offset a slowing in the United States and he saw room for further tightening by the European Central Bank (ECB). "We see a need for the monetary authorities in Europe to move toward neutrality but we do not see a need for a restrictive monetary policy, certainly not now," he said. Rato declined to say how close he thought the ECB was to reaching "neutral" rates. The ECB, whose benchmark rate is currently 3.25 percent, is expected to raise rates to 3.5 percent in December, a level that many analysts say is the beginning of a neutral range. It has given no clear signal on monetary policy direction thereafter, although some ECB officials have indicated they are worried about price pressures and would like rates to head higher. Rato gave a cautious assessment of Japan. "Inflation data are still relatively weak," he said. "Recent (data) has shown the economy is growing at a good rhythm, but domestic demand is not as strong as we would like." The IMF chief declined to give a monetary recommendation. The Bank of Japan has raised interest rates to 0.25 percent from virtually zero and markets are speculating on the timing of its next move. The BOJ has left the door open to raising rates again before year-end, although markets generally believe it will wait until early 2007 at least. The IMF is forecasting 5.1 percent global growth in calendar 2006 and 4.9 percent growth in 2007, marking a fifth year of the best economic growth in a generation.
