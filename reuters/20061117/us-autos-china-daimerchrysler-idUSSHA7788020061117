 BEIJING  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said on Friday that talks with China's Chery and others for a production alliance are on-going but that a deal could be finalized in the near future. 

 Chrysler currently has no offerings in the small-car segment, which is growing in the United States and represents a larger share of sales in Europe and other markets. Several automakers, including Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp ( 7211.T ) and South Korea's Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) and Chery were reportedly named as Chrysler's likely partner. "We have been talking to a number of partners, which has been reduced to a very small number," Zetsche told reporters on the sidelines of the Beijing Autoshow. "I am optimistic that we are coming to a decision in the not-so-far future," he added. "But it takes two to tango." He declined to say whether negotiations with China's Chery were exclusive but added Chery was the only Chinese company that the auto giant is talking with currently. Sources told Reuters in September that DaimlerChrysler and Chery were in detailed talks to make cars for sale in the United States and other markets. An option being considered is for Chery to provide the models and make revisions at the request of DaimlerChrysler DCX.N, while the cars would be made at Chery plants in China, the source said. But the  two parties are far apart in profit-sharing and other technical details, they added. When asked whether Volkswagen's ( VOWG.DE ) restructuring whiz Wolfgang Bernhard would join DaimlerChrysler if he handed in his resignation, Zetsche said he "has no reason to participate in this speculation." German newspaper Handelsblatt on Tuesday said Bernhard, VW brand chief and reform driver, was seriously considering stepping down after Volkswagen appointed Martin Winterkorn as its future chief executive, replacing Bernd Pischetsrieder. "I still do not have official confirmation that his current situation will change. I guess he would first have to collect his thoughts and re-position himself before he would start to make any plans," Zetsche said.
