 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The pace of U.S. home building fell sharply in October in a sign that the housing sector may still have a rocky road ahead, government data showed on Friday. 

 New home starts dropped 14.6 percent to their lowest level in more than six years in October and building permits fell 6.3 percent, according to the Commerce Department. A healthy housing sector had been key to recent economic expansion but growth has slowed sharply after a robust start to the year. Homebuilding activity has dropped and auto-makers have cut back on production as the economy moved ahead at just a 1.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter. Many economists had thought the worst of the housing slump had already passed -- and data released earlier this week seemed to support that idea -- but Friday's data cast doubt on that view. "The raw number (housing starts) looks incredibly weak," said Robert McIntosh, chief economist with Eaton Vance Management of Boston. U.S. government bond prices rose after the fresh housing data signaled weakness in the market, with the benchmark 10-year note yield falling to around 4.62 percent. The dollar fell and U.S. stocks were expected to open lower. The Commerce Department said October housing starts came in at an annual pace of 1.486 million units, compared with a pace of 1.74 million units in September. Economists had forecast October housing starts to fall to 1.690 million units from September's originally reported pace of 1.772 million. Compared to a year earlier, October housing starts were down 27.4 percent from the October 2005 pace of 2.046 million units. Permits for future groundbreaking, an indicator of builder confidence, fell 6.3 percent to an annual pace of 1.535 million units, the lowest rate since December 1997, from a 1.638 million pace in September. Economists had expected the Commerce Department to report October permits at a 1.625 million pace. Permit applications were down 28 percent from October 2005. Economists said the data suggested the economy was slowing, perhaps even more than the Federal Reserve foresees. "I think there is a risk that the economy will underperform the Fed's expectations. We have seen some signs of manufacturing weakness as well as housing emerging," said David Sloan, economist at 4Cast in New York. The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady when its policy-making group meets in December, but views are mixed on whether it will begin cutting rates next year to bolster the economy. Other data released this week painted a healthier picture of the nation's housing sector. A private survey of U.S. homebuilders' sentiment ticked higher in November. The National Association of Homebuilders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index on Thursday got a two-point bump to 33 points in November. The survey hit at 15-year low of 30 in September. On Wednesday, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported that applications for U.S. home mortgages rose last week to their highest level since January as falling interest rates encouraged more loan refinancing. The group's seasonally adjusted index of total mortgage applications increased 4.3 percent in the week ended November 10 to 647.5, up 2.6 percent on the week. Residential mortgage refinancing surged to its fastest rate since October 2005, the MBA said.
