 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) 
reported on Thursday a quadrupling of net profit as the 
computing and printing company's sales and margins improved 
across its key divisions. 

  The results were helped by the absence of last year's 
charges of more than $1 billion for job cuts, and profit before 
items handily topped analysts' forecasts.  HP shares rose only slightly as analysts said they appeared 
richly valued after rising more than 40 percent this year.  HP has in recent months endured the embarrassing disclosure 
of its investigation into board leaks to the media, which 
spurred the collection of phone records of directors, a few HP 
workers and reporters. The scandal ultimately claimed HP 
Chairman Patricia Dunn, who has since resigned as a director.  But the business remains in good shape, and Chief Executive 
Mark Hurd said HP had its best quarter in a number of years. 
Operating profit margins in all its major businesses -- PCs, 
printers, servers and storage, services and software -- all 
rose on last year as HP continued to cut costs and grow sales.  "What a difference a year makes. Last year, HP was a dog 
and Dell was a darling," said Shawn Campbell, principal at 
Campbell Asset Management, which owns HP shares. "It's a solid 
quarter across all the business segments."  Last quarter, HP recaptured the worldwide lead in PC 
shipments from longtime rival Dell Inc. DELL.O for the first 
time since the end of 2003. Dell has been struggling with weak 
results and the biggest electronics recall in U.S. history.  "The surprise was that their PC business and their imaging 
business did better than expected," said American Technology 
Research analyst Shaw Wu.  Net income for its fiscal fourth quarter to October 31 rose 
to $1.7 billion, or 60 cents per share, from $416 million, or 
14 cents per share. Revenue climbed 7 percent to $24.6 billion.  Excluding items, HP made a profit of 68 cents per share, 
compared with analysts' average forecasts of 64 cents per share 
on revenue of $24.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
  GUIDANCE GOOD  For the current quarter, Palo Alto, California-based HP 
expects earnings per share, including stock-based compensation, 
of 60 cents to 62 cents before items, including 5 cents for 
amortization of purchased intangible assets. HP expects revenue 
this quarter of $24.1 billion to $24.3 billion.  Analysts had expected 60 cents per share, on average, on 
revenue of $23.9 billion for the first fiscal quarter of 2007.  "The guidance looks pretty good," Wu said. "I think though 
their guidance is pretty conservative, which is typical Mark 
Hurd fashion."  HP said fourth-quarter revenue in its lucrative imaging and 
printing group rose 7 percent to $7.3 billion, and operating 
profit was 14.8 percent of revenue, up from 13.2 percent a year 
earlier. HP is the world's biggest maker of computer printers.  "That's some of the strongest growth we've seen, frankly, 
in years," Hurd said in a phone interview, noting that printer 
unit shipments climbed 17 percent from a year ago.  PC sales rose 10 percent to $7.8 billion as unit shipments 
rose 16 percent, while operating margin widened to 4.3 percent 
from 2.8 percent.  In enterprise storage and servers, a business that has 
rebounded recently, revenue climbed 4 percent to $4.7 billion 
and operating margin widened to 10.7 percent from 9 percent.  Revenue in HP's software unit climbed 14 percent to $349 
million as its operating margin was 17.2 percent. Revenue in 
its computer services businesses rose 5 percent to $4.1 
billion, and operating margin was 12.4 percent.  Hurd said in a conference call with reporters that HP had 
completed nearly all the 15,300 job cuts announced in July.  Due to the board leak scandal, HP has vacancies on its 
board that it hopes to fill soon. "Hopefully you'll see us take 
action in an appropriate time frame," Hurd said on the call.  HP shares rose to $40.35 in extended trading after closing 
up 0.9 percent at $40.13 on the New York Stock Exchange.  Shares of HP have surged 40 percent this year, compared 
with a 14 percent decline in those of Dell. The Merrill Lynch 
Technology 100 Index .MLO, of which both companies are 
constituents, has advanced 11 percent in the same time period.  HP now trades at 16 times estimated profit per share for 
its fiscal 2007, while rival IBM ( IBM.N ) trades at about 14.
