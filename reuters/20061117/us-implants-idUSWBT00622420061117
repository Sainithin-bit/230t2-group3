 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mentor Corp. and Allergan Inc. have won U.S. approval to resume widespread sales of silicone-gel breast implants for the first time since 1992, U.S. health officials said on Friday. 

 Each company will be required to study the safety and effectiveness of the implants in 40,000 women for 10 years, the Food and Drug Administration said. Silicone breast implants had been banned for most U.S. women after some complained the devices leaked and made them chronically ill. Both makers also announced the approvals, which cleared the devices for cosmetic use in women ages 22 and older and for breast reconstruction in women of all ages. Dr. Daniel Schultz, director of FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the manufacturers had presented data that provided "reasonable assurance of the benefits and risks" that would enable women to make informed decisions. Some complications reported in the companies' studies included breast pain, hardening of the area around the implant, change in nipple sensation, implant rupture and the need for additional surgery, the FDA said. Most women in the studies said they were happy with the implants. "We now have a good understanding of what complications can occur and at what rates. We also know that women who get these devices will probably need to have additional breast implant surgery at least once," Schultz said. Silicone breast implants are among the most extensively studied medical devices, Schultz added. Saline-filled breast implants had been the only option for most U.S. women since sales restrictions were put in place in 1992. Plastic surgeons say the silicone ones look and feel more natural. A number of independent studies found no convincing evidence that breast implants were associated with connective tissue diseases or cancer, the FDA said. The manufacturers' post-approval studies are expected to further examine those issues. Opponents criticized the FDA decision, saying complications were likely for most women and long-term health risks were unknown. "The FDA's standards for implants has reached a new low with this decision," said Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Research Center for Women & Families. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, said the approval "appears to be yet another example of the FDA dismissing scientific evidence in order to appease corporate interests." "When Congress reconvenes next session, it must examine the agency's approval process and ensure that the FDA makes decisions based on science and not on corporate and political considerations," DeLauro said.
