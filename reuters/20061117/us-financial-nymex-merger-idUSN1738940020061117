 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The chief executive of NYMEX Holdings Inc NMX.N said on Friday the world's largest energy market would consider a merger with the CME, the top U.S. futures exchange, or other exchanges as there was more room for consolidation in the sector. 

 Exchanges worldwide are under pressure to merge to cut costs and fees and fend off increasing competition. NYMEX CEO James Newsome said on CNBC television that he did not rule out a possible merger for the energy and metals exchange with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME.N. The CME last month agreed to acquire rival exchange CBOT Holdings BOT.N to form the world's largest derivatives exchange and U.S. powerhouse. "There's no question that there's going to be further consolidation in the business," said Newsome after NYMEX made its debut on the stock market. "It's not just a domestic trend, it's a global trend. We think the New York Mercantile Exchange is very flexibly positioned to look at all potential opportunities to the benefit of our shareholders," Newsome added. NYMEX and CME have already started to merge some operations since early September, when NYMEX energy futures contracts along with some precious metals futures began 24-hour trading on the CME Globex electronic trading platform. However, the relationship between NYMEX and the CME and the prospects of their possible merger would not hamper other merger opportunities, NYMEX chairman Richard Schaeffer said on  CNBC. "No, it would not. We're open to all opportunities," Schaeffer. "Right now we're just thrilled that our investors have the faith in us to pay the price that they do. And our job is to go back and make more money for them," he said. Shares of energy and metals exchange NYMEX Holdings Inc. NMX.N climbed as high as $150.01 per share in their market debut on Friday. Shares of the company opened up 103 percent at $120, and steadied at $139 a share, up 135.59 percent in late morning dealings on the New York Stock Exchange. On Thursday, the 6.5 million share offering raised $383.5 million after selling for $59 a share, over a $54 to $57 forecast range. "We appreciate the shareholders, certainly the confidence they had in us, the leadership we have from (chairman) Rich, the strong management team, and a good story. Obviously, investors are happy with that," Newsome said of the meteoric rise of the exchange's stock price. Newsome said he was not worried about the NYMEX's future should the bull run in energy and metal futures run out. "We've got roughly 60 new products in our pipeline right now. And we've been very creative and innovative in our new product and development. And that will continue," he said. "We think our future is really bright," he added.
