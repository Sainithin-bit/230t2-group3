 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The billionaire hedge fund manager who runs Sears Holding Corp. ( SHLD.O ) rarely speaks in public, but he has been sending a message to shareholders: Have faith. 

 Sears stockholders have done pretty well lately putting their trust in Sears Chairman Edward Lampert, a finance guru some consider a next-generation Warren Buffett who might transform Sears into a holding company in the mold of Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway. But while the stock has jumped nearly 50 percent this year, investors might feel left in the dark about the company's strategy and even the particulars on how it's making money. The company's reticence -- it no longer provides earnings forecasts or gives out monthly sales data -- and reluctance to discuss its long-term plans have put off some money managers who say they won't invest in the stock. Some observers say it's impossible to get a good handle on the business and that many individual investors probably have little idea of how much Sears has shifted away from traditional retail. Sears in many ways is transforming itself into a quasi-hedge fund along the lines of Lampert's ESL Investments fund for wealthy clients. "If you are investing in the company, you are investing every bit as much in Lampert's investing strategy as you are investing in the retailing results," said Joseph Carcello, co-founder of the University of Tennessee's Corporate Governance Center. "This isn't your father's Sears." The Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer said earlier this week that about one-third of its total earnings per share in the third quarter came from gains it made from complex derivative contracts known as "total return swaps." Under these agreements, the investor takes on the risk of an investment without actually owning the security. Hedge funds are known for secrecy, something that Lampert is clearly trying to replicate within the confines of the disclosure rules required for a public company, said David Baker, a principal at money manager North American Management Corp., which oversees $1 billion in assets but does not invest in Sears. "Sears is clearly becoming less transparent," he said. "It's not just the lack of disclosure. It's that I don't like what he's (Lampert's) investing in, because I can't quantify the risk." Already, Sears' debt is considered a riskier bet than most of its peers. Its senior unsecured debt is rated a "Ba1" -- the highest junk level -- by Moody's Investors Service. For its size, the company is one of the largest high-yield retailers in the world, said Moody's analyst Charles O'Shea. COMPLEX DERIVATIVE DEALS In its profit report this week, the Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based retailer said the derivative contracts, which generated $101 million in investment gains in the three months, involved substantial risks and that returns could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. But it did not provide many other details, including whether the derivative deals involved investments in the shares of other retailers or other types of companies altogether. The lack of information about these derivative contracts is troubling, said James Huguet, president and chief executive of Great Companies Inc., an asset management firm that does not hold Sears shares. Sears "is not the type of company we would invest in," said Huguet, whose Tampa, Florida investment firm oversees $350 million. "I would not be comfortable looking at a company that's had a one-time shot or a nonrecurring event where you can't be sure what earnings are going to do in the future." A Sears spokesman declined to provide additional details about the total return swaps beyond what was in the earnings statement. Because Sears has kept Wall Street at arms length, few stock analysts now cover the company. Lampert, who engineered Kmart's $12.3 billion buyout of Sears, Roebuck and Co., does not comment in public very often and investors must rely on his periodic "Message from the Chairman" letters to glean his insights into the business. Baker, of North American Management, said it's understandable that Sears, like some other companies, would want to move away from Wall Street's short-term focus by giving up quarterly earnings guidance. But he said the company should give investors more to go on if they want people to understand the business. "Eddie is running it like it's his own entity, but you can't have your cake and eat it too, so to speak," he said. "Quite honestly, if he doesn't want to deal with Wall Street, he should take the thing private."
