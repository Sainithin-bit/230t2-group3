 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of NYMEX Holdings Inc. NMX.N more than doubled on Friday in the strongest market debut yet this year, as investors clamored to buy into the exchanges sector, where companies are merging and valuations have soared. 

 NYMEX's surging share price leaves the company trading at nose-bleed levels compared to competitors, and also raises questions about whether it was underpriced in the first place, analysts said. But for now, investors are focusing on the potential for the commodities exchange to use its shares for acquisitions. "With all the consolidation and deals in exchanges, this industry is just on fire," said Ben Holmes, an analyst with independent research firm Morningnotes.com. "The timing of the deal is absolutely perfect." Acquisitions have been at the forefront of the industry since Chicago Mercantile Exchange Holdings Inc.'s CME.N $8 billion takeover bid last month for rival exchange CBOT Holdings Inc. BOT.N Shares of NYMEX, which owns the largest physical commodities exchange in the world, opened up 103 percent at $120 before surging as high as $150.01 in trading on the Big Board. NYMEX closed at $132.99, up $73.99 on the day. "It was what we call controlled chaos," said broker Doreen Mogavero, chief executive of Mogavero, Lee & Co., of the scene on the New York Stock Exchange floor when NYMEX began trading. "It was very, very exciting." The opening-day stock surge gave NYMEX a market value of about $12 billion, vaulting it into fifth place among exchanges globally as ranked by market capitalization, ahead of Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) and the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ). NYMEX's opening gains were the largest of this year's IPOs, beating out fast-food chain Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG.N ), which gained as much as 118 percent on its opening day. The big debut also reflected gathering momentum in the overall initial public offering market as stock markets reach six-year highs. Friday's gains leave NYMEX trading at over 70 times annualized adjusted 2006 earnings, far higher than many competitors, said Francis Gaskins, president of research firm IPO Desktop. Rival energy marketplace IntercontinentalExchange ( ICE.N ) was trading at 42 times 2006 earnings, while International Securities Exchange ISE.N, the largest equity options marketplace, was trading at 36 times 2006 earnings, according to Reuters Estimates. CME was trading at 47 times 2006 earnings and the NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N, which owns the No. 1 U.S. stock exchange, was trading at 59 times 2006 earnings. The soaring IPO may have also given a boost to other exchanges -- including Atlanta-based ICE, which was up nearly 7 percent to close at $101.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. IPO UNDERPRICED? On Thursday the 6.5 million share offering raised $383.5 million after selling for $59 per share, compared with a $54 to $57 forecast range. The gap between the offering price and the market price raised questions about why the offering's underwriters didn't price it even higher. "NYMEX may have decided that rather than raise the price higher, they would take the publicity. This instantly establishes their branding worldwide." said IPO Desktop's Gaskins of the offering price. Saying there was "no question" about further consolidation among exchanges, NYMEX chief executive James Newsome told CNBC television after the debut that the exchange was "very flexibly positioned to look at all potential opportunities to the benefit of shareholders." Enormous acquisitions have recently swept the industry. In March, the NYSE Group Inc., which owns the No. 1 U.S. stock exchange, floated its shares, rising 25 percent to $80 on their first day of trading. It is poised to acquire Paris-based rival Euronext ENXT.PA. Earlier this year, NYMEX struck a deal to sell a 10 percent stake to private equity group General Atlantic LLC for $160 million. Underwriters for the NYMEX IPO, led by JPMorgan and Merrill Lynch & Co., have the option to buy an additional 975,000 shares to cover over-allotments.
