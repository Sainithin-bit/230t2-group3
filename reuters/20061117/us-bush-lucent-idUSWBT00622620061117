 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush approved a bid by French telecommunications equipment maker Alcatel SA CGEP.PA to acquire Lucent Technologies Inc. LU.N in a $11.8 billion deal, the White House said on Friday. 

 The move came despite some concerns about safeguards for classified work that Lucent's Bell Laboratories conducts for the U.S. government. The companies have agreed to create a separate unit run by Americans to handle sensitive U.S. contracts.
