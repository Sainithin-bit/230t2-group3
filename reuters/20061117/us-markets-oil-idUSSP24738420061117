 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil fell on Friday to the lowest level since June 2005 amid fund selling across commodity markets and worries of an economic slowdown in the  United States. 

 High U.S. oil inventories heading into winter and selling pressure ahead of the expiry of the front-month U.S. crude contract at the close of trading fueled the selling. The expiring December U.S. crude contract settled down 45 cents at $55.81 a barrel, the lowest settlement price since June 15, 2005. The price of oil has fallen nearly 30 percent from the record high of $78.40 in July. London Brent crude for January delivery settled up 45 cents at $58.99 "There is rising concern that we could be going into a U.S. economic slowdown," said Rick Mueller, senior oil analyst at consultancy ESAI. "This fall also speaks of a well-supplied crude market and a warmer outlook in the U.S., and with those conditions maybe the market is starting to wake up to the fact that prices shouldn't be near $60." There was also widespread talk in the market that an investment fund was in trouble and unwinding its positions. Base metals also slid on concern that global demand for raw materials would suffer if the world's largest economy slows. London copper prices fell to their lowest levels since June. Thursday's U.S. industrial output data for October was weak, showing signs of a cooling economy. Oil markets had traded in a roughly $58-$62 barrel range for around six weeks, the longest period of rangebound trading since the same time a year ago. While the front-month U.S. contract for December was well below that level on Friday, the second-month futures contract for oil in January was still trading near $58. That contract will become the benchmark on Monday. CONTRACT EXPIRY "We really can't ignore the fact that it is contract expiry," said Mueller. "As things stand, once that contract is off the board, we'll be back where we were on Monday." Still, some traders said prices may break below the band, dragged down by ample stocks, a relatively mild start to the U.S. winter, and doubts about whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can enforce output cuts. Lower oil prices have spurred product consumption, but warmer-than-usual weather has sapped heating oil demand. The U.S. National Weather Service on Thursday forecast warmer-than-normal weather for the U.S. Northeast, the world's top heating oil market, from December until February, although other forecasts were mixed. OPEC producers agreed at an emergency meeting last month to cut supplies by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) from November 1, although investors doubt the cuts will be enacted fully. OPEC this week prepared the ground for a further cut when the group next meets on output in December, citing concern about potentially large rises in inventories next spring if it continues to pump at present levels. Analysts said the market may be testing the group to find the oil price it wants to defend. For some longer-term investors who believe markets will get tighter in the years to come as suppliers struggle to meet rising demand, the fall in price represents a buy opportunity. "I don't think short-term sentiment is looking anything other than negative," said Mark Matthias, chief executive of British investment specialist Dawnay Day Quantum. "But taking a three- to five-year view, I would be a buyer of oil below $60." (Additional reporting by  Richard Valdmanis  in New York)
