 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) said on Friday it named Wachovia Corp.'s WB.N chief executive to its board, filling one of the vacancies created by the computer and printer maker's board leak scandal that prompted the departure of three directors. 

 Separately, HP said in a filing late on Thursday that securities regulators had elevated an investigation into the company's probe of boardroom leaks. Ken Thompson, CEO of the U.S. No. 4 bank, is the ninth member of HP's board of directors and its seventh outside director, the company said on Friday. After the close of regular trade on Thursday, HP posted better-than-expected results and issued a forecast for the current period that topped analysts' estimates. Shares fell on Friday, however, as investors concluded that much of the good news had already been factored into the stock price. "With the major restructuring actions behind us, we believe it will be increasingly difficult for HP to maintain its pattern of beating estimates and raising guidance," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore in a note to clients. Shares of HP fell 42 cents, or 1 percent to $39.74 on the New York Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock is up nearly 40 percent. Thompson's appointment, which took effect on November 16, comes amid a widening probe of the Palo Alto, California-based company's tactics in identifying reporters and company directors who leaked confidential company information to the media. Venture capitalist and former director Thomas Perkins resigned in May 2006 over what he claimed were objections to some of the tactics used to ferret out the board leaks. Former director and retired HP executive George Keyworth ultimately confessed to being the source for some of the leaks and he resigned. Former Chairman Patricia Dunn, after the board room leak scandal erupted in September, offered to resign if asked to by the board. Ultimately, she also resigned. In the filing, HP said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had issued a formal order of investigation in its previously disclosed inquiry of the company's boardroom probe. HP also said in the filing that it received a request from the Federal Communications Commission for records and information relating to the leak investigations. HP on Friday also declared a regular quarterly dividend of 8 cents per share and set the date for its next annual meeting on March 14 in Santa Clara, California.
