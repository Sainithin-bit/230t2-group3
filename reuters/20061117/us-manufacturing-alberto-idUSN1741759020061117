 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Alberto-Culver Co. Inc.'s ACV.N chief financial officer, William Cernugel, plans to retire once the consumer products company appoints a successor, the company said on Friday. 

 The announcement comes a day after Alberto-Culver completed the spin-off of its Sally Beauty retail arm. Sally Beauty Holdings Inc. ( SBH.N ) is now its own publicly traded company. The manufacturing part of Alberto-Culver, which was the smaller of the two units, kept the company name and ticker symbol, Cernugel, 63, has been Alberto-Culver's CFO since May 2000 and has been with the company for 36 years. Alberto-Culver made the announcement in a filing with U.S. regulators signed by Cernugel. In the filing, the company said that Cernugel plans to retire "effective on or about the appointment by the company of his successor." Alberto-Culver, which makes Nexxus shampoo and St. Ives lotion, also said that the board's compensation committee approved a fiscal year 2006 bonus of $266,000 for Cernugel on November 13. Shares of Alberto-Culver, which is based in Melrose Park, Illinois, rose $1.07, or 5.4 percent, to $21.08 in afternoon trading. The shares had traded at $52.45 before the split and the payment of a special $25 dividend declared on Thursday. Shares of Sally Beauty, which is based in Denton, Texas, were up 8.6 percent at $7.93 after rising as high as $8.00 in their debut on the New York Stock Exchange. Sally Beauty, which is known to shoppers for its stores stocked with shampoo, hair dryers and other beauty products, also has about 1,200 sales consultants who sell professional supplies directly to salons. A fund managed by private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice invested $575 million to buy about 47.5 percent of Sally's common stock and one of the firm's operating partners, James Berges, is chairman of Sally's board. Gary Winterhalter, who led the Sally business while it was part of Alberto-Culver, serves as the independent company's president and chief executive.
