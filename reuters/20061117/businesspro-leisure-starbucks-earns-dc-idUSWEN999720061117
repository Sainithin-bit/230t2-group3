 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ), the world's 
largest coffee shop chain, said on Thursday that quarterly 
profit fell 5.2 percent, weighed down by accounting changes and 
store costs, and its shares fell nearly 6 percent. 

  It marked the first time that Starbucks' quarterly net 
profit declined since the second quarter of 2002.  One investor said that Starbucks benefited from a lower tax 
rate.  "The quality wasn't quite as good as I believe the Street 
would have liked to see," said Don Gher, chief investment 
officer for Bellevue, Washington-based Coldstream Capital 
Management, who owns Starbucks shares.  Total revenue jumped 20.7 percent to $2.0 billion, but fell 
short of Wall Street's average forecast of $2.01 billion.  Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 1 
was $117.3 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $123.7 
million, or 16 cents per share, a year ago.  The latest period included the impact of expensing stock 
compensation, which reduced earnings by 2 cents per share, and 
a requirement that addresses asset retirement obligations, 
which cut another 2 cents per share from earnings.  Excluding the impact of FIN 47, a new requirement that 
calls for retailers to estimate expected costs at the end of a 
lease, Starbucks earned $135 million, or 17 cents per share.  On that basis, the results met analysts' average forecast, 
according to Reuters Estimates. But the effective tax rate in 
the quarter was 33.2 percent, down from 38.1 percent a year 
earlier.  "The tax rate probably added a penny or so to the 
earnings," Gher said.  Sales at stores open at least 13 months, a key measure that 
is closely watched on Wall Street, rose 5 percent and Starbucks 
still expects such sales to rise 3 to 7 percent this year.
  HIGHER COSTS WEIGH  Store operating expenses rose to 42.1 percent of 
company-operated retail revenue from 40.6 percent a year 
earlier, as Starbucks added assistant store managers and retail 
support staff to handle its rapid expansion.  About 77 percent of Starbucks stores now have assistant 
managers, up from about 68 percent a year ago. The company said 
it is not adding assistant managers due to long lines it had 
this summer when more consumers ordered cold blended drinks, 
which take longer to prepare.  "Let's not make any mistake, the anomaly of the summer is 
not related whatsoever to the incremental labor costs of the 
fourth quarter and assistant managers," an executive said.  Starbucks opened a record 2,199 stores in fiscal year 2006 
and plans to open about 2,400 stores during fiscal year 2007, 
with about 700 of those abroad.  The company is also expanding the number of U.S. outlets 
that sell warm breakfast sandwiches. By this time next year, 
about 3,400 stores will have the sandwiches, up from about 
1,000 so far, President and Chief Executive Jim Donald said on 
a conference call.  He said Starbucks gets about $35,000 in additional annual 
sales per store from those that offer sandwiches.  Starbucks also said it expects to make an announcement 
about its next entertainment partnership sometime during the 
beginning of next year.  The Seattle-based company still expects to post total net 
revenue growth of about 20 percent and earnings of 87 cents to 
89 per share this year. Analysts had expected a profit of 89 
cents per share.  Shares of Starbucks fell 5.7 percent to $37.20 in extended 
trade. The shares closed at $39.43 on Nasdaq after rising to a 
high of $40.01.  The chain's stock trades at roughly 44.3 times analysts' 
average 2007 earnings estimate, compared with an average 
multiple of 19.8 for companies in the Dow Jones U.S.
