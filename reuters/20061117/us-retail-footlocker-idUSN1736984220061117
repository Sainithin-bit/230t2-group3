 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Foot Locker Inc. ( FL.N ) denied on Friday that it was exploring a potential sale of the company, quashing hopes by some investors who had banked on profit-taking, and shares fell as much as 6 percent. 

 Speculation of a buyout of the world's largest retailer of athletic shoes and apparel has simmered since the spring. It was heightened by the company's hiring of an advisory firm in August and by Foot Locker's refusal to comment on any buyout interest. On Friday, Chief Executive Matthew Serra dispelled the rumors on a conference call with analysts, a day after the company posted third quarter results that narrowly beat Wall Street earnings and sales estimates. "The continued rumors in the press regarding Foot Locker being involved in discussions of a potential sale of the company are not true," said Serra. "There are no discussions taking place, nor have there been." Serra told analysts that Foot Locker had hired Evercore Partners to advise it on a range of matters and strategic consulting firm the Parthenon Group to assist it in reviewing its business plan. Susquehanna Financial analyst John Shanley, who rates the stock "positive," said that now that a sale was not in sight, the company will have to be judged on its own merits. Foot Locker has a dominant market share in the United States but its profit has been crimped by weak European sales "There isn't any incentive on the part of potential investors to look for a richer multiple being paid for the company," Shanley said. "You're seeing a lot of the momentum people that jumped into the stock with the expectation they'd see a quick profit, they're the ones bailing out today." WILL "FOOTQUARTERS" TAP INTO HIGHER MARGIN BUSINESS? On the conference call, Serra detailed plans for a new lower-priced chain of family footwear called "Footquarters" that the company hopes will be able to tap into the $25 billion dress and casual shoe business. Approximately 60 percent of merchandise will be athletic shoes, with the rest dress and casual shoes, which carry higher profit margins than the athletic business. The company plans to open up to 70 stores in 2007, with the first group to open in April or May and the second in the fall. "We feel that our buying power in the athletic segment will give us enhanced margins versus our competition, so I personally believe it could be a very large division," said Serra, adding that the business could eventually expand to Canada, Mexico and Central America. Analyst Shanley said the dress and casual business hinges much more on strong merchandise styling than in the athletic shoe business. "It's a very competitive (business), very fast-moving and very different from what Foot Locker currently has in its merchandise mix," Shanley said. "It's a very different animal." Foot Locker is also opening a chain of athletic hat stores called "Champs Sports Just Hats," that Shanley said would try to steal market share from Genesco Inc.'s ( GCO.N ) successful Hat World chain. That business has operating profit margins of 12 percent to 13 percent, higher than the average for specialty retail, he said. "They (Foot Locker) see the numbers that Hat World is doing for Genesco and see this as an opportunity." Shanley said. Shares of Footlocker trade at 14 times 2008 earnings, at a premium to Genesco at 13 times forward-looking earnings, but below rival Finish Line Inc. ( FINL.O ) at 16.5. Foot Locker shares were down 90 cents, or nearly 4 percent, to $23.01 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Martinne Geller )
