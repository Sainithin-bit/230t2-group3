 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ) will leave all options open should German truckmaker MAN's ( MANG.DE ) bid for rival Swedish truckmaker Scania ( SCVb.ST ) fail, Europe's largest carmaker said on Friday. 

 "In the case of an apparent failure of the bid, Volkswagen will keep all alternative possibilities open," it said in a statement released after a meeting of its supervisory board. It also said the board had approved the appointment of Martin Winterkorn, who currently heads VW's premium unit Audi, as group chief executive from the start of next year.
