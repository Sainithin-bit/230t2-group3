 LONDON  (Reuters) - A more than $3 plunge in oil prices to their lowest levels for nearly two years has not ended a sustained bull run, but could jolt OPEC into further defensive action. 

 A two-day fund-driven sell-off pushed U.S. crude to a low of around $55 a barrel on Friday, its weakest since June 2005 and at the bottom of the price range OPEC officials say the group needs to protect its revenues. "It's the classic middle of a bull market. I don't think people are going to exit en masse," said Mark Matthias of British investment specialist Dawnay Day Quantum. "It's only a stage in the market... I suspect OPEC will be able to impose a level of discipline," he said, adding price support would also come from a return of political risk. U.S. oil would have to fall decisively below $48 to break the three-year rally and technical analysts said strong support around $52 for U.S. crude and then a major psychological barrier at $50 stood in the way. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries recognizes that a stall in the charge that took prices from $30 a barrel in December 2003 to $78.40 in July could force another cut in output when the group meets in December. OPEC is monitoring signs of a slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in top fuel consumer the United States, ample levels of stocks and forecasts for a big increase in non-OPEC supply. Already, OPEC decided last month to cut output by 1.2 million barrels per day from November 1. Mike Wittner of investment bank Calyon said OPEC would be obliged to pare back production, but an uptick in demand would do much of its work. "Stocks are high. I think they do need to cut and at this point, they need to cut simply because they have said they're going to cut," said Wittner. "But the real driver is going to be good, old-fashioned demand." DOUBTS ABOUT OPEC Doubts about OPEC's ability to stick to its existing supply pact have helped to drive this week's sell-off. Olivier Jakob, analyst at Petromatrix, said Friday's price drop was exaggerated because the U.S. December crude futures contract expired at close of trade. "If the collapse had happened at another time, it would be much more bearish," he said. The January contract, which becomes the new front month after the weekend, was trading around $58 a barrel, just within the market's six-week range of around $58-$62 -- bang in the middle of the protracted bull run. But that would probably not reassure OPEC, whose economies have grown ever more dependent on high oil revenues to balance their budgets and finance ambitious spending projects, including plans to increase oil capacity. Nigerian Oil Minister Edmund Daukoru, also OPEC's president, told Reuters on Wednesday a cut in December was "most likely because the price is still alternating between $58 and $60." Roger Diwan of PFC Energy in Washington said he saw leading OPEC producer Saudi Arabia aiming for a U.S. crude price of between $55 and $65. "There's a revenue target for Saudi Arabia and it all starts from there," said Roger Diwan of PFC Energy in Washington. "OPEC's ultimate benchmark remains prices." While OPEC is keen to keep prices strong, it is also wary of destroying economic growth and demand for its crude. Energy analysts are divided about the future strength of the world's biggest economy. "Our outlook is very, very bearish for the U.S. economy," said Harry Tchilinguirian of BNP Paribas. But he still predicted prices would rally after weakness in the first half of next year. "There is still tightness in refining capacity, there is still supply disruption in Nigeria and Iraq ... Geopolitical threats have receded, but they are still there," he said.

Goldman Sachs said its commodities index, which is the market's biggest investment vehicle, would increase to around $110 billion by January and Dawnay Day's Matthias said he saw no reason for investors to turn away. "Taking a three-to-five year view, I would be a buyer of oil below $60," said Matthias. (additional reporting by Colin Wooster)
