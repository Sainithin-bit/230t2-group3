 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of United States Steel Corp. ( X.N ) rose over 8 percent on Friday and options were active, as talk reignited that the company is a takeover target, analysts said. 

 "U.S. Steel shares are up dramatically on renewed takeout chatter," said Paul Foster, options strategist at Web site theflyonthewall.com in Chicago. In addition, analysts said a Moscow newspaper reporting on the possibility of a deal between Severstal and U.S. Steel had pushed up shares. The takeover talk has prompted many investors to aggressively seek upside calls to bet on further gains in the stock, Foster said. The demand for options has also pushed up U.S. Steel options volatility, as investors brace for a big stock move. More than 110,000 contracts had changed hands in U.S. Steel in the U.S. options market by mid-afternoon, way above its normal volume of 15,250 contracts, according to market research firm Track Data. U.S. Steel declined to comment. Meanwhile, shares of the company, which has been the subject of takeover rumors for months, rose $5.61, or 8.7 percent, to $70.21 in New York Stock Exchange trading. At one point, the stock traded as high as $71.82. Steel has become attractive as prices have been on the rise due to strong demand both domestically and abroad. "Overall, the steel group is up today trading very actively, as there are rumors circulating that a takeover might occur in this sector," said William Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance Investments in New York. The stock rise also comes on a day when Brazil's Companhia Siderurgica Nacional ( CSNA3.SA ) ( SID.N ) said that it has approached Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus Group CS.L CS.AX with a takeover offer. Corus had already agreed to be bought by India's Tata Steel ( TISC.BO ). In addition, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corp. WPSC.O was in the news on Friday as shareholders voted on whether to elect a slate backed by privately held Esmark, which is trying to take over the company. The result of that vote has not been released; but Esmark has said it is confident it will win, which would sideline a previous deal between Wheeling-Pittsburgh and CSN. NEWSPAPER SAYS SEVERSTAL WANTS US STEEL Analysts said that the stock has moved in part on a report in a Moscow newspaper saying that Severstal wants to buy U.S. Steel. Steel and iron company Metalloinvest, controlled by billionaire Alisher Usmanov plans to merge with steelmaker Severstal ( CHMF.RTS ), Kommersant business daily reported on Friday, quoting unnamed banking and company sources. A source at Metalloinvest told Kommersant the company is holding "broad consultations on the market" and has picked a likely partner for a merger, the paper said. "We understood that we will get the highest synergy effect from a merger with Severstal because we both produce thick steel plate for the construction industry. This market is developing very rapidly," the source said. Kommersant said Severstal declined to comment. The paper quoted analysts as saying the merged company would have a market value of $20 billion. The paper quoted Moscow-based analysts as saying such a merger would strengthen Severstal's positions for further acquisitions in the steel industry. The paper quoted banking sources as saying Severstal was interested in U.S. Steel. Severstal has said it wants to be the world's second-largest steelmaker.
