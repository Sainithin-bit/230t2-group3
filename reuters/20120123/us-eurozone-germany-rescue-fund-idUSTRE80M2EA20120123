 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany denied a report on Monday that it was ready to boost the combined firepower of the euro zone's rescue funds to 750 billion euros ($978 billion). 
 "It is not true. There is no such decision," German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert told Reuters, referring to a Financial Times newspaper report earlier that Germany would accept an increase of the rescue schemes in return for its euro zone peers accepting tough budget rules in a new fiscal compact.
