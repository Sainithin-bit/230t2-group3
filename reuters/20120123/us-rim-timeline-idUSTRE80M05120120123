 (Reuters) - Mike Lazaridis and Jim Balsillie, the tandem who led the company that makes the BlackBerry smartphone for two decades, have stepped down as co-CEO and co-chairman of Research In Motion. 
 Here is major milestones in the history of the Canadian company: February 1985 - Mike Lazaridis and Douglas Fregin co-found Research In Motion as an electronics and computer science business based in Waterloo, Ontario, the Canadian university city where Lazaridis studied. 1989 - RIM develops a network gateway later introduced as RIMGate, a predecessor to its BlackBerry Enterprise Server. 1992 - Jim Balsillie joins RIM as co-CEO, mortgaging his house and investing $250,000. 1994 - RIM launches handheld point of sale card reader, which verified debit and credit transactions directly to a bank. 1995 - RIM builds its own radio modem for wireless email. 1997 - RIM lists on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising more than $115 million.

The next year revenue is $221 million. Late 1999 - The company shares are listed on Nasdaq, raising another $250 million. RIM introduces BlackBerry 850 Wireless Handheld, combining email, wireless data networks and a Qwerty keyboard. Demand explodes. September 11, 2001 - People trapped in New York's World Trade Center use BlackBerrys to communicate after cellular networks collapse. November, 2001 - NTP sues RIM for patent infringement, the start of a five-year legal tussle. Late in the battle, the U.S. Justice Department says a threatened BlackBerry shutdown would damage the public interest due to their heavy use by government. 2002 - RIM adds voice transmission to the BlackBerry. 2004 - Surpasses one million BlackBerry subscribers.

November, 2007 - Google's open source Android platform is unveiled. It launches in October 2008. May, 2008 - RIM introduces the Bold, a major refresh and still one of its top-tier products.

November 2008 - RIM launches BlackBerry Storm, its first touchscreen and keyboard-less device.

The company appoints Thorstein Heins as CEO and Barbara Stymiest as chair of the board. (Reporting by  Alastair Sharp )
