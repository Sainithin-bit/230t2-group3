 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday unveiled a plan to inject $250 billion into beleaguered U.S. banks to beat back a credit crisis that threatens to swamp the economy. 

 KEY POINTS: * U.S. Treasury says to buy up to $250 billion in senior preferred, nonvoting shares in financial institutions * Treasury says maximum purchase amount will be $25 billion per institution * Treasury sets deadline of Nov 14 for banks to participate in equity purchase program * Treasury says preferred shares to pay 5 percent a year for first 5 years, 9 percent after 5 years * Treasury says firms in program must adopt Treasury's standards executive pay, corporate governance * Treasury says for firms in program, compensation for top executives won't be tax deductible above $500,000 COMMENTS: RICHARD GOODMAN, CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, PEPSI, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "The (commercial paper) market is obviously a volatile one, so it's just something we need to stay on top of. Obviously like everybody else we're hoping that the stabilization of the banking system and interbank lending will help enormously to stabilize the financial situation." "I think that stabilizing the banking system and restoring confidence is critical to stabilizing the financial markets. The issue here is flow of funds and making sure that the funds that are available -- and there are a lot of people and institutions with money to invest -- that they feel confident in being able to put that money into the places that then can loan it out. I'm hopeful that the coordinated global response will work." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES, NEW YORK: "Clearly the markets are relieved by these actions and see them as a way of ensuring the financial system doesn't collapse in of itself. "There was a growing realization even if the TARP plan worked as it was hoped it would, and even if you did get price discovery, that it wasn't going to be implement fast enough to have this full effect. "Everybody in these markets had come to the realization you needed to have something radical to restore trust and confidence among banks. Many of the banks weren't real keen on taking this capital infusion from the government, but they recognized it had to be all or none. "The goal here is to give confidence in one another... I think we're going to find it has the desired effect. "We're in a period of economic stagnation and contraction, it's probably going to last another few months and into next year, but at the same time this is happening we should be a little encouraged by the drop of oil prices we've had recently." SUBODH KUMAR, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SUBODH KUMAR & ASSOCIATES, TORONTO: "The plan continues the investment objectives that were continued elsewhere, especially the recapitalization of financial institutions and the easing of the credit freeze. I think a major fear people had was that this would become political, but because it is a global move there is clearly no political agenda. "We saw a bounce-back yesterday, some of the relief already happened yesterday. I think the markets will continue to show recovery today, though maybe not at the same rate as yesterday. Volatility going forward is likely to continue. The markets will be affected by a 30-35 percent decline in earnings, which is a bigger decline than in 2001-2002. Also, these capital injections come at a cost. Credit is stilly clearly not freely available. All these things mean that volatility will continue. "It's possible or likely that the Friday numbers were the low, but I'll leave calling that a bottom to others. I think that the market has been discounting earnings." ROBERT ANDRES, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT CONSULTANTS, PHILADELPHIA: "This is still 'whack- a-mole.' They sold this to public so poorly. This one-a-day pill is insanity. This does not instill confidence. Now they are giving the money to the banks and some of them didn't want it." "They has taken us away from the risk of a systemic collapse, but it could be managed better. Everything seems reactionary and random. This doesn't build confidence. "They need to explain to the public why credit and liquidity are important. Liquidity is synonymous with confidence. Everything is frozen without confidence." "Policymakers need take some of these steps: guarantee the transactions in the interbank market; support the recapitalization of certain banks, which they have done to some extent; purchase of mortgage-backed securities to increase the flows of funds in the financial system and a massive fiscal package that creates jobs and invest infrastructure. "Right now they are not getting the bang for their dollars. They need to relate to them how they affect the public's lives. We are spending a lot of empty calories which are not going to create a lot of jobs." JIM AWAD, CHAIRMAN, W.P. STEWART & CO., NEW YORK: "The bank plan is another step in the right direction. The markets have been looking for it and they're reacting positively to it. I expect it to add to the series of efforts that will add stability to the financial and credit markets, but it's important to not get overly euphoric, because we still have to enforce it. It's like, if someone has a heart attack, they can't go out jogging the next day. I would put the financial system on the rehabilitation stage. "There's been damage done, we'll see that when companies give their third-quarter results and provide fourth-quarter outlooks. There may be some stability in the markets, but you don't want to get overly excited because there has already been damage and the rehabilitation will be slow." GREGORY MILLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, SUNTRUST BANKS, ATLANTA: "This clearly adds an immense backstop against the prospect of the largest of the financials falling into capital inadequacy. "We have a capital adequacy problem that we can't seem to solve no matter how much cash we dump on to it because mark to market keeps moving the target. That will likely happen as long as house prices are falling and there's no way of telling when that stops. "It probably serves a useful purpose. The kindest of us would suggest that it's a necessary evil, and that probably ranged down to folks who absolutely can't stand the interference in the markets." STEPHEN MALYON, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, SCOTIA CAPITAL, TORONTO: "Most of the news was outlined in the morning press. I didn't really see anything in the joint statement from the Fed, Treasury and FDIC that introduced anything shocking given what we've already read in the papers this morning. "Dollar/yen is moving a little bit higher, but it's already positive on the session. I think partly this reflects pressure on the carry trade. Basically the world's lowest yielding currencies are underperforming." KEVIN LOGAN, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, DRESDNER KLEINWORT, NEW YORK: "It is certainly going to have a positive affect on financial markets. One of the important things is guaranteeing bank debt. Everyone is focusing on the capital infusion, which is helpful, but guaranteeing the bank debt will have an immediate impact -- banks have not been able to roll over their debt recently and that compromises or interferes with their funding and makes them less secure overall and it is a downward spiral. So by guaranteeing the debt they will now be able to roll over debt and that will keep them funded. So that immediately alleviates a lot of the problems." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. equity index futures hit session highs BONDS: Treasury debt prices add to losses DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extends gains against yen RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures steady, suggesting a nearly 100 percent chance the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in October.
