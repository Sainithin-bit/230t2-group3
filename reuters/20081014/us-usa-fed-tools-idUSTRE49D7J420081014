 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has rolled out a series of measures over the past 14 months to enhance its liquidity tools and ease strains in credit markets that have been hammered by mortgage-related losses. 

 The following is a look at the Fed's liquidity toolkit. DISCOUNT WINDOW The discount window is the Fed's traditional way of providing liquidity to depository institutions that it regulates. The Fed's first liquidity salvo was on August 17, 2007, when it unexpectedly lowered the discount rate by a half-percentage point, narrowing the spread above the benchmark federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for loans -- to a half-percentage point. * The Fed also extended the term of financing to 90 days for institutions in good standing. * The Fed on March 16 again narrowed the spread between the discount rate and the fed funds rate to a quarter-percentage point, where it remains. As of the Fed's last policy-setting action October 8, the discount rate stands at 1.75 percent, while the fed funds target is 1.5 percent. The Fed accepts a broad range of collateral for loans at the discount window. SHORING UP MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUNDS, MORTGAGE DEBT The Fed on Sept 19 said it will open its discount window to financial institutions to allow them to buy certain assets from money market mutual funds. Non-recourse loans will be offered at the primary credit rate to finance purchases of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP). This should help funds that hold such paper meet demands for redemptions by investors and boost liquidity in the ABCP markets and broader money markets. The move came in step with a $50 billion pledge from the U.S. Treasury to bank money market mutual funds. The Fed also announced plans to purchase federal agency discount notes from primary dealers. Those notes are short-term debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were seized by the government on September 7, and the Federal Home Loan Banks. SWAP LINES WITH OTHER CENTRAL BANKS The Fed has steadily expanded reciprocal currency arrangements with other major central banks to lend to their local commercial banks in a bid to get U.S. dollars circulating in overnight and short-term money markets. On October 14 The U.S. Federal Reserve erased the upper limit on its currency swap line with the Bank of Japan, the latest in an extensive series of steps to restore stability in shaky credit markets world-wide. On October 13, the Fed said it would lift the cap on its swap facilities with the Bank of England, the European Central Bank and the Swiss National bank to provide funding "in quantities sufficient to meet demand." The Fed also has authorized swap lines with the central banks of Canada, Norway, Australia, and Sweden. PRIMARY DEALER CREDIT FACILITY (PDCF) The Fed said that "in light of continued fragile circumstances in financial markets" it would extend this facility until January 30. The measure, introduced on March 16 for an initial six months, allows investment banks overnight access to the Fed's discount window for lender-of-last-resort cash. This was the first time since the Great Depression that the Fed had lent money directly to investment banks it did not regulate, and the move highlighted the gravity of conditions facing the financial system around the time of the rescue of investment bank Bear Sterns by JPMorgan Chase. Loans under the PDCF are collateralized by investment-grade securities. AUCTION OF TERM SECURITIES LENDING FACILITY (TSLF) OPTIONS The Fed has authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to auction options for primary dealers to borrow securities from the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF). The amount will be for up to $50 billion of draws on the TSLF, and will be collateralized by the full range of investment-grade assets that qualify for regular TSLF auctions. The Fed said the options will be for exercise ahead of periods when market conditions have become stressed, like quarter-ends. The $50 billion option draws will be in addition to the $200 billion that may be offered under regular TSLF auctions. TERM SECURITIES LENDING FACILITY (TSLF) Under the TSLF, the New York Fed conducts weekly auctions of 28-day loans of Treasury securities to primary dealers. Loans under the TSLF are collateralized by a range of government and private securities. TERM AUCTION FACILITY (TAF) LOANS The Fed launched the Term Auction Facility (TAF) in December to provide funds over longer period to a wider range of banks and has steadily enlarged it. On October 6, the Fed increased TAF to $150 billion for both the 28- and 84-day auctions. The increases will eventually lift outstanding amounts under the regular TAF to $600 billion. The Fed has also announced two forward TAF auctions aimed at ensuring funding will be available over year end, for $150 billion each, potentially meaning that $900 billion of TAF credit will be outstanding at year-end. The Fed accepts the same broad range of collateral at the TAF as it does at the discount window, including home mortgages and mortgage-backed securities. TERM REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS The Fed on March 7 announced a series of 28-day repurchase transactions for primary dealers, expected to add up to $100 billion. Eligible collateral is the same as for open market operations. COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY (CPFF) The Fed on October 7 said it would fund purchases of highly-rated, U.S.-dollar denominated, three-month commercial paper to ease strains in that market, which is widely used to fund day-to-day business operations. Purchases will be made through a special purpose vehicle that would buy unsecured and asset-backed commercial paper beginning October 27. On October 14, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York named Pacific Management Investment Corp as asset manager for the CPFF and State Street Bank and Trust Co as custodian for the facility. OTHER TRADITIONAL TOOLS The Fed also provides liquidity through its traditional open market operations and securities lending to primary dealers. The loans of funds or Treasury securities are typically overnight repurchase agreements against collateral of Treasuries, agencies, or agency MBS. Sources: Federal Reserve  here New York Fed  here
