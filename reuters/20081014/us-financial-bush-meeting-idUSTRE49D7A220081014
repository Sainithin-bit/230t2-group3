 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President George W. Bush will meet with French President Nicolas Sarkozy and European Commission President Manuel Barroso on Saturday to discuss the global financial crisis, the White House said on Tuesday. 

 Bush invited the two leaders, who will already be in Canada for meetings, to dinner at the Camp David presidential retreat and they will discuss a wide range of issues "which would certainly include the global financial issues," said White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe.
