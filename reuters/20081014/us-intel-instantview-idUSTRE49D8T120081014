 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) posted a 12 percent increase in third-quarter net profit on improved gross margins, sending its shares up 4 percent. 

 COMMENTARY SEAN CONNER, SENIOR EQUITY ANALYST, FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS IN MINNEAPOLIS "The bottom line is that they did better than expected. Gross margins came in better than people were expecting, for both this quarter and in its outlook for the fourth quarter. For me, this is a relief rally more than anything else." "Couple of things I'm looking for on the call: they lowered capital expenditure for 2008, the key is what the capex will be for 2009, since it'll affect gross margins. I'm looking for a 2009 outlook." "As for how Intel shares will perform going forward, tell me how the market will do and I'll tell you how Intel will do. All things being equal, it should outperform the market, but who can tell with this crazy market these days." ROB BURLESON, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS: "While there will be estimate revisions in this earnings season, it seems they won't be disastrous. Intel's number cut (on fourth quarter revenue) was not that bad. It's definitely a shortfall. The consensus had been for $10.8 billion and now they are guiding more to like $10.5 billion."
