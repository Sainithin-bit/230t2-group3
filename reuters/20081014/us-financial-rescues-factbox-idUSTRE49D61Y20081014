 (Reuters) - The world's richest nations have vowed to prevent vitally important banks from failing and to unfreeze credit markets in a bid to halt panic in financial markets. 

 The United States on Tuesday said $250 billion would be directly injected into financial institutions as part of a rescue plan aimed at restoring normality to the markets and laying the groundwork for an economic recovery.
