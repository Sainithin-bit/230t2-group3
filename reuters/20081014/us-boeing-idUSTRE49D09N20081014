 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Monday that a second round of mediated talks with its biggest union, which has been on strike for five weeks, had failed. 

 The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) called members out on strike on September 6, after a majority rejected Boeing's "best and final" contract offer. Boeing and union negotiators sat down for further talks last weekend. But late on Monday, Boeing said in a statement that the latest talks were adjourned without an agreement and that no new talks were currently scheduled. "We worked very hard to find solutions, and we are extremely disappointed that the talks broke off," Doug Kight, Boeing vice president of human resources, said in a statement. The work stoppage has idled the plane makers' Seattle area plants for more than a month. About 27,000 Boeing employees are on strike. On the union's Website, IAM District 751 President Tom Wroblewski said federal mediators adjourned the latest talks. "The company is attempting to put the union in an unacceptable position to bargain away our members' jobs," Wroblewski said on the union web site. "The union will continue to look for ways to resolve this strike so that our members can return to building airplanes ... but it cannot be at the price of selling out thousands of our members' jobs," Wroblewski added.
