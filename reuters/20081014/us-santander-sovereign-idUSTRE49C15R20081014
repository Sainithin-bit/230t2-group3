 MADRID  (Reuters) - Santander's ( SAN.MC ) takeover of Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N will have little impact on its overall capital levels, but it will sell assets and make additional provisions of $1.2 billion over the next two years. 

 The Spanish bank said in a presentation on Tuesday the deal will add 0.5 percent to earnings per share by 2011 and it would make pretax savings of $215 million over three years. The bank, which has been spared the worst afflictions of the credit crisis due in part to conservative regulation by Spanish authorities, said it would maintain its core tier 1 ratio above 6 percent and make credit portfolio reductions of $10 billion over three years. "This is a low risk deal," Chief Financial Officer Jose Antonio Alvarez told a presentation. "This fits perfectly with our profile," he said. The euro zone's biggest bank said on Monday it would buy the remaining stake of 75.65 percent in U.S. bank Sovereign it does not already own for $1.9 billion in stock. [nN13455348] Santander will sell assets to offset the impact on its capital base from the deal, including its share in Cepsa CEP.MC and Banco de Venezuela. Analysts said Sovereign did not expose Santander to much risk. "Sovereign was a spearhead in the United States, Santander's just thrown in a tip and got the whole thing," a senior London banker said. "Sovereign is a troubled bank, but it's so small that they could lose it all and it wouldn't make a difference. It's one of the few cases where you can lose less than you've invested." At 1401 GMT, Santander shares were trading up 2.2 percent at 10.41 euros, compared with a 2.4 percent gain in the European banking sector .SX7P.
