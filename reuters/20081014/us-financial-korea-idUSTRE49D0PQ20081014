 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's finance minister was quoted as saying on Tuesday that the government would consider further measures to support local banks in the global credit crisis as the won jumped for a second day. 

 But the central bank chief warned that the outlook for Asia's fourth-largest economy remained tough, with growth likely to stay under 4 percent until the middle of 2009 and even then there was no guarantee it would improve after that. Pledges by governments around the world to pour cash into their battered banks and ease the turmoil in world financial markets pushed the won to a two-week high against the dollar as Asian currencies and stock markets rallied across the board. The won's rise followed two trading sessions that have seen some of the wildest swings in the currency since the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis. "The latest measures and steps taken by governments come as an enormous relief to investors, and they have helped them regain some trust in the financial system. We are seeing liquidity slowly returning to markets, and this is a good sign," said Lee Kyoung-su, a market analyst at Taurus Investment & Securities. By 0340 GMT, the won was quoted around 1,209 to the dollar, after earlier touching its highest since September 29 at around 1,180. The equally hard-hit share market also took heart from the latest moves by governments around the world, shooting up some 5 percent in morning trade. By 0340 GMT, the main index was up 4.6 percent. The rise takes gains on the week to some 9.5 percent, recouping some of last week's 12.6 percent fall, which was the biggest weekly retreat since 2001. South Korea's financial institutions have looked especially vulnerable to the credit crunch as local banks have had to scramble to find dollars to service short-term debts. In addition, they face the prospect of some clients struggling to pay off loans as domestic growth slows. CONSIDERING GUARANTEE Finance Minister Kang Man-soo was quoted as saying that the government would consider guaranteeing local banks' foreign currency debts. "We need to consider that carefully in the future. If necessary, we will do that," Kang told reporters in the United States, according to local online news provider EDaily. Kang had been in Washington for the annual IMF/World Bank meeting and his office had earlier said he was expected to meet top executives of major U.S. banks to ask them to keep credit lines open for South Korean banks. He was also quoted as saying the government would consider raising government guarantees on bank deposits, in case of a massive withdrawal of deposits. The turmoil comes as growth expectations for the export-driven economy decline as consumers around the world cut spending. "It would be difficult for the economy to grow 4 percent (annually) in the fourth quarter and until the first half of the next year," Bank of Korea Governor Lee Seong-tae was quoted by his office as saying in Washington. "It is also difficult to confidently say that the economy would get better in the second half," he added. Lee said inflation would be the top priority in deciding interest rate policy by the central bank, which last week followed global moves by trimming rates 0.25 percentage point. He repeated the government's pledge to dip into foreign exchange reserves of $240 billion -- the world's sixth largest -- to help relax the dollar funding squeeze at home. "A central bank wants the market to solve it.. (But) we will act as the last resort with our foreign exchange reserves, although we need to be careful as we don't know how long the recent turmoil would last," he said.
