 LJUBLJANA  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) is interested in taking over Slovenia's largest bank Nova Ljubljanska Banka (NLB), daily paper Finance reported on Friday, citing unofficial government sources. 

 The newspaper gave no details. It also said the government would approve a possible takeover of NLB by Belgian banking and insurance group KBC ( KBC.BR ), citing the sources. The government gave no immediate comment. The government and its affiliated companies hold 48 percent of the unlisted NLB. KBC owns 30.6 percent of NLB and had hoped to gain a majority in the bank in 2006, but the government rejected its bid saying Slovenian shareholders should remain in the majority. NLB, which was the only Slovenian bank included in the recent European Union stress tests, passed narrowly and said it plans a capital hike of 400 million euros ($523.5 million) later this year to increase its strength. Prime Minister Borut Pahor said last week the government has not yet decided whether to inject capital in the bank by itself or to sell some of its stake in NLB.
