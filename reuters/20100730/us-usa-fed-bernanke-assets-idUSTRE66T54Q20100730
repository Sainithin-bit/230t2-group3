 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's personal finances recovered in 2009, disclosure forms released by the central bank on Friday showed. 

 Bernanke listed assets in a range of $1.2 million to $2.5 million. They had slipped to between $822,011 to $1.8 million in the previous year, from $1.7 million and $2.5 million in 2007. Bernanke's assets included annuities, mutual funds and money market funds. His two largest holdings were annuities from the TIAA-CREF financial services company worth between $500,001 and $1 million each. The most affluent Fed board member was Governor Elizabeth Duke, who listed assets worth between $3.5 million and $8.2 million. Governor Kevin Warsh's wife, Jane Lauder, granddaughter of the founder of the Estee Lauder cosmetics company, listed assets worth at least $66.3 million. Warsh listed assets worth between $702,000 and $1.5 million. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by Dan Grebler)
