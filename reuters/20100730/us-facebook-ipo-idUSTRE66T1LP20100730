 (Reuters) - Social networking website Facebook Inc may postpone its initial public offering until 2012, Bloomberg said, citing three people familiar with the matter. 

 The move may give Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg more time to gain users and boost sales, but Zuckerberg could still push for a stock sale at any time, the agency said. Jonathan Thaw, a spokesman for Facebook, declined to comment, Bloomberg said. Facebook could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters outside regular U.S. business hours. Zuckerberg said in a recent television interview Facebook will sell stock in an IPO "when it makes sense." (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by  David Holmes )
