 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Newell Rubbermaid ( NWL.N ) beat quarterly profit estimates, but warned that it expected weakness in the global economy to continue through the year. 

 While the maker of Rubbermaid containers and Sharpie pens got help from developing markets like Latin America and Asia in the latest second quarter, it raised concerns about uneven sales trends in key markets like North America and Europe. "It has become unlikely that we will see a meaningful improvement in the macroeconomic situation over the next six months," Chief Executive Mark Ketchum said on a call. A U.S. Commerce Department report on Friday showed U.S. economic growth slowed in the second quarter as companies invested heavily in equipment from abroad and consumers spent less, raising concerns about the recovery in the rest of 2010. [ID:nN29111411] Newell, whose sales fell 0.5 percent to $1.5 billion in the quarter, continues to expect net sales growth at a low- to mid-single-digit percentage rate and margins to rise by 0.75 to 1.00 percentage point in the year. "We are pleased with this rate of growth especially given we are not getting much help from the economy," Ketchum said. Its second-quarter net income rose to $130.4 million, or 41 cents a share, from $105.7 million, or 37 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned 51 cents a share, beating the analysts' average estimate of 44 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Newell's second-quarter results were "generally solid," Oppenheimer's Joseph Altobello said. He wondered, however, if the sales growth was sustainable and if the company could successfully offset rising commodity costs. The company also raised concerns about rising labor costs in China and freight costs. A PROMOTIONAL BACK-TO-SCHOOL SEASON? Newell said sales ahead of the back-to-school season have been encouraging, but pointed out that many retailers were preparing for what seems like a promotional back-to-school season. The company's customers range from discounter Target Corp ( TGT.N ) to office supplies retailer Staples Inc ( SPLS.O ). On Friday, Newell raised its full-year profit outlook, counting on strength in the second quarter, price hikes and other initiatives like exiting certain product categories like shelving and wooden pencils. It now sees 2010 earnings of $1.40 to $1.50 a share before items, up from its prior forecast of $1.38 to $1.48. Newell shares, which have fallen 13 percent since touching a year-high in April, were down slightly at $15.57 on Friday. (Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Dave Zimmerman)
