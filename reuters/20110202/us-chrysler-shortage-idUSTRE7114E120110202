 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler Group LLC canceled first production shifts at several plants in eight locations on Wednesday due to a shortage of parts. 

 The affected plants are largely concentrated in Michigan and include Jefferson North, where Chrysler builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, and the Sterling Heights assembly plant, which makes the Chrysler 200. Chrysler's plant in Brampton, Ontario, where it makes the Chrysler 300, the Dodge Challenger and the Dodge Charger, is also temporarily shut down. The company said in a statement Wednesday that it will decide whether or not to cancel the day's second shift by noon. This is the second time in less than a week that parts shortages have prompted Chrysler to temporarily shut down a plant. Its minivan plant in Windsor, Ontario, has been closed this week. Chrysler is managed and 25-percent owned by Italy's Fiat SpA. (Reporting by  Deepa Seetharaman , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
