 PARIS  (Reuters) - A senior Federal Reserve official said on Thursday he was hopeful of strong U.S. economic growth to close out the year, but said he was "losing faith" in employment starting to rise before 2010. 

 The U.S. economy grew at a stronger-than-expected 3.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter, signaling the end of a deep recession, although analysts said the growth was driven by temporary government stimulus. "We've only had one quarter of strong (gross domestic product) growth so far, but I'm hopeful that we'll get another one in the current quarter," St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President James Bullard told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of a conference in Paris. "Hopefully that will set us up for a good performance in the first half of 2010," he said. Bullard said he was "losing faith" in there being an increase in jobs by the end of 2009, but added he expected to see the economy adding jobs in the first part of 2010. The U.S. economy lost 190,000 jobs in October, sending the unemployment rate to 10.2 percent, a 26-1/2 year high. Bullard cautioned the economy would have to be adding jobs at a rate of around 200,000 a month before it would make a dent in the unemployment rate. "You need it really to be 200,000 or something, it can't just be a little bit positive. It has to be quite positive before you start seeing unemployment coming down so I think labor markets are going to take a while to improve," he said. The U.S. central bank slashed interest rates to near zero last December and has kept them there to foster a recovery from the deepest recession since the 1930s. With overnight rates near zero, the Fed this year turned to efforts to drive down other borrowing costs and jump-start growth by buying $300 billion in longer-term U.S. government debt, $175 billion in housing agency debt and up to $1.25 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. Bullard said the U.S. central bank faces a decision on whether it should adjust the asset purchases program -- also known as quantitative easing -- or raise rates first when it begins to tighten policy. "I don't think it has to be all about interest rates, it's also about what we are going to do with the quantitative easing," Bullard said. After their last meeting on November 3-4, Fed policy-makers reiterated a pledge to keep rates extraordinarily low for an extended period. Bullard, who will vote on the Fed's policy-setting panel next year, is seen as occupying the middle of the spectrum between anti-inflation hawks and growth-promoting doves.
