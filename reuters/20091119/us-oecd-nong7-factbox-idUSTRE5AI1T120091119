 PARIS  (Reuters) - The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development said on Thursday the tentative recovery had spread across the economies it monitors but warned growth would remain modest for some time as unemployment rose. 

 The following is a synopsis of the OECD's views of European non-G7 economies in its twice-yearly economic outlook: AUSTRIA Stronger exports and public stimulus policies are seen boosting growth to its potential level at 2.2 percent in 2011, but unemployment is still set to increase until the end of next year while inflation remains subdued. Weaker public finances in the wake of the global downturn call for authorities to commit soon to a credible medium-term consolidation strategy to be implemented when the recovery is under way. BELGIUM The economy began a slow recovery during the second half of this year on the back of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus and an acceleration in global trade, but growth will not be enough to ward off a continued rise in unemployment until mid-2011. As the economic recovery gathers strength, urgent measures are needed to secure fiscal sustainability. These should seek to restrain government spending and control costs stemming from an aging population. DENMARK The economy is expected to recovery gradually as world trade picks up, aided by large automatic stabilizers, fiscal easing and low interest rates, with growth seen at 1.3 percent next year and 1.8 percent in 2011. The budget deficit is expected to remain large in 2011, despite the withdrawal of some of extraordinary stimulus measures introduced in the wake of the global downturn. Additional measures to boost public finances should be spelled out sooner rather than later. FINLAND A recovery should get underway by the end of this year as exports revive from the collapse experienced earlier this year, but the recovery will be muted and the unemployment rate will continue to rise, magnified by a rigid labor market. The government has planned further significant fiscal easing, but this may prove counterproductive if it comes just as the recovery gets underway. A coherent plan for fiscal consolidation should be drafted as soon as possible. The upcoming wage negotiations in the labor market should also align the outcome more closely to productivity. GREECE The economy is expected to continue contracting next year with the unemployment rate hitting double digits, but growth could gather momentum in 2011. A credible commitment to restoring fiscal sustainability is essential for boosting market confidence in order to make room for future budgetary flexibility to meet the rising costs of an aging population. Strict control of spending and curbing widespread tax evasion are vital to ensure this, while long-term fiscal viability also requires further pension and health care reforms. ICELAND The economy remains mired in recession following the collapse of its main banks and is expected to continue shrinking until early next year, after which it is seen returning to growth boosted by a normalization of financial conditions and energy-related investments. It is vital that the government's planned fiscal consolidation program is implemented in full while monetary policy should remain aimed at exchange rate stability. The removal of capital controls should be carried out gradually as soon as possible, but this also constitutes the main downside risk were it to result in a sharp fall in the exchange rate. IRELAND There are signs that the pace of the severe contraction of the Irish economy is slowing and the country should benefit from an upswing in world trade and improved competitiveness due to lower wages and prices. But the economic recovery will be sluggish and further substantial measures to boost public finances will be needed for an extended period, both in terms of cuts in public spending and increases in revenues. Deflation is expected to continue through the first half of next year and is the major downside risk to the forecast. LUXEMBOURG The sharp downturn, magnified by the economy's exposure to financial services and trade, appears to have ended while underlying inflationary pressures have eased. The government plans further fiscal stimulus of about 1.5 percent of gross domestic product next year and authorities should map out a credible path for consolidation of public finances over the medium term. NETHERLANDS The Dutch economy is seen returning to growth at 0.7 percent next year, but the recovery will not be strong enough to ward off a further rise next year in the unemployment rate, currently one of the lowest in the OECD, to 5.2 percent. With the budget deficit seen at around 4.5 percent of GDP this year, the government should pursue its plan to restore public finances which is set to begin in 2011. The main downside risk to the forecast is renewed financial market disruption which could spark further increases in pension fund contribution rates, which would reduce disposable income and raise labor costs. NORWAY The recession in Norway was much less severe than in most OECD countries and a rebound in house prices shows recent stimulus has encouraged households to spend. Private investment is expected to grow again next year once the rise in consumption is well established and credit markets normalize. A sizeable tightening of fiscal policy is desirable after 2010 while the tightening of monetary policy that has already begun should continue for some time. Downside risks have diminished but still remain in the area of bank lending to the shipping and commercial property sectors. PORTUGAL The unemployment rate is likely to rise to about 10 percent next year as growth remains relatively subdued due to deleveraging in the private sector, only picking up significantly toward the end of 2011. The budget deficit shot up this year and is seen rising further in 2010 and 2011, meaning a gradual implementation of fiscal consolidation is a major priority. Structural reforms are also key to achieving higher growth going forward. SWEDEN A gradual recovery has begun for the Nordic country but the slack in the economy is very large and the jobless rate will remain high for some time while cost pressures stay low. Monetary policy is very expansionary and should remain so for the time being. Fiscal consolidation measures will be needed to reach the medium-term budget surplus target once the economic recovery firms up. Swedish banks' exposure to economies in Eastern Europe remain a key issue and the process of absorbing potential losses in the region could be lengthy and delay a broader recovery. TURKEY The economy posted a strong rebound in the second quarter of this year after four straight quarters of contraction. It is expected to stage a more moderate recovery during the remainder of the year. Economic growth seen picking up to close to 4 percent in 2010 and more in 2011. Turkish authorities should seek to preserve the recent strengthening of investor confidence by making further progress in the crucial area of improving fiscal transparency.
