 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A gauge of the U.S. economy's prospects rose for a seventh straight month in October to a two-year high, a private research group said on Thursday, indicating the recovery was becoming entrenched. 

 The Conference Board said its index of leading economic indicators climbed 0.3 percent to 103.8, the highest level since September 2007. The coincident economic index was unchanged, while the lagging indicator fell 0.2 percent. "The data indicate that economic recovery is finally setting in. We can expect slow growth through the first half of 2010," said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein said in a statement. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
