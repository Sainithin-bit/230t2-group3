 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N reported a 27 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday, hurt by lower ad sales at The Wall Street Journal and higher stock-based compensation expenses after its share price surged following News Corp.'s NWSa.N bid for the company. 

 Second-quarter profit fell to $21 million, or 25 cents a share, from $28.8 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest results include a charge of 13 cents per share for stock-based compensation expenses after Dow Jones' share price jumped from around $36 to $60 in early May following news that Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. had made a $5 billion bid for the company. Dow Jones also took a 7 cents per share restructuring charge, which includes employee severance costs related to the elimination of about 100 positions, mostly in the consumer media group that includes the Journal. Excluding those charges, Dow Jones earned 45 cents per share, up from 39 cents a year earlier. The results were in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. While the quarterly report has little bearing on Murdoch's offer for Dow Jones, Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino said it "maybe confirms his theory that this is actually a company in transition, away from a dependence on print and more into these growth areas." The results come two days after Dow Jones's board endorsed the $60-per-share buyout offer from News Corp. Approval of the deal now rests with the Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones through its voting shares. Family members plan to meet in Boston on Monday to examine the proposed deal. In a conference call with analysts, Dow Jones Chief Executive Richard Zannino said the Bancrofts are "carefully considering" the offer. He declined to give more details. Some members of the family oppose the bid because they fear Murdoch might use control of the Journal and Dow Jones's other news operations to further his business interests. Dow Jones said second-quarter revenue rose 16.2 percent to $529.7 million, missing the analysts' average forecast of $533.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. "The big gains were in nonprint categories," Atorino said. "Information services, enterprise media -- all that stuff did very well." Meanwhile, the Journal continued to struggle with a slowdown in ad sales that is affecting other U.S. newspapers. Ad revenue fell 6.8 percent at the U.S. print edition of the Journal, but rose at Barron's, Dow Jones's weekly investor newspaper. The Journal's online ad revenue growth slowed to just 2.7 percent, compared with 30 percent in the first quarter and about 21 percent for all of 2006. Lehman Brothers analyst Craig Huber said the results were disappointing. Zannino said the company now derives about 57 percent of its revenue from digital operations. His goal is to get that amount to under 50 percent, he has said. The enterprise media group, which includes Dow Jones Newswires, reported an 81.4 percent rise in revenue because of its acquisition of a 50 percent stake in the Factiva online news archive from Reuters Group Plc RTR.L. Dow Jones shares fell 1.02 percent to $55.08 on the New York Stock Exchange. News Corp. shares rose 15 cents, or less than a percent, to $22.75.
