 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) said on Thursday that second-quarter profit rose 22 percent, beating analyst estimates, as premium revenue increased and operating margins improved, but an important medical-cost gauge worsened from the first quarter. 

 Net income increased to $1.2 billion, or 87 cents per share, from $981 million, or 70 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected 81 cents per share. Revenue rose 6 percent to $18.9 billion, while premium revenue increased 5.2 percent to $17.3 billion. Based on its quarterly results, UnitedHealth lifted the upper end of its full-year earnings projection by 2 cents per share. The company now expects 2007 earnings per share of $3.43 to $3.48, excluding certain charges. UnitedHealth said its consolidated medical care ratio -- which measures medical costs as a percentage of premium dollars -- had improved, reflecting strong performance in its business for seniors. But the medical care ratio for its UnitedHealthcare unit for mid-size and small employers worsened to 81.8 percent from 81.2 percent in the first quarter. The company now expects the unit's ratio for the full year to be 81.5 percent to 82 percent, compared with its prior forecast of 80 percent to 81 percent given in April. Analysts are homing in on UnitedHealth's medical-cost results for its commercial plans for employers after the company disappointed in that respect in the first quarter. The Minneapolis-based company, the No. 1 U.S. health insurer by market value, has largely emerged from a stock-option scandal that plagued it last year. But operational missteps -- including cuts to its Medicare forecasts and worrisome medical cost trends -- have spooked investors. Shares of UnitedHealth have fallen slightly in 2007, underperforming a more than 7 percent rise for the S&P Managed Health Care index, a barometer of large U.S. health plans.
