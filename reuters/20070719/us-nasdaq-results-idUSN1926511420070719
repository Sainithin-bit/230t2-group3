 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ), which runs the largest U.S. electronic stock exchange, said on Thursday that its quarterly profit more than tripled on higher revenues and the strength of new products and customer service initiatives, beating analysts' estimates. 

 Net income for the second quarter was $56.1 million, or 39 cents a share, up from $16.6 million, or 13 cents a share, a year before. Analysts, on average, were expecting Nasdaq to earn 36 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue for the quarter rose 16 percent to $198.7 million, excluding various fees. Revenue from market services increased nearly 19 percent from the year-ago quarter to $128 million from the year-ago quarter as it took trade execution market share from securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, the company said in a statement. Sophisticated trading tools introduced during the quarter also helped drive revenues. Revenue from its listings business, including non-trading services offered to issuing companies, rose 11.5 percent to about $71 million. Nasdaq expects net income for the full year to be in the range of $171 million to $181 million. It expects net revenue for 2007 to be in the range of $775 million to $790 million.
