 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. director Dieter 
von Holtzbrinck is resigning from the board, saying he could 
not support the company's endorsement of a $5 billion takeover 
offer by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 

  Von Holtzbrinck said on Thursday Murdoch's $60 per share 
offer was "very generous in financial terms," but that he was 
concerned that Dow Jones's journalistic values would "strongly 
suffer" after the proposed sale.  "I cannot prove my worries are right," he wrote in a letter 
to the board that Dow Jones filed with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission. "I can only refer to News Corp. practices 
in the past."
