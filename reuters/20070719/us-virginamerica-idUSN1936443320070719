 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Virgin America Airlines, the low-cost carrier with marketing ties to British entrepreneur Richard Branson, will begin ticket sales on Thursday after being given permission earlier this month to operate flights within the United States. 

 The airline said tickets will go on sale from 3 a.m. PDT (1000 GMT). An inaugural flight is scheduled for August 8. Virgin America will initially operate two daily flights between its San Francisco hub and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, and five daily flights between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Operating a fleet of new Airbus A319s and A320s and promising luxury amenities, Virgin America is taking aim at JetBlue Airways and other carriers that promote customer service. Several major U.S. airlines had tried to block the airline from winning approval to operate in the U.S. market. "Our goal is to provide top-notch service at low fares," said Chief Executive Fred Reid. Passengers buying first-class tickets on Virgin America flights, at prices from $149 each way between San Francisco and Los Angeles, will be seated in reclining, massage chairs. Virgin America said it plans to serve as many as 10 cities within its first year of operation, and up to 30 over the next five years. It expects to create 1,000 jobs in its first year of business, adding to a current staffing of 400. Virgin America won regulatory approval of its business plan in May after agreeing to restructure its financing and agreeing to change its executive leadership to satisfy a U.S. law that limits overseas influence in domestic airlines. CEO Reid is to step down within six months of the airline's launch, a concession designed to satisfy regulators. Reid's "longstanding association with foreign investors" had raised concerns about possible overseas influence. U.S. law restricts foreign ownership in airlines to 25 percent of voting stock.
