 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Jones & Co. Inc. DJ.N, which soon could be bought by News Corp. NWSa.N for $5 billion, reported on Thursday that quarterly profit fell because of one-time charges, while revenue rose because of strength in its digital businesses. 

 Second-quarter profit fell to $21 million, or 25 cents a share, from $28.8 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, Dow Jones earned 45 cents per share compared with 39 cents per share last year. Items included a 13-cent charge for stock-based compensation expense as a result of the company's share price increase after the News Corp. offer came out, as well as a 7-cent restructuring charge. Revenue rose 16.2 percent to $529.7 million. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan )
