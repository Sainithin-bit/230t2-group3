 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ), the world's largest food company, held merger talks with U.S. snacks and drinks conglomerate PepsiCo ( PEP.N ) earlier this year, but the project ran aground due to a number of complications, the Wall Street Journal Europe reported on Thursday. 

 There are no talks ongoing now, the newspaper said. A spokesman for Nestle was not immediately available for comment.
