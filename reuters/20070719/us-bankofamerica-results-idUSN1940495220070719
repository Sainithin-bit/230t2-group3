 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp. and other large U.S. banks on Thursday reported higher quarterly profits, as rising fees offset deteriorating credit quality. 

 Profit rose 5 percent at Bank of America, 24 percent at SunTrust Banks Inc., 7 percent at BB&T Corp. and 11 percent at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. Earnings fell 2 percent at Fifth Third Bancorp. Results at all but PNC met or exceeded analysts' forecasts. Banks are relying on higher fees from such areas as credit cards and deposits to offset double-digit increases in loan losses. Asset management and investment banking operations are boosting revenue as U.S. equity indexes set record highs. "Earnings for larger banks have been better than I and Wall Street expected," Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates LLC in Chicago, said. "The fly in the ointment is substantially increased reserves for loan losses. The housing industry's woes are radiating into the economy, and to the financial institutions that support it." He added: "Whether the (reserve) increases are adequate, more than adequate, or inadequate, we won't know for a while." Bank of America shares closed down 9 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $49.27; SunTrust fell $1.26, or 1.4 percent, to $86.53; BB&T fell 48 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $40.13; PNC fell $1.84, or 2.5 percent, to $71.37; and Fifth Third fell 56 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $39.55. The Philadelphia KBW Bank Index fell 0.6 percent. BANK OF AMERICA, SUNTRUST Net income for Charlotte, North Carolina-based Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank, rose to $5.76 billion, or $1.28 per share, from $5.48 billion, or $1.19, in the year-ago period. The 5 percent increase lagged the 20 percent gain posted Wednesday by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Still, excluding items, a profit of $1.30 per share topped the average analyst forecast by 10 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue of $19.56 billion also topped forecasts. Fee income rose 17 percent, helping offset an 80 percent jump in the amount set aside for credit losses. "(We) remain a little concerned about domestic consumption spending given the prolonged housing subprime issues and higher fuel prices," Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis said on a conference call. "(However), we're well positioned going into the second half of 2007, with additional upside in 2008." Atlanta-based SunTrust, the seventh-largest bank, said profit rose to $673.9 million, or $1.89 per share, from $544 million, or $1.49. Excluding a gain from selling some Coca-Cola Co. shares, profit was $1.48 per share, 4 cents above forecasts. Fee income rose 32 percent, and 5 percent excluding the Coke sale, but bad loans doubled and net charge-offs tripled. BB&T, PNC, FIFTH THIRD Profit at Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based BB&T rose to $458 million, or 83 cents per share, from $429 million, or 79 cents. Operating profit was also 83 cents per share, matching forecasts. Fee income rose 12 percent to a record, while bad loans jumped by 52 percent. PNC, based in Pittsburgh, said profit rose to $423 million from $381 million. Earnings per share fell to $1.22 from $1.28. Excluding items, profit was $1.29 per share, 7 cents less than forecast. Fee income rose 6 percent on an adjusted basis, while loan losses increased 23 percent. Cincinnati-based Fifth Third said profit fell to $376 million, or 69 cents per share, from $382 million, or 69 cents. Analysts on average expected 67 cents per share. Fee income rose 8 percent, while bad loans rose 70 percent. Loan losses weighed on two smaller banks' results. Columbus, Ohio-based Huntington Bancshares Inc. said profit fell 28 percent, citing soured loans to Michigan homebuilders. Memphis, Tennessee's First Horizon National Corp. posted a 79 percent profit decline. Citigroup Inc. and Wachovia Corp., the largest and fourth-largest banks, are slated to report results Friday.
