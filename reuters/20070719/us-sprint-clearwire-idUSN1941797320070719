 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sprint Nextel Corp( S.N ) and Clearwire Corp CLWR.O plan to connect their WiMax high-speed wireless services to allow customers to move between their networks thereby boosting demand for the technology and cutting costs. 

 The news sent shares of Clearwire up as much as 43 percent to a record on Thursday as investors believed the deal would help the company attract more customers by expanding its geographical reach without the cost of building a big network. The partnership also reduces costs for Sprint, whose shares briefly rose higher. Stanford Group analyst Michael Nelson said the pact "legitimizes" WiMax, an emerging wireless technology that both Sprint and Clearwire have endorsed. They plan to use WiMax to compete with rival wireless and wired broadband networks. "On the positive side, it should facilitate a faster, more efficient network," Nelson said. But he also noted that this meant Sprint was now too invested in WiMax to give up on it, even if the technology fails to take off with consumers. "With this deal there is no turning back for Sprint," Nelson said. "We think it's one of the reasons Sprint's shares are trading off." The stock, which had recently traded near its 52-week high on merger speculation, closed down 15 cents at $22.01. WiMax offers Internet access speeds five times faster than typical wireless networks, though it is still slower than wired broadband. Sprint and Clearwire said the agreement allowed them to offer services to about 100 million people by the end of 2008. They also said they would exchange wireless spectrum licenses and share broadcast towers, distribution and branding as they both build out their respective networks. LOWER COSTS Sprint has said it would invest up to $2.8 billion on a new high-speed wireless network this year and next year. Chief Executive Gary Forsee did not provide details about the financial impact of the Clearwire agreement, except to say it would save on the initial costs of building the network. "We are reducing our capital and operating expenditures as a result of this agreement," Forsee said on a conference call with analysts on Thursday. The deal also eased some concerns over how Clearwire, founded by wireless pioneer Craig McCaw, would have the money to build out its network to compete with bigger rivals. "We would reasonably expect to see lower capital expenditure budgets over the next couple of years, thus also reducing Clearwire's longer term funding needs," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Christopher King in a client note. Sprint, which had originally planned for its WiMax network to cover potentially 100 million customers, lowered that target to about 70 million potential customers. Previously Clearwire had targeted coverage for about 45 million customers. Sprint said it aims to eventually make its network available to about 185 million people, while Clearwire will focus on areas covering about 115 million people. The partners said they do not expect any material exchange of cash between them. Sprint said it expects to begin the initial stage of its construction by the end of 2007 and both companies expect to launch commercial service in the first half of 2008. Clearwire shares rose to a record high of $35.41 on the Nasdaq before closing up 34.38 percent at $33.30.
