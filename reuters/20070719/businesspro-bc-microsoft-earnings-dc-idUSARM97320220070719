 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) said on 
Thursday it eked out a gain in net profit despite taking a $1 
billion charge to pay for repairs to its Xbox 360 game 
consoles. 

  Microsoft said net profit totaled $3.04 billion, or 31 
cents per diluted share, in the company's fiscal fourth 
quarter, versus a profit of $2.83 billion, or 28 cents per 
diluted share. Revenues rose 13 percent to $13.4 billion.  The company had warned earlier this month that it would 
incur a charge of up to $1.15 billion in the quarter ended in 
June to fix an "unacceptable" number of Xbox 360 repairs and 
offer a new extended warranty to customers.  Shares of Microsoft have risen 6 percent in the year to 
date, compared to a 10 percent gain in the S&P 500 during the 
period.
