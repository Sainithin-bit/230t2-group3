 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp ( BK.N ), created this month from the merger of Bank of New York Co. and Mellon Financial Corp., on Thursday said rising fees from holding securities and processing trades helped boost operating profit at the former Bank of New York and Mellon. 

 Income from continuing operations for the former Bank of New York rose 15 percent to $448 million, or 59 cents per share, from $391 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier. Net income fell 1 percent to $445 million, or 58 cents per share, from $448 million, or 59 cents. At the former Mellon, income from continuing operations rose 26 percent to $281 million, or 67 cents per share, from $223 million, or 54 cents, a year earlier. Net income rose 19 percent to $275 million, or 66 cents, from $232 million, or 56 cents. Excluding items, profit per share from continuing operations was 63 cents at the former Bank of New York and 69 cents at Mellon, the combined company said. Analysts on average forecast profit of 61 cents per share for the former Bank of New York, according to Reuters Estimates. Fees from securities servicing rose 19 percent to $1.09 billion at the former Bank of New York, and 11 percent to $333 million at the former Mellon. Bank of New York's $18.3 billion merger with Pittsburgh-based Mellon created the world's largest provider of custody services for institutional investors, and a top-10 asset manager. Bank of New York shareholders got 63 percent of the combined company, and the bank got 10 of 18 board seats. Bank of New York Mellon shares closed Wednesday at $46.13 on the New York Stock Exchange.
