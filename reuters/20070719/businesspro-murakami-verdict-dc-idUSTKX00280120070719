 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese financier and shareholder 
activist Yoshiaki Murakami was jailed for two years on Thursday 
after being found guilty of insider trading. 

  Prosecutors said the former bureaucrat traded shares with 
advance knowledge of a February 2005 takeover bid by Internet 
firm Livedoor for radio operator Nippon Broadcasting System  (NBS).  Murakami, 47, who had pleaded not guilty, bought 10 billion 
yen ($82 million) worth of additional NBS shares prior to the 
failed bid, which drove up the share price, yielding him a 
hefty profit.  He was known for buying stakes in companies and pressuring 
them to cede more power to shareholders, raise dividends or use 
reserves for productive investments.  Murakami and Livedoor's flamboyant founder, Takafumi Horie, 
gained fame as symbols of a buccaneering style of capitalism 
that some welcomed but others criticized as un-Japanese.
