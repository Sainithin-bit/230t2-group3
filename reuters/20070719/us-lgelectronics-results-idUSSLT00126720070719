 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea's LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) swung to its highest quarterly net profit in three years, thanks to its LCD venture and mobile phone sales, but the outlook remains marred by its troubled plasma display business. 

 LG, the world's No. 5 handset maker, is likely to enjoy an extended recovery at its liquid crystal display joint venture, LG.Philips LCD Co. Ltd. ( 034220.KS ). But analysts warned the margins in mobile phones could fall on growing low-cost phone sales and a recovery from its loss-making plasma display panel (PDP) business would be difficult. "( LG ) has yet to present a clear answer how it will secure profitability from PDPs," said John Park, an analyst at Daishin Securities. "In the handset business, earnings numbers may be smaller in the third and fourth quarters, but it looks okay as long as the company maintains profit margin in this sector of more than 7 percent." LG, which competes with local rival Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) in handsets, TVs and appliances, posted on Thursday a net profit of 384.6 billion won ($420.1 million) in the second quarter ended June, well above 215 billion won forecast from analysts polled by Reuters. It was the highest quarterly profit since posting a 493 billion won profit in the second quarter of 2004. LG posted a loss of 9.7 billion a year earlier and a 122.6 billion shortfall in the previous quarter. Revenue came at 5.9 trillion won, compared with 5.8 trillion a year earlier. Shares in LG, which has a market value of nearly $12 billion, rose 1.65 percent to end at 73,800 won, leading the wider market's  .KS11  0.37 percent gain. The stock rose as much as 2.6 percent on anticipation of strong results. PLASMA WOES DEEPEN Prospects remain dim for LG's plasma displays, whose sales fell 16 percent from the first quarter. "There's no chance that the PDP will recover in the second half," said Lim Chang-gue, fund manager at Samsung Investment Trust Management. "A sale would be the best solution, or if not that, a shutdown of its production lines." LG, the world's second-biggest maker of plasma panels, is suffering from a glut of flat screens and increasing popularity of rival LCD screens in the large-TV market. LG.Philips reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit last week. The operating loss margin at the display division, which includes the plasma business, deepened to 24.2 percent on a parent basis, from a 16 percent loss margin in the first quarter. Chief Financial Officer James Jeong told an investor meeting the plasma panel business might break even on an operating level by the end of third quarter. LG sold 19.1 million phones in the second quarter, up from 15.8 million in the first. Its parent-basis mobile phone profit margin rose to 11.3 percent from 6.6 percent in January-March. The company, which trails Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), Motorola Inc. MOT.N, Samsung and Sony Ericsson ( 6758.T ) ( ERICb.ST ) in the handset market, was helped by its high-end phones, including the hit "Chocolate" slider model and metal-encased "Shine". But Jeong expected its handset margin to fall to a high single-digit percent in the third quarter, despite an expected shipment growth, due to higher marketing costs for new models and a push into emerging markets. LG won in February a global contest to supply millions of low-cost phones for third-generation mobile services. For the full year 2007, LG is expected to post a profit of 640 billion won, according to Reuters Estimates, better than a revised 213 billion posted in 2006. LG shares climbed 19 percent in the second quarter, in line with the KOSPI's 20 percent gain.
