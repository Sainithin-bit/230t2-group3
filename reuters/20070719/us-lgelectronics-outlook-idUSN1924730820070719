 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Revenues at the U.S. unit of LG Electronics Inc. ( 066570.KS ) rose 39 percent in the first half, and North American sales are expected to top $10 billion this year, fueled by demand for mobile phones, flat-screen displays and appliances, it said on Thursday. 

 LG Electronics USA Inc., the Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey-based subsidiary of the South Korean consumer electronics group, said growth was helped by stronger marketing of its brand. Earlier in the day, parent LG Electronics said it swung to its highest quarterly net profit in three years, thanks to its LCD venture and mobile phone sales.
