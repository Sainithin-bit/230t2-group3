 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - EBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ) on Wednesday posted a 50 percent rise in net profit on strength in its auction and PayPal units but left its 2007 outlook little changed, even though investors had hoped for more. 

 Revenue as well as margins for eBay's auctions and fixed price shopping grew, with revenue rising 26 percent and breaking out of the 22 percent to 24 percent range of the prior four quarters. But new sales listings fell 6 percent. President and Chief Executive Meg Whitman told investors on a conference call that improvements to its auctions should lead to better results in future quarters. "I am very optimistic about the remainder of this year and into 2008," she said. Net income rose to $376 million, or 27 cents per diluted share, from the year-earlier quarter's $250 million, or 17 cents a diluted share. Profit excluding one-time items was 34 cents per share, 2 cents ahead of the average Wall Street target, while total revenue rose 30 percent to $1.83 billion, the top end of the range of Wall Street predictions. U.S. revenue rose 24 percent, while international revenues grew 37 percent. The South Korean eBay unit had its best quarter in years. Whitman said eBay must revive listings and growth in the volume of merchandise sold in its two top markets -- the United States and Germany: "Neither is where we think they can be." Active eBay users globally rose 7 percent to 83.3 million. The company is seeking to rebound from confusion created by mixing auctions and set-price shopping formats and has taken steps to make it easier for consumers to find and buy goods in its auctions, reduce fraud and attract new buyers to eBay. "I think it was a pretty big shock to the system that's only now coming back into balance," Whitman told analysts. EBay said it expected revenue of $7.30 billion to $7.45 billion, within the range of existing analyst predictions, but shy of the top end of analysts' forecasts, which were as high as $7.49 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Nonetheless, the new outlook marks an increase to the low end of the range of $7.2 billion to $7.45 billion which eBay gave in April. EBay said it expected 2007 net profit of between $1.08 and $1.12 per share, in the middle of Wall Street forecasts. "I am very neutral on the stock and I don't see anything in the release that would change that," said Global Crown Capital analyst Martin Pyykkonen, who noted the fall in listings. GROWTH FROM NEW MARKETS Second-quarter net revenue for PayPal grew 34 percent to $454 million, fueled by overseas expansion and a 57 percent rise in payment volume from non-eBay online businesses. Among U.S. and British online shoppers, one in three use eBay's electronic payment system, and Whitman said PayPal still was seeing little impact from newer rival Google Checkout. Revenue from running advertising on its sites, while tiny relative to transaction fees, grew 77 percent from a year ago. It increased to 4.2 percent of revenue in its marketplaces division during the second quarter, up from 3.1 percent of revenue in the first quarter of the year. The rise mostly derived from the start of Google-run advertising in Europe. Skype was profitable for the second quarter running. Registered users rose to 220 million at the end of June from 196 million at the end of March. Skype's net revenue rose to $90 million, double the year-earlier quarter's $44 million. But Whitman said eBay, which acquired Skype in a deal worth up to $4.1 billion in 2005, has more work ahead: "Skype has delivered in many of these areas, but it is not where we want it to be in terms of user activity," she said. EBay shares closed at $34.05, down 20 cents in regular Nasdaq trade. Following the report, the stock initially rose more than $1 before reversing course and falling 1.6 percent to $33.49 in extended trade. The stock is valued at 24 times Wall Street's average 2007 forecast compared with Google Inc.'s ( GOOG.O ) price-to-earnings multiple of 36 times 2007 forecasts and Amazon.com's ( AMZN.O ) multiple of 72 times.
