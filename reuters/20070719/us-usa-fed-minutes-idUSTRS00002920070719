 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials believed downside risks to U.S. economic growth had diminished between their May and June meetings, suggesting little likelihood that the current housing market downturn would spark a near-term cut in benchmark U.S. interest rates. 

 Minutes of the June 27-28 Federal Open Market Committee released on Thursday showed that members saw housing as a drag on the economy for some time, but voiced concern over a lack of "convincing evidence" that a recent moderation in core inflation data could be sustained. "In their discussion of monetary policy for the inter-meeting period, members generally regarded the risks to economic growth as more balanced than at the time of the May meeting," the Fed officials said. "Although the housing market remained a key source of uncertainty about the outlook, members thought it most likely that the overall economy would expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters," the Fed said in the minutes. "Members generally anticipated core inflation would remain relatively subdued but concurred a sustained moderation in inflation had not yet been convincingly demonstrated." The participants agreed their predominant concern was still the risk that inflation would fail to moderate as expected. MUTED MARKET REACTION Release of the minutes did little to move financial markets as the second day of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke's semi-annual testimony before Congress stole the limelight. Treasuries were little changed after the report and the dollar remained fractionally weaker against the euro. Stocks indexes  .DJI   .IXIC   .SPX  rose on the back of strong corporate earnings. "We are not going to get a rate cut if downside risks to the economy don't grow," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ in New York. "The bottom line is no rate cuts are being contemplated. So I would regard it as slightly negative. They are saying the improvement in inflation could just be temporary for all they know." The FOMC members viewed incoming data on core consumer prices, stripping out volatile food and energy costs, as favorable, but said such data were 'noisy' and may have been depressed by transitory factors. They said a number of forces could sustain inflation pressures, including high levels of resource utilization, elevated energy and commodity prices, a decline in the dollar's value and slower productivity growth. Labor market conditions remained "rather tight," particularly for skilled workers. In May, the FOMC members had said that downside risks had "diminished slightly" while voicing concerns that a failure of moderation in price growth could lead to an upward drift in inflationary expectations. On both May 9 and June 28, the FOMC voted unanimously to maintain its key federal funds rate at 5.25 percent. "Spillovers from the strains in the housing market to consumption spending had apparently been quite limited to date," the Fed said in the June meeting minutes. However, the members noted that data on productivity, which had recently showed a slowing in growth, could be revised upward, resulting in a possible easing of some pressure on prices. They said that a level of unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation also could be lower than previously thought, a possibility that would help to explain the absence of "out-sized" wage pressures in recent months.
