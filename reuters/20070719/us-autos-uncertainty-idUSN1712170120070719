 DETROIT/CHICAGO  (Reuters) - As Wall Street ponders the future of Detroit, analysts see sharply diverging scenarios emerging from an uncertain summer and crucial contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers union. 

 The more bullish see General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and soon-to-be-privately owned Chrysler Group clinching a transformational labor deal that would put their costs on a footing with more nimble Japanese rivals led by Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ). Others see a risk that the UAW will hold out for only modest concessions on behalf of the 180,000 factory workers it represents, leaving the Detroit-based automakers drifting toward a more wrenching financial reckoning. With talks between the UAW and Ford and GM set to start next week, that deepening uncertainty is playing out in a split between fundamental analysts and indications of heightened risk in the options market. "Some hope for landmark concessions that will rejuvenate the industry for decades ahead, while others hold out little hope," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group. "As such, options traders are pricing in a greater degree of uncertainty going forward." JP Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel raised his ratings on GM and Ford this month to "overweight," saying a UAW contract to replace a four-year deal expiring in September would boost earnings. Patel said cost savings from a new contract could add $1.86 per share in earnings for GM and 38 cents per share for Ford in a best-case scenario. "Signs are strengthening that the UAW will engage in radical changes," he said. By contrast, Bear Stearns analyst Peter Nesvold downgraded GM to "peer perform," saying investors would be prudent to take profits after the stock's run-up since May. After bottoming out in early May, GM shares have gained 23 percent, outperforming the broad market by a wide margin. Ford shares have trended higher since mid-March, rising 15 percent. JP Morgan's Patel attributed much of that rally to an emerging view that both Ford and GM would be able to get the UAW to agree to a trust fund for retiree health care that would remove one of their major operational uncertainties. But he said the market had only partly priced in the benefit from that potential shift of some $8 billion in liabilities from the balance sheets of the two automakers. "While the easy money has been made, we still see a compelling risk-reward case in both names on a 12-month view," he said. MARKET SKEPTICISM PERSISTS Others are more skeptical that the gains can be sustained in light of the pressures facing both loss-making automakers. "If you look at the sector, you're generally rewarded at this point for taking profits and declaring partial victory," said David Sowerby, portfolio manager at Loomis & Sayles, who does not own shares in either company. U.S. automakers pay their unionized workers about $75 an hour in wages and benefits, compared with $45 an hour for workers at plants owned by Japanese automakers, according to internal data from Detroit's automakers. That gap stems largely from the cost of providing health care benefits, including benefits for retirees, which annually runs to $4.8 billion at GM and $3.1 billion at Ford. As analysts handicap the odds of those costs being reduced, the options market has priced in more risk. Some analysts said that also reflected the approach of second-quarter earnings. But Wilkinson of Interactive Brokers noted that implied volatility of 41 percent for GM options earlier this week was the highest reading "since February when shares tumbled when the Tracinda Group threw in their cards and left the poker table." Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's investment arm, Tracinda Corp, sold its stake in GM last year following the automaker's rejection of his proposed tie-up with Nissan-Renault. Implied volatility can be read as a percentage measure of how much a stock is expected to move in a rolling 12-month period. Brian Overby, an options analyst with TradeKing, said the large number of outstanding put options in GM and Ford with expiry in January 2008 and 2009 shows that "the options market is worried about the long-term aspects" of both. Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange has rolled out new credit option contracts that would pay out if either GM or Ford default on bond payments before September 2012. Neither contract has traded yet, but indicative prices point to a roughly 32 percent default risk for GM and roughly a 40 percent risk for Ford over that period.
