 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday said losses associated with subprime mortgages could reach $100 billion. 

 "The credit losses associated with subprime have come to light and they are fairly significant. Some estimates are in the order of between $50 and $100 billion of losses associated with subprime credit products," Bernanke told a Senate Banking Committee hearing. "The credit rating agencies have begun to make sure they account for those losses and they have downgraded some of these products," he said.
