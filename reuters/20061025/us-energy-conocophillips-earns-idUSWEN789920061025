 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ), the No. 3 U.S. oil company, on Wednesday said third-quarter earnings rose slightly from a year before as improvements in chemicals, pipeline, and refining and marketing operations offset production problems and charges from tax law changes. 

 But the quarterly profit was much lower than the windfall earnings the company posted in the second quarter, and the retreat of oil prices from sky-high levels has led many investors and analysts to speculate that the days of record oil company profits are nearing their end. "I think we've seen peak earnings for all these companies," said Oppenheimer analyst Fadel Gheit. "What goes up in this business comes down ... Basically, all they are praying for is a soft landing," he said. Net income in the quarter rose to $3.88 billion from $3.80 billion last year. On a per share basis, earnings fell to $2.31 a share from $2.68 a share in the year-earlier quarter. The company's third-quarter earnings include results from ConocoPhillips' acquisition of Burlington Resources earlier this year. The deal increased the company's share count to 1.68 billion shares from 1.42 billion shares a year before. ConocoPhillips said its third-quarter earnings were hurt by 37 cents per share in items including charges from new taxes in the United Kingdom and Alaska, an impairment charge on assets up for sale, and a benefit from business interruption insurance. Excluding these items, the company earned about $2.68 a share, well above the average forecast of analysts polled by Reuters Estimates of $2.37 a share. Revenue in the quarter dipped to $48.4 billion from $48.7 billion a year earlier. PRODUCTION DOWN FROM Q2 Daily production from the exploration and production segment rose to 2.04 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in the quarter from 1.52 million BOE in the year-ago period, excluding ConocoPhillips' stake in Russia's Lukoil ( LKOH.MM ). But that result marked a decline from production of 2.13 BOE per day in the second quarter. ConocoPhillips said the dip in third-quarter production was mostly on problems at Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, which was shut down by operator BP Plc ( BP.L ) in August because of a leaking pipeline and planned maintenance in the United Kingdom and Venezuela. ConocoPhillips owns more than 36 percent of the Prudhoe Bay field. The company said it expects production to increase from third-quarter levels in the fourth quarter due to the resumption of operations in Prudhoe Bay and less downtime, partially offset by shifts in its production-sharing contracts in the Timor Sea. The company said it expects a fourth-quarter crude oil refining capacity utilization rate similar to the 95 percent average worldwide utilization rate it logged in the third quarter. Speaking on the company's conference call, Chief Executive Jim Mulva said he expects 2007 capital spending to be around $15 billion or $16 billion, but said it was "very likely" that the company would not complete all of its proposed refining projects, including one in Saudi Arabia, as it looks to restrain spending. "We are very pleased about the opportunity in Saudi Arabia but have quite a number of these (projects)," he said. "We frankly are going to have to step back and assess capital costs, whether we think it makes sense for us to commit capital to do all these projects." U.S. oil prices hit a record high of $78.40 a barrel in early June and spent much of the third quarter hovering above $70 before retreating to around $60 as the summer driving season ended and geopolitical tensions eased. The company said its average realized crude oil price for the quarter was $65.05, up from $56.64 a year before. Rival BP announced a 58 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by asset sales. Hess Corp. ( HES.N ) also posted a higher profit, helped by higher oil prices. Shares of ConocoPhillips rose $1.32, or 2.15 percent, to $62.72 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up about 8 percent since the beginning of the year, well underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX which is up about 20 percent in the same period.
