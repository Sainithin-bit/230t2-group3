 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) on Wednesday posted third-quarter profit well above Wall Street expectations but issued a disappointing forecast for 2007, sending the planemaker's shares down 3 percent. 

 The Chicago-based company, which is also the No. 2 U.S. defense contractor, is racking up record sales of its commercial jets as rival Airbus flounders, but some investors are concerned that costs are rising on its new 787 Dreamliner. "Overall, we view this quarter as a slight negative," JP Morgan analyst Joseph Nadol said in a research note. "The results were better than expected, but on the strength of lower-than-expected corporate costs. And rising 787 costs meant that 2007 guidance was raised by less than expected." Boeing shares, up about 30 percent over the past 12 months, were down $2.54 at $81.05 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. They hit an all-time high of $89.58 in May. Boeing's commercial airplanes unit, which is outselling Airbus ( EAD.PA ) three-to-one so far this year, posted sharply higher revenue, but analysts pointed to higher research and development forecasts, chiefly for spending on the new mid-sized 787 Dreamliner and 747-8 jumbo. Boeing said its revolutionary 787, made mostly of carbon composite and titanium to cut weight and save on fuel costs, was still on target for flight testing next year and entry into service in the summer of 2008. But the cost of the program, which is being closely watched by investors and competitors, has crept up over the past year as the company looks to avoid production delays that have dogged its European rival. "I would describe what we're doing as pretty aggressive contingency planning," Boeing Chief Executive James McNerney said in a conference call, on the subject of higher spending. "We're at that point in the (787) development program where weight remains a dogged issue. We know what we have to do. Suppliers occasionally need help." McNerney said Boeing had moved some 787 production work to  its own Seattle-area facilities but would not say where from. He did not say which suppliers needed help. "This plane will be done on time and within contractual commitments," he added. BEATS STREET Overall, Boeing reported third-quarter profit of $694 million, or 89 cents a share, down from $1 billion, or $1.26 a share, in the year-earlier quarter, which was boosted by some one-time tax and asset-sale gains. That easily beat Wall Street's lowered average earnings forecast of 63 cents per share as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Profit was helped by sharply lower general and administrative costs. Its commercial plane unit reported sales up 45 percent to $6.7 billion, and its defense unit reported sales rose 4 percent to $7.8 billion, helped by growth in its military plane programs. Boeing Capital -- which organizes financing for customers -- posted sales up 32 percent to $304 million. Total revenue rose 19 percent to $14.7 billion, boosted by higher plane deliveries, but missed analysts' average forecast of $14.99 billion. On the back of booming plane sales, Boeing raised its 2007 earnings forecast to a range of $4.45 to $4.65 per share, up from a previous forecast of $4.25 to $4.45. But that fell short of analysts' average forecast of $4.69. Third-quarter profit was reduced by 22 cents a share by a charge for closing Connexion, its money-losing in-flight high-speed broadband communications service. As a result of the charge, Boeing nudged down the top end of its full-year 2006 earnings forecast by 5 cents a share. The new range is $2.40 to $2.50 per share. Wall Street expects, on average, $2.35. STRONG BACKLOG Boeing said the backlog of work on its order books rose 12 percent from a year ago to a record $229 billion, boosted by strong commercial plane sales. "They now have five years' worth of production for commercial airplanes (backlog)," said Paul Nisbet at aerospace specialists JSA Research. "If it stays that way, no one will complain." Boeing has taken firm orders for 753 commercial planes so far this year, on track to rival last year's record of 1,002. The company raised its R&D spending forecast for the second successive quarter to tackle 787 problems and fund more work on its new 747-8 jumbo. It now expects to spend $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion on R&D across the company this year, and between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in 2007.
