 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Cigarette maker Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) on Wednesday said it will announce the timetable for its planned spinoff of Kraft Foods Inc. at the end of January, sending its stock higher despite a quarterly earnings report that missed Wall Street expectations. 

 Investors have been anxiously awaiting Altria's announcement about the 88.6 percent of Kraft shares it holds since management first disclosed the plan two years ago. "Today's announcement brings us a step closer to a fully independent Kraft," Louis Camilleri, Altria chairman and chief executive, said in a news release. Altria, parent of the Philip Morris tobacco companies, said profit in the third quarter was roughly flat at $2.88 billion, or $1.36 a share, held back by weakness in Spain and Japan. That compared to $2.88 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.39 a share. On that basis, analysts forecast $1.41 a share on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Despite the lackluster earnings report, Altria shares were up $1.51 at $81.33 on Wednesday morning on the New York Stock Exchange. But while the stock rallied after the Kraft news, some analysts said investors may be disappointed Altria did not provide details for the spin-off on Wednesday. "It's like the carrot and the horse. You keep moving the carrot forward and eventually the horse loses interest," said Morningstar analyst Gregg Warren. Kraft shares fell 78 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $34.59. Analysts and investors note that when Kraft is spun off, many funds that invest in Altria will need to sell the Kraft shares they receive. ALTRIA REVENUE UP, SHIPMENTS DOWN Altria's third-quarter operating revenue rose 3.7 percent to $25.8 billion. Philip Morris International's operating profit fell 3.8 percent to $2.1 billion and the unit shipped 215.9 billion cigarettes, down 0.5 percent. Shipments fell 12.4 percent in Spain, where the entire cigarette market has been hurt by a ban on smoking in most public places. In Japan, shipments fell 10.4 percent as retailers sold off extra inventory bought ahead of a July 1 industry-wide price increase that resulted from a tax increase. Operating profit at the company's Philip Morris USA unit rose 5.7 percent to $1.3 billion. The unit shipped 47.6 billion cigarettes, a decrease of 0.6 percent. Altria also said it now expects full-year earnings to be $5.48 to $5.53 a share, up from its previous forecast of $5.40 to $5.50, due in part to its part of a gain Kraft will post from the sale of its Minute rice brand. Altria shares are up about 10 percent this year, compared with a 13-percent increase for the Dow Jones industrial average   .DJI . The stock had rallied to an all-time high of $85 earlier this year. But the shares have retreated since a federal judge in New York ruled last month that U.S. smokers who bought "light" cigarettes could sue the tobacco industry as one large class on allegations cigarette makers fooled consumers into thinking "light" cigarettes were safer than regular smokes.
