 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Johnson Controls Inc. ( JCI.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly earnings rose 27.2 percent, driven by strength in building temperature controls and batteries, while its auto interiors business remained under pressure. 

 Net income rose to $360 million, or $1.82 per share, in its fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30, from $283 million, or $1.45 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 18.1 percent to $8.15 billion. Earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.86, while analysts on average expected Johnson Controls to earn $1.85 per share, with revenue of $8.16 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Johnson Controls earlier in October said it expected a slow start to fiscal 2007 because of production cuts by North American automakers, but forecast earnings per share growth of 14 percent for the year. The Milwaukee company acquired York International to boost its building heating and cooling systems, and the battery business of bankrupt auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK to add to a large position in auto batteries. Sales in its building efficiency business more than doubled to $3.1 billion in the quarter, supported by the York acquisition, while battery sales rose 14 percent to $981 million. Auto interiors sales fell 11 percent to $4 billion. Auto interiors sales fell 19 percent in North America due to lower vehicle production and a focus on light trucks, the company said. European interiors sales fell 3 percent. Operating income rose 118 percent to $253 million in building controls, rose 23 percent to $140 million in batteries and fell 46 percent to $112 million in auto interiors in the fourth quarter, Johnson Controls said. Johnson Controls plans to cut about 5,000 jobs and 16 plants by about the middle of 2007 in a restructuring focused mainly on auto interiors and building controls systems. Several U.S. auto parts suppliers have warned that production cuts by General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG's DCX.N DCXGn.DE Chrysler Group would hurt results in the last few months of 2006. Unlike most U.S. auto parts makers, Johnson Controls has had substantial non-automotive growth. Building controls accounted for nearly one-third of fiscal 2006 revenue and it expects that percentage to increase in fiscal 2007. Johnson Controls expects auto interiors revenue to decline by up to 5 percent in fiscal 2007, with 25 percent growth in building temperature controls systems and 5 percent growth in battery business sales more than offsetting that pressure. The company earlier in October said it expects fiscal first-quarter earnings per share of 80 cents to 85 cents, while analysts expect 84 cents. Johnson Controls also has forecast earnings per share of about $6 for fiscal 2007, with revenue of about $34 billion. Analysts expect $6.03 per share and revenue of $34.31 billion. Results were released after the close on the New York Stock Exchange. Johnson Controls rose to $82.74 in trading after the market closed, up from its $82.47 close on the NYSE. The shares have risen about 13 percent so far in 2006, while the Dow Jones U.S. automobiles and parts index .DJUSAP is up nearly 17 percent.
