 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. ( BUD.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly profit rose on higher prices and easing energy costs, narrowly beating Wall Street's view and sending shares up 2 percent. 

 The largest U.S. brewer, whose flagship brands include Budweiser and Bud Light, said third-quarter net income rose 26 percent to $638 million, or 82 cents per share, from $505 million, or 65 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting profit of 81 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales for the quarter rose 4.7 percent to $4.28 billion and total beer volume rose 2.9 percent, driven by a 2.8 percent rise in revenue per barrel, as Anheuser raised prices in some markets during the summer. The company said it plans to raise prices again on most of its volume early next year, with a few selective increases in the fourth quarter. Last year, the company took price cuts amid sluggish growth in the U.S. beer market, forcing competitors like Miller Brewing Co., a unit of SABMiller Plc ( SAB.L ), to follow suit. DOMESTIC GOING FLAT Anheuser-Busch, whose Bud Light is the top-selling brand in the United States, controls about half the U.S. beer market. But Bud Light's dominance is being challenged by imported light beers, such as Heineken Premium Light. Volume of beer shipments to domestic wholesalers rose 1.1 percent during the quarter, but sales from wholesalers to retailers fell 0.4 percent. "Sales to retailers were below our expectations due to a slowdown in September," Anheuser's Chief Financial Officer W. Randolph Baker said on a conference call. He blamed unfavorable weather, especially during the Labor Day holiday, and said he did not think it was a long-term trend. Bear Stearns analyst Carlos Laboy said the lag implied there was now a "considerable" build-up of inventory. In a research note he said the next two quarters "could be messy" as Anheuser faces tough comparisons and two more inventory days. J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher said he thought the market had already anticipated such problems, which explained why the stock rose 97 cents to close at $47.86 on the New York Stock Exchange, reversing much of a 4 percent drop over the last week. INTERNATIONAL BUBBLING Volume in the company's international unit rose 5.9 percent, helped by strength in Canada, China and Mexico. That segment's sales also includes domestic sales of some foreign beers. Earlier this year the company bought Rolling Rock beer from Belgium's InBev INTB.BR. That followed its moves to exclusively import and distribute Dutch brewer Grolsch NV's GROLc.AS beers in the U.S. and exclusively import Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd.'s Tiger beer. Anheuser also has a 50 percent stake in Mexico's Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), which brews Corona, and a 27 percent stake in China's Tsingtao Brewery Co. Ltd. ( 600600.SS ). These moves are ways for the U.S. brewer to capitalize on the growing popularity of imported and craft beers, which, along with wine and spirits, have been grabbing market share from domestic beers. In response to a question about the growing threat of imported beers, CFO Baker acknowledged that the success of Heineken NV'S ( HEIN.AS ) light beer and other imports were hurting sales, but said those volumes remained small. Looking ahead, the St. Louis, Missouri-based company said it will focus on marketing its flagship American beers. NEW PRODUCTS Anheuser-Busch also said it was still studying a hard liquor product in test markets called Jekyll and Hyde. "We continue to see whether there are opportunities for products that fit into our portfolio that would be profitable for our wholesalers as well as Anheuser-Busch," Baker said. This autumn the company is rolling out bottles of a seasonal craft brew called Jack's Pumpkin Spice Ale, which was previously only available by draught. Anheuser-Busch shares have gained 9.3 percent this year and trade at 18.5 times earnings estimates for the current year, outperforming a 2.5 percent gain for rival Molson Coors Brewing Co., ( TAP.N ) which has a price-to-earnings multiple of 17.4.
