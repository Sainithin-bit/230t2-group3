 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) on Tuesday posted quarterly profit and revenue ahead of Wall Street estimates and said growth in its technology spending would slow this quarter, lifting its shares by 14 percent. 

 The Web retailer has unnerved investors with narrowing profit margins in recent quarters as it spent heavily on technology and content to improve its site, which offers everything from books and computers to diamonds and lawnmowers, and stay ahead of competitors. But Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said operating profit margins would improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, thanks to a combination of revenue growth and a slower increase in technology investment. "The company is guiding to a pretty significant improvement in the operating margin declines that they've experienced over the past couple of quarters," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt. "Amazon shares typically follow operating margins." Other analysts were more skeptical about the long term. Pacific Crest analyst Steve Weinstein said improved operating profit margins were to be expected over the holidays, with the surge of gift-giving. He was concerned by accelerated marketing spending. "While the growth rates for the company are impressive, they seem to have to keep working harder and harder to get that growth," Weinstein said. "It's just not clear to me that margins get better into next year." Amazon said third-quarter net income fell to $19 million, or 5 cents per share, from $30 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose 24 percent to $2.31 billion from $1.86 billion, helped by a sharp rise in sales of electronics. Wall Street on average had targeted earnings of 3 cents per share on sales of $2.25 billion, based on Reuters Estimates. Amazon, the second-most-popular e-commerce site behind eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ), has been seen as focusing on revenue growth at the expense of profits. In the process, it has alienated many investors who wonder when its heavy investment will pay off. Third-quarter technology and content spending rose 42 percent to $172 million, a sharp deceleration from a 74 percent rise in the year-ago quarter and a 58 percent rise in the second quarter. Operating profits fell to 1.7 percent of revenue, compared with 3.0 percent a year ago and 2.2 percent the prior quarter. North American sales rose 21 percent to $1.26 billion, while international sales rose 29 percent to $1.05 billion. Worldwide electronics sales rose 43 percent to $699 million, accounting for 30 percent of worldwide net sales, up from 26 percent in the year-ago quarter. Amazon now expects fourth-quarter sales of $3.63 billion to $3.95 billion, while Wall Street on average expected $3.69 billion. Amazon also projected operating earnings of $145 million to $235 million for the fourth quarter, versus the Wall Street target of $178 million. For full year 2006, the company said operating earnings should range between $339 million to $429 million. In July, Amazon had expected a range of $310 million and $440 million. The full-year revenue target was raised to a range of $10.35 billion to $10.68 billion from $10.15 billion to $10.65 billion in July. The stock, which had been down 31 percent in 2006, is valued at 49 times estimated 2007 earnings, or three times that of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) at 16, and an average multiple of 15 in the Standard & Poor's Retailing Index .GSPMS. Expectations that Amazon will sharply boost its low margins mean it also trades at a premium to rival Internet stocks such as Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ), eBay and Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ). Amazon shares rose to $38.44 in after-hours trade from a close of $33.63 on Nasdaq.
