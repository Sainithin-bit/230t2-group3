 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp. ( RSH.N ) posted a quarterly loss on Wednesday, hit by higher costs and lower wireless sales as the consumer electronics retailer struggles to turn around its business. 

 RadioShack reported a net loss of $16 million, or 12 cents per share, for the third quarter ended September 30, 2006. That compares with net income of $108.5 million or 75 cents per share in the year-ago period. The company said last year's third-quarter net income was boosted by a non-cash gain of $56.5 million or $0.39 per share due to the reversal of a tax contingency reserve. Total sales in the third quarter fell 11 percent to $1.06 billion. The company said comparable store sales dropped 9.6 percent during the quarter. The company said the earnings reflected a non-cash write-down of $29 million of assets associated with RadioShack's wireless kiosk operations, $18 million in turnaround plan costs, and lower wireless sales. RadioShack is trying to stabilize a business hurt by slumping mobile phone and product sales, and intense competition. It is shutting hundreds of stores and offering more popular, quick-selling merchandise, such as MP3 digital music players and flat-panel televisions. It also installed turnaround veteran Julian Day as chief executive in July and said it will no longer host conference calls when it issues quarterly earnings updates.
