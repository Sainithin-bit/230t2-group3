 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - FPL Group Inc. FPL.N and Constellation Energy CEG.N on Wednesday scrapped a $12.5 billion merger deal over uncertainty of regulatory and judicial approvals, the second potential tie-up among large power companies to fail this year. 

 The move, which comes a month after Exelon Corp. ( EXC.N ) canceled its planned purchase of Public Service Enterprise Group ( PEG.N ) over to regulatory hurdles, follows the repeal of a long-standing federal law limiting mergers. But state regulators have increased scrutiny of such deals as utility rates rise. The state regulatory step-up could have a chilling effect on future utility deals and may push companies to consider spinning off their regulated businesses, as PSEG said it might do, bankers said. "I think a number of states have done a spectacularly effective job ensuring that merger transactions will be chilled or impeded for some time," said George Bilicic, head power and energy investment banker at Lazard Ltd. ( LAZ.N ). The 10-month-old FPL-Constellation deal had been in trouble since the spring, particularly in Maryland, and the companies had said several times that they might not be able to complete it. In May, they stopped integration work and Constellation continued to pursue other strategic plans, such as the sale of its gas generation plants for $1.64 billion to Tenaska Power Fund LP. RATEPAYERS REVOLT FPL was caught up in politics in Maryland over Constellation's Baltimore Gas & Electric's plans to raise electricity rates, which have since been scaled back. "As we considered the situation in Maryland, we determined the risks and uncertainties were too significant to overcome," Constellation Chief Executive Mayo Shattuck said in a statement. "I think the timing was poor," said energy analyst Daniele Seitz of Dahlman Rose. "Going to market-based rates is a big challenge in itself, but trying to do that along with the merger was obviously difficult." FPL, the parent of Florida Power and Light utility, announced plans to acquire Constellation in December 2005, a move aimed at creating a top-tier nuclear generator and as part of broader expansion plans away from Florida. The all-stock deal, which at the time was worth about $11 billion, was part of a series of large announcements marking consolidation in the power sector. Of those, only Duke Energy Corp.'s ( DUK.N ) purchase of Cinergy has closed. Still outstanding is National Grid Plc's ( NG.L ) plan to buy KeySpan Corp. KSE.N in the U.S. Northeast. LAW REPEALED The increased difficulty in closing deals has come as power shifted away from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission after the repeal of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which had limited utility mergers since 1935. That repeal, effective in February, was expected to ease the abilities of companies to merge. But it may have pushed some state regulatory commissions to take a closer look at such deals. Now experts say utilities might look to build more profitable unregulated divisions and spin off the regulated units. Those moves, however, would also likely to draw sharp regulator scrutiny. Sharp rises in electricity prices, which vary dramatically by state, have been one of the key drivers of the state scrutiny, experts said. "Electricity pricing is the paramount issue. We are in an environment where a merger must have demonstrable benefits for rate payers," said Curt Launer, a managing director at boutique firm Sagent Advisors. "The balance of power...has shifted more toward state regulation." The companies' shares have both risen since the deal was announced, and on Wednesday FPL was up $1.52, or 3.1 percent, at $49.69 by mid-afternoon, while Constellation fell 81 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $61.75, both on the New York Stock Exchange.
