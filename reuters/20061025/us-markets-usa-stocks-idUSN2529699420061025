 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stock futures pointed to a slightly higher market open on Wednesday, boosted by investor optimism about strong earnings after online retailer Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) posted quarterly profit and revenue above Wall Street estimates. 

 But many investors were hesitant to take new positions before the Federal Reserve wraps up a two-day policy setting meeting later on Wednesday. Though investors expect the Fed to keep interest rates on hold, an accompanying Fed statement could give clues about the outlook for rates. Amazon.com shares leapt 14.6 percent in European trading after the company's profit and revenue beat analysts' estimates.  "The outcome of the Fed meeting is already known ... so we're up this morning based on Amazon's announcement last night, which beat expectations," said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "Third-quarter earnings are coming in much better than anyone felt, and even though we're getting some warnings for the fourth quarter, they are outweighed by the strong results." Standard & Poor's 500 futures SPc1 were up 0.2 point, above fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 were up 6 points, and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures were up 2.75 points. Overseas stocks were also higher, with the MSCI All-Country world index .MSCIWD hitting a fresh all-time high. General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) is expected to report strong results on Wednesday. Dow components Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) and Altria Group ( MO.N ) are also due to report. Shares of Analog Devices Inc. ADI.N, which makes semiconductors used in home theater systems and cars, were down 1.4 percent in Europe after the company lowered its fourth-quarter revenue forecast. Shares of electronics retailer RadioShack ( RSH.N ) fell 2.3 percent in light European trading after the company posted a quarterly loss, hit by higher costs and lower wireless sales.  The Fed is due to release its statement on interest rates and the economy at 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT). On the economic data front, the National Association of Realtors releases existing home sales data for September and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago releases its September National Activity Index at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT). U.S. tech stocks fell on Tuesday, but the Dow industrials closed at another record high. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  finished up 10.97 points, or 0.09 percent, at 12,127.88, a record closing high. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  closed up 0.36 points, or 0.03 percent, at 1,377.38. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  ended down 10.72 points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,344.84.
