 LONDON  (Reuters) - Private equity groups Blackstone BG.UL and PAI Partners said on Wednesday they had agreed to buy Britain's biggest biscuit maker, United Biscuits, for just over 1.6 billion pounds ($3 billion), including debt. 

 The price tag is a little less than the 1.7 billion pounds originally expected for the maker of McVitie's Jaffa Cakes and Jacob's Cream Crackers. In the deal, PAI will increase its current 40 percent stake in United Biscuits to about 50 percent. United Biscuits (UB) is Europe's second-largest biscuit maker after France's Danone ( DANO.PA ), and its brands include Penguin and go ahead! biscuits and snacks such as Hula Hoops, KP Nuts, Mini Cheddars and Skips. The business has 15 manufacturing plants in western Europe and a 9,000 workforce, with 7,500 in the UK. Blackstone and PAI said the deal would be financed through a combination of equity, which would be contributed equally by the two groups, and debt financing committed by Barclays, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. The private equity firms declined to say how much debt they were taking on. UB management will also participate in the ownership of the business, and the deal is expected to close by December 2006, Blackstone and PAI said. PAI led a 1.26 billion pound buyout of UB in 2000 with fellow private equity groups Cinven CINV.UL and MidOcean Partners, as well as U.S. food giant Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N. Kraft transferred its 25 percent stake in July to its three private equity partners and, in exchange, took over UB's Spanish and Portuguese operations. That left PAI and Cinven each with 40 percent stakes and MidOcean with 20 percent. PENSION DEFICIT CONCERNS Last month, Britain's Premier Foods ( PFD.L ), whose brands include Branston Pickle and Angel Delight desserts, pulled out of the bidding for UB, leaving Blackstone as the only bidder left in the auction. Cinven said in a statement that both its and MidOcean's interests in United Biscuits had generated returns of 2.2 times the cost of investment. The firm, founded in 1948 following the merger of two Scottish family businesses, made earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 202 million pounds in 2005 on revenues of 1.44 billion. Britain's Transport and General Workers Union (T&G), which has nearly 900 members at UB, called on Blackstone and PAI to take action to reduce the firm's pension deficit. "Private equity deals are invariably struck for quick returns for shareholders," Brian Revell, T&G national organizer for food and agriculture said in a statement. "We believe there should be a cash injection to show this is not a quick-fix deal but a longer-term investment." United Biscuits said in an emailed statement that its new shareholders would make a "significant lump sum payment" into the deficit, which it said was 213 million pounds. It declined to put a figure on the payment. PAI and Blackstone were not immediately available to say what plans they had for the pension deficit. The two private equity firms were advised by JP Morgan, Herbert Smith and Simpson Thatcher, while UB was advised by Goldman Sachs and Allen & Overy.
