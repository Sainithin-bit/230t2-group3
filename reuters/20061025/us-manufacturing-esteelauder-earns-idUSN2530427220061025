 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos. Inc. ( EL.N ) on Wednesday said its quarterly profit fell slightly, but blew past its lowered expectations, as it worked to promote its brands amid consolidation among the department stores where its cosmetics and fragrances are sold. 

 The company, whose brands include Clinique, Aveda and Bobbi Brown, kept its full-year expectations intact despite coming in ahead of its forecast and said that view could be pressured if Lord & Taylor shuts some stores. Estee Lauder also said its board voted to increase the annual dividend on Estee Lauder's common stock by 25 percent to 50 cents per share. Profit was $58.3 million, or 27 cents per share, in the first quarter that ended September 30, compared with $58.5 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations fell to $58 million, or 27 cents per share, from $61.8 million, or 28 cents per share. In August, Estee Lauder forecast first quarter earnings of 15 cents to 20 cents per share from continuing operations, well below Wall Street expectations for 33 cents at the time. Analysts then lowered their forecasts to 19 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Estee Lauder has been pinched as Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N, which owns the Macy's and Bloomingdale's chains, closes stores following its acquisition of May Department Stores. Despite that pressure, sales rose 6 percent to $1.59 billion, or 5 percent excluding the impact of foreign currency translation. Sales rose in most categories, but fragrance sales slipped 1.3 percent to $289.3 million. The company expects to take advantage of Federated's national Macy's chain, which debuted in September, during the current fiscal year. Estee Lauder, which is based in New York, said it is confident it can meet its full-year forecast for earnings from continuing operations of $2.00 per share to $2.10 per share, including an impact of 8 cents per share from the Federated store closures. It also said sales should still grow 5 percent to 7 percent for the year. Estee Lauder said that full-year results could be lower if Lord & Taylor stores close. The 2007 estimate includes $50 million of sales and earnings of 6 cents per share related to that chain, which Federated just sold to NRDC Equity Partners. For the current second quarter, Estee Lauder forecast sales growth of 6 percent to 8 percent and earnings of 73 cents to 78 cents per share from continuing operations.
