 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tobacco industry leader Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) on Wednesday posted lower-than-expected earnings due to weakness in international markets, while competitor Reynolds American Inc. ( RAI.N ) beat estimates, helped by market share gains for Camel cigarettes. 

 Altria also said it would announce at the end of January the timing and details of its plan to spinoff the 88.6 percent of Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N shares it holds, sending Altria stock up almost 2 percent. "Overall, we believe this is very positive news since it is clear the board's priority is to break-up the company and now the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the break-up has finally diminished," Bonnie Herzog, an analyst at Citigroup Investment Research, said in a research note. Reynolds said its Conwood smokeless tobacco business will add more to earnings than expected in 2006 and raised its profit forecast for the year. Altria, parent of Philip Morris USA and Philip Morris International, also raised its forecast, but largely due to an expected gain from the sale of a business by Kraft. Reynolds has cut costs and focused its marketing on Kool and Camel cigarettes, helping drive market share gains for those brands while lifting operating margins. The company also acquired Conwood, the No. 2 smokeless tobacco company. Altria's international operations have been hurt by a smoking ban in most public places in Spain and by industry weakness in the third quarter in Japan Altria shares were up $1.08 cents at $80.90 in midday trading, while Reynolds were up $1.47, or 2.28 percent, at  $65.87. ALTRIA PROFIT FLAT Altria said profit in the third quarter was roughly flat at $2.88 billion, or $1.36 a share. That compared with $2.88 billion, or $1.38 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were $1.39 a share. On that basis, analysts forecast $1.41 a share on average, according to Reuters Estimates. Third-quarter operating revenue rose 3.7 percent to $25.8 billion. Philip Morris International's operating profit fell 3.8 percent to $2.1 billion and the unit shipped 215.9 billion cigarettes, down 0.5 percent. Operating profit at the company's Philip Morris USA unit rose 5.7 percent to $1.3 billion. The unit shipped 47.6 billion cigarettes, a decrease of 0.6 percent. Altria said it now expects full-year earnings to be $5.48 to $5.53 a share, up from its previous forecast of $5.40 to $5.50, due in part to its share of a gain Kraft will post from the sale of its Minute Rice brand. REYNOLDS BEATS ESTIMATES At Reynolds, the company said profit was $309 million, or $1.05 a share, in the third quarter, compared with $213 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding merger-related charges, earnings were $1.09 a share. Analysts, on average, forecast $1 on that basis, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 1.9 percent to $2.19 billion. The company shipped 26.7 billion cigarettes in the quarter, down 7.4 percent from a year earlier. Reynolds now forecasts earnings of $4.20 to $4.30 a share for the year. The company had previously forecast $4.15 to $4.25 a share, adjusting for a 2-for-1 stock split. As of Tuesday's close, Reynolds shares were up about 32 percent this year, compared with about a 7 percent increase for Altria. Reynolds traded at about 14.8 times 2007 estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 14.2 for Altria.
