 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - High-yielding emerging market currencies may see further gains in the wake of Wednesday's Federal Reserve statement which gave credence to the view that U.S. interest rates have peaked in this business cycle. 

 The Federal Reserve held its fed funds rate unchanged for the third consecutive month on Wednesday, and issued a balanced statement, warning about inflation, but also noting that the U.S. economy was slowing and that crude oil prices had fallen. "I'm less concerned about any dramatic slowing because we've seen a U.S. equity market rally, income growth has been okay, and you're not seeing a sharper slowdown in consumer behavior," said Stephen Gilmore, emerging market currency strategist at Banque AIG in London." As a result financial futures markets now suggest the chances the Fed will raise its fed funds rate to 5.5 percent by January are down to 10 percent from 16 percent on Tuesday. In fact, fed funds futures futures now show a moderate chance the Fed will cut rates as soon as the second quarter next year, a scenario that should spur the flow of capital into higher yielding emerging markets. And the slippage in the U.S. dollar "reflected a market that was slightly long dollars going into the event on expectations that if there were any changes, they were likely to err on the hawkish side," said Alan Ruskin, chief market strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. Rising stock prices in emerging markets, backed by robust foreign equity inflows, should entice investors to seek returns in those countries, lifting their currencies. "It's not a bad time to be in emerging market currencies," Banque AIG's Gilmore added. Emerging market currencies rallied across the board against the dollar after the Fed statement. Latin American and Asian currencies posted sharp gains following the Fed meeting. Both Latin America and Asia, which rely heavily on the United States for exports, would benefit if the U.S. economy slows only gradually. Rebecca Paterson, global currency strategist, at JP Morgan in New York has recommended that investors use the dollar's declines to buy emerging market currencies. "Part of why the dollar is selling off...is also just selling to get into emerging markets," Patterson said. UNCONVINCED ABOUT EMERGING FX GAINS Some analysts, however, remained unconvinced about the current phase of emerging market strength. Bank of America emerging currency strategist Lawrence Goodman said while the Fed is expected to keep rates unchanged for some time, other major central banks such as the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan are in a tightening mode. "Monetary conditions in major central banks will be critical for emerging markets in coming days," said Goodman in New York. "As rate expectations are ratcheted up in G3 currencies (dollar, euro, yen), the prospect of a modest correction in high-yielding emerging market currencies increases," he added. Higher bond yields in recent weeks in the United State, the eurozone and Japan could well tempt investors out of lucrative emerging markets, therefore putting downward pressure on their currencies. Other brokerage houses like BNP Paribas, while clearly bullish on emerging markets, were also cautious. In a research note, the bank said "further gains could start to be more discriminate and benefit only those currencies that have embarked on tighter monetary policies" and stronger fiscal measures. Analysts say Asian currencies fit that mold. "There's an inevitability about Asian currency strength that can only be frustrated by actions of local policymakers to stop excessive appreciation," wrote Bear Stearns chief currency strategist Steve Barrow in London. Most analysts believe even if the United States does end up raising interest rates one more time, Asia would not be as negatively affected as many of its counterparts, especially given the region's external surpluses. For now, a U.S. rate rise is certainly far from most investors' minds. "For someone who is prepared to take large swings, then high-yielders make sense," said Banque AIG's Gilmore.
