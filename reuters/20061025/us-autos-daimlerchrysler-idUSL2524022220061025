 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE maintained its 2006 profit forecast on Wednesday after strong third-quarter profits at Mercedes and its trucks business helped absorb a 1.16 billion euros ($1.46 billion) loss at Chrysler. 

 The world's fifth-biggest carmaker made an operating profit of 892 million euros ($1.12 billion) -- down by half but easily beating the average of 550 million in a Reuters poll -- and said it still saw 2006 operating profit around 5 billion euros. The Stuttgart-based group, created by the 1998 merger between Germany's Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler of the United States, is facing growing demand for more fuel-efficient cars in the U.S. after oil prices hit a record high earlier this year. "DaimlerChrysler is maintaining this earnings target due to very positive business developments in the divisions Mercedes Car Group, Truck Group and Financial Services," it said, avoiding having to cut its outlook for the second time in 2006. Morgan Stanley said it expected market estimates to shift "significantly higher", especially since premium arm Mercedes was enjoying strong underlying margins even in the year's weakest quarter. But Chrysler and aerospace group EADS cast long shadows over the group. Caught out by U.S. consumers' sudden aversion to light trucks and big sport utility vehicles given high fuel prices, Chrysler swung to an operating loss of 1.16 billion euros, in line with last month's warning that its losses could hit 1.2 billion in the quarter and 1 billion in 2006. Finance chief Bodo Uebber and Chrysler head Tom LaSorda told a conference call the group was rigorously reviewing what steps were needed to rescue profits at Chrysler while it launches a string of fuel-efficient cars to energy-conscious buyers. "We'll come back with a detailed plan when we're ready. But I'm not sitting here, sitting and thinking we're going to be optimistic on everything," LaSorda said. He and Uebber refused to answer questions on whether selling Chrysler was ruled out. U.S. rivals General Motors ( GM.N ) and Ford ( F.N ) have also struggled on their home turf this year as Asian carmakers build market share by offering fuel-sipping alternatives to the pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles Detroit has come to love. U.S. oil prices reached a record of $78.40 in mid July but have since come down to around $60 a barrel CLc1. GM's automotive business reported a net loss of $374 million in North America in the third quarter while Ford's auto business there lost $2 billion before tax and special items. EADS DRAG DaimlerChrysler also said it expected the 2006 profit contribution from aerospace group Airbus parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) to lag expectations by around 200 million euros. Repeated delays in launching the Airbus A380 superjumbo jet have prompted EADS to warn of a 4.8 billion euro shortfall to expected operating profit for the years 2006 to 2010. DaimlerChrysler is cutting its EADS stake to 22.5 percent from around 30 percent and plans to sell a further 7.5 percent. Uebber said consultations on this with stakeholders including the German government would continue, but gave no more details. DaimlerChrysler group net income fell to 541 million euros from 855 million a year ago on sales of 35.2 billion, down from 38.2 billion as Chrysler sales and output shrank by a quarter. DaimlerChrysler shares rose as high as 43.95 euros and closed 4.2 percent higher at 43.23 euros, the top gainer among German blue chips  .GDAXI  and the European auto sector .SXAP. Chrysler's loss eclipsed rebounding earnings at premium division Mercedes Car Group, whose operating profit rose 127 percent to 991 million euros, handily beating the poll average. Uebber said the division was on track to keep improving earnings and hit its 7 percent operating margin target in 2007. "However, due to seasonality and the model changeover of the (Mercedes-Benz) C-Class we expect a weaker first quarter in 2007 subsequently followed by stronger quarters," he said. The company's industry-leading trucks business boosted operating profit by 57 percent to 556 million euros amid a global boom that is now showing signs of waning. Profit at financial services rose 9 percent to 445 million. DaimlerChrysler stock has lagged the European car sector index .SXAP by around 16 percent this year given Chrysler's woes. The stock trades at around 11.7 times estimated 2007 earnings per share versus 11 times for archrival BMW ( BMWG.DE ), Reuters data showed.
