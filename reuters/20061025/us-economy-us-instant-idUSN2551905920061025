 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its benchmark interest rate steady for a third straight meeting, citing economic cooling while warning that it was closely monitoring price pressures. 

 As expected, the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to keep its overnight federal funds rate target at 5.25 percent, the level it reached in June after 17 straight increases since mid-2004.   KEY POINTS: - Voting against holding rates steady was Richmond Federal Reserve Bank President Jeffrey Lacker, who preferred an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate target, the FOMC statement said.  COMMENTARY:  T.J. MARTA, FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW  YORK: "Bonds are rallying and it ends up being a sell the rumor buy the fact reaction. The Treasury market sold off earlier in the week on the idea that the Fed's statement would sound hawkish. They didn't get that and now what we're seeing is a rally."  JASON SCHENKER, ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA CORP., CHARLOTTE, N.C.: "Again the Fed sees inflationary concerns but also moderating growth. We believe this is likely to keep the Fed on hold for the rest of the year. "The (25-basis point) cut that we've got, I think March is probably the most likely of the meetings for that cut. "The majority of the members on the committee believe risks are balanced and that aggregate demand has been somewhat contained and that inflationary pressure might be contained as well."  ALEXANDER PARIS, ECONOMIST AND MARKET ANALYST, BARRINGTON  RESEARCH, CHICAGO: "It confirms again that they not going to raise. The overwhelming majority did not expect them to increase rates. They have been talking tough on inflation but not really doing anything about it because they are assuming the economy will be slowing particularly with oil prices coming down. Inflationary pressures are out there, but we will see some relief with the economy slowing. Some had thought they would be easing, but I don't think they will be easing until the second quarter at the earliest next year. "(Stocks) are rallying on a little relief rally that they didn't raise rates."  BARRY HYMAN, EQUITY MARKET STRATEGIST, EKN FINANCIAL SERVICES  INC., NEW YORK: "I don't think there are any surprises ... A measured commentary, telling us that inflation can be maintained with energy prices staying at moderate levels, but still warning that you have to watch the data. It was maybe a little less hawkish than some people anticipated, and this is coming within the background of a very strong earnings quarter. The trend in the (stock) market is still up, so anything that is not super disturbing can be interpreted as slightly positive."  KEVIN FLANAGAN, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, GLOBAL WEALTH  MANAGEMENT, MORGAN STANLEY, PURCHASE, NEW YORK: "The market may have been gearing itself up for a more hawkish statement: that is why you are seeing some kneejerk buying. "It really doesn't change the outlook for rates going forward, The Fed remains committed to keeping inflationary pressures contained. You don't get a sense of urgency at this point in time that the Fed needs to take that next step and raise rates."  NICK BENNENBROEK, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BROWN BROTHERS HARRIMAN,  NEW YORK: "I don't think their policy outlook has moved forward much in the past month. We're in the same situation we were in a month ago. Probably the most significant element of the statement was the second sentence, when the Fed said the economy is likely to expand at a moderate pace. If anything, it would be somewhat negative for the dollar. So long as the Fed continues to see the economy expanding at a moderate pace, it's unlikely we'll see further tightening. If that's the case, that means dollar support erodes over time."  RICHARD DEKASER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIONAL CITY CORP.,  CLEVELAND, OHIO: "The Fed remains firstly preoccupied with inflation risks. A distance second is a concern about growth. "They dropped the reference to energy and commodities. It's a very straight forward statement. "There's no change in policy and no likely change in the forseeable future. The fed funds futures don't see the Fed making a move until the third quarter 2007. "My read on the Fed is more hawkish than what the market is reading. The Fed is more biased on a hike than an ease."  JACK ABLIN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HARRIS PRIVATE BANK,  CHICAGO: "The picture I got from this so far is that the Fed really wants to see evidence of slowing inflation before they make any move to lower interest rates. As long as the economy and energy prices cooperate to help stem any growth in inflation, then the Fed can sit on sidelines and watch, but they're going to want some concrete proof that inflation is slowing before they take any action on the fed funds rate. "Both stocks and bonds have popped up in reaction because the concern was that we might have an impending rate hike in the future and that message wasn't sent in the statement. Stocks have rallied about 20 points just in the past few minutes. "It appears the bond market vigilantes have retired because they don't appear too aggressive in reaction to this news."  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices extend gains after Fed statement less hawkish than feared. 
- U.S. rate futures steady as Fed keeps rates on hold, cites inflation risks. Chance of rate hike at December FOMC meeting holds at 8 percent.  
- Dollar slips against euro in wake of FOMC statement. The euro rose against the dollar, trading at $1.2618 soon after the report from $1.2580 shorly prior. The dollar also slipped against the yen, trading at about 119.00 yen from 119.15 before the FOMC decision.
