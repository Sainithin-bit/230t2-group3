 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ), on Wednesday said quarterly profit fell less than 1 percent due to charges and forecast double-digit earnings-per-share growth through next year and beyond, pushing its shares up more than 3 percent. 

 Excluding restructuring charges, profit rose and topped Wall Street's forecast. Sales were also higher than expected and a new high-end toothpaste from Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) did not pressure Colgate as much as some had anticipated. "Net, this was a remarkably strong, high quality quarter," said Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Pecoriello. Third-quarter profit at the maker of its namesake toothpaste and dish soap fell to $344.1 million, or 63 cents per share, from $347.2 million, or 63 cents, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring charges and the impact of stock-based compensation in the latest period, and excluding restructuring charges a year ago, Colgate earned $421.5 million, or 77 cents per share, up from $369.7 million, or 67 cents per share. Excluding the restructuring charges, but including stock-based compensation charges, Colgate earned 73 cents per share in the latest quarter, topping Wall Street's consensus view by a penny, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $3.14 billion, above the analysts' average estimate of just under $3.08 billion. "The quality of the numbers they reported were as good as any we have seen in the sector recently," said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who rates Colgate stock as "outperform." During a conference call, Hott and others asked Chief Executive Reuben Mark about how Colgate has performed against Crest Pro-Health, the new toothpaste from P&G. Mark said, in his view, Pro-Health has not grown as much as Colgate Total did when it was launched in 1997 and that Colgate was defending itself well. "Bring them on," said Mark. Colgate said its share of the U.S. toothpaste market rose to 37.4 percent year to date, up 40 basis points from a year earlier and more than 3 share points ahead of Crest, citing ACNielsen market share data. Colgate Total led that growth, posting a record high market share of 15.2 percent. "Pro Health is so far not the death knell of Colgate," Hott said. P&G gives its results next week. Colgate unveiled a restructuring plan in 2004 that included cutting 12 percent of its work force and closing one-third of its factories. On Wednesday, it said savings from that program could come in slightly above its original expectations. Mark also said that the company would not chase acquisitions, and feels that Colgate can generate volume growth ahead of its historical growth with its existing businesses. Colgate, which also makes Ajax cleanser and Hill's Science Diet pet food, expects to post double-digit earnings-per-share growth this year, excluding restructuring and stock-based compensation charges, with the same seen in 2007. President and Chief Operating Officer Ian Cook, who will become CEO in the middle of 2007, said that the restructuring and other plans should also help Colgate post double-digit earnings-per-share growth beyond 2007. Mark also said that Colgate's raw material costs should be up just 0.8 percent this year, after earlier forecasting a 1.7 percent increase. Shares of Colgate, which is now focused on profitable areas such as oral care, personal care and pet food, rose 3.7 percent during the quarter, while the six-company S&P Household & Personal Products Index .GSPHHPE, which includes Colgate, advanced 8.9 percent. The stock was up $1.90 at $62.37 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising to $62.52.
