 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) posted a surprise drop in quarterly net profit on Wednesday due to finance-related losses, but it raised its full-year forecasts to adjust for a weaker yen. 

 At the operating level, Japan's No. 3 auto maker beat market estimates with a 19 percent jump to a record profit for the second business quarter, thanks partly to brisk car sales in North America, India and China. But the main catalyst for that rise was a favorable slide in the yen's value -- by 5 yen against the dollar and 12 yen to the euro -- which wiped out all the negatives including bigger outlays for raw materials and sales incentives. Domestic rivals such as Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ) are also enjoying windfall currency gains, even as some U.S. and European auto makers announce dismal results amid sliding sales and production cutbacks. Nissan is scheduled to report earnings on Thursday, followed by Toyota on November 7. For the full year to end-March, Honda, which relies on North America for the majority of its profits, lifted its operating profit forecast to 820 billion yen ($6.9 billion) from the previous 750 billion. A softer-than-assumed Japanese currency contributed 91 billion yen -- more than the margin of revision. The positive impact from its core vehicle sales business is now expected to shrink as a shift in consumer demand toward smaller cars hurts its product mix -- meaning thinner margins. "We all know that forex is the main reason behind Honda's upward revision, which could be followed by similar moves by other auto makers," said Takashi Miyazaki, general manager of the investment strategy division at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management. "But because of that I see the risk of the yen strengthening." Full-year net profit is now seen at 555 billion yen instead of 550 billion. Honda changed its assumptions for the average values of the dollar and the euro for the year, to 115 yen per dollar from 112 and to 145 yen per euro from 139. The dollar is trading just under 120 yen and the euro around 150 yen. July-September net profit at Honda fell 4.3 percent to 127.91 billion yen ($1.07 billion), hit by valuation losses on financial instruments and a difficult comparison with last year's big derivatives-related gains. The net profit lagged an estimate of 135.5 billion yen by five brokerages surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Operating profit, which strips out earnings from 44 affiliates in China and other parts of Asia, totaled 193.02 billion yen as revenue grew 12.5 percent to 2.63 trillion yen. COMPACT CAR SHIFT Powered by a fleet of fuel-efficient cars against the backdrop of high gasoline prices, Honda is winning drivers in North America and Europe, especially with the remodeled Civic sedan, although analysts said a supply shortage of such popular models is holding back volume growth globally. At the same time, consumers' preference for smaller cars was also forcing bigger spending on deal-sweeteners for larger vehicles, especially in the United States, Honda said. "There's a global shift toward compact cars, and that's led to a worsening model mix," Fumihiko Ike, a director at Honda, told a news conference. Executive Vice President Satoshi Aoki said Honda was budgeting an additional $40 million to $50 million in sales costs in the United States, where competitors are piling on discounts on larger sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. Still, Honda said its results were generally within expectations apart from the yen's swing, and lifted its planned dividend payout to 64 yen a share for the full year from 60 yen. It said it would pay a quarterly dividend for the first time -- 17 yen at the end of each of the remaining quarters. Honda's fortunes contrast sharply with those of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, which have been wrongfooted by U.S. consumers' shift away from big sport utility vehicles in favor of fuel-efficient cars. Ford on Monday posted a quarterly loss of $5.8 billion -- its largest loss in 14 years -- while DaimlerChrysler last month slashed 1 billion euros off its original 2006 operating profit forecast on mounting losses at the U.S. Chrysler arm. Honda's global car sales in the second quarter rose 6.0 percent to 884,000 units. But it nudged down its full-year forecast, by 20,000 units, to account for weak domestic sales. Analysts said Honda's overall volume growth would continue to be hampered by supply constraints for four-cylinder engines, which power the small Civic and Fit models, adding the bottleneck would persist at least through the current quarter. To address those issues, Honda said on Tuesday it would rejig output arrangements at two of its North American factories to allow for the production of up to 60,000 more Civics a year starting in April. Honda shares gained 9.4 percent in July-September, beating a 6.9 percent rise in the transport sector subindex .ITEQP.T. The stock ended down 1 percent at 4,070 yen on Wednesday before the results were announced. ($1=119.20 Yen) (Additional reporting by Risa Maeda)
