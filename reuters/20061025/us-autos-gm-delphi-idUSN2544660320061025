 DETROIT/CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Wednesday cut its worst-case estimate of its retirement cost liability at Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, the clearest sign yet that the automaker is nearing a deal with the former subsidiary and its unions. 

 GM also detailed for the first time how much it could pay to reimburse Delphi for hourly labor costs to help the parts maker cut its payroll as it emerges from bankruptcy. GM said it expected to pay less than $400 million to support Delphi's work force in 2007 and less than $100 million in other ongoing payments of a limited duration. In exchange for those payments, GM said it expected to get savings on Delphi parts that would more than offset the costs. "I'm cautiously optimistic, is the way I would put it," GM Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson said when asked if he expected a deal with Delphi to be done by the end of the year. GM said on Wednesday it expected its total liability from Delphi would be between $6 billion and $7.5 billion, compared to a prior forecast of $5.5 billion to $12 billion. Henderson said the revised estimate, which was accompanied by a $500 million charge in the third quarter, reflected progress in the talks between GM, Delphi and its unions. Analysts also said the details indicated progress in talks. However, Delphi's bankruptcy negotiations include creditors, stockholders, unions, potential investors and possible buyers for some business units, making the timing unclear, they said. "To be willing to say that ... suggests they have a firm plan and are in the final stages of negotiating it," Morningstar analyst John Novak said. "There is always a risk that creditors or the equity committee could throw a wrench into this." Delphi, which filed the largest bankruptcy in U.S. automotive history in October 2005, has outlined plans to cut several business lines, shut U.S. plants and drop thousands of its hourly and salaried workers to reorganize operations. "We are making progress, we still have issues to resolve, but we are focused on reaching a consensual agreement and we will keep working with our stakeholders and affected parties until one is reached," Delphi spokeswoman Claudia Piccinin said. As part of its 1999 spin-off of Delphi, GM agreed it would remain liable for some of the retirement costs for the Troy, Michigan-based parts supplier's work force if Delphi was unable to meet those obligations on its own. GM reached a deal this year with the United Auto Workers, the International Union of Electrical Workers-Communications Workers of America and Delphi under which more than 20,000 union workers opted for retirements or buyouts and another 5,000 UAW workers could return to GM. Analysts have seen that exodus as reducing the likelihood of a lengthy labor disruption at Delphi, which has the potential to force a costly shutdown at GM plants. GM's estimate for its Delphi liability is a net estimate, including what it may recover in the bankruptcy process, Henderson said. "I'd love to actually go through all the constituent parts, but I'm really not at liberty to do that today because it is frankly a matter that has got to get dealt with at the negotiating table," Henderson said. GM and Delphi's creditors and stockholders have been locked in a dispute over whether the automaker's unsecured claims against Delphi should be allowed. Delphi earlier in 2006 gave its unions two wage and benefit cutting proposals, one with less stiff cuts should GM agree to provide subsidies. Unions rejected that offer and would still need to ratify any new proposal. "The major obstacle is how extensive are the final wage cuts going to be, how long do they last if GM is subsidizing and the ultimate level of benefits in terms of pension and health care," Fitch Ratings Managing Director Mark Oline said.
