 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly profit rose 27 percent as the health insurer better controlled overhead, but it cut its full-year enrollment forecast and reported medical cost trends that disappointed some analysts. 

 Shares of WellPoint, the largest U.S. health insurer by enrollment, fell as much as 4.2 percent in morning trade, with its results dragging down other insurers, even though its third-quarter profit was slightly above expectations. "You might just have some short-term traders saying they didn't get the upside surprise they wanted and got out of the stock," said Jack White, director of research at Todd Investment Advisors, which holds about 900,000 WellPoint shares. "If you look at how the company has performed lately, it has been conservative guidance, and beat," White said. Net income at the Indianapolis-based company, the second major U.S. health insurer to report earnings this quarter after UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ), rose to $811 million, or $1.29 per share. That compared to $641 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier. Earnings were $1.24 per share, excluding a 4 cent tax benefit and net realized investment gains of 1 cent. That was a penny ahead of the $1.23 per share expected by analysts, according to Reuters Estimates. Medical enrollment rose by 5.2 million members to 34.2 million from a year ago, including about 4.8 million members added through its $6.5 billion purchase of rival WellChoice Inc. in December. Bank of America analyst Joseph France said in a research note that enrollment grew by 27,000 from the second quarter -- "really disappointing for a company that enrolls business year-round." WellPoint projected medical enrollment of about 34.3 million members at year end, down from the 34.5 million it forecast in July. The company's sales, general and administrative expense ratio was 15.5 percent in the quarter, down from 16.8 percent in the 2005 quarter. WellPoint said the improvement stemmed from controlling spending and various efficiencies, including those gained by integrating acquisitions. WellPoint expects to lower that SG&A ratio by as much as 2 percentage points over the next three to five years, Chief Financial Officer David Colby told analysts on a conference call. The company's benefit expense ratio -- a key barometer that measures medical costs as a percentage of premium dollars -- worsened by a tenth of a percentage point to 81.3 percent from the second quarter and by 1.8 percentage points from a year ago. WellPoint said the worsening of the ratio -- which came in below several analysts' expectations -- resulted mainly from adding the New York state prescription drug contract, which has a higher-than-average benefit expense ratio, and increased medical expenses for a federal employee contract. CIBC analyst Carl McDonald said in a research note the ratio came in "a touch higher than expected, but was offset by a better SG&A ratio." Revenue rose 29 percent to $14.4 billion. WellPoint said it raised its full-year forecast to $4.81 per share. Analysts expected $4.76. For 2007, the company said it expects to achieve its targeted 15 percent growth in net income per share. "Looking ahead to 2007, we anticipate another year of robust growth in our National Accounts business, along with further expansion of our Medicaid membership base following our recent contract awards," Chief Executive Larry Glasscock said in a statement. WellPoint shares have fallen more than 4 percent this year, a smaller drop than those of rivals UnitedHealth and Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ), which reports earnings on Thursday. WellPoint shares fell $2.67, or 3.4 percent, to $75.95 on the New York Stock Exchange, where they earlier dropped to $75.32. Shares of UnitedHealth and Aetna were off more than 2 percent.
