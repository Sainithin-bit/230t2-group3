 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's BT Group Plc said on Wednesday it had bought Counterpane Internet Security Inc., boosting its capability to advise its corporate customers in their battle against computer hackers. 

 The former UK telecoms monopoly said California-based Counterpane currently monitors 550 networks worldwide for multinational and Fortune 100 customers, and the deal would be earnings enhancing almost immediately with cost synergies. It did not disclose the exact value of the deal, only saying it was in the "tens of millions of dollars". An industry source put the value at around $40 million. BT said Counterpane, whose founder and Chief Technology Officer Bruce Schneier is mentioned in Dan Brown's blockbuster novel "The Da Vinci Code" as a leading cryptologist, had gross assets of $6.8 million at end-2004 and annual sales of around $20 million. "While this is not a large transaction from a financial perspective, it is a very strategically important transaction to us," President of Strategy for Global Services Maggie McClelland said in a conference call. The group said it was actively considering other similar acquisitions to boost its professional services business, a key business for its fastest-growing division, BT Global Services. BT has been increasingly dependent on this division, which provides networked IT services to clients ranging from food group Unilever to Britain's National Health Service, to offset declining sales in its traditional fixed-line telecoms business. "The acquisition of Counterpane strengthens BT Global Services' capabilities in the important Internet security space and also its U.S. capabilities," NCB said in a research note. BT said Counterpane's founder Schneier would continue in his role, as would Chief Executive Paul Stich. BT plans to keep the company as a separate entity for the foreseeable future. The deal follows news on Tuesday that French computer consultancy Capgemini was transferring a large part of its European networking infrastructure services operations to BT in a deal that will see BT engaging around 250 Capgemini staff. Shares in BT were down 0.3 percent at 270-1/2 pence by 0825 GMT, valuing the group at around 22.5 billion pounds. (Additional reporting by  Santosh Menon )
