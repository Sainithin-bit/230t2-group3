 MOSCOW  (Reuters) - U.S.-based International Paper Co. launched a major foray into Russia on Wednesday, signing a letter of intent to form a joint venture with the country's leading forestry firm Ilim Pulp. 

 Under the deal, Memphis-based International Paper would take a 50 percent equity interest in Ilim Holding, into which Ilim Pulp's four pulp and paper mills in Siberia and European Russia are being grouped. The joint venture, valued at about $1.3 billion, would produce 2.5 million tonnes a year of market pulp, uncoated papers and packaging, the companies said. The two sides also plan to invest $1.2 billion over the next five years to boost capacity by 40 percent, or 1 million tonnes a year, and increase output of high-value products. International Paper Chairman and Chief Executive John Faraci said the venture would "unite the unique capabilities of both companies to enable us to create more value together than we could individually." News of the deal appeared well-timed, as President Vladimir Putin used a televised question-and-answer session to call on Russia's forestry industry to invest more in processing and cut exports of logs. RESTRUCTURING DRIVE International Paper's Russian move follows a restructuring drive over the past year, during which it has raised over $6 billion by selling U.S. forestry land with an area the size of Massachusetts. Analysts have praised the U.S. timberland sales as a good move to cash in on rising U.S. property prices. By coming to Russia, International Paper will gain access to vast resources, although poor transport infrastructure is a problem. Ilim Pulp, founded in 1992, says it has Europe's largest resources of timber, with reserves of nearly 8 million cubic metres. It is the continent's fourth-largest producer of market pulp. "Our joint success would provide Russia with a competitive edge over other emerging markets in attracting needed capital to the industry," said Zakhar Smushkin, who is both chairman and a core shareholder of closely held Ilim Pulp. The deal should close in the first quarter of 2007, pending due diligence and regulatory approvals. The venture will not include International Paper's pulp and paper mill in the Russian town of Svetogorsk. Ilim Pulp will, meanwhile, fold its wood-products business into a separate holding company, the companies said. News of the venture came as Putin said the government would hike export duties on timber logs by 2009 and cut tariffs on imports of wood-processing equipment to stimulate the domestic industry. Heavy logging has led to deforestation in areas such as Russia's northwest, close to the Finnish border, while the forestry industry in the remote interior is deeply depressed. Putin told the forestry industry to stop lobbying to protect tax breaks on the export of logs. "It would be better if you devoted your efforts to securing a reduction in tariffs on imports of technical equipment, creating jobs in Russia, paying taxes and stimulating the development of the machine-building sector in Russia," he said.
