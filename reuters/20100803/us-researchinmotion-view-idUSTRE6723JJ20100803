 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Research In Motion on Tuesday unveiled a new touchscreen BlackBerry smartphone designed to compete more effectively against Apple Inc's iPhone and handsets using based on Google's Andriod software. 

 KEY POINTS: * BlackBerry Torch to be launched in U.S. with AT&T. * Available at AT&T stores and online, also at Best Buy, Wal-Mart and RadioShack Corp stores. * Retail price announced at $199, available from August 12. * RIM unveils new BlackBerry operating system * OS 6 expected to be available for some older BlackBerry lines COMMENTS: SHAW WU, ANALYST, KAUFMAN BROS "It looks like an outstanding product. It really closes the gap with Android and iPhone -- probably more Android, because Apple really offers something unique. But RIM really overhauled the user interface. I think they've regained their No.2 position in terms of technology." "BlackBerry 6 (operating system) is now pretty comparable to what Android offers. The only negative is that it's probably not going to be available on Verizon for six months or longer. AT&T is arguably the big winner in this - they've got both the BlackBerry 6 and the iPhone." TODD COUPLAND, ANALYST AT CIBC WORLD MARKETS "This was all leaked for a while -- the worst-kept secret. ... It is good to see that it is out. The test is really how well does it sell, which we will only see in a little while." "I was happy to see the OS6 and new browser is going to work on some of the older devices. There was some question on whether it would work on anything prior to today. ... Not everyone is going to buy a touchscreen." "It is priced where you would expect it to be priced." "It looks (like) the antennae works" MATT THORNTON, ANALYST, AVIAN SECURITIES "The launch date is very good. That is toward the front end of some of the speculation. ... There was some concern that it could slip further out. ... The pricing is spot-on. NICK AGOSTINO, ANALYST, MACKIE RESEARCH CAPITAL "The overall perception will be that (the launch) is a tad earlier than most people expected. I would view that as a positive, especially for the quarter itself, as far as meeting numbers is concerned." "I'm glad to see they got it out sooner rather than later" "First and foremost we need to see a positive reception, when most of the industry folks start doing their own reviews. The last time they (RIM) put a touchscreen out that was not necessarily the case." "The next thing we need to see is signs that the development community is on board with the new device. The fact that this device is going to be geared toward both enterprise and consumer that will be a positive, as people will feel that if they design for this device, they can hit two birds with one stone."
