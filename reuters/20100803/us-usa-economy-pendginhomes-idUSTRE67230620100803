 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Contracts for pending sales of previously owned homes fell to a record low in June as buyers sat on the sidelines, a survey from the National Association of Realtors showed on Tuesday. 

 New orders received by U.S. factories fell more than expected in June, according to a government report on Tuesday that was consistent with a slowdown in manufacturing. KEY POINTS: PENDING HOME SALES- * The Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in June, fell to a record low 75.7 from a revised 77.7 in May. * Economists polled by Reuters had expected a rise of 0.6 percent in June. ( FACTORY ORDERS- * The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods dropped 1.2 percent after falling 1.8 percent in May. * That was the second straight month of decline in factory orders * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders falling 0.5 percent in June. ( COMMENTS: GIRI CHERUKURI, HEAD TRADER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: "I think it's more evidence of the economy being a little bit slow right now. With GDP last week, the second-quarter is a little bit slower than previously expected, and I think the (stock) market is trying to reconcile stronger earnings reports with weaker economic reports." TOM SIMONS, U.S. ECONOMIST, JEFFERIES & CO., NEW YORK: FACTORY ORDERS: "Aircraft kind of sucked it down a little. Non-defense capital goods, ex-aircraft was up 2 percent, so obviously it's not a super strong report, but I don't think it necessarily translates to the weakness in the overall headline number. "I am discounting a lot of the stuff that's been going on in the media, like that Wall Street journal article today. I doubt the Federal Reserve is going to reverse course over a few numbers. "They've continued to pound away at this notion that the recovery is still intact and it's going to be slow and painful but it's still there. "On the whole, factory orders looks kind of weak. There's not really a whole lot to get excited about. I don't really think it tells us much we didn't already know: The manufacturing sector is decelerating a little bit. The declines come off pretty solid gains in the recent months." WAYNE KAUFMAN, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, JOHN THOMAS FINANCIAL, NEW YORK: "It's a little disappointing. We get good news, bad news, good news, bad news. As far as for how this is going to impact the market, we need to consolidate over the next week, so I'm not sure we're going to get a read on what the market thinks about this because it needs to pull back anyway. But we did make a new high yesterday and took out resistance, so the uptrend is very much alive. There's aren't a lot of sellers at this time, and over the next few days we'll be able to gauge whether this weaker than expected data is meaningful in the near-term."
