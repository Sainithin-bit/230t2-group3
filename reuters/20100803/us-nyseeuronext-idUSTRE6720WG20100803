 LONDON  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.N said its quarterly profit rose 25 percent, beating expectations, as a surge in trading and revenue generation from new initiatives boosted the transatlantic exchange operator. 

 The company earned $184 million in the second quarter -- , or 64 cents per share -- up from $132 million, or 51 cents, a year ago. Revenue climbed 7 percent to $654 million. Analysts on average expected NYSE Euronext to earn 59 cents per share on $659.6 million in revenue. "Our strong second quarter results were driven by robust trading volumes, strong revenue generation from new initiatives across our segments and continued cost discipline," said Duncan L. Niederauer, chief executive, NYSE Euronext. The results include a pretax gain from disposals of $54 million. Gains in revenue were lifted by a $31 million, or 10 percent, increase in transaction and clearing revenues, mostly related to derivatives trading. A further $26 million, or 53 percent, increase in technology services revenue also boosted quarterly activity. (Reporting by Alex Chambers; Editing by Louise Heavens)
