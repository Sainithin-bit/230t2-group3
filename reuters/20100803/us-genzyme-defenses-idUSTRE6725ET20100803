 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Biotechnology company Genzyme Corp GENZ.O, which received an $18.4 billion takeover offer from Sanofi-Aventis SA ( SASY.PA ), has few takeover defenses if its French suitor decided to make a hostile bid, according to report by FactSet SharkRepellent. 

 * Genzyme's board is unstaggered, meaning that all of its directors face election every year. It can increase or decrease the size of the board without shareholder approval. * The company also let its "poison pill" or shareholder rights plan expire in 2009. It can renew the poison pill at any time, however. * Since Genzyme just held its annual meeting in June, any hostile bidder or new activist shareholder would have to wait almost a year before challenging the board of directors. * Special meetings can only be called by holders of 40 percent of the company's stock, making it difficult to conduct a shareholder meeting outside the annual meeting schedule. * FactSet SharkRepellent gave Genzyme a so-called "bullet proof" rating of 1.75 on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the strongest defense. In comparison, Genzyme's industry peer group has an average "bullet proof" rating of 4.56 and the S&P 500 companies have a rating of 3.11, according to FactSet SharkRepellent.
