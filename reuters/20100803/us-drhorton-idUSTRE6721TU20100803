 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc ( DHI.N ), the No. 1 U.S. homebuilder, on Tuesday posted a quarterly profit that met Wall Street's expectations as buyers and builders both rushed to seal deals before the federal homebuyer tax credit's June 30 deadline for home closings. 

 Horton reported earnings of $50.5 million, or 16 cents per share, for the third quarter that ended June 30, even with analyst estimates of 16 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Last year, Horton posted a loss of $143.8 million, or 45 cents per share. Closings jumped 60 percent to 6,805 homes, but orders fell 3 percent, reflecting the April 30 tax credit deadline for orders, according to a statement. "Market conditions in the homebuilding industry have become more challenging after the expiration of the tax credit at the end of April," Chairman Donald Horton said in a statement. "Our net sales orders declined significantly in May and improved modestly in June and July." Horton is among only a few of its peers to achieve profits without the help of tax benefits since the housing downturn took root in 2006. The builder has long been known for its focus on the first-time buyer and a strategy of pursuing marketshare by building homes in advance of orders in the hope of selling them and then slashing prices if necessary. If its behavior in Houston, near the builder's Fort Worth, Texas, headquarters, is any indication, Horton may be ramping up its standard operating procedure to cope with the fall-off in demand subsequent to the tax credit's expiration. "Horton is by far the most aggressive," in cutting prices, said Lance Wright, a co-owner of CastleRock Communities, which builds about 500 homes a year, 400 of those in Houston. Wright said Horton has not lowered its base prices in Houston but is instead offering massive incentives to try to clear out the inventory it built up in anticipation of sales driven by the tax credit.
