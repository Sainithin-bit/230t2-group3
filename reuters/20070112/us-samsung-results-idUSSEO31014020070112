 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) posted an 8.5 percent drop in quarterly profit on Friday on weaker-than-expected shipments of flash memory chips and falling prices of flat screens and forecast a challenging first quarter. 

 But its stock rose as much as 4.1 percent after the company announced it would buy back almost $2 billion worth of shares. "Samsung Electronics anticipates challenges in key product areas in the (first) quarter, a seasonally weak period," Chu Woo-sik, Samsung's senior vice president of investor relations, said in a statement. The first part of 2007 looks bumpy as seasonally weak demand for NAND flash memory chips and flat panel screens will likely offset a strong showing from computer memory chips. Samsung earned 2.346 trillion won ($2.5 billion) in net profit for the quarter ended December 31, against 2.563 trillion a year earlier and 2.187 trillion in the previous quarter. The result was in line with the 2.34 trillion won forecast by 29 analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Analysts anticipated a better performance in the second half. "I believe Samsung will be regaining momentum around the third quarter," said Jae H. Lee, an analyst at Daiwa Securities. "LCDs seem to probably be weak in the first half, but profits should be improving in the second half." Samsung's net profit is likely to rise 16 percent to 9.2 trillion won from 7.93 trillion in 2006, Reuters Estimates showed. That number would still be well short of 2004's record 10.79 trillion. Shares in Samsung Electronics, the country's biggest stock worth $91 billion, rose 3.6 percent to close at 603,000 won, leading the 1.7 percent gain in the wider market  .KS11  and posting its biggest one-day percentage gain since August 17, 2006. Revenue came in at 15.69 trillion won, up from 15.52 trillion a year earlier. CHIP STRUGGLE SEEN Samsung saw the overall profit margin at its mainstay chips division rise to 31 percent from the third quarter's 26 percent. But the South Korean firm was hurt by shipment growth of only 19 percent for its NAND flash chips, compared with market expectations for a 40 percent jump, as no new blockbuster media players comparable to Apple's ( AAPL.O ) iPod Nano music player were launched last shopping season. The company also said DRAM prices would drop by a "high single digit" percent in the first quarter, with flash chip prices falling "less than 10 percent". "For NAND...the first half looks to be weak due to seasonal results, but 2007 will be better compared with last year as supplies are expected to tighten," said Kim Young-jun, an analyst at Daishin Securities. Samsung said it forecast 120 percent shipment growth for NAND chips, down from 2006's 147 percent, while DRAM chip shipments were expected to grow 90 percent, up from 38 percent. Samsung, the world's third-largest mobile phone maker, sold a record 32 million mobile phones in the fourth quarter, up from the third quarter's 30.7 million units. But profit margin in the handset division fell to 8 percent from 11 percent in the third as marketing costs doubled in what appears to be an increasingly difficult market. Just last week, world No. 2 handset maker Motorola MOT.N issued a profit warning, citing an "unfavorable" geographic and product mix. Still, Samsung maintained its 2007 sales forecast of 130 million units, up 13 percent from 2006. Samsung's liquid crystal display (LCD) business, the world's biggest in large LCDs ahead of LG.Philips LCD ( 034220.KS ), underperformed last year's results, with margins coming in at 10 percent against 13 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005. The margin, however, was double that in the preceding quarter as a rebound in computer monitor panel prices outweighed falling TV panel prices. The company predicted slight falls in LCD selling prices in 2007 but said it didn't expect excessive growth in LCD supply. Samsung also announced it would invest 8.1 trillion won in 2007, compared with 10 trillion in 2006. When taking into account Samsung's investment into its U.S. chip plant and its LCD joint venture, the capital spending plan rises to 9.7 trillion won, Samsung said. Samsung said it would buy back shares worth 1.8 trillion won between January-April to support its share price. In 2006, Samsung bought back the same value in shares between April and June. Its shares fell 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter, trailing a 4.6 percent rise in the KOSPI. ($1=938.5 Won) (Additional reporting by  Angela Moon , Kim Yeonhee and Cheon Jongwoo)
