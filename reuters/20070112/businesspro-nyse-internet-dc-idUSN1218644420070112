 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The New York Stock Exchange plans a 
pilot program later this year that could bring real-time stock 
quotes to Internet users, The Wall Street Journal reported on 
Friday. 

  The NYSE Group Inc. NYX.N unit is expected to file a 
proposal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on 
Friday, the Journal reported.  If the SEC approves the plan, the NYSE will allow Web sites 
to publish trade prices with nearly no delay in return for 
payments of $100,000 a month, the Journal reported.  The test program could be available as early as March, 
depending on the SEC's response, the paper said.  Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) and business news television station 
CNBC have said they would offer data for free to their users, 
the paper said. The NYSE also has had discussions with other 
Internet service providers such as Yahoo, the Journal added.  Google is a member of a group called NetCoalition, which 
has complained about a lack of real-time stock data offered 
through services owned by the NYSE Group and Nasdaq Stock 
Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O )
