 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Swimming pool distributor Pool Corp. 
( POOL.O ) warned on Thursday that its 2006 earnings per share 
would fall short of Wall Street estimates and its own previous 
forecast, and it issued a 2007 earnings outlook that also was 
shy of analyst expectations. 

  Pool said 2006 earnings will be $1.74 to $1.75 per share 
compared with its previous projection of $1.82 per share.  It said it expects a fourth-quarter loss of 8 cents to 10 
cents per share, citing about two percent lower gross margins 
due to lower vendor price incentives than previously expected.  It also said sales would be flat rather than the 5 percent 
sales growth it had anticipated.  Analysts on average expected 2006 earnings of $1.81 per 
share with a loss of 1 cent per share for the fourth quarter.  Covington, Louisiana-based Pool said 2006 results were also 
impacted by the cost of opening 17 new locations.  "While some of these investments have had a short term 
adverse earnings impact, they are consistent with how we have 
managed the business since its inception, which has resulted in 
consistently strong long term earnings growth," Chief Executive 
Manuel Perez de la Mesa said in a statement.  For 2007, Pool forecast earnings of $2.00 to $2.10 per 
share, below Wall Street estimates of $2.15.  The 2007 forecast represents long term organic earnings per 
share growth of 15 percent plus the accretive benefits of 
already completed acquisitions and share repurchases, the 
company said.  De la Mesa said the industry witnessed some softness in new 
pool construction in the latter part of 2006. He said the 
company would likely realize more 2007 earnings growth relative 
to 2006 in the second half of the year.  The company also said it expects 2006 cash flow from 
operations to be about $70 million for the year, despite the 
negative impact of a $27 million payment for estimated federal 
tax charges that were deferred from the second half of 2005 as 
allowed by the (Hurricane) Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act of 
2005.
