 LONDON  (Reuters) - EMI Group Plc EMI.L ousted its two top music executives on Friday and announced plans to cut costs, after poor Christmas sales prompted a profit warning that sent its shares down over 10 percent. 

 EMI, which had pinned its hopes on new releases from artists such as Robbie Williams and a new Beatles album compiled by veteran producer George Martin, announced its latest restructuring in the face of falling market share, poor scheduling and the growth of digital music. The world's third-biggest music group said Alain Levy, chairman and chief executive of EMI Music since 2001, and David Munns, vice chairman of EMI Music, would leave immediately. Eric Nicoli, who has been executive chairman of EMI Group since 1999, becomes group chief executive officer and will take direct responsibility for managing EMI Music. "We have now had seven consecutive years of decline in the recorded music market," he told a conference call, adding that EMI needed to strengthen its position in digital music sales. EMI shares, boosted throughout 2006 by regular takeover speculation, fell over 10 percent in early trading to 237-3/4p before improving slightly to 248-1/4p by 1550 GMT. Analysts said the warning was likely to make the company vulnerable to a bid. The warning came almost two months after EMI said it expected to hit its full-year targets thanks to a strong second-half release schedule from the likes of Williams, Norah Jones and Joss Stone. On Friday, it said annual revenues at its music business were instead likely to fall between 6 percent and 10 percent on a constant-currency basis. LOUSY COMMUNICATOR "Industry music sales have been weak, but even so it looks like EMI has lost significant market share," said analyst Simon Wallis at brokerage Collins Stewart. "One year's poor result does not mean that EMI Recorded Music is rotten and worthless. It is more a poor reflection on management's ability to set an appropriate cost base for their business and manage their release schedule." Most analysts Reuters spoke to were not convinced that Nicoli was the right man to head the music division as he was widely seen as more of a "business man" than a "music man". One music analyst who asked not to be named said EMI had failed in the last year to match the success of larger rival Universal, which regularly sees its artists in the top 10 of music charts around the world. EMI has said its digital music -- which is replacing some of the declining sales of CDs -- represented 9.4 percent of its music division revenue, compared to the industry average of 11. "EMI Music's second-half performance to date, in terms of revenues and profits, has been below prior expectations," EMI said. The company also unveiled plans for 110 million pounds ($213 million) of annual cost savings, including an unspecified number of job cuts. Nicoli said 85 percent of the cost savings would come from its recorded music business, with the rest from publishing and the vast majority coming from the "non-creative end" of the business. He did not expect its dividend policy to change. EMI said over half the 110 million pounds of planned annual cost savings would be delivered in the year ending March 31, 2008, and the full amount in the following financial year. It said the restructuring was likely to disrupt the start of its new financial year and would cost no more than 150 million pounds. EMI has been at the center of bid speculation for several years but has repeatedly failed to clinch a deal under Nicoli. It rejected a bid approach in December that a source familiar with the situation said was from private equity group Permira PERM.UL and has been locked in a takeover battle with rival Warner Music WMG.N over the past six years. "These valuations now look like wishful thinking and leave management struggling for a plausible strategy," said Bridgewell Securities analyst Patrick Yau of the private equity bid rumored to be over 310 pence a share. Hopes of a deal between Warner and London-based EMI were quashed in June when a European court annulled approval of the 2004 merger of Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T ) Sony Music and Bertelsmann's BERT.UL BMG. The ruling cast doubt on whether an EMI-Warner deal would get regulatory clearance. "Errors like this give strength to private equity bidders to argue to run EMI," analyst Wallis said. "Meanwhile could Nicoli want to take the company private and do a (management buyout)?" (Additional reporting by  Robert MacMillan  in New York)
