 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) on 
Friday labeled as "desperate" a lawsuit by PR Newswire accusing 
it of trademark infringement by mimicking the name of its press 
distribution business. 

  In a lawsuit filed Thursday, PR Newswire contended Nasdaq 
made a "calculated attempt to trade off of the goodwill" 
associated with PR Newswire by renaming Primezone Media 
Network, which the stock exchange bought in September, 
PrimeNewswire.  Nasdaq pledged to defend itself vigorously against PR 
Newswire's claims, calling the lawsuit "a desperate attempt to 
prevent greater customer choice, enhanced competition and lower 
costs in the newswire services business."  PR Newswire filed its lawsuit with the U.S. District Court 
for the Southern District of New York.  Other major press release services include Business Wire, a 
unit of Warren Buffett's insurance and investment company 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( BRKa.N )( BRKb.N ).
