 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) is exploring strategic options for its Boston Market casual chicken restaurant chain, a spokesman said on Friday. 

 Boston Market employees were told on Thursday that McDonald's was going to review its options about continued ownership, a spokeswoman said. "We are beginning to look at potential options and will explore our alternatives during 2007," said McDonald's spokesman Walt Riker in an e-mailed statement. "No decisions have been made whatsoever and therefore it is absolutely inappropriate to speculate," he added. The news was first reported by the Chicago Tribune. Riker said the company's priority was its namesake hamburger chain. McDonald's, the world's largest restaurant company, acquired Boston Market in 2000 for $173.5 million as part of a diversification strategy that included buying a controlling interest in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. ( CMG.N ), which it spun off last year. McDonald's shares were down 23 cents at $44.28 on the New York Stock Exchange in morning trading.
