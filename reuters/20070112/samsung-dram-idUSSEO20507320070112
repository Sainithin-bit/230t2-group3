 SEOUL  Jan 12 (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd.
( 005930.KS ) expects most of its businesses in the first quarter
to improve from a year earlier, despite seasonal weakness, an
executive said on Friday.  Samsung, the world's biggest maker of memory chips, expects
a "very strong" market for dynamic random access memory (DRAM)
chips in the first quarter, Chu Woosik, senior vice president
of investors relations, told a conference call.  For NAND flash memory, Chu expected a seasonal slowdown in
the first quarter but solid pricing in the second half of the
year.
