 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) will begin to 
extinguish next week the brand of cellphone operator Cingular, 
built up with billions of dollars over a few years, to imprint 
its more-than-century-old name firmly across its services. 

  AT&T, which took full control of No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier 
Cingular with its $86 billion purchase of BellSouth Corp. last 
month, will launch on Monday a campaign to mark the change.  "We did not enter that decision lightly," Wendy Clark, vice 
president of advertising at AT&T, said in an interview. "We 
came to understand that consumer customers and business 
customers alike are looking for a single provider. We heard it 
so consistently across the marketplace."  In its first stage, Cingular will share its orange logo of 
a bouncing jack with the AT&T globe logo on everything from 
television ads to sales uniforms and monthly bills.  AT&T's name and logo will eventually replace Cingular in a 
process expected to take several months, with the exact timing 
determined as more customer feedback comes in, Clark said.  But with its long and complicated history, AT&T may face 
customer confusion over its name, marketing experts said. Also, 
Cingular built up a reputation among younger customers who may 
not easily associate with the AT&T brand.  At stake are AT&T's efforts to promote its bundle of phone, 
Internet and video services against a growing number of rivals, 
including cable operators and Web providers.
  EXPENSIVE BRANDS  One new ad will portray a familiar Cingular image -- grain 
harvesters mowing a field to represent "bars" showing maximum 
cellphone reception. But in a new take, the harversters will 
change direction and mow the AT&T globe out of the stalks.  "It's a tough proposition," said Hayes Roth, chief 
marketing officer at brand agency Landor Associates. "Multiple 
brands within any company is expensive. Arguably they don't 
have much choice, they've made a stand now that they've 
invested back in the core brand."  Cingular spent nearly $1 billion on media advertising in 
the first nine months of 2006, up from about $920 million in 
the same period during 2005, according to the latest data from 
tracking firm TNS Media Intelligence.  For the remainder of their businesses, AT&T spent nearly 
$600 million on media ads in the nine-month period, while 
BellSouth spent just over $100 million, TNS said.  AT&T has said about 20 percent of operating cost savings in 
the BellSouth merger will come from lower advertising costs.  The new AT&T was formed in the merger of SBC Communications 
and AT&T Corp. in late 2005. Adding to the mix, in late 2004 
Cingular bought AT&T Wireless, eradicating that brand for its 
poor reputation among customers.  "The good news is there is a difference between AT&T and 
AT&T Wireless," Clark said. "We have benefited significantly 
... by having 12 months under our belt as the new AT&T."  AT&T ad agencies include Omnicom Group's ( OMC.N ) GSD&M and 
BBDO.
