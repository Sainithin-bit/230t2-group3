 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Advanced Micro Devices ( AMD.N ) fell more than 10 percent on Friday after the computer chip maker forecast quarterly revenue below market expectations amid a price battle with larger rival Intel Corp.( INTC.O ). 

 AMD shares dropped $2.09 to $18.09 in early trade as several analysts downgraded their recommendations due to the company's earnings warning late on Thursday. The company said that it expected fourth-quarter revenue to rise about 3 percent from the third quarter, implying revenue of about $1.37 billion. In mid-October, Wall Street analysts had on average forecast fourth-quarter sales of $1.44 billion, excluding revenue from graphics chip maker ATI which AMD acquired later the same month. Citing lower average prices for its chips, AMD said fourth-quarter operating income, excluding acquisition-related charges and other items, would be substantially lower than in the third quarter. Among investment firms downgrading their views on AMD, Morgan Stanley cut its rating to "underweight" from "equal-weight" due to the earnings warning and said it expected the shares to slide sharply in Friday trading. Goldman Sachs cut its price target on AMD shares to $16 from a previous $19 with a "sell" rating. Shares of rival Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), the world's top chipmaker, fell 22 cents, or 1 percent, to $21.70.
