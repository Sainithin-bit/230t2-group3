 LONDON  (Reuters) - BP Plc ( BP.L ) Chief Executive John Browne will step down at the end of July, 17 months earlier than planned, the oil giant said on Friday, ending months of uncertainty about future leadership of the company. 

 Browne, will be succeeded as CEO by Tony Hayward, one of the favorites for the role, who is currently head of the exploration and production unit, BP's core division. The move follows a spat between Browne and chairman Peter Sutherland last year, analysts said, when Sutherland pressed Browne to name a firm date for his retirement, originally expected in early 2008. Browne, who was credited with turning a troubled BP in the early 1990s into one of the most respected companies in the industry, announced last July that he would leave at the end of 2008, and he decided a successor would be named early this year. "Having made that decision, which the board fully supports, we came to the conclusion that a six month handover would be more appropriate," Chairman Peter Sutherland said in a statement on Friday. Browne joined BP in 1966 and was appointed CEO in 1995, after previously running the exploration and production (E&P) division. He led a round of industry consolidation with takeovers of U.S. oil companies Amoco and ARCO in the late 1990s, and BP is now the world's third-largest western oil company by market capitalization. Until recently, Browne was seen as a visionary in the oil business for his takeovers and his environmental record. BP was among the first oil companies to acknowledge global warming and invested huge sums in renewable energy. But problems in the United States, including a string of fatal accidents at a Texas refinery and sloppy maintenance of a key oil pipeline in Alaska, have tarnished his image. Investors were also concerned that a long handover period could lead to stagnation at BP, with difficulty in pushing through major new initiatives. SHARES RALLY Shares in BP closed in London up 1.8 percent at 546-1/2 pence and were later up around 4.5 percent in New York. The stock lost almost 8 percent in 2006, underperforming a sector index .SXEP that rose slightly. "I see it as positive news," Jason Kenney, oil analyst at ING in Edinburgh, said. "They had a difficult choice because there were a number of positive people who could have taken over the role". "The fact that Tony Hayward has got it will enable BP to move forward and put the succession debate behind them and get on with the job," said Kenney, who has a 'Hold' rating on the stock. Hayward, who joined BP in 1982, was appointed to the main board in 2003, becoming CEO of BP's exploration and production business. "He was the most probable option, so it doesn't come as a surprise," said Stephane Foucaud, analyst at Societe Generale in London. "If I had bet, I would have bet on him. He comes directly from the E&P side of the business -- E&P is the most important side of the business, so he has worked very closely with Lord Browne," Foucaud added.
