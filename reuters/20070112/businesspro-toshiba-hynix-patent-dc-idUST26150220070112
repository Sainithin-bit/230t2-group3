 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Toshiba Corp. ( 6502.T ) said on 
Friday it had sued South Korea's Hynix Semiconductor Inc. 
( 000660.KS ) in a U.S. court over two patents on NAND-type flash 
memory chips, the latest in a string of suits and countersuits. 

  Toshiba said it filed the suit on January 9 at the federal 
court in San Francisco claiming Hynix infringed patents related 
to the design and circuitry of the chips, used in digital 
cameras and portable music players such as Apple Inc.'s 
( AAPL.O ) iPod.  The two companies have been locked in legal disputes since 
Toshiba, the world's No. 2 NAND chip maker, first sued Hynix in 
November 2004 after the companies failed to extend a 
cross-licensing agreement.  Last November, a U.S. International Trade Commission judge 
dismissed Toshiba's suit seeking to stop U.S. imports of Hynix 
flash memory chips.  That same month, another judge dismissed a countersuit by 
Hynix to halt Toshiba imports. Both decisions are subject to 
review by the full trade commission.
