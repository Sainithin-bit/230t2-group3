 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) reported on Friday an 8.5 percent drop in its quarterly net profit, hurt by lacklustre shipments of flash memory chips and falling prices of flat screens. 

 Samsung, the world's top memory chip maker and the third-largest mobile phone producer, earned 2.35 trillion won ($2.50 billion) in net profit for the quarter ended December 31, compared with 2.56 trillion a year ago. The result was in line with the 2.34 trillion won forecast by 29 analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates. Following are some reactions from fund managers: KIM YOUNG-JUN, ANALYST, DAISHIN SECURITIES "The LCD division showed better-than-expected results while semiconductors did not do as well as anticipated. But overall, the results are not bad. "LCDs are likely to be weak in the first half, but it won't be as low as last year. For NAND as well, the first half looks to be weak due to seasonal results, but 2007 will be better compared to last year as supplies are expected to tighten. "Conditions for DRAM are likely to improve after May and April considering seasonal factors." - - - - JAE H. LEE, ANALYST, DAIWA SECURITIES "I believe Samsung will be regaining momentum around the third quarter. LCDs seem to probably be weak in the first half, but profits should be improving in the second half. "Also, if you look at NAND flash, usually there is weak seasonality in the first half. With NAND and LCD combined, it will probably be supporting higher profits in the second half. "Samsung seems to be bullish about the (DRAM) market outlook. It is a matter if PC manufacturers will increase the DRAM content despite the high prices. If it slows, I guess they will have to cut the prices." - - - - KIM YUNG-MIN, FUND MANAGER, SH ASSET MANAGEMENT "There's some worries about mobile phones. Samsung is struggling against competitors in the mobile phone sector such as Motorola MOT.N, and now some people are worried about Apple's ( AAPL.O ) iPhone. "LCD prices are likely to continue falling. In terms of memory chips, we expect new applications will boost demand in NAND flash in the second half of this year."
