 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy ordered Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) to halt work on one of its two littoral combat ships due to significant cost overruns, the service said on Friday. 

 The Navy said Lockheed's work would be stopped for 90 days while costs are reviewed. The Navy would not disclose how much costs had climbed. Lockheed, the top U.S. defense contractor, is building the first and third of the Navy's littoral combat ships, designed for closer-to-shore missions, while General Dynamics ( GD.N ) is building the second and fourth. Lockheed won the $198 million contract in June to build the second ship. According to the Navy, work will be stopped on the second ship because of cost overruns on the company's first vessel. Lockheed Martin was not immediately available to comment.
