 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales were surprisingly strong last month as consumers snapped up large-screen TVs and other electronic products, a sign of economic resilience that poured cold water on the idea of interest rates dropping any time soon. 

 Retail sales rose by a larger-than-expected 0.9 percent in December and were even stronger than anticipated when autos were stripped out, suggesting consumers were willing to open their wallets despite slowing housing markets, a Commerce Department report showed on Friday. The seasonally adjusted December gain in retail sales, which covers the crucial holiday shopping season, was the largest since July. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 0.6 percent rise. A 1 percent jump in sales aside from autos, considered a more reliable indicator of core household spending, was well ahead of the 0.5 percent gain analysts were expecting. It was the sharpest climb since January of last year. Electronics and appliance stores posted a 3 percent gain in sales, propelled by high-end items such as video game systems and plasma televisions. However, November's sales data were revised down to a 0.6 percent gain overall from a previously reported 1 percent increase, and excluded autos to a 0.7 gain from an earlier reported 1.1 percent rise. "Consumers are hanging in there surprisingly well despite the beating they are getting from home values and inability to extract home equity values," said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. Stocks ended the day higher, with the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closing at a record high, as strong retail sales underscored a robust economic outlook. U.S. Treasury debt prices tumbled, sending yields to their highest since late October, as the data supported the view that the Federal Reserve will not cut interest rates soon. The dollar gained after the data but fell later in the day on profit taking. The Fed has kept benchmark interest rates steady at 5.25 percent since June and has remained focused on inflation risks. Fed officials have forecast that economic growth at a slower pace than the economy's full potential will reduce inflation to more comfortable levels. Analysts said warm weather, lower gasoline prices and low unemployment spurred consumer enthusiasm. "It seems that everything we heard about flat screen television sets is certainly true. The possibility of a Fed rate cut in the first quarter has melted away along with everything else on the East Coast," said Mark Vitner, a senior economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Short-term interest rate futures contracts showed markets now expect the Fed to cut rates only once in 2007. In December, markets had been betting on three quarter rate cuts this year. Another report emphasized some inflation risks remain. Prices of imported goods jumped a stronger-than-expected 1.1 percent in December, with much of the increase from higher petroleum costs. When oil was excluded, import prices rose a strong 0.4 percent. Retail sales for all of 2006 advanced by 6 percent from 2005, the smallest year-over-year gain since a 4.3 percent increase in 2003, the government said. Sales at auto and parts dealers were up 0.3 percent in December after a revised unchanged reading in November, which was originally reported as a 0.9 percent gain. Sales at gasoline stations rose 3.8 percent, while sales at furniture and home furnishing stores also increased. Meanwhile, sales at building material and garden supplies stores declined 1.1 percent, reflecting the housing slowdown. A separate Commerce Department report showed that business inventories rose a higher-than-expected 0.4 percent in November and business sales were up 0.5 percent.
