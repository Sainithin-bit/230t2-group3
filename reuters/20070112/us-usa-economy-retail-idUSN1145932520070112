 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales accelerated by a larger-than-expected 0.9 percent in December and were even stronger than anticipated when autos were stripped out, suggesting consumers were optimistic despite slowing housing markets, a government report showed on Friday. 

 The December gain in retail sales, which covers the crucial holiday shopping season, was the largest since July. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 0.6 percent rise. A 1.0 percent jump in sales aside from autos, considered a more reliable indicator of core household spending, was well ahead of the 0.5 percent gain analysts were expecting and it was the sharpest climb since January of last year. "Consumers are hanging in there surprisingly well despite the beating they are getting from home values and inability to extract home equity values," said Christopher Low, chief economist at FTN Financial in New York. However, November's sales data were revised down to a 0.6 percent gain overall from a previously reported 1.0 percent increase and to a 0.7 gain from an earlier reported 1.1 percent rise when autos were excluded. U.S. Treasury debt prices fell and the dollar gained after the data, which some analysts said pointed to stronger economic growth in the fourth quarter than previously thought. Some analysts had said an earlier-than-usual Thanksgiving holiday in November may have drawn some sales strength away from December and that the growing prevalence of gift cards could push some of December's normal holiday spending into January, a further suggestion of consumer spending resilience. Sales for all of 2006 advanced by 6 percent from 2005, the smallest year-over-year gain since a 4.3 percent increase in 2003, the Commerce Department said. Sales at auto and parts dealers were up 0.3 percent in December after a revised unchanged reading in November, which was originally reported as a 0.9 percent gain. Sales at gasoline stations rose 3.8 percent, while sales at electronics and appliance stores, furniture and home furnishing stores also increased. Meanwhile, sales at building material and garden supplies stores declined 1.1 percent, reflecting a slowing housing market. A separate Labor Department report showed U.S. import prices gained a stronger-than-expected 1.1 percent in December on a rebound in petroleum prices. It was the biggest monthly increase since May 2006 when import prices rose 1.8 percent, the Labor Department said.
