 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines Corp. NWACQ.PK on 
Friday said holders of its current shares will not receive any 
payments under the carrier's plan to exit bankruptcy in the 
second quarter. 

  The company said under the plan it will cancel its common 
and preferred stock, when it emerges from bankruptcy.  Northwest said it may raise exit financing via an equity 
rights offering. The No. 5 U.S. carrier may also raise equity 
capital from one or more private equity investors.
