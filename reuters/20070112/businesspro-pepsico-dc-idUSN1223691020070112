 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) said on Friday 
that it will roll out a new advertising campaign beginning in 
February that will include new package graphics for Pepsi-Cola 
that change every few weeks. 

  The worldwide campaign, which is aiming to attract teens 
and young adults with images of sports, music, fashion and 
cars, will involve changing the look of Pepsi Cola bottles and 
cans more than 35 times this year, the beverage company said.  By contrast, Pepsi Cola's look has only changed 10 times 
over the last 109 years, the company said.  There will also be interactive online promotions, such as 
inviting consumers to help design a Pepsi billboard ad that 
will run in New York City's Times Square in April.
