 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Dolan family raised its bid for Cablevision Systems Corp. by $1.1 billion on Friday, saying it was the "best and final offer," but the company's shares fell as investors were unimpressed by the bid. 

 The Dolans, who own about 20 percent of Cablevision's ( CVC.N ) common stock representing 70.4 percent of voting power, raised their offer for all the outstanding shares of the New York cable operator to $30 per share from $27. The bid values the company at $8.9 billion and expires on January 17. Cablevision shares fell 4.1 percent to end at $28.39, after hitting a year-high of $30.50 on Wednesday. The stock has risen nearly 25 percent since the Dolan's bid in October. "The shares are down because investors were hoping for a bid of around $31 or $32," said Tom Eagan, an analyst at Oppenheimer. He believed the board would nonetheless approve the bid and he did not expect another bidder to make a significantly higher offer in the near term. But Richard Greenfield, an analyst at Pali Research, said it was "virtually impossible" for the Cablevision board to approve a bid of less than $31 to $32 per share. "We continue to believe that CVC deserves a valuation premium to its industry peers based on its stronger earnings growth, more valuable underlying systems (demographic driven), and a strong likelihood of a Time Warner Cable takeover attempt over the next 12 to 18 months," he wrote in a note on Friday. Industry analysts have long speculated that, once taken private, Cablevision would soon be sold on to a larger operator, such as Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) or Comcast Corp.  ( CMCSA.O ) But the Dolans said they had no intention of selling and were willing to discuss contractual provisions to that effect. In a letter to the special committee, the Dolans said taking the company private would give management more latitude to cope with an increasingly competitive marketplace with telecommunications companies offering video services. The family offered in 2005 to take only Cablevision's cable operations private and spin off other assets, but a committee evaluating the deal balked at the price and blocked it. Cablevision also owns the Madison Square Garden sports arena and the New York Knicks basketball team. Cablevision said its special committee is reviewing the revised bid and would be giving no further comment. The Dolans said the new price represents a value per subscriber of about $4,750 and argued the premium compared favorably with other cable companies that have gone private, including Cox Communications Inc. and Insight Communications. Craig Moffett, an analyst at Bernstein Research, said the offer was no better than market multiples for cable. "The Dolans' offer cites a cable valuation of $4,750 per subscriber, or just 7.2 percent above our current estimated value of Comcast video subscribers ($4,430 per subscriber)," he wrote in a note. He said Cablevision has a markedly higher average revenue per user and earnings before interest tax, depreciation and amortization per subscriber than Comcast, the largest U.S. cable operator. Cablevision Chairman Charles Dolan and his son and CEO James Dolan said in the letter they will use their stake in Cablevision, valued at around $1.8 billion, plus additional funds from debt and preferred equity financing from Merrill Lynch & Co. and Bear, Stearns & Co, to finance the bid.
