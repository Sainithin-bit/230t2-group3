 BOSTON  (Reuters) - A top executive at General Electric Co ( GE.N ) said on Tuesday the world's industrial economy remains "pretty good," orders have risen so far through the third quarter and he reiterated the company's profit forecast. 

 "The broad industrial economy is still pretty good for the activity we see," Keith Sherin, vice chairman and chief financial officer, said at a meeting with financial analysts monitored via the Web. Sherin said GE was sticking by its profit forecast of 54 cents to 56 cents per share for the third quarter and $2.18 to $2.23 for the year. Higher expenses related to its pullback from some consumer-finance operations have been offset by gains from the sale of its plastics unit, he said. Analysts, on average, expect GE to report third-quarter profit of 55 cents per share, and full-year profit of $2.21 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sherin said major equipment orders have been up 40 percent in the quarter, with services orders up 9 percent. The U.S. conglomerate has businesses ranging from manufacturing jet engines to commercial lending. "The global consumer continues to perform pretty well," Sherin said. "We're watching what's going to happen with the U.S. consumer." Sherin said GE expects to complete its exit of the subprime lending market by the end of the year. The company in July said it would sell its WMC Mortgage unit, which made loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. "We've made a decision to get out, we're taking the hit and we're exiting this," Sherin said. GE expects to face $300 million to $400 million in after-tax costs related to exiting that business, he said. GE is also pulling sharply back from the Japanese consumer-finance market and has placed its GE Money Japan operations on the block. On the commercial-lending side, he said GE has not seen delinquencies rise even amid the recent credit-market turmoil. "We're seeing a re-pricing of risk, which is good news for us," he said.
