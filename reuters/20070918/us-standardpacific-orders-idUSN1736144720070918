 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Standard Pacific Corp ( SPF.N ), which builds homes in the once-hottest U.S. markets, said on Monday net new orders in July and August rose 20 percent, with those in California nearly doubling. 

 Still, the company sees additional impairment charges in the third quarter because of the deteriorating U.S. housing market. Analysts warned the rise may not indicate a rebound in homebuilding demand. They said higher sales may have been driven by increased incentives -- which would result in lower profit margins -- and were also a reflection of easier year-ago comparisons. Company officials did not return calls for comment. California, Florida, Nevada and Arizona, historically the company's largest markets, led the U.S. housing boom in the early to mid 2000s. They have seen some of the most rapid declines in demand. Although orders were up in the first two months of the quarter versus a year earlier, orders in the same period of the third quarter in 2006 were 58 percent lower than in 2005. Net orders in California rose nearly 100 percent in the July and August period and were up 42 percent in Arizona. But they were off 24 percent in Florida, 5 percent in Texas and 13 percent in the Carolinas. When the company reported full third-quarter earnings in 2006, consolidated net new orders fell 58.4 percent to 1,200 units. In California, net new orders in the third quarter of 2006 were 252, down 70 from 839 in 2005. The cancellation rate for the two-month period in 2007 was 33 percent compared with 51 percent in the year-earlier period. But it was greater than 28 percent in the second quarter of 2007. Standard Pacific's share price has tumbled over 50 percent in the last three months on growing signs of problems in the U.S. housing market.
