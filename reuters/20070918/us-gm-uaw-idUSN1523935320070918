 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and the United Auto Workers union on Monday broke off negotiations for the night and agreed to return to the bargaining table on Tuesday morning, a GM spokeswoman said. 

 The talks adjourned for the day around 9 p.m. ET , GM spokeswoman Katie McBride said. The top U.S. automaker and its major union have been locked in nearly nonstop bargaining talks since Friday, when the UAW's current contract expired. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki )
