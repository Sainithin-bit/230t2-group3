 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street widely expects the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut short-term interest rates on Tuesday, which would be its first policy move since June 2006, when it raised rates to cap a two-year rate hike campaign. 

 In its most closely watched meeting this year, the Fed is expected to cut the benchmark federal funds rate, now at 5.25 percent, by at least 25 basis points. A report earlier this month showing a surprise drop in U.S. payrolls in August sealed such expectations at a time when speculation the Fed might cut rates already was running high as global credit dislocations hurt financial markets. Analysts say the Fed may also take additional measures to provide liquidity to the markets since a tightening in global credit conditions surfaced in mid-August. It could cut the discount rate, currently at 5.75 percent and further ease lending conditions. Following are some factors Fed policy-makers are considering: MARKETS/CENTRAL BANK ACTION Credit disruptions surfaced shortly after the Fed's last rate-setting meeting in early August, as banks scrambled to procure funds after troubles in the U.S. mortgage market hit European banks. Central banks reacted by pumping massive liquidity into the money market -- the Fed injected a total $38 billion on August 10, the largest amount since shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks. In the ensuing financial market turmoil, the Fed cut its discount rate -- the rate the central bank charges on loans -- by 50 basis points to 5.75 percent on August 17. That was aimed at encouraging banks to borrow at the discount window and cap a rise in the federal funds rate. The European Central Bank held off from raising rates in August. Before the current credit market turmoil, it had been expected to raise rates. The Bank of England last Friday offered lender of last resort facilities to British mortgage bank Northern Rock after the home loans firm became the latest casualty of the ongoing global credit market crunch. The Bank of Japan will hold a policy-setting meeting on September 18-19, where it will likely hold off from raising rates to assess the impact of global market turmoil. ECONOMY Monthly hiring contracted in August for the first time in four years. U.S. employers cut 4,000 jobs in August, compared to economists' forecast for a median 110,000 gain in payrolls. Retail sales in August rose a smaller-than-expected 0.3 percent in August and sales excluding automobiles fell 0.4 percent, the sharpest drop since September 2006. Consumer sentiment was steady in early September. The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers' preliminary September figure on consumer sentiment was 83.8, slightly above forecast. The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) survey showed U.S. manufacturing expansion slowed in August. The index of national factory activity eased to 52.9, its lowest since March and down from 53.8 in July. The ISM's services index was unchanged in August at 55.8 from July. Industrial production rose by a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in August. HOUSING Housing starts fell 6.1 percent in July to their lowest in more than 10 years while building permit activity, a sign of future construction plans, sank to a nearly 11-year low. Pending home sales plummeted 12.2 percent in July as credit tightened amid troubles in the housing and subprime mortgage sectors. The National Association of Realtor's Pending Home Sales Index fell to 89.9, the lowest reading since September 2001. Total existing home sales fell 0.2 percent in July to a 5.75 million unit annual rate. U.S. construction spending fell 0.4 percent to $1.169 trillion in July against a 0.1 percent gain in June. INFLATION The price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy costs rose 1.9 percent year-on-year in July. U.S. import prices unexpectedly fell 0.3 percent in August, marking the first decline since the start of the year as petroleum costs retreated. OTHER U.S. crude oil futures prices surged in September, hitting a record above $80 a barrel. Gold rose to a 16-month high on Monday to around $719. U.S. non-farm worker productivity grew at a slightly faster-than-expected 2.6 percent annualized pace in the second quarter, the highest since the third quarter of 2005, and labor costs rose a more moderate 1.4 percent. RECENT COMMENTS Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, on August 31: "The Federal Reserve stands ready to take additional actions as needed to provide liquidity and promote the orderly functioning of markets. It is not the responsibility of the Federal Reserve -- nor would it be appropriate -- to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions." San Francisco Fed president Janet Yellen, on September 10: "I see significant downward pressure based on recent data indicating further weakening in the housing sector and the tightening of financial markets." Fed "Beige Book" summary of economic conditions, on September 5: "Outside of real estate, reports that the turmoil in financial markets had affected economic activity during the survey period were limited.
