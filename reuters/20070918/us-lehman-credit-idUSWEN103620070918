 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N executives said on Tuesday the worst of the credit correction is over, barring any unforeseen circumstances. 

 The U.S. investment bank, which reported a third-quarter profit that beat expectations, also said issues in the asset-backed commercial paper market still need to be resolved. Lehman executives made their comments during a conference call with analysts. Lehman said its liquidity position is stronger than ever as it faces only a small amount of debt maturing in the near term. The company also faces little refinancing pressure. Lehman, which shut down subprime lending operations, said it ended the third quarter with $1.6 billion in junk-rated interest in residential mortgage securitizations. Of that amount, $230 million was related to risky subprime loans. Amid market volatility, Lehman's valuations on leveraged loans took more than $1 billion in hits during the quarter.
