 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home builder sentiment fell for a seventh straight month in September as tougher mortgage requirements hindered sales from bloated inventories, the National Association of Home Builders said on Tuesday. 

 The NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market index declined 2 points to 20, matching the record low of January 1991 when the economy was in the throes of a recession, the NAHB said in a statement. But an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve on Tuesday offered the industry hope, the NAHB's chief executive said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the index would fall to 20. Readings below 50 mean more builders view market conditions as poor than favorable. A two-year slump in U.S. housing has created excess inventories of unsold new homes, forcing builders to cut prices and offer incentives to boost sales. Sales have been curbed further since July as skittish investors cut back sharply on mortgage-related investments that finance most home loans. "Certainly problems across the mortgage finance arena are taking their toll on buyer demand, which is weighing heavily on builder confidence measures," NAHB Chief Economist David Seiders said in the statement. The NAHB's index measuring sales expectations for the next six months declined 5 points to 26 in September, the lowest since the association began collecting data in January 1985. The index of current sales fell to 20 in September from 22 in August, and the gauge of prospective buyers was unchanged at 16, the NAHB said. The availability of mortgages for home buyers has diminished, but loans are still available, Hovnanian Enterprises Inc ( HOV.N ) Chief Executive Ara Hovnanian told investors at a Credit Suisse conference on Tuesday. Hovnanian resorted to cutting prices as much as $100,000 last weekend with its "Deal of the Century" promotion, which he said generated 10 times the usual sales volume. Home builders including Beazer Homes USA Inc ( BZH.N ) have also been lobbying the Fed to buttress the housing market by lowering its key interest rate, as central bankers did after a meeting on Tuesday. Lower rates would encourage buyers in addition to promotions, which have trimmed Beazer inventory by 26 percent over a year, Beazer Chief Executive Ian McCarthy said at the Credit Suisse forum. The Federal Open Market Committee lowered its federal funds target rate by a half-percentage point to 4.75 percent, more than most traders expected, in a move to protect the economy from financial market disruptions. "We applaud the recognition on the part of the Fed that they needed to take a bold move," said Jerry Howard, chief executive of Washington-based NAHB. "This has potential to have significant impact on the housing markets," initially through lower rates on short-term adjustable-rate mortgages, he said. Lower short-term rates may soften the impact of scheduled rate resets on existing ARMs, which have been contributing to foreclosures that are pressuring home prices, he said. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index <.DJUSHB. rose 4.8 percent to 405.67 after the Fed rate cut, nearly doubling the gain in the broader Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI . The home construction index this week has climbed 10 percent from a 52-month low of 364.81 on Friday. (Additional reporting by Nick Zieminski and  Ilaina Jonas )
