 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. fed funds target rate could fall as low as 3 percent as the Federal Reserve continues to ease monetary policy to shore up growth, Bill Gross, chief investment officer at Pacific Investment Management Co said on Tuesday. 

 "I think what the U.S. economy needs is somewhere in the 2-1/2 to 3 percent real rate of growth. We are down in the 1 to 2 percent category," Gross told CNBC television. "It's going to take interest rates at 1 percent real ... that means somewhere in the 3 percent category. I wouldn't go as low as 3 percent, but 3 to 3.25 percent fed funds rate target looks very real." Gross also said that European central banks would likely be forced to cut interest rates due to housing bubbles in the U.K., Ireland, Spain.
