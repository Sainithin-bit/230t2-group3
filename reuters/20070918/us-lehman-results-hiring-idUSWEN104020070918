 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N expects to reduce its headcount in the fourth quarter, but expects to hire again next year, the company's chief financial officer said on Tuesday. 

 On a conference call, Lehman CFO Chris O'Meara said the fourth-quarter reductions would come mainly from previously announced mortgage-related layoffs. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
