 DETROIT  (Reuters) - United Auto Workers President Ron Gettelfinger has told local unit presidents the union had made progress in negotiations with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ), but may need to set a firm deadline if talks don't accelerate, sources said on Tuesday. 

 Gettelfinger and UAW Vice President Cal Rapson, who is leading the union negotiations with GM, sent letters to the local leaders on Monday that said several key issues remained to be resolved, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the talks are private. Negotiators from the UAW and GM resumed talks on Tuesday morning.
