 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Foreclosure filings rose 36 percent in 
August from July and 115 percent from a year ago, hit by 
declines in once-hot housing markets such as California, Nevada 
and Florida, according to a report released on Tuesday. 

  RealtyTrac's U.S. Foreclosure Market Report found the 
number of foreclosure filings in August -- default notices, 
auction sale notices and bank repossessions -- was 243,947, the 
highest since it began its monthly report in January 2005, just 
months before the housing boom peaked.  That translates into one foreclosure filing in August for 
every 510 households, also a high for the RealtyTrac report.  "The jump in foreclosure filings this month might be the 
beginning of the next wave of increased foreclosure activity, 
as a large number of subprime adjustable rate loans are 
beginning to reset now," James Saccacio, RealtyTrac's chief 
executive, said in statement.  The number of bank repossession filings rose dramatically, 
pumping up the month's foreclosure numbers, Saccacio said.  Nevada again posted the highest state foreclosure rate, 
with one filing for every 165 households. The state reported 
6,197 foreclosure filings in August, a 21 percent rise from 
July and more than triple the number reported in August 2006.  California's foreclosure rate jumped to the second highest 
among states, with a 48 percent month-on-month spike in 
foreclosures. The state reported 57,875 foreclosure filings in 
August, or one for every 224 households, more than twice the 
national average.  Florida's foreclosure activity jumped 77 percent from the 
previous month, with the foreclosure rate jumping from seventh 
highest to third highest. Florida reported 33,932 foreclosure 
filings, one for every 243 households.  Rounding out the top 10 for foreclosure rates were Georgia, 
Ohio, Michigan, Arizona, Colorado, Texas and Indiana.  In terms of absolute numbers of foreclosure filings, after 
California and Florida, Ohio registered the third-highest state 
total, with 17,793 foreclosure filings in August, or one in 
every 281 households.  Texas, Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Colorado, Illinois and 
Nevada all reported more than 10,000 foreclosure filings for 
the month.  California accounted for six of the top 10 metro area 
foreclosure rates in August. Modesto was hardest hit, with one 
foreclosure for every 79 households, followed by Stockton and 
Merced. Other California cities in the top 10 included 
Vallejo-Fairfield, Riverside-San Bernardino, and Sacramento.  Detroit saw one foreclosure filing for every 87 households, 
giving it the fourth-highest metro foreclosure rate, which was 
more than five times the national average. Also in the top 10 
were Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Las Vegas, and Cleveland.  (Reporting by  Ilaina Jonas )
