 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kroger Co ( KR.N ), the largest U.S. grocer, on Tuesday posted a greater-than-expected 28 percent increase in quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast, sending its shares up nearly 7 percent. 

 The company said it had been able to pass on higher product costs to customers, which helped lift gross margin to 23.94 percent from 23.47 percent. Food companies and other manufacturers have been increasing prices on a range of products due to soaring ingredient and raw material costs. "A lot of people were worried that inflation would take a bite out of their margins, but it looks like they were able to pass substantially all of the inflation through," said Morningstar analyst Mitchell Corwin. Kroger said earnings rose to $267.3 million, or 38 cents a share, in the second quarter that ended August 18 from $209 million, or 29 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had forecast profit of 34 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 6.6 percent to $16.1 billion, while analysts had forecast $16 billion. Sales at stores open at least five quarters increased 5.1 percent, excluding fuel sales. Kroger has been improving customer service, remodeling stores and promoting items like fresh produce as it has battled pressure from rivals ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), warehouse clubs, drugstores, dollar stores and natural foods chains such as Whole Foods Market Inc WFMI.O. For the year, Kroger raised its earnings forecast to a range of $1.64 to $1.67 a share from a prior outlook of $1.60 to $1.65. Analysts on average forecast $1.66, according to Reuters Estimates. Kroger shares rose $1.80, or 6.7 percent, to $28.82 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock is up about 25 percent this year, compared with a 4.4 percent increase for the Standard & Poor's 500 index  .SPX .
