 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Tuesday declined to comment on the Fed's half percentage point cut in interest rates to 4.75 percent. 

 "I have chosen not to speak about monetary policy," he said during an interview on Fox News television. "Let's just let them do what they think is right," he urged.
