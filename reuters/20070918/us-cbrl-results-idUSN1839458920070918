 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBRL Group Inc ( CBRL.O ), parent of the Cracker Barrel restaurant chain, on Tuesday reported lower quarterly earnings, hurt by a higher income tax rate, which was partly offset by the benefit of an additional week in the latest quarter. 

 The company said separately that its chief financial officer, Lawrence White, will retire on February 1 next year, and that it will start looking for a successor immediately. Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended August 3, was $27.8 million, or $1.13 per share, compared with $35.8 million, or $1.03 per share, a year ago. The company had about 25 million shares outstanding in the latest quarter, down from about 36 million a year earlier. Total revenue rose 12 percent to $632.1 million. The company said it expects to earn $3.05 to $3.20 a share in fiscal 2008, on revenue from continuing operations that is expected to rise about 4.5 percent to 5.5 percent from fiscal 2007.
