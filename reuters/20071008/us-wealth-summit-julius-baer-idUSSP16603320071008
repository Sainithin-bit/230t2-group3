 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Swiss wealth manager Julius Baer ( BAER.VX ), which set up its Asian operations just a year ago, expects the region to account for 10-20 percent of its global business in three to five years, a senior executive said on Monday. 

 The growth in Asia's private banking business has been "north of 30 percent," Wilfried Kofmehl, Julius Baer's chief executive of private banking for Southeast Asia, said at the Reuters Wealth Management Summit. "All the relationship managers have performed above our expectations," he added. Kofmehl also said Julius Baer, which currently has 240 employees in Singapore and Hong Kong, expects to add another 100 staff by 2010-2011. Julius Baer opened offices in Singapore, Hong Kong and Dubai last year to expand its business outside of Europe. Singapore, which acts as the bank's regional centre for Southeast Asia, also functions as the booking centre for Asia. The bank is considering opening a second Asian booking centre in Hong Kong, Kofmehl said. Private bankers manage assets out of many cities but often "book" the business only in jurisdictions where their clients are protected by tough banking secrecy laws. Julius Baer's move to expand beyond its European base began in 2005 when a new management team came abroad. Kofmehl, 41, joined the bank from UBS ( UBSN.VX ) about a year ago. Kofmehl said the profile of Asian private banking clients may change in coming years as the region's tycoons hand over the reins of their businesses to their children, many of whom were educated in top universities in the West. The younger generation may be open to new forms of investments, unlike their parents who have a trading bias and prefer investing in foreign exchange and equities and equity-linked structured products. Julius Baer competes with global giants, including Swiss rival UBS -- the world's biggest wealth manager -- as well as Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Citigroup ( C.N ) and HSBC ( HSBA.L ). Julius Baer currently has about 170 billion Swiss francs of private banking assets under management, Kofmehl said. Singapore, which has a population of 4.7 million people, saw the fastest increase globally in the number of high-net-worth individuals last year, according to the annual World Wealth Report by Merrill Lynch and Capgemini. According to the report, the number of people in the city-state with more than $1 million in financial assets excluding their homes rose 21.2 percent in 2006 to 66,660. Shares of Julius Baer have gained nearly 15 percent in the last month amid a recovery in financial stocks as investors bet that the worst of a global credit crunch was over.
