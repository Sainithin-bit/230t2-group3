 PARIS  (Reuters) - Financial regulators are partly to blame for the knock-on effects of this year's crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage market, according to a French business school study published on Monday. 

 The study by the EDHEC business school said pending European Union rules on insurers could make matters worse and urged regulators to re-think their approach to complex financial instruments. Regulators' reliance on information requirements, codes of conducts and certificates of aptitude had "fostered an illusion of confidence" between suppliers of complex financial products and investors, the study concluded. "Trying to protect investors from themselves, without the means to do so, is probably the greatest risk of regulation," the study said. "After the crises of 1998 and 2001...the emphasis on international codes of conduct for the use of credit derivatives...as well as the severity of new rules put forward by domestic regulators have likely fostered institutional investors' misplaced confidence in the ability of regulators to protect them from credit risk." It said the European Union's Solvency II directive for insurers and draft new accounting standards would make matters worse by putting less emphasis on the impact volatility can have on portfolios. "This summer's crisis is but an early warning. Institutional investors may have resorted en masse to the securitization of subprime loans, derivatives thereof, and structured debt products, but it was above all because these products offered attractive returns and low volatility," it said.
