 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marsh & McLennan Cos Inc ( MMC.N ) reinsurance unit Guy Carpenter said on Monday there was "no basis" for the Connecticut attorney general's antitrust lawsuit that alleged it illegally inflated prices for insurance consumers across the United States. 

 Guy Carpenter said in a statement the lawsuit was based "on a fundamental misunderstanding of reinsurance facilities," and that it plans to defend itself vigorously against the claims. (Reporting by  Lilla Zuill )
