 PARIS  (Reuters) - Business Objects BOBJ.PA BOBJ.O, which agreed to a $6.77 billion buyout offer from Germany's SAP ( SAPG.DE ), was approached by several potential buyers, its chairman and founder said on Monday. 

 "We were solicited by several partners. As I said we never started an auction process," Bernard Liautaud told a news conference on the friendly offer. "Business Objects never decided to put itself up for sale. .... SAP made its approach in July and from then on discussions accelerated in the last weeks," he added. The world's leading business software maker, SAP said on Sunday it would acquire Business Objects for a total $6.8 billion. The 42 euros ($69) per-share offer represented a 20 percent premium over Business Objects' closing price on Friday.
