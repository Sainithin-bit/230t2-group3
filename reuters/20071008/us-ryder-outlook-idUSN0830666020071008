 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Ryder System Inc ( R.N ) cut its profit forecast on Monday saying that softness in the U.S. economy has spread beyond the housing sector, sending the truck leasing and logistics company's shares down more than 6 percent. 

 "Economic conditions have softened considerably in more industries beyond those related to housing and construction," Ryder said in a statement. The announcement also hit the share prices of other publicly traded truck operators and pulled the Dow Jones Transportation Average .DJT down nearly 1.5 percent. Ryder cited less-than-expected demand in its commercial rental product lines and lower prices for used vehicles. Ryder's commercial rental business fluctuates with market demand and is more directly affected by a soft market than Ryder's long-term rental operations. So far, most U.S. trucking companies -- which are always the first to benefit from an economic uptick as well as the first to be hurt when growth slows -- have said market weakness has mostly been restricted to the housing sector and the automotive industry. The U.S. trucking sector has been hit by weak volumes since the third quarter of 2006, with some analysts describing this slowdown as a "freight recession." Ryder said on Monday it expects earnings of $1.12 to $1.14 a share for the third quarter before one-time items, down from its earlier forecast of $1.20 to $1.23. Analysts had forecast earnings per share for the quarter of $1.21, according to Reuters Estimates. The company also said it would have a $10 million gain from the sale of property, and $12 million in restructuring charges related to the elimination of some 300 jobs. Including one-time items, it expects third-quarter profit of $1.09 to $1.11 per share. The company lowered its 2007 earnings forecast to $4.10 to $4.15 a share before special items, down from its prior view of $4.30 to $4.35. Analysts on average had predicted full-year EPS of $4.31. "Despite (Ryder's) downward estimate revision, second half 2007 earnings are still flattish year-on-year, outpacing other cyclical transports," R.W Baird & Co. analyst Jon Langenfeld wrote in a research note. Baird lowered its target price on Ryder stock to $56 from $62, but maintained its "outperform" rating on the company, citing its "contractual business model, ability to participate in a freight upturn, and valuation." "Cyclical transports generally move ahead of improving fundamentals," Langenfeld wrote. The U.S. housing market has slowed markedly over the past two years amid higher interest rates and cooler demand. Investors have been watching closely for any sign of slowing in the broader economy. Miami-based Ryder last cut its full-year earnings outlook when reporting earnings in July. Chief Executive Greg Swienton said at the time it was based on what customers were saying and not an "illogical hope" of recovery in the second half of 2007. Most trucking companies at that time were saying that a market recovery was still possible in the second half. In New York Stock Exchange trading, Ryder shares were down $3.18, or 6.46 percent, at $46.07. The shares, which were as high as $57.70 in August, touched a new 52-week low of $45.44. Shares in YRC Worldwide Inc ( YRCW.O ), North America's largest trucking company, were down 85 cents, or 3.02 percent, at $27.29; J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc ( JBHT.O ) stock slid 96 cents, or 3.55 percent, to $26.11; and Con-Way Inc ( CNW.N ) fell $1.56, or 3.34 percent, to $45.17.
