 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices fell nearly 3 percent on Monday as part of a wider drop in commodities due to a recovery by the U.S. dollar against other major currencies. 

 U.S. crude futures settled down $2.20 at $79.02 a barrel after dipping as low as $78.35. London Brent crude fell $2.32 to $76.58 a barrel. "The stronger dollar is hurting commodities across the board, and for oil there is also a sense that the worst of the hurricane season has passed, and so that is adding to the weakness," said Mike Zarembski, senior commodities analyst with optionsXpress in Chicago. The dollar firmed after a report showed September U.S. jobs growth was the best since May, easing concern about an imminent recession in the world's top energy consumer.  Metals prices also fell on Monday as the stronger dollar prompted investors to reduce positions. Some investors have also bought crude and other commodities in recent weeks as a hedge against the weaker dollar, which has hit multiyear lows against other major currencies. Further pressure came on easing concerns about the Atlantic hurricane season, which officially runs through November but which peaks in August and September. Thirteen named storms have been tracked in the Atlantic this year, but no significant damage has been done to oil and gas infrastructure. Oil prices hit a record high of $83.90 a barrel on September 20, after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates in a bid to calm credit markets, sending the dollar lower. Concern that OPEC's decision to increase oil production by 500,000 barrels per day starting November 1 would not be enough to meet fourth quarter demand has also helped push prices higher. Ecuador on Monday announced it plans to join OPEC officially when the group next meets as part of efforts by President Rafael Correa to revive the flagging oil industry of South America's No. 5 producer.  PRICE CONCERNS The new executive director of the International Energy Agency, which represents 26 developed nations, warned high prices would eventually hurt consuming nations' economies. "If the prices are going very high, certainly, it has a negative effect on the economy," said Nobuo Tanaka in an interview.  However, Tanaka stopped short of calling on OPEC to further increase production and said the IEA was still evaluating the impact of the subprime credit crisis on oil demand growth. A poll of analysts ahead of weekly U.S. oil inventory data, to be released a day late on Thursday due to the Columbus Day holiday, forecast a 600,000 barrel build in crude stocks, a 600,000 barrel draw in distillates and a 100,000 barrel fall in gasoline inventories.
