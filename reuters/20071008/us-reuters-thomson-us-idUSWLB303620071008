 LONDON  (Reuters) - Reuters Group RTR.L said on Monday the U.S. Department of Justice will give its decision on the proposed takeover by Canadian financial information company Thomson Corp TOC.TO by January 15. 

 Reuters and Thomson said in a joint statement that they would continue to work with the European Commission after it said it would open an in-depth antitrust investigation into the deal. The companies said they expect the second phase of the European regulatory review to be completed in the first quarter of next year.
