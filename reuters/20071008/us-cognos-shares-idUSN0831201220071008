 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Cognos Inc COGN.O shares climbed 9 percent on Monday on speculation that the Canadian software maker could be an acquisition target, after news that a rival, Business Objects BOBJ.PA, would be acquired by SAP ( SAPG.DE ). 

 German software giant SAP ( SAP.N ) said on Sunday it would pay about 4.8 billion euros ($6.8 billion) for Franco-American software maker Business Objects BOBJ.O, which competes with Cognos CSN.TO in selling business-intelligence programs that companies use to mine mountains of data to detect and analyze trends affecting their business. Shares of Cognos, Canada's biggest software maker, rose $3.88 to $48.33 in morning Nasdaq trade. Canadian exchanges were closed for a national holiday. Mark Murphy, an analyst with Broadpoint Capital Inc., said in a note to investors that SAP's agreement to buy Business Objects increases the chances that Cognos will be acquired in the next 12 to 18 months. Cognos would be the last major independent maker of business intelligence software after SAP acquires Business Objects. Oracle Corp ORCL.O bought another key player, Hyperion, in April for about $3 billion. Murphy said he believed SAP beat out several other companies in the bidding for Business Objects. He said several companies would be interested in buying Cognos. "We estimate Cognos could fetch $57 to $65 per share," he said. The analyst raised his price target on the stock to $54 from $50 and rates it "buy." He has a "neutral" rating on Business Objects. Cognos officials could not be reached for comment. Oracle and Hewlett-Packard Co ( HPQ.N ) declined comment on whether they were involved in the bidding for Business Objects. International Business Machines Corp ( IBM.N ) could not be reached.
