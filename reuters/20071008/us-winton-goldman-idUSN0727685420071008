 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A fund set up by investment bank Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) has bought a 10 percent stake in Winton Capital Management, a London-based hedge fund that manages $10 billion, the Financial Times reported on its Web site on Sunday. 

 The Goldman fund, managed by former banker Jonathan Sorrell, bought the stake in July, according to the FT. The sale price was unknown, the FT reported, but similar deals have valued hedge fund managers at between five and 17 percent of assets, which would put Goldman's stake between $50 million and $170 million. Goldman Sachs and Winton Capital Management could not be immediately reached for comment.
