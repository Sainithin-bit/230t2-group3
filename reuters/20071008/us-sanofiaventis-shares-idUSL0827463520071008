 LONDON  (Reuters) - Shares in French drugs company Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) rose as much as 3 percent in a weaker market on Monday on market talk that Pfizer ( PFE.N ) was looking to buy stakes from Sanofi's major shareholders. 

 Oil company Total ( TOTF.PA ) and cosmetics firm L'Oreal ( OREP.PA ), which jointly own about 23 percent of Sanofi's share capital, have previously made it clear they do not consider their stakes strategic. Companies involved were not immediately available to comment. Total said in August that it would sell its 13.12 percent stake in Sanofi-Aventis progressively. L'Oreal said in June the sale of its 10.6 percent stake in Sanofi was not imminent and said its position had not changed after Sanofi won a U.S. patent trial on its blockbuster bloodthinner drug Plavix. On Monday, shares in Total were down 0.3 percent and L'Oreal rose 0.4 percent. Pfizer shares were 0.6 percent weaker. (Additional reporting by  Ben Hirschler )
