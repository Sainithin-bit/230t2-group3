 LONDON  (Reuters) - Emerging economies have had to use some unconventional policy tools to slow loan and money supply growth, but overall the gamble seems to be paying off as they wait for the West to start tightening monetary conditions. 

 For months the developed world's zero-interest rate policies have unleashed waves of yield-seeking capital and inflation onto emerging economies, pushing up their currencies and jeopardizing exports. But fearful of hurting still-fragile growth or abetting further currency strengthening, emerging market central banks have balked at using the most potent policy tool in their arsenal -- interest rate hikes. Instead, many, facing soaring loan and liquidity growth, have responded with measures such as upping banks' reserve requirement ratios. This have been dubbed quantitative tightening, the flipside of quantitative easing in G3 states. The hope was that these moves would allow them to get away with as few rate rises as possible, at least as long as the West stays in zero-interest rate or money-printing mode. So has the quantitative tightening worked? "If you look at Chinese inflation and PMI data, you can argue things have slowed, so the measures seem to be working to some extent," said Phil Poole, head of global and macro strategy at HSBC Global Asset Management. "But what they are really doing is buying time. The expectation is, developed markets' monetary policy won't be loose forever." Reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) force banks to deposit more cash with central banks rather than use it to make loans. Users include China, Russia, India, Brazil, Peru, Indonesia, Poland, Taiwan, Israel, Malaysia and Turkey, which raised its ratio further on Wednesday. In China, money supply growth and economic activity has slowed to pre-2009 levels, and while Brazil's inflation is high, loan growth has eased. Israel, which put higher reserve ratios on accounts dealing FX derivatives, has seen the shekel fall. Poole said reserve ratios are more effective when used in conjunction with rate rises, as in China or Brazil. The litmus test will be Turkey, the only one to cut rates even as it raised reserve ratios. It has had some initial success though, and the measures have helped check the lira's surge versus the dollar. COMPLEX TOOLS Still, the efficacy of these steps is often limited. Reserve requirement ratios don't work on their own as banks, keen to lend to credit-hungry borrowers, simply borrow to acquire funds, or sell some domestic bond holdings. Both these will ultimately drive up short-term domestic interest rates. Interest rate rises on the other hand directly contract money supply by discouraging borrowing and encouraging saving. "In practice, if RRRs are effective they push up short-term interest rates. So you can't raise RRRs too far without doing what you were trying to avoid in the first place," said Kasper Bartholdy, head of emerging markets research at Credit Suisse. In fact, UBS economists argue in a recent note that only China has achieved significant monetary tightening via reserve ratios, while Peru, Brazil, Indonesia and Turkey have only managed to bring skyrocketing base money growth back to emerging market norms. The price of short-term interbank funds has held steady in these countries despite reserve ratios, UBS said. But rates in China zoomed up as the central bank reeled in excess liquidity. Hiking ratios also burdens the banking sector as the cost of sterilizing money supply is effectively moved to banks from the government. This is most evident in Turkey where bank stocks have fallen more than broader equity markets this year. Investors are most pessimistic over Turkey as it has coupled its substantial reserve ratios with rate cuts to deter hot money. Up to $10 billion may have fled Turkey, weakening its currency, while after Wednesday's reserve move, liquidity amounting to 40 billion lira will have been drained from the market. But investors see the rate cuts as entrenching inflation and reckon the 20-25 percent loan growth target remains elusive. "Brazil and China have been able to get away with it as central bank credibility is reasonably strong. In Turkey the risk is the central bank is relying on this for too long and not hiking rates," said UBS strategist Manik Narain. "If you rely on RRRs exclusively, markets will fear the tightening is lacking decisiveness." But the momentum for reserve requirement ratios may soon start petering out. "(Quantitative tightening) was an essential response to the fact that most emerging markets are importing liquidity from the developed economies," said Manoj Pradhan, chief EM economist at Morgan Stanley. "As long as QE is not renewed, emerging markets will get some relief from liquidity inflows." While Pradhan warns G3 monetary policy will still be very accommodative, the crucial issue is euro zone and UK interest rates will rise soon. U.S. rates will go up in 2012 but the Fed should wrap up its $600 billion bond-buying program by mid-year, making huge capital inflows less of a risk. And above-target inflation almost everywhere will force central banks to step up the pace of rate rises and tolerate some currency strength. Also, with reserve ratios already at 20 percent in Brazil and China, raising them further may be tough. Still, these ratios have served as an effective stopgap, which is probably what emerging policymakers had hoped for. ""The use of RRRs in emerging markets is only a short-term palliative," HSBC's Poole said. "It won't change the use of interest rates as the primary tool of monetary policy."
