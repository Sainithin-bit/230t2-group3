 (Reuters) - Following is a roundup of the impact of this month's devastating earthquake and tsunami on Japanese manufacturers of cars and electronics. 

 Plant shutdowns in Japan threaten supplies to manufacturers across the globe of items from semiconductors to car parts. Japanese companies are not only reeling from damage to factories and suppliers in quake-hit northeastern Japan but are also suffering from fuel shortages nationwide and power outages in the Tokyo area that are affecting production, distribution and the ability of staff to get to work. AUTO MAKERS * Toyota Motor Co halted operations at 18 factories that assemble Toyota and Lexus vehicles in Japan, resulting in lost production of 140,000 vehicles. A further seven plants making parts and engines were also affected. From March 28 the carmaker plans restart production of three hybrid models: the Prius, Lexus HS250h and CT200h. It will, however, delay the launch of the Prius wagon and minivan models in Japan from the original plan for the end of April. On Monday the firm begin making car parts at plants near its base in Toyota City, central Japan, for overseas assembly facilities. It resumed making parts last week for service centers to repair vehicles already on the road. * Honda Motor Co extended its production halt in Japan to April 3. On Monday, Honda said a fifth of its Japan-based Tier 1 suppliers affected by the earthquake would take more than a week to recover. Honda made 69,170 cars in January in Japan, accounting for around a quarter of its production. On Thursday the company said it will resume production of motorcycles and power products at its Kumamoto plant in Kyushu, southern Japan. * Nissan Motor Co resumed vehicle production at all assembly plants in Japan from Thursday, March 24, while supplies last. It resumed production of parts for overseas manufacturing and repair parts on March 21. Restoration continues at its damaged Iwaki engine factory in Tochigi prefecture, north of Tokyo. Nissan made 81,851 cars in January in Japan, where it manufactures 23 percent of its vehicles. Goldman Sachs has calculated that one day's lost production costs Nissan about 2 billion yen ($25 million) in profit. * Mazda Motor Corp said on Thursday it would suspend production of vehicle repair parts and parts for overseas production at its Hofu factory in Yamaguchi on March 28, after having resumed limited operations there earlier this week. Tts Hiroshima factory will continue limited production until further notice, a spokeswoman said. * Suzuki Motor Corp said its three car assembly factories in Japan will remain closed on Friday, but the firm will operate an engine factory using parts in its inventory. It has not decided on production plans for next week and beyond. * Fuji Heavy Industries Co said all five of the car and parts-related plants for its Subaru-brand vehicles in Gunma prefecture, north of Tokyo, will be shut at least until Monday, pushing back a restart that had been due to start on Tuesday. Production of vehicle parts to be shipped to overseas manufacturing plants started on Wednesday and production of vehicle repair parts began Thursday. ELECTRONICS MAKERS: * Sony Corp said shortages of parts and raw materials would force it to suspend or reduce production at five plants in central and southern Japan making digital cameras, camera lenses, flat-screen televisions and other goods. Another plant may be affected by rolling power blackouts. Six production sites in northern Japan have been halted since the quake. If shortages continue, Sony may consider temporarily shifting some production overseas. * Toshiba said output was suspended at a factory in Iwate prefecture making system LSI chips for microprocessors and image sensors, with no time frame yet for a resumption of output. An assembly line at a plant making small liquid crystal displays for smartphones and other devices will be closed for a month to repair damaged machinery. * Canon said all of its domestic camera production would remain suspended at least until Friday, citing difficulty obtaining parts. * NEC said it restarted production on Wednesday at all its four quake-hit plants in northeast Japan, which include factories making communications equipment, routers and switches. * Nikon Corp said it was still working to restore four production facilities damaged in the quake, including two of its precision equipment plants. Nikon does not have a timetable to reopen the plants. The effect on cameras and lenses is seen as minor, since they are mostly produced in Thailand. * Panasonic said it still had no timetable for restarting production at manufacturing facilities in northern Japan halted by the quake, including plants making optical pickups and other electronic parts, digital cameras and audio equipment. None has been badly damaged, but infrastructure needs to be restored before manufacturing can resume, it said. * Renesas Electronics, the world's No.5 chipmaker, said production at three of its 22 factories in Japan is still halted while output at three other assembly plants has been affected by power outages imposed by utilities unable to meet electricity demand in the wake of the earthquake. OTHERS * Shin-Etsu Chemical, the world's leading maker of silicon wafers, said two of its plants near the worst-hit areas remained offline. The firm has not said when it will restart operations. Some of the wafers made in Japan are shipped to chip companies overseas. Shin-Etsu is trying to boost production elsewhere, particularly of 300-mm wafers, to make up the shortfall. * Jamco, a Japanese company making galleys for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, has said delivery could be delayed if gasoline becomes more scarce.
