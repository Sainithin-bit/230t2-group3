 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - A collapse of the euro currency was not "unthinkable" if it comes under too much strain, billionaire investor Warren Buffett told CNBC on Thursday. 

 "Enough of a strain could cause it to fall apart," Buffet told the news channel. "I know some people think it is unthinkable, I don't think it is unthinkable." (Reporting by  Matthias Williams ; Editing by Aradhana Aravindan)
