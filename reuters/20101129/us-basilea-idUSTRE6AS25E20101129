 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) must pay former Swiss partner Basilea ( BSLN.S ) about $130 million for breaching a license agreement for a superbug antibiotic, a Dutch arbitration tribunal has ruled. 

 The Swiss biotech group, which was developing ceftobiprole with the U.S. healthcare company, said on Monday the amount awarded included lost milestone payments as well as damages. Earlier this year, Johnson & Johnson ended a partnering deal with Basilea, returning the rights to ceftobiprole to Basilea after European and U.S. authorities decided not to back the drug, citing doubts about how reliable the results of the trial were. Johnson & Johnson, which acted as Basilea's drug sponsor, was in charge of the trials for ceftobiprole, but health authorities said these had not been done in compliance with good clinical practice. Johnson & Johnson was not immediately available for comment on the ruling by the Netherlands Arbitration Institute. "We are very pleased that we can gain full control and development and commercialization of ceftobiprole at the latest by February 2011," Basilea Chief Executive Anthony Man said. "It's our priority to make this drug available to patients as soon as possible," Man told Reuters. SHARES UP, TAKEOVER TARGET? At 1045 GMT, shares in the group, which is worth some $648 million and had revenues of about 27 million Swiss francs ($26.92 million) in 2009, were trading 2.4 percent higher, adding to the 5.2 percent gained so far this year. "Even though we had been expecting that the arbitration would rule against J&J, today's announcement comes as a positive surprise to us," Helvea analyst Olav Zilian said in a note. "This awarded payment of about $130 million compares to about 100 million francs in lost milestone payments for approval of ceftobiprole in the USA and Europe, and possibly some 15 million francs in costs for the arbitration on Basilea's side, as we speculate," Zilian said. Basilea Chief Financial Officer Ron Scott said the drug still had "significant" sales potential, but he declined to name the group's peak sales estimate. "The medical need has not changed. There are people who are dying in hospitals because of these infections," Scott said. There has been market speculation that larger Swiss biotech group Actelion ( ATLN.VX ), itself the subject of takeover talk, may be interested in buying Basilea. The two companies work together in Canada, where they have a distribution agreement for Basilea's eczema treatment toctino. Asked about being a potential takeover target, Scott said the company did not disclose discussions it had with other groups. "We are certainly aware of the assets that we have and that there aren't very many assets like those around." Zilian said the award ruling made Basilea more appealing. "It is definitely much more attractive in view of the cash it has on its balance sheet versus its market cap," he said. (Editing by  Matthew Jones ) ($1=1.003 Swiss Franc)
