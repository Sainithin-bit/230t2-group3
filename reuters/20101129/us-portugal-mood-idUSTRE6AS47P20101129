 LISBON  (Reuters) - As Portugal struggles through an economic crisis, a mood of "saudade" is gripping many of its people. 

 The sentiment is a national characteristic -- a feeling of melancholy and resignation and a nostalgia for a past that always seems better than the present. "Saudade" is an essential element of fado, the mournful songs played in the bars of Lisbon's Bairro Alto at night. With the government imposing austerity measures and talk in markets that an internationally-funded bailout is needed to overcome a debt crisis, gloom prevails on the streets of the rain-swept capital at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean. "This all began two or three years ago," said Jorge Dias, owner of the Louie Louie record store in Bairro Alto. "The 90s were quite good. Before the euro came in, we were living better. You could eat very well, very cheaply." His store, which sells music from fado to African hip hop, was surviving, he said. But other businesses in the area had closed and restaurants were complaining of a drop in custom. Like other people, he had cut down on going out socially. People had to learn to live within their means, Dias said. "We have to try to get on with things. The country won't fall apart, we can survive. I don't know if we can survive well." This nation of 10 million people has been pushed into the frontline of the euro zone's battles with a 85-billion-euro bailout of debt-laden Ireland. Portugal's parliament approved an austerity budget on Friday which will slash public spending and raise taxes, hoping to cut a deficit of 7.3 percent of GDP. Prime Minister Jose Socrates says the measures can work and the country does not need a rescue package. But some economists advocate a Portuguese bailout to protect Spain, its bigger, brasher neighbor on the Iberian peninsula. While the euro zone could afford a Portuguese bailout, a rescue of Spain's much larger economy could imperil the whole currency zone. Spain is heavily involved in Portugal, from banks to trade, somewhat to the chagrin of the Portuguese. Unlike Ireland and Spain, Portugal never went through a spectacular boom which saw extravagant spending and lifestyles. It prospered moderately, particularly in comparison with the years following the 1974 Carnation Revolution which ended decades of dictatorship. There were also a few good years around the introduction of the euro in 1999, and EU money helped to build a fine road system and other infrastructure. But it had Europe's weakest economic growth rate and the lowest per capita income in western Europe. ALWAYS DIFFICULT "It is difficult. But it has always been difficult," said Fatima Rodrigues, aged 42. "Houses are expensive, cars are expensive, bringing up children is expensive." She earns about 1,000 euros ($1,315) per month driving the Elevador da Gloria, a funicular tram that whisks passengers up the side of one of Lisbon's many hills, and she works at other jobs to make ends meet. Asked what she thought of the government's handling of the situation, she said: "They do what they can. Nothing is perfect." Trade unions are less philosophical. A general strike last week shut down public transport, grounded planes, and hit some main services. Union posters on the walls urge people: "Struggle against robbery -- for the workers, the people and the country." Others may have different solutions. Portuguese have traditionally emigrated -- to Brazil, Africa, North America or elsewhere in Europe -- in search of opportunity in hard times. Tania Cristovao, a student smoking a cigarette outside a government service office, said she planned to leave the country when she finished her studies in six months' time. "I'm pessimistic. It's going to get worse. I have no confidence in this government," she said.
