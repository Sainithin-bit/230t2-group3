 TOKYO  (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Christian Noyer said on Monday he saw no reason to question a plan to fix Ireland's public finances as EU finance ministers unveiled a rescue package for the heavily indebted nation. 

 The EU approved an 85 billion euro ($115 billion) rescue for Ireland on Sunday and outlined a permanent system to resolve Europe's debt crisis, in which investors could gradually share the cost of any future default. Finance ministers from the 16-nation euro zone, anxious to prevent market contagion engulfing Portugal and Spain, unanimously endorsed an emergency loan package to help Dublin cover bad bank debts and bridge a huge budget deficit. "Europe has set up appropriate mechanisms with the IMF to support two countries who have taken tough measures to repair their public finances," Noyer said during a speech in Tokyo, referring to Ireland and Greece. "There is no reason to doubt the recovery plans of the two countries. They have the approval of the IMF." NOT A EURO CRISIS With anxiety rattling bond markets, the Irish government had been under intense pressure to accept a bailout despite repeatedly saying in recent weeks it did not need one. Initial reactions from market analysts to the EU moves ranged from sceptical to bleak. Noyer said the current crisis is not a crisis of the euro but a sovereign crisis. The euro fell to its lowest in two months against the dollar below $1.3200 on Monday as the market looked past the rescue package for Ireland to other euro zone economies and a euro zone crisis resolution mechanism. Noyer, also governor of the Bank of France, said there would be benefits in separating the accumulation of currency reserves from managing exchange rates because piling up reserves can harm economic policy. "The need for national reserves could be reduced if credible mechanisms exist to provide for the supply of official liquidity on a multilateral basis," Noyer said. "Hence, the current search for international safety nets which has taken first stage in G20." Finding ways to diversify countries' international reserves away from the U.S. currency is a key part of French President Nicolas Sarkozy's plan to sketch out a blueprint for a more stable monetary system during France's year-long presidency of the Group of 20 nations, which began this month. France is taking over the presidency of the G20 after the Seoul summit, at which developed and emerging nations agreed to a watered-down commitment to watch out for dangerous imbalances, yet offered investors little proof that the world was any safer from economic catastrophe. France is calling for ambitious plans to reform the international monetary order. China has also called for use of the IMF's Special Drawing Right as an alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency, but many experts are dismissive as they say the SDR is not a currency and only a synthetic in-house unit of account for the IMF.
