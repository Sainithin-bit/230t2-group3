 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) internet analyst Mary Meeker, once dubbed "Queen of the Net," has left the bank and joined venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. 

 After 20 years at Morgan Stanley, Meeker joins Kleiner Perkins as a partner based in Silicon Valley, the venture capital firm said in a statement. Meeker rose to prominence amid the boom in the 1990s when she was one of the first to cover companies such as Yahoo ( YHOO.O ) and Google ( GOOG.O ). Like other tech analysts, Meeker faced investor criticism when the internet bubble burst 10 years ago but unlike peers such as Henry Blodget, she was not charged with securities violations. "We look forward to working with Mary as a client," said Morgan Stanley executives Greg Fleming, Linda Reifler, Juan-Luis Perez and Stephen Penwell in an internal memo. Scott Devitt will take over coverage of the U.S. internet sector, according to the memo. A bank spokeswoman confirmed the contents of the memo.
