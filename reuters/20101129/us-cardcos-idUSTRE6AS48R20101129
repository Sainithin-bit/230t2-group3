 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Visa Inc and American Express Co will benefit from a partial rebound in consumer spending this holiday season, bolstered by a more financially secure American consumer, but MasterCard Inc may be left behind. 

 Visa, the world's largest credit and debit card processing network, could grab the lion's share of holiday spending via cards because of its wide acceptance at merchants and the fact that it has a larger debit card portfolio compared with smaller rival MasterCard, according to some analysts. "I don't think American Express will necessarily do poorly, nor will MasterCard... we just believe that Visa should be able to put out better results," said Michael Sansoterra, a portfolio manager of the RidgeWorth Large Cap Growth Fund. Sansoterra has investments in Visa and Capital One Financial Corp. High-income consumers could be key this holiday season as they are expected to spend more and indulge in big-ticket purchases -- something that could be key for American Express, which caters to a wealthier clientele. U.S. consumer sentiment is at its highest level since June, at 71.6, up from 67.7 in October, bolstered by signs of improved job conditions and early holiday sales, data from a Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan survey revealed earlier this month. "We think consumers are ready for a sentiment shift and some retail therapy, if only for the holiday season," S&P Equity Research said in a note on holiday sales forecast. Though a survey suggests only 12 percent of U.S. consumers would pay for their holiday gifts with a credit card this year, compared with 32.4 percent last year, Visa and MasterCard would benefit from both credit and debit card payments as these would in most cases have to pass through their networks for processing. "For the most part, everyone will use cash and debit cards this Christmas, I don't think you'll see a huge increase in consumer credit balances for this Christmas," said Alan Creech, a co-portfolio manager at the Marshall Large-Cap Growth Fund. Creech holds shares of Visa and MasterCard. The National Retail Federation is expecting 2010 holiday retail sales, which exclude online sales, to rise by 2.3 percent this year to $447.1 billion, compared with a rise of 0.4 percent last year. Top retailers Wal-mart and Target Corp are also optimistic about sales during the holiday season. BIG BUYS, BIGGER BITE Analysts say that the high-end spenders "are back" feeling more secure about their jobs and their financial position, and this season will see an increase in big-ticket purchases. "Most people tend to use their Visa card for normal purchases and their AmEx card for the travel and entertainment side of things," David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poors, said. And American Express' rewards program could be the factor that makes consumers prefer AmEx card to others. "Are they (high-end customers) going to put it on another card where they get no rewards? Most likely they're going to take out the Amex card," S&P equity analyst Rafay Khalid said. U.S. online holiday sales, estimated at an average of $858.49 per person, would see Visa and MasterCard raking in more cash. While options such as eBay's PayPal do exist, analysts say the bulk of the transactions would be processed by Visa and MasterCard. "I would definitely expect online sales to benefit Visa and MasterCard just because they're so broadly used online," said S&P equity analyst Zaineb Bokhari. Fashion jewelry, fur and electronic goods -- specifically tablet computers, smartphones, and e-Book readers -- would be most sought after this holiday season, S&P Equity Research said in a note on retail holiday forecast. Of the top 10 items for this Christmas, seven are electronics, including the iPhone and the iPad, which are expensive, said Alan Creech, a co-portfolio manager at the Marshall Large-Cap Growth Fund. STOCKS BATTLING REGULATIONS The strong holiday sales may not be enough to prop up share prices of the card networks. The shares have been on the decline through this year due to uncertainty over the impact of recent regulations on these companies. Visa stock, for instance, has seen an over 20 percent fall since its 52-week high of $97.14 in April on worries that the new law could cut deeply into the company's future profits. "The reason the stocks are not where they used to be is that although the economy is recovering, the government has stepped in," Susquehanna Financial's analyst James Friedman said. The debit card industry is now closely awaiting any word from the Federal Reserve, which has been given the task of defining exactly how fees will be imposed and any rules would be implemented. The new U.S. Dodd-Frank financial reform law will restrict the processing fees that Visa and MasterCard earn from debit card transactions. In October, both companies settled an antitrust lawsuit over their processing rules. (Reporting by Brenton Cordeiro; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)
