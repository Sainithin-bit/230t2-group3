 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell's Soup Co ( CPB.N ) has been having a tough time getting its soups from the store shelf to the home pantry. 

 Campbell's U.S. soup sales fell 8 percent during the usually strong late fall and winter months, the company said on Monday. While the economy remains weak, shoppers are being lured by other prepared foods such as frozen dinners, that may be promoted at lower prices. While Campbell's benefited during the worst of the recession as consumers ate at home more often, the second-quarter results raised questions about whether it could meet a lowered sales goal for the year and if it was doing enough to promote its biggest business. "The issue is not within soup, it's beyond soup, and we just have to lift our game up, which we will do," Chief Executive Douglas Conant said on a feisty conference call where analysts persistently posed questions about the soup business. "I don't want to have another call like this," Conant added. He also said that Campbell, whose brands include Prego pasta sauce and Pepperidge Farm cookies, would probably have changed its earnings guidance if it believed there were long-term issues in the soup business. Analysts on the call asked whether consumers might permanently be looking at lower-priced options other than ready-to-serve soup. "I just don't know whether you and your team are ready to deal with this if this isn't just a promotional issue, but a bigger challenge to, $3-plus per can for ready-to-serve soup versus whatever Kraft KFT.N is putting out Mac & Cheese at, for example," Deutsche Bank analyst Eric Katzman said. The world's largest soup maker saw an 18 percent drop in ready-to-serve soup sales in the second quarter that ended January 31. Campbell also reported flat sales in lower-priced condensed soup, but noted that trends were improving. The company's shares fell as much as 2 percent on Monday and are down 3.8 percent since it reported a decline in first-quarter soup sales in November. In that time, the Standard and Poor's 1500 Packaged Foods index .15GSPFOOD has gained 6.2 percent. MISSED THE "PROMOTIONAL BOAT" Earnings rose to $259 million, or 74 cents share, from $233 million, or 64 cents a share, a year ago. Analysts on average forecast 74 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 1 percent to $2.15 billion, falling short of a Wall Street forecast of $2.23 billion. Gross margin rose to 40.5 percent from 39.4 percent a year earlier, helped by improved productivity. Rival Progresso, which is owned by General Mills ( GIS.N ), has also seen some pressure on ready-to-serve soup as consumers choose not to pay more for the convenience. Conant told analysts that Campbell's Chunky soup was hurt the most during the quarter due to fewer promotions. He said the company was now ramping up those offers. "We just missed the promotional boat on Chunky in the second quarter," Conant said, adding that part of the reason was because retailers were interested in promoting other products during that time. The company cited evidence that shoppers may have bought condensed soup more as an ingredient for other recipes rather than to eat on its own. Soups such as Cream of Celery and French Onion, used in casseroles and other dishes, were better sellers in the category and the company noted recipes using "cooking soups" being downloaded from its website. Campbell last week cut its 2010 sales forecast to predict an increase of 2.5 percent to 3 percent and said it would overhaul the packaging and marketing of condense soup. But some analysts doubted whether Campbell could attain the lowered growth level. "This lowered sales guidance still seems a bit lofty after this quarter's weakness," J.P. Morgan analyst Terry Bivens said in a research note. Campbell's shares were down 54 cents at $33.39 on the New York Stock Exchange.
