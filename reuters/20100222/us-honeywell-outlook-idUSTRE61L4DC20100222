 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) believes its revenue could grow to a range of $41 billion to $45 billion over five years, as the world economy climbs out of a severe recession. 

 Chief Executive Dave Cote made that projection in a presentation to analysts on Monday, saying that the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics could see a rapid, or "V-shaped" recovery in some markets as customers stop cutting inventory. The $41 billion to $45 billion target, which the company could reach by 2014, would be well above the Morris Township, New Jersey-based company's most recent revenue peak of $36.56 billion, reached in 2008. Chief Financial Officer Dave Anderson affirmed Honeywell's previous 2010 earnings forecast of $2.20 to $2.40 per share, including charges related to its pension accounting. This year, Wall Street looks for full-year earnings of $2.38 per share on $31.82 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Honeywell's competitors include United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) in aerospace and building control systems, Goodrich Corp GR.N in aviation and DuPont Co ( DD.N ) in specialty materials.
