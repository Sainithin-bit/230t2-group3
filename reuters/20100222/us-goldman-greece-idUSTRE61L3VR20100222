 LONDON  (Reuters) - The transparency of financial instruments used by investment banks and governments to mask budget deficits in the past should have been better, a director at Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) said on Monday. 

 Goldman Sachs Managing Director Gerald Corrigan, a former president of the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said currency swaps entered into by his bank and Greece helped reduce that country's budget deficit, but the instruments were not uncommon at the time. "With the benefit of hindsight ... in the particular cases going back to the late 1990s and early 2000s that the standards of transparency could have been and probably should have been higher," Corrigan told a panel of UK lawmakers. Goldman earlier on Monday defended the cross-currency derivatives it conducted for Greece in 2001, which reduced the country's debt. The nine-year old swaps have re-emerged after several months of concern about Greece's budget and debt levels. "It is true that a family of currency swaps that were entered into jointly by Goldman Sachs and Greece in the late 1990s and early part of 2000s were of a nature that they did produce a rather small but nevertheless not insignificant reduction in Greece's debt to GDP ratios at that time," Corrigan said. But he said the transactions were consistent with and comparable with the standard of behavior and measure used in Europe at the time. "There was nothing inappropriate," he said.
