 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's Mazda Motor Corp does not plan to launch a special marketing campaign to draw customers away from Toyota Motor Corp in the wake of Toyota's massive global recalls, Mazda's chief financial officer said. 

 Kiyoshi Ozaki told Reuters in an interview that Mazda has not seen much of an impact from Toyota's recalls of more than 8 million vehicles globally. The recalls have been centered on the United States, where Mazda holds a 2 percent market share. "Our U.S. sales representatives have reported that some customers are taking a wait-and-see stance. But I don't expect a direct impact because our clients favor the unique features of our cars and are different from Toyota's clients," Ozaki said. Ozaki said Mazda would look to boost transparency internally about possible product defects and accelerate the company's response to problems. "I think these are the two most important tasks, as there will never be zero possibility of a product defect," Ozaki said. (Reporting by Yumiko Nishitani)
