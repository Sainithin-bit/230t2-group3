 LONDON  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) said a glitch on its Turquoise cross-border share trading platform may have happened under "suspicious circumstances," forcing it to delay the adoption of the same technology for its main trading system. 

 Turquoise, a pan-European multilateral trading facility, was down for two hours early on Tuesday. "Human error was to blame for the disruption that began at 0823 (GMT) this morning," the LSE said in a statement. "Preliminary investigations indicate that this human error may have occurred in suspicious circumstances." The company said it had started a full internal investigation and that it had informed the relevant authorities. The Financial Services Authority, Britain's industry watchdog, declined to comment. LSE chief executive Xavier Rolet is keen to migrate its main order book trading platform Sets to new technology that is already in use by Turquoise, to make it faster and more attractive to high-frequency trading firms that generate huge volumes. But Tuesday's incident "coupled with necessary network upgrades" had now forced the stock exchange to postpone until next year the change which was slated to happen this month. "The London Stock Exchange Group will work in partnership with customers to agree a date as early and practicably as possible in 2011," the company said. The glitch is the second at Turquoise in less than a month, after a problem with a network card forced the exchange to shut the system for over an hour on Oct 5. Last month's problem came just two days after Turquoise had moved across to the new technology platform, supplied by the LSE-owned software supplier MillenniumIT. The LSE had been using the Turquoise switch as a dry run for the subsequent migration of the main UK order book, and was set to announce its decision about the timing of the switch this week, a source close to the exchange has said. Some of the LSE's largest investment banks clients had asked it to postpone the move of the far larger Sets trading book after the October 5 glitch, arguing a repeat of the problem on a bigger scale would be far more serious.
