 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said on Tuesday he did not expect "overpowering results" from any policy easing the central bank adopts this week to try to revive the U.S. economic recovery. 

 The Fed is widely expected to resume purchases of longer-term Treasuries to inject cash into the economy following a two-day meeting that ends on Wednesday. Many analysts expect the Fed to announce a $500 billion buying program over about six months. "I don't look for any overpowering results of this action," Volcker, currently chairman of the Obama administration's Economic Recovery Board, said in Singapore as part of a dialogue on financial reform. He said a fresh injection of Fed cash into the economy could create a risk of inflation longer term, but "I don't think it's beyond the capacity of a central bank to deal with that problem... but they're going to have to deal with it." He was speaking at the National University of Singapore. (Reporting by Rachel Armstrong; Editing by Neil Fullick)
