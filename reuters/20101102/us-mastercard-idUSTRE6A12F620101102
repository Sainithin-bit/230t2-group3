 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc's ( MA.N ) third-quarter profit rose 15 percent and beat expectations as people outside the United States bought more things and switched more of their payments from cash to plastic. 

 The company's shares rose 3 percent by midday on Tuesday after MasterCard reported $1.43 billion in quarterly revenue. The company, which processes credit card transactions but does not lend directly to people, makes money every time someone buys something with a MasterCard credit or debit card. It was relatively insulated from the credit losses that banks suffered during the financial crisis, but its revenue faltered over the past two years as consumers spent less money. "The numbers were well ahead of expectations" and illustrated "a fundamental turn in their business," said Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of W.P. Stewart, which owns MasterCard shares. The company is cultivating new business in emerging markets. People in Asia, Europe and especially Latin America spent more money with MasterCard-branded credit and debit cards during the third quarter. MasterCard reported a 32 percent jump in debit card purchase volume growth outside the United States, meaning that many people who once relied on cash are starting to replace it with cards. Cross-border volumes also rose 15.4 percent from a year earlier, indicating that more people and businesses are spending money on travel and using their cards abroad. Chief Executive Ajay Banga told investors on a conference call that MasterCard is benefiting from domestic and cross-border business in Asia and Latin America where countries like India and Brazil "are showing good growth in domestic demand." He was cautious regarding the U.S. economy. Spending on U.S. MasterCards shrank slightly during the quarter, although much less than it did a year ago. "While the (U.S.) market is looking healthier than it did this time last year, the economy continues to show conflicting signals," Banga said. EXPANDING AND EMERGING The company has relatively few opportunities for growth in the United States, where rival Visa Inc ( V.N ) dominates the debit processing market and most consumers already use credit and debit cards. Banga, who took charge of MasterCard in July, is betting the company can grow more robustly in emerging markets like Asia and Latin America, where consumers still use cash more than plastic. Banga is investing in new types of technologies, including e-commerce and mobile payments. He said on Tuesday that MasterCard and a large U.S. bank partner will run a test program to let consumers pay for goods and services with their mobile phones. The test, which will start in the first quarter of 2011, follows similar programs this fall from Visa and its bank partners, including Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ). MasterCard, the world's second-largest credit and debit processing network, earned $518 million, or $3.94 per share, in the third quarter, compared with $452 million, or $3.45 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $3.54 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. REGULATION REASSURANCE Both MasterCard and Visa are facing increased U.S. regulatory scrutiny, which investors fear could cut into on future profits. The U.S. financial reform law will restrict the processing fees that MasterCard and Visa earn from debit card transactions. Last month, the companies settled a Justice Department antitrust lawsuit over their processing rules. But the law is expected to have a light impact on MasterCard, because of its small share of the U.S. debit market. MasterCard has even said the law could help it take some market share from Visa, because a provision in the law would end exclusive debit processing contracts. "That's a more positive scenario than what people are expecting on Visa," said Evan Staples, an equity analyst with First American Funds, which owns shares of both companies. MasterCard shares were up 3.0 percent at $246.05 by midday Tuesday. (Reporting by Maria Aspan. Editing by Derek Caney, John Wallace and  Robert MacMillan )
