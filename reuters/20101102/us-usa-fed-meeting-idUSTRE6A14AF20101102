 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday that was expected to lead to a decision to launch a fresh round of bond purchases to foster a more vigorous recovery and beat back deflation risks. 

 The central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee began meeting at 1 p.m., a Fed spokesman said. The Fed is expected to announce its decision at around 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT) on Wednesday. Financial markets expect the U.S. central bank to announce a new program to buy $500 billion in longer-term Treasuries over a period of about six months.
