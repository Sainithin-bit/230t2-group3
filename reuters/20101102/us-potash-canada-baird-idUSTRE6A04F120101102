 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Canada's Conservative government said on Monday it will not take a partisan approach when considering whether to approve BHP Billiton's $39 billion takeover bid for Potash Corp. 

 "The government won't take a partisan approach, it won't take a political approach," Conservative House Leader John Baird said in Parliament. "What we will do is follow our responsibilities under the Investment Canada Act. What we will do is only approve the deal if it's of net benefit to Canada," Baird said. Industry Minister Tony Clement, who last week fielded questions from opposition lawmakers on the proposed takeover, sat in silence on Monday.
