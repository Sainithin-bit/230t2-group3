 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported disappointing sales on Tuesday, hurt by generic competition for its Lipitor cholesterol fighter and Effexor XR depression drug as well as weak revenue in emerging markets. 

 The last of the large U.S. drugmakers to report third-quarter earnings, Pfizer ( PFE.N ) followed the example of most rivals with higher-than-expected profits -- largely from cost cuts -- but disappointing sales. "Generic competition is causing pain, and this is just a taste of what Pfizer will be going through in the next few years," said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. Pfizer, whose shares fell more than 1 percent, said global sales of Lipitor fell 11 percent to $2.53 billion in the quarter. The arrival in recent months of Lipitor generics in Canada and Spain hurt the world's top-selling medicine. The bigger threat to Pfizer comes in November 2011, when Lipitor loses U.S. marketing exclusivity. Pfizer bought Wyeth last year for $67 billion to replace vanishing Lipitor revenue with brands from its former U.S. rival. More than a half dozen other Pfizer drugs also lose U.S. patent protection in the next few years, including impotence treatment Viagra and Xalatan for glaucoma. Effexor XR, a Wyeth anti-depressant that once had annual sales of $3 billion, was battered by cheaper U.S. generic versions launched over the summer. Sales of the pill plunged to $175 million in the third quarter. "As with the rest of the industry, patent losses are hurting the bottom line, and it's always especially tricky to gauge the real magnitude of patent erosion in overseas markets," Conover said. EMERGING MARKETS SALES FLAT The world's biggest drugmaker is also counting heavily on fast-growing emerging markets to bolster results in coming years. But its sales in those markets, excluding the Wyeth brands, were essentially flat in the quarter. "The flat growth rate was due to inventory adjustments, principally in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe," Ian Read, head of Pfizer pharmaceuticals, said in an interview. Although inventory changes cause Pfizer's emerging market sales to bounce around from quarter to quarter, the company said the sales have risen 6 percent for the year to date and the longer-term trend continues to look bright. Pfizer's net earnings fell to $866 million, or 11 cents per share, from $2.88 billion, or 43 cents, a year earlier. Excluding merger costs and other special items, Pfizer earned 54 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 51 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company took a $701 million charge in the quarter for asbestos litigation involving its Quigley Co subsidiary. Global revenue rose 39 percent to $16.17 billion, swelled by the addition of Wyeth products, but would have risen 40 percent if not for the stronger dollar, which lowers the value of sales in overseas markets. Sales lagged the consensus Wall Street forecast of $16.68 billion -- in contrast to the second quarter, when a weaker dollar helped Pfizer trounce analysts' sales estimates. Pfizer raised its full-year 2010 profit forecast to between $2.17 and $2.22 per share, from its prior view of up to $2.20. The company stuck to its 2012 outlook of $2.25 to $2.35 per share, which suggests stability during the first full year after Lipitor goes generic in the United States. But Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister said the decline of Pfizer shares on Tuesday suggests skepticism the company will emerge so intact from its ongoing patent cliff. "There's uncertainty whether they'll deliver, and how they're going to get there," Bannister said. Pfizer shares are down 4.5 percent for the year to date, versus a slight gain for the drug group. They are trading at 8 times expected 2011 per share earnings, a considerable discount to most U.S. rivals. Shares of Pfizer were down 19 cents to $17.43 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with moderate gains for the drug sector.
