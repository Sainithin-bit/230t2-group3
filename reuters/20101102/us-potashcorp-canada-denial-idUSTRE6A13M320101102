 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - The Canadian government, responding to market rumors it has rejected BHP Billiton's takeover bid for Potash Corp, said on Tuesday that no decision had yet been made. 

 Industry Minister Tony Clement has until midnight on Nov 3 (0400 GMT on Nov 4) to announce whether he will accept or reject the $39 billion hostile bid. "No decision has been made," a spokesman for Clement told Reuters. (Reporting by  David Ljunggren ; editing by Peter Galloway)
