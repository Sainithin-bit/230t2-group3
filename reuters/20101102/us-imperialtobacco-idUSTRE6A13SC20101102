 LONDON  (Reuters) - Imperial Tobacco ( IMT.L ), the world's fourth-biggest cigarette maker, predicted a return to volume growth this year as Spanish and Russian markets improved after it met forecasts with an 11 percent annual earnings rise. 

 Chief Executive Alison Cooper said she is looking for a small rise in global cigarette volumes for the current year after reporting a 4.2 percent fall for the year to September 2010 due to poor trading in four of its key markets. "We have had a tough year in Spain and Russia as well as the U.S. and Ukraine but conditions are getting better in Spain and Russia and we are looking for a small rise in volumes this year," she told a full-year results briefing on Tuesday. The British maker of Lambert & Butler, West and Gauloises saw its cigarette volumes fall as smokers switched to cheaper, and sometimes illicit, cigarettes in the global downturn but it has offset this by price rises, on-going cost savings and growth in its fine-cut loose tobacco. Analysts said a strong rise in the dividend, a better than expected fall in net debt and a commitment to create further sustained returns for shareholders all helped to push the shares up 2.1 percent to 2,038 pence by 1540 GMT. Imperial reported a 8.7 percent growth in fine cut loose tobacco volume meaning its cigarette equivalent volumes fell just 2.9 percent, and with the help of price rises overall annual sales rose 3 percent. The Bristol-based company, which acquired Franco-Spanish group Altadis in January 2008, posted adjusted earnings per share for the year to end-September of 178.8 pence, line with a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S/ consensus of 178.7 pence. Imperial raised its annual dividend by 15 percent to 84.3 pence a share, while cutting its adjusted net debt by 1.5 billion pounds to 9.3 billion pounds. "Imperial's results contain no real surprises and show an extremely resilient sales and profit performance against some challenging market conditions," said analyst Julian Hardwick at house broker RBS. He is holding his earnings forecast for the year to September 2011 at 191.6 pence. The group, with brands such as Fortuna and Davidoff, is heavily exposed to Western Europe and North America for over 70 percent of earnings and has seen cigarette volumes dip more sharply than most rivals. Last week, rival British American Tobacco Plc (BAT) ( BATS.L ) reported a 3 percent fall in volumes for the first nine months of 2010, and said the downturn's impact on smokers showed no sign of abating. Imperial ranks after Marlboro maker Philip Morris International ( PM.N ), BAT, and Japan Tobacco ( 2914.T ) in terms of global cigarette volumes.
