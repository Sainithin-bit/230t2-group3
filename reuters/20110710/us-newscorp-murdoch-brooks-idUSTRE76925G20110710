 LONDON  (Reuters) - Rebekah Brooks, the chief executive of News Corp's crisis-hit British newspaper arm, arrived at the London residence of Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch on Sunday, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene. 

 Brooks, who has resisted calls to resign over a phone-hacking scandal at the News of the World tabloid, looked expressionless as she was driven to Murdoch's residence. Murdoch, who flew into London on Sunday to deal with the crisis, said in a television interview on Saturday his support for Brooks was "total." (Reporting by  Paul Sandle )
