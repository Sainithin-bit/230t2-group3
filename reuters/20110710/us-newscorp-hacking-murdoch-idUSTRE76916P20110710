 LONDON  (Reuters) - Media mogul Rupert Murdoch arrived in London on Sunday to tackle a crisis that has spiraled beyond a phone-hacking scandal at one of his papers and threatened to scupper a multi-billion-dollar deal. 

 Murdoch was photographed reading a copy of the last ever edition of News of the World, which his News Corp empire axed just a few days ago, as he swept into the company's Wapping headquarters by car. The Australian-born American, one of the world's most influential men, has flown in to personally oversee his company's handling of a crisis in which senior executives are implicated. He later left the company headquarters by car for an unknown destination. (Reporting by  Paul Sandle ; Writing by  Jodie Ginsberg ; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
