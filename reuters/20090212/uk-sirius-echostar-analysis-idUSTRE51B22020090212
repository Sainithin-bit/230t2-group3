 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - With heavy debt payments just round the corner, Sirius XM Radio Inc Chief Executive Mel Karmazin is under increasing pressure to strike a deal with Charlie Ergen's EchoStar Corp to avoid bankruptcy. 

 Wall Street analysts say a deal with Ergen is emerging as the most likely and preferable scenario for the satellite radio provider, whose main growth engine -- sales of new cars with Sirius radios -- has been hit badly by the recession. Ergen, the majority owner of satellite television company EchoStar and its sister company Dish Network Corp, holds $175 million in Sirius convertible notes that mature next week and holds another $400 million of debt due in December, media reports say. This means Karmazin has to work with Ergen or find some other source of cash, which is unlikely in these markets. "Given Sirius' lack of alternatives, talking to Charlie Ergen would be advisable," said Stanford Group analyst Frederick Moran. "From a strategic standpoint, if Dish can gain control of Sirius for pennies on the dollar, it could be of strategic benefit long term," Moran said. At the other extreme, Sirius could file for bankruptcy protection -- it has already engaged law firm Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett LLP as bankruptcy counsel and restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal, according to the New York Times. But that could open up Karmazin to the risk of shareholder lawsuits, particularly if Ergen had made a bid for the company. The Wall Street Journal reported that Ergen offered late last year to restructure Sirius' debt and inject several hundred million dollars of capital in return for control. "I think he'd prefer to strike a deal out of bankruptcy," said Chris Marangi, a portfolio manager at Gabelli & Co, a holder of Dish and EchoStar shares. Both EchoStar and Sirius declined to comment. IF NO DEAL ... THEN .... Sirius has $175 million of convertible notes maturing on February 17, $350 million of secured bank debt due in May 2009, and $433 million in convertible notes due December. The satellite radio company ended September with about $360 million in cash. At the time, Chief Financial Officer David Frear told investors the company would have enough cash to meet its debt load, but analysts now question that claim. Some experts suggest Sirius might consider a prepackaged bankruptcy with its bondholders, a cheaper and quicker way to clear the process. In it, major creditors vote on details of a bankruptcy plan before it is filed with the court. That option probably would be the least attractive for shareholders as the equity would likely be wiped out. Equity holders are already critically hurt: Sirius shares traded on Wednesday at about 5.5 cents a share, down 91 percent in the past six months. Some large holders of Sirius bonds said they welcomed a potential takeover by EchoStar. "We look at it as a positive," said Jean-Marie Eveillard, co-manager of First Eagle Global Fund, under the investment advisory firm Arnhold & S Bleichroeder Advisers. "It looks like Ergen is interested and, in an indirect way, trying to take control of the company." A bankruptcy filing could lead to the sale of Sirius assets to myriad investors including Ergen, but experts are starting to see a future where the two satellite concerns work together. "My thesis is Charlie's making an investment in this debt because if Sirius can pay back, he's going to get a 30 percent return. And if not, he can get hold of $1 billion's worth of hardware for $300 million," said Todd Mitchell, analyst at Kaufman Bros. Debt analysts say Ergen could lose some cash if Sirius goes bankrupt, but if EchoStar holds secured bank debt as well as convertible notes, a bankruptcy court might give it first shot at the assets it wants in a fire sale. One long-time satellite industry watcher cast doubt on the idea that Ergen is simply on the hunt for assets, saying he would want an investment he could control. "EchoStar has told Karmazin it would be willing to increase the amount it has invested to roughly $800 million," said Bob Scherman, editor of Satellite Business News, adding that such a move would be a precursor to Ergen taking control of Sirius, something Karmazin is loathe to agree to. Scherman said his industry sources said talks between Ergen and Karmazin ground to a halt on Tuesday but a phone call could easily restart negotiations.
