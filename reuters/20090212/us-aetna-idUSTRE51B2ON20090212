 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) posted a 57 percent drop in net income on investment losses and charges, but a lower-than-expected tax rate helped drive operating results slightly above analysts' targets. 

 Shares of the No. 3 U.S. health insurer, which also forecast 2009 profit in line with analysts' expectations, fell 1.4 percent in morning trading, slightly outperforming the broader market. "I'd call it a decent quarter, but I think we were expecting a little bit more on a quality basis than what we got," said David Heupel, a portfolio manager with Thrivent Investment Management. Aetna's results close a fourth-quarter reporting season for major health insurers that has lacked any huge negative surprises, encouraging investors that stability may be returning to a sector whose shares were hammered in 2008. Aetna's net income fell to $194.7 million, or 42 cents per share, from $448.4 million, or 87 cents per share, a year earlier. The latest results included 42 cents a share in net realized capital losses, as well as charges for severance payments and a probe into out-of-network medical services. Excluding those items, earnings were 96 cents per share, 2 cents ahead of the analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Several analysts said lower-than-expected taxes helped results. Revenue at the Hartford, Connecticut-based company rose 8.7 percent to $7.76 billion. Aetna's health plan membership stood at 17.7 million at the end of 2008, for annual growth of about 5 percent. Aetna's medical benefit ratio, a key measure of the amount of premiums spent on medical claims, deteriorated to 80.6 percent in the fourth quarter from 79.2 percent a year earlier for its commercial segment that serves employers. Analysts at Oppenheimer & Co had expected 80.5 percent. Aetna projected 2009 operating earnings of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. Analysts are looking for $3.88. The outlook equates to growth of about 12 percent to 14 percent, consistent with Aetna's previous forecast. Aetna shares were down 44 cents, or 1.4 percent, at $31.80 on the New York Stock Exchange. After a rough 2008 for HMO stocks, Aetna shares had risen 13 percent this year through Wednesday, higher than a 9 percent climb for the S&P Managed Health Care index .GSPHMO.
