 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's idea of buying Treasury bonds to aide U.S. growth is still on the table, but officials are wary of moving quickly on it, the Wall Street Journal said. 

 The Fed could also be hesitant to extend further long-term lending because it wants to preserve its policy options and on worries that these loans it could be difficult to pull back when the economy recovers, it reported without citing sources. U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on Tuesday unveiled a plan to soak up as much as $1 trillion in bad assets on banks' books and expand a Federal Reserve program to support up to $1 trillion in new loans. To improve its flexibility, the Fed wants the Treasury to get permission to borrow money and leave that money on deposit with the central bank. The cash the Fed would get from such deposits would make it easier for it to unwind its long-term holdings slowly, the paper said. The Treasury made such deposits last year as the Fed's balance sheet started to grow but was forced to pull away from the program as government borrowing soared. Officials might now ask Congress for permission to resume the program without counting against Treasury borrowing limits, the paper added.
