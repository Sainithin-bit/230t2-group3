 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc will sell $12.3 billion in assets to Chinalco and raise a further $7.2 billion by issuing China's top aluminum maker convertible bonds to cut debt, a source with direct knowledge of the deal said on Thursday. 

 The deal, which will require approval by Australian foreign investment regulators, will increase Chinalco's stake in Australia and London-listed Rio to 18 percent from 9 percent, the source said on Thursday. The source was not authorized to speak on the record about the deal. Chinalco's convertible bonds in Rio comes with a 60-year financing term and a 7-year call option, the source said. Chinalco's investment involve minority stakes in nine mines around the world: Boyne & GPS, Escondida, Grasberg, Hamersley Iron, La Granja, KUC, Weipa and Yarwun. (Reporting by  Michael Flaherty )
