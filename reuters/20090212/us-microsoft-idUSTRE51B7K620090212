 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp announced plans on Thursday to open its own chain of stores and hired a DreamWorks Animation executive to run them. 

 The move follows rival Apple Inc's successful foray into retailing, but comes at a time when consumer spending is under pressure due to the recession. The company did not say how many stores it was looking to open, or when, or which products would be available. That is to be decided by David Porter, a former DreamWorks executive, which Microsoft named as its new vice president of retail stores on Thursday.
