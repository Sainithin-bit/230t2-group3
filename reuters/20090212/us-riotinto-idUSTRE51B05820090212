 MELBOURNE/LONDON  (Reuters) - Debt-laden mining group Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ) has agreed to a $19.5 billion cash injection from China's state-owned Chinalco under a deal to be unveiled on Thursday, Australian and British newspapers said. 

 The plan is likely to face close scrutiny in Canberra, where the Australian government last year said Chinalco would need to seek approval if it wanted to raise its stake in Rio Tinto above 15 percent of the group's London shares. Australian media were already criticizing the reported deal on Thursday. Rio's former suitor, bigger rival BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ), may also enter the fray, with counter bids for some of the asset stakes Chinalco is set to pick up, the Times Newspaper said on its web site on Thursday. An agreement with Chinalco had been widely expected after Rio's chairman-designate, Jim Leng, quit the mining group two days ago because of objections to a tie-up with the state-run Chinese aluminum maker, which is Rio's top shareholder. Rio, scheduled to releases its annual results on Thursday, issued a statement reiterating it was in talks with Chinalco. Rio, the third-biggest diversified mining group by market value, announced last week it had held talks with Chinalco about selling it convertible notes and stakes in some assets. Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan said any deal would be scrutinized by Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board. Swan then has final say if the foreign investment can proceed. "They will be examined in the normal way within the guidelines that we put out at the beginning of last year," Swan told Australian radio. The government has said it would scrutinize investments by foreign state-owned entities to ensure they were not pursuing a political or strategic position. A Chinalco deal may dampen investor concerns over Rio's $39 billion debt load and an $9 billion debt payment due in October. CRITICISM EMERGES QUICKLY But at least one fund manager in Australia said some shareholders might not be pleased and Rio Tinto could run into problems when the plan goes to a vote. Criticism has focused on Rio Tinto allowing a big state-owned customer, which has an incentive to keep prices down, so much influence over the group and direct stakes in prized assets. "We're getting a smorgasbord across the highest-quality assets. It's perplexing," said Ken West of Perennial Growth. Rio's London shares climbed 3.5 percent to 1,969 pence -- outperforming a 0.7 percent increase in the UK mining index .FTNMX1770 -- after jumping 6.2 percent in Australia. Its shares were put on a trading halt in Australia ahead of the announcement expected after the market closes on Thursday. Rio Tinto shares have fallen by more than a fifth since BHP walked away on November 25, while the broader market .AXJO is down just 4 percent. BHP shares have meanwhile gained 22 percent. Under the terms of the deal, Chinalco will increase its stake in Rio to 18 percent from 9 percent. It will buy $7.2 billion in bonds convertible into Rio shares at a later date, the FT reported, without saying how it had obtained the information. Chinalco bought a 9 percent stake in Rio with U.S. aluminum giant Alcoa ( AA.N ) a year ago. Chinalco will also invest $12.3 billion in three strategic partnerships with Rio across its copper, aluminum and iron ore divisions, the FT and the Australian Financial Review said. This would involve Chinalco taking minority stakes in a total of nine mines around the world: Weipa; Yarwun; Boyne & GPS; Escondida; KUC; Grasberg; la Granja and Hamersley Iron. Chinalco will pay premiums of 100-200 percent on the mine stakes, The Australian Financial Review web site said, adding that the conversion price of the notes would be set at premiums of 55 and 107 percent over the current Rio share price. Rio owns 30 percent of Escondida, the world's biggest copper mine, in a joint venture with BHP. The FT did not explain how Rio can sell a stake to Chinalco when BHP has a pre-emptive right to buy the stake. BHP declined to comment. BHP, which owns 57 percent of the Chilean mine, has said it would be interested in Rio's Escondida stake if it was for sale. The Times report said BHP was expected to approach the Rio board to make a counter-offer for some of the mining stakes, and if the board were to reject BHP's approach, it would be prepared to go directly to shareholders. The FT also said Chinalco will set up a $1 billion joint venture with Rio which will be used to develop projects such as the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. Chinalco would receive one seat on Rio's board and have the right to appoint another at a later date. Chinalco last year told the Australian government it would not seek a board seat.
