 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Shares of Sanyo Electric 6764.T fell after a newspaper said Panasonic Corp ( 6752.T ) was seeking to buy Sanyo shares at 120 yen each in a takeover, far below the current stock price and valuing the company at $7.7 billion. 

 Panasonic, Japan's largest electronics company, said earlier this month that it planned to buy smaller rival Sanyo, but their main shareholders have yet to agree on a price. It is offering a low price -- 25 percent below Sanyo's previous close -- because of an expected dilution in Sanyo's per-share value after the conversion of outstanding preferred shares, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported on Tuesday. Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and two others hold almost 430 million preferred shares in Sanyo, each of which can be exchanged for 10 common shares from next March. If converted, they would hold a combined 70 percent stake. "It would be positive for Panasonic if it can buy Sanyo shares at 120 yen apiece. But talks are in very early rounds and it looks like they are just exchanging jabs," said Mitsushige Akino, chief fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management. Panasonic's reported offer price would still be a 20 percent premium to Sanyo's per-share value, based on estimates earlier this month by one brokerage analyst. The Yomiuri said Panasonic, formerly known as Matsushita Electric, had begun talks with Goldman Sachs and other major Sanyo shareholders but Goldman aims to sell its stake for about 250 yen a share. Akino said Panasonic and Sanyo's top shareholders would likely meet somewhere in the middle though the reported asking price of 250 yen sounded a little on the high side. At 250 yen/share, Sanyo's market capitalization would come to 1.54 trillion yen if the preferred shares were converted, making it more than twice as valuable as its bigger and more profitable rival Sharp Corp ( 6753.T ). Sanyo shares closed down 2.5 percent at 156 yen on Tuesday after touching a low of 145 yen in the morning session. The benchmark Nikkei share average  .N225  rose 5.2 percent. Panasonic, the world's largest plasma TV maker, said it had not decided on its bid price, while the Japan unit of Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The acquisition would boost Panasonic's competitiveness in rechargeable batteries and solar power equipment as demand grows rapidly for greener energy sources. Sanyo is the world's biggest maker of lithium-ion batteries, which are widely used in mobile phones, laptop computers and portable music players, and the seventh-largest in solar cells behind such rivals as Sharp and Germany's Q-Cells QCEG.DE. Credit Suisse analyst Koya Tabata earlier this month estimated Sanyo's per-share value at around 100 yen and said Panasonic could offer as much as 140 yen per share. To acquire Sanyo, Panasonic has to buy out its top three shareholders, Daiwa Securities SMBC, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Co and Goldman Sachs, which bailed out the company in 2006. Daiwa Securities SMBC is a joint venture between Daiwa Securities Group ( 8601.T ) and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) ( 8316.T ), while Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp is Sanyo's main bank and part of SMFG.
