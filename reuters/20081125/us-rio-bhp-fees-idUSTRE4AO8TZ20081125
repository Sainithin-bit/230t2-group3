 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc is not yet ready to publish the advisory fees it paid for its defense against BHP Billiton's failed bid for the company, Rio Tinto Chairman Paul Skinner said on Wednesday. Skinner made the comments in an address to the Australian-British Chamber of Commerce. 

 On Tuesday, global miner BHP Billiton abandoned its hostile takeover bid for rival Rio Tinto, blaming sliding metals prices and the threat of global recession for scuppering the mega-merger. (Reporting by  James Regan , editing by James Thornhill and  Mark Bendeich )
