 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) called off its $58 billion bid for rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) on Tuesday, citing worsening market conditions and demands for asset sales from European regulators. 

 BHP Billiton said the European Commission wanted divestments in both iron ore and coal as a condition of the deal. Iron ore was one of the main reasons behind BHP's audacious bid, which ranked as one of the world's top-three takeovers in history when launched last year, ahead of a dive in metal prices.
