 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Qantas Airways Ltd ( QAN.AX ), Australia's flag carrier, slashed its 2009 profit forecast and said it would further cut capacity due to shrinking demand as the global financial crisis bites. 

 Airlines around the world are being buffeted as corporate customers slice their travel budgets, and sliding oil prices are not helping in the short run as many had hedged their fuel costs at much higher levels. Europe's biggest airline, Air France-KLM ( AIRF.PA ), last week reported a 44 percent slide in quarterly operating profit, while Japan Airlines 9205.T virtually halved its profit forecast. Analysts said Tuesday's profit warning was unlikely to be the last for Qantas, as Australians, hit by a weak local currency, holiday closer to home and the global economy deteriorates. "Investors will be cautious that there could be further bad news down the track," said Derek Sadubin, chief operating officer of the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation in Sydney. "Everyone's going to be struggling to make money in the 2009 calendar year. The second half of their (Qantas') current financial year is going to be very, very challenging." The International Air Transport Association said last week that business and first-class travel dropped 8 percent in September from a year earlier, with Asia most affected. "We are in unpredictable times and the international business market, in particular, has slowed," Qantas Chief Executive Geoff Dixon, who is due to step down this month, said in a statement. Qantas now expects its pre-tax profit to fall 65 percent to around A$500 million ($327 million) in the year to June 2009, compared with an average forecast from three analysts of A$749 million, according to Reuters Estimates. The airline had said in August it expected 2008/09 pre-tax profit to be in line with analysts' consensus forecasts, which at the time were in a wide range around A$751 million. BETS GONE WRONG Despite a big drop in oil prices, Qantas said its fuel bill this year would still be A$750 million higher than last year, as it had hedged 97 percent of its fuel at $106 a barrel, nearly double the current oil price. "The carriers that have hedged have had wrong-way bets because fuel prices have come off so steeply," said Sadubin, pointing to Air China's ( 0753.HK ) ( 601111.SS ) $454 million in potential losses on fuel hedging. Qantas shares sank as much as 6 percent, but by 0440 GMT were trading flat at A$2.31, trailing a 4.2 percent jump in the broader market .AXJO. For Graphic on airline share prices, click  here Qantas said its latest capacity cuts, equivalent to grounding 10 planes, would be met partly by not taking up planned leases of two A330-200 aircraft and by stopping all planned growth within Australia for Qantas and its budget airline, Jetstar. It said it would cut costs by accelerating staff leave, rather than adding to plans to cut 4 percent of its workforce. The latest news comes after Qantas planes had a string of incidents, including a mid-air explosion of an oxygen bottle that ripped a minivan-sized hole in the side of a jumbo jet in July. Dixon last month blamed the two biggest incidents on the aircraft manufacturers or parts manufacturers, rather than any problems with maintenance. Air New Zealand ( AIR.NZ ), which last week announced plans to cut up to 200 jobs, said on Tuesday traffic between Australia and New Zealand and in the Pacific market had fallen sharply in October, with passenger numbers down 10 percent on a year ago. It said its scheduled international capacity for the fourth quarter of the 2009 financial year would be down 13 percent on a year earlier. Air New Zealand shares rose 4.8 percent to NZ$0.88 on Tuesday, outpacing a 2.4 percent gain in the New Zealand market .NZ50 . Singapore Airlines ( SIAL.SI ), the world's biggest airline by market value, said it was not looking to cut staff salaries to cope with the global economic slowdown.
