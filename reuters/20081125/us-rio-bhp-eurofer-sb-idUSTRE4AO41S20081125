 LONDON  (Reuters) - European steel confederation Eurofer welcomed the withdrawal of BHP Billiton's hostile offer for rival Rio Tinto, a spokesman said on Tuesday. 

 "This is good news; not only for European steel industry and worldwide steel industry but for the whole global economy," a spokesman for Eurofer told Reuters on the phone. Top global miner BHP Billiton dropped a $66 billion hostile offer for Rio Tinto, the latest casualty of a global crisis that has frozen credit markets and hit demand for raw materials. The world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal and Europe's second biggest producer Corus, owned by India's Tata Steel declined to comment on the news. Steelmakers across the globe have long opposed such a merger, fearing the merged company would control more than one third of the world's seaborne trade in iron ore, a key steelmaking ingredient, and influence prices. "This is not the idea of a market-based approach the  European Union is thinking of," the spokesman said. "Now we can be sure that the market concentration is not going any further and this is an insurance that the prices will be less influenced than they could have with the merger," he said. The withdrawal of the $66 billion bid comes at a key time, when the $800 billion steel industry is bracing for yet another acrimonious and fierce round of negotiations for the 2009 annual contracts for iron ore, which are due to start soon. Asked what Eurofer believed the reasons were for the withdrawal, the spokesman said: "The statement of objection of the European Commission is certainly the main reason for that." "The commission, it seems, would never allow a merger of this magnitude. So there is no way...for BHP to have this merger unless they fulfill certain conditions of European Commission," the spokesman said. On November 4, BHP Billiton announced that it had received a document from European regulators detailing anti-trust hurdles to the company's takeover bid for Rio Tinto, but declined to give any details of the content. The Commission previously said it had sweeping concerns that the combination of the two groups might result in higher prices and reduced choice for customers. "They are just too big for the European Union," the Eurofer spokesman said. (Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk, editing by Peter Blackburn)
