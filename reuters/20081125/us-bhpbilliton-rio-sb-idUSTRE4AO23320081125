 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX ) ( BLT.L ) still believes the current downturn in markets is a short-term challenge, despite its decision to pull its roughly $60 billion bid for rival Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ), BHP Billiton said on Tuesday. 

 BHP Billiton had billed the deal as one for the long-term, which made sense in good times as well as bad. "There simply isn't value for our shareholders," BHP Chief Executive Marius Kloppers told a media teleconference. (Reporting by  James Regan , editing by Mark Bendeich) ($1=.6590 Pound)
