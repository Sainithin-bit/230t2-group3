 (Reuters) - BHP Billiton, the world's top miner, said it was dropping its proposed $66 billion hostile takeover of Rio Tinto, citing concerns about deteriorating global conditions and demands for asset sales from European regulators. 

 Following are measures announced by iron ore miners to cope with reduced demand from steelmakers, as well as tables of the world's top iron ore producers and consumers. November 21 - Shandong Iron and Steel Group and other big Chinese steel mills are no longer interested in buying a Chilean iron ore miner they had held talks with. November 20 - Fortescue Metals, Australia's No. 3 iron ore miner, has increased its sales to China in stark contrast to gloom surrounding the sector. November 20 - Metalloinvest, Russia's largest iron ore miner, has slashed output to 65 percent below peaks reached earlier in the year. November 17 - BHP Billiton has had requests from some customers to defer up to 5 percent of this year's production, about 6 million metric tons, but has not cut output. November 12 - Chinese trading firm Minmetals Corp has cut imports of iron ore by about 3 percent this year amid falling prices. November 10 - Australia's Rio Tinto said it would cut 2008 iron ore shipments from Australia by 10 percent to between 170 million and 175 million metric tons because of weakening demand from China. The move reduces output by up to 20 million metric tons from its previously targeted output of around 190 million metric tons in 2008. November 10 - Fortescue Metals Group has brought forward a planned shutdown of port and iron ore mining processing facilities in Australia for upgrading work, which will affect calendar 2008 production. The firm also said on October 28 it had deferred some spending on expansion and pushed out its target of lifting annual output to 80 million metric tons amid weakening orders from China. November 3 - Gibson Iron, Australia's fourth-largest iron ore miner, said it would temporarily cut a third of its workforce and raise new capital as it cut its sales target in the 2008/09 business year by 30 percent to 5 million metric tons. October 31 - Brazilian miner Vale, the world's top iron ore producer, said it would cut iron ore output by 10 percent from November, for an output cut of 30 million metric tons a year. October 20 - Atlas Iron, Australia's newest iron ore producer, said it had decided to sell its output on China's spot market after failing to tie up long-term contracts.
