 (Reuters) - Internet search giant Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) said it is "significantly" reducing the number of contract workers it uses, but has no plans at this time to lay off employees, the Wall Street Journal said. 

 "We have been thinking for some time, before the acute phase of the economic crisis, about significantly reducing the number of contract workers," spokeswoman Jane Penner told the paper. Google declined to specify how many contract workers might be cut, nor would Penner discuss the pace at which the company would terminate contractors, the paper said. Google ended the third quarter with 20,123 company employees and about 10,000 contractors, according to the paper. Google could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.
