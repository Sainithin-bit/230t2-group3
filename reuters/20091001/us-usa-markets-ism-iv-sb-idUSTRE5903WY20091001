 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in September for a second consecutive month, although at a weaker-than-expected rate, according to an industry report released on Thursday. 

 U.S. construction spending rose at its fastest pace in nearly a year in August. Investment in private residential construction notching its biggest increase in almost 16 years. KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity eased to 52.6 from 52.9 in August. The median forecast of 75 economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 54. * August marked the first month of expansion in the sector in more than a year and a half. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector. PENDING HOME SALES: Pending sales of existing U.S. homes rose sharply in August, for a seventh consecutive month of gains, reaching the highest since March 2007, data from a real estate trade group showed on Thursday. KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Realtors Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed, was up 6.4 percent to 103.8, the longest consecutive month-on-month gain in the history of the series, which began in 2001. * The index rose from a reading of 97.6 in July and is 12.4 percent above August 2008's level of 104.5. Economists polled by Reuters had been expecting pending home sales to rise, but by only 1.0 percent. COMMENTS: MICHELLE MEYER, ECONOMIST, BARCLAYS CAPITAL, NEW YORK: "Pending home sales have reached the highest level since March 2007, reversing half way back to the peak in late-2005. The sharp upturn in home sales has been driven by a combination of greater affordability, which has been boosted by the first-time home buyer tax credit, and improved consumer confidence. "We believe that the first-time home buyer tax credit has amplified the recent gain in home sales, likely pulling future sales forward. As such, sales may revert back slightly once the credit expires at the end of November. However, looking past this choppiness, we believe that there is a clear upward trend in home sales that should persist." GARY THAYER, MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "The ISM manufacturing index was positive, but not as strong as investors wanted to see. It was a good number, over 50, but the expectations had been for a higher reading. "The numbers on pending home sales were better than expected, but they are not the focus of attention right now. A lot of investors are trying to figure out how much the economy will slow after the surge in spending we saw in the cash for clunkers program. The question is, did that spending borrow from the future or will the gains be sustained?" ZACH PANDL, ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL INC, NEW YORK: "This morning's data highlights that while the economy is emerging from recession, recovery is likely to proceed in fits and starts rather than a continuous upward march. This uneven pattern of growth is what we've been seeing for the last several weeks. "We are convinced the recession is ending but the data is becoming more mixed lately, (although) the positive news generally outweighs the negative. "I think today's data is consistent with the economy gradually rising, so that should be a net positive for the market." ALAN LANCZ, PRESIDENT, ALAN B. LANCZ & ASSOCIATES INC, TOLEDO, OHIO: "The ISM makes me more bearish, especially after yesterday's PMI number. The markets were expecting continued improvement, and you're not seeing that to any significant extent. That draws into the thesis of, if not a W-shaped recovery, then at least a very anemic recovery. It's not at all the V-shaped recovery investors were expecting. I'm bearish in the sense that expectations are high and valuations are up so much. The expectations are getting high for improvement and if we don't see signs of that, of a V-shaped recovery, the market is going to react negatively. We're not going to have the follow-through." STEVEN WOOD, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INSIGHT ECONOMICS, DANVILLE, CALIFORNIA: "Construction spending rose in August and appears to have stabilized at a low level after a long substantial three-year slide. Home building increased but remained very low with a more than 60 percent peak-to-current decline. Non-residential construction fell because of rising vacancy rates, falling rents, and tighter credit conditions; further weakness is expected in the months ahead. Government building activity slipped because rapidly deteriorating state and local government budgets are offsetting some of the federal stimulus dollars." RONALD SIMPSON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GLOBAL CURRENCY ANALYSIS, ACTION ECONOMICS, TAMPA, FLORIDA "Wall Street got smacked and I think that largely came as result of the ISM headline. "It was pretty close to expectations, but if you're looking at recovery, the number really didn't do the trick. The orders were up and the headline number was up, and the employment component was lower again, so I think that's taken some air out of the recovery scenario. "Construction data was good and pending home sales was the best since sometime in 2007, so that's not bad. "I think the market is a little bit nervous ahead of the employment numbers tomorrow. Based on recent history, with Wall Street getting hit the dollar probably should have rallied some and we haven't seen that yet. "I suspect there's not too many willing buyers of dollars ahead of the employment report tomorrow ... the whisper numbers I've been hearing in the market today are getting larger on the negative side. "We might really be seeing the dollar staying soft as traders bet on a worse-than-consensus nonfarm payroll number tomorrow." NORBERT ORE, CHAIR, ISM MANUFACTURING BUSINESS SURVEY COMMITTEE, ATLANTA, GEORGIA: "Overall September was a good month as far as manufacturing is concerned. We're consistent with the rate of growth that was established in August. We're coming off a bottom that took us 18 months to reach so while the rate of growth in manufacturing looks fairly good, we've got a long way to go in terms of getting enough economic activity to use up the capacity in U.S. manufacturing." DAVID RESLER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NOMURA SECURITIES INTERNATIONAL, NEW YORK: "The ISM numbers confirmed that the manufacturing sector is improving. Even in good times, this is not far off its historic long-run average. It is a pretty good sign that there has not been any letup in manufacturing activity from the improvement we have seen in recent months. Only those people who are looking for a V-shaped recovery might have been thinking we would get stronger numbers. I don't see the economy unfolding quite that vigorously and this is consistent with what I think is likely to be happening. "Pending home sales were pretty strong, which is an indication that those people who hoped to cash in on the first-time home buyers tax credit want to make sure that they will get that transaction completed." JOHN KICKLIGHTER, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, DAILYFX.COM, NEW YORK "All in all, we had a very consistent bullish trend since the beginning of the year... the manufacturing sector is really recovering. "But we have to remember just like with general growth, you're seeing a rebound or recovery but it's not necessarily putting us back on pace for the kind of growth that we saw through the first half of 2007 or 2006 and beforehand. We really have to come to grips with the fact that we're going to have a moderate and choppy pace of growth going into the second half of the year and into 2010." RAY STONE, ECONOMIST, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "ISM over 50 for the second month in a row is good news, although it would have been better if it had kept on going up. "This is still consistent with third quarter U.S. economic growth showing expansion of a little more than 3 percent." ALAN GAYLE, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, RIDGEWORTH INVESTMENTS, RICHMOND, VIRGINIA: "While the number did not match expectations, I think we got a hint that it might not from the Chicago index that came out yesterday. While the number is above 50 and encouraging, there are concerns about manufacturing momentum. We had the in ISM bounce, but what comes after the bounce is weighing on the market. The data suggests that manufacturing is trying to establish a new normal production level after cutting aggressively over the last 12 to 18 months. The question on the market's mind is how much does production have to increase to get us back to a more sustainable level?" MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes extended losses. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pared gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose slightly against the euro.
