 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded in September for a second consecutive month, although at a weaker-than-expected rate, according to an industry report released on Thursday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity eased to 52.6 from 52.9 in August. The median forecast of 75 economists surveyed by Reuters was for a reading of 54. August marked the first month of expansion in the sector in more than a year and a half. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector.
