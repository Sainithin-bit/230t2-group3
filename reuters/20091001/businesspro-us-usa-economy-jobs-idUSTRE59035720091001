 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits rose last week, government data showed on Thursday. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose to a seasonally adjusted 551,000 in the week ending September 26 from a revised 534,000 in the previous week. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting claims of 530,000, which would have been unchanged from the previously reported figure. The four-week moving average of new claims fell to 548,000, the lowest since 547,000 reported in the week ending January 24. A Labor Department spokesman said there were no unusual factors affecting the latest week's data. Continued claims of workers still collecting jobless aid after an initial week of benefits fell to 6.09 million in the week ending September 19 from a revised 6.16 million in the prior week. Analysts were expecting continued claims to rise to 6.16 million.
