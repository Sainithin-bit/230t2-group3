 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc's board approved a restructuring plan on Thursday, clearing the way for the commercial lender to launch a large debt exchange offer or to file for prepackaged bankruptcy if that failed, a person knowledgeable about the matter said. 

 CIT, which caters to small and mid-sized businesses, could announce the plan as soon as Thursday night, this person said, declining to be identified because the talks are not public yet. (Reporting by  Paritosh Bansal ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
