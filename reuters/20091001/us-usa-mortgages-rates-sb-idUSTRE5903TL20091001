 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The average rate on 30-year U.S. home loans fell in the past week in a new test of the record lows set in April, Freddie Mac FRE.N said on Thursday. 

 The long-term borrowing cost dropped 0.10 of a percentage point in the week ended October 1 to 4.94 percent, heading back to the all-time low of 4.78 percent, the second largest U.S. home funding source said. A year ago, before government interventions aimed at cutting borrowing costs to stimulate housing and the economy, the rate was 6.10 percent. (Reporting by  Lynn Adler ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
