 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norwegian video-conferencing equipment maker Tandberg ASA said on Thursday that major shareholders had voiced support for the $2.98 billion cash bid from U.S. network equipment maker Cisco System. "There are major shareholders out there that have sent their congratulations over the course of the day... We really appreciate your support," Chief Executive of Tandberg, Fredrik Halvorsen, told a telephone conference.
