 OSLO  (Reuters) - U.S. network equipment maker Cisco said it would stay aggressive in acquisitions going forward after bidding $3 billion for Norway's video-conferencing equipment maker Tandberg on Thursday. 

 "You're going to see us more aggressive over the next 12 months than you have seen us as a company," Cisco Chief Executive John Chambers told a news conference. "We will be very aggressive with internal start-ups, partnering... and also in acquisitions," he said. (Reporting by  Wojciech Moskwa )
