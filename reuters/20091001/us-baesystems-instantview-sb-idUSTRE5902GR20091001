 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Serious Fraud Office said on Thursday it would seek consent from Britain's attorney general to prosecute Europe's biggest defense contractor BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) over bribery allegations. 

 BAE said it was working hard to resolve the issue at the earliest opportunity. Following are reactions from lawyers and analysts on the likelihood of conviction, the level of any fines and the possible timeframe. LIKELIHODD OF CONVICTION GEORGE BROWN, GLOBAL REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT PARTNER, REED SMITH "I would think it is an uphill struggle because, as the law stands, they're not going to be successful against the company. As to individuals, that's simpler. "To get a prosecution of the company you have to prove that the person who is the controlling mind and body of the company was involved in making the decisions. If there is a board of directors and there is dispersal of management .... that is virtually impossible." HOWARD WHEELDON, SENIOR STRATEGIST, BGC "There is a middle road -- we don't know for certain that (Attorney General) Baroness Scotland will say yes, this should go to court," Wheeldon said, adding that any events prior to the current 2002 legislation could make it "very difficult for the SFO to build a case." CHRISTOPHE MENARD, ANALYST, BRYAN, GARNIER & CO "Pursuing criminal charges is one way for the SFO to move forward but whether it is in the public interest to do such a thing I don't know. I don't think prosecuting BAE now would solve anything. "The consequences if there is a criminal investigation are that BAE can be barred from publicly funded projects which in the end would mean job losses in the UK." LEVEL OF ANY FINES IF CONVICTED GEORGE BROWN, GLOBAL REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT PARTNER, REED SMITH "I would have thought it would go into hundreds of millions (of pounds). The UK authorities will want to show that there is some sort of comity in relation to the way in which one deals with international corruption and will want to follow the lines of Germany and the U.S. "These are quite big projects -- South Africa fighter planes, Czech Republic fighter planes, Tanzania is more modest in that it was a radar system, and quite a big project for refurbished warships in Romania." CHRISTOPHER GRIERSON, BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION TASK FORCE PARTNER, LOVELLS LLP "The sheer scale of the penalties being sought, which are believed to be 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), is unprecedented in the UK and will send shockwaves across corporate Britain. Whilst we have yet to see how this will play out, it is clear that the SFO is flexing its muscles and attempting to emulate the aggressive approach of the U.S. authorities." HOWARD WHEELDON, SENIOR STRATEGIST, BGC "If the SFO says BAE should pay a 10 million pounds fine BAE should get on with it (and pay) -- it's in the interests of the government, BAE and the SFO for a lid to be put on this. If we are talking hundreds of millions -- upwards of 500 million -- the categoric answer is that BAE should not accept and say to the SFO 'bring it on'." CHRISTOPHE MENARD, ANALYST, BRYAN, GARNIER & CO "A 1 billion pound figure that has been talked about in the British press is insane and is unrealistic compared to what is being alleged. I would guess the fine to be in the tens of millions of pounds but not more than that. "It was a 40 million pound contract in Tanzania and was just a tender offer in Czech Republic so I don't think this 1 billion pound figure is at all realistic." LIKELY TIMEFRAME GEORGE BROWN, GLOBAL REGULATORY ENFORCEMENT PARTNER, REED SMITH "I would think that they will move this as quickly as they can and I would have thought twelve to 24 months. Once you're charged it means you've got a case to go to court. Their case should be ready. "The SFO want to show that they are effective and that they are behaving in an efficient manner especially since Jessica de Grazia's report that said they weren't as effective as the New York prosecutors."
