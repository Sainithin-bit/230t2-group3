 DETROIT  (Reuters) - There are a number of scenarios President Barack Obama can follow on Monday when he unveils the next phase of the government's bailout plan for troubled U.S. automakers. 

 The government has set March 31 as the deadline for General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Chrysler LLC to show they are worthy of up to $22 billion in taxpayer money, in addition to the $17.4 billion they have already received since the start of the year. * OFFERS LIMITED FUNDING Obama said on Thursday the automakers could expect more government help if they commit to "drastic" restructuring. But even if GM and Chrysler miss the deadline to win sweeping concessions from the United Auto Workers and creditors, the government could still provide limited aid to avert immediate failure and tell them to come back with concessions if they want more. GM wants more than $16 billion in loans, while Chrysler has sought $5 billion. GM and Chrysler are pushing for deals with the UAW that would allow them to pay the union in stock rather than cash for half of the remaining obligations to a retiree healthcare trust, known as a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association. GM bondholders are also under pressure to write off two- thirds of the more than $27 billion they are owed in exchange for stock in a recapitalized company. * UAW HEALTHCARE DEAL GM and Chrysler have won pending contract changes from the UAW to help cut hourly wage costs to the level of plants operated by Japanese automakers in the United States. About 7,500 UAW workers from GM, or 12 percent of its U.S. factory workforce, have also accepted buyouts to leave the company by April 1. <ID:N26492950> Bondholders would be the last holdout if GM also reaches agreement with the UAW to convert half of its $20 billion remaining obligation to the VEBA into equity. GM has to cut $27 billion of debt by two-thirds to meet the terms of its emergency loans. But bondholders complained as recently as Sunday that they have been shut out of negotiations on restructuring the debt since a meeting on March 5 with members of the Obama administration's autos task force. A person with knowledge of the negotiations said GM has made the bondholders a new offer to turn most of that debt into equity. * U.S. TREATS GM, CHRYSLER SEPARATELY Analysts have raised the possibility the government could treat GM and Chrysler differently. Chrysler, which received $4 billion of government loans, has come under more public scrutiny because of the private equity status of its owner, Cerberus Capital Management LPCBS.UL, which controls about 80 percent of the automaker. Several Congressmen, including Tennessee Republican Bob Corker, said there is little hope Chrysler can be viable in its current form and should consider a merger with other automakers to survive. * BANKRUPTCY THREAT GM and Chrysler executives have ruled out filing for bankruptcy, insisting it would quickly spin out of control into liquidation because buyers would be scared away from new cars and trucks from a bankrupt automaker. But some outside analysts argue that, without the threat of bankruptcy, the companies lack the leverage they need to extract deep concessions from bondholders and the UAW. (Editing by  Andre Grenon )
