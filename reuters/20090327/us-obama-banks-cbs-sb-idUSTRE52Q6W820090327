 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama told the chief executives of some of the largest U.S. banks that they needed to be aware of how the situation on Wall Street looked to the rest of the country, CBS News reported on Friday. 

 "Show some restraint," Obama said he told the bankers who met him at the White House. "Show that you get that this is a crisis and everybody has to make sacrifices." Asked how the bankers reacted, Obama told CBS News in an interview: "They agreed and they recognized it. Now the proof of the pudding is in the eating." (Editing by  Peter Cooney )
