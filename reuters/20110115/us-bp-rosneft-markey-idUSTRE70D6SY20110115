 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A high-ranking Democrat in the U.S. Congress on Friday called for a careful U.S. government review of a share swap between BP and Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft to see if the deal could have an impact on U.S. national security. 

 "If this agreement affects the national and economic security of the United States then it should be immediately reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Additionally, the U.S. State Department should closely monitor this transaction," said Representative Edward Markey. CFIUS is part of the Treasury Department. (Editing by  Gary Hill )
