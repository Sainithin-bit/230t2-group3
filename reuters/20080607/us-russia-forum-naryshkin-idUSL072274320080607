 ST PETERSBURG, Russia  (Reuters) - Kremlin chief of staff Sergei Naryshkin said on Saturday that BP Plc's interests were not always aligned with those of its Russian joint venture TNK-BP, repeating a criticism made by the venture's Russian shareholders. 

 TNK-BP, owned 50-50 by BP and a group of four Russian oligarchs, is currently the subject of a fierce dispute over strategy and future ownership. The company is highly profitable and made over $5 billion last year. "The oil and gas industry remains of course one of the key ones for the Russian economy so in this case we are interested in the development of all companies in this sector, including the TNK-BP firm," Naryshkin told Reuters and one Russian media. "I understand that on external markets the interests of TNK-BP as a united corporation and the interests of BP can overlap and not coincide with one another. And BP as a shareholder of TNK-BP must find a way to find a compromise in the case of such contradictions on the external market." TNK-BP's Russian shareholders have accused BP of trying to block the firm's expansion overseas by failing to approve projects at board level. TNK-BP senior managers say they are not opposed in principle to such projects but add that these must pass a rate of return test like any other investment. Naryshkin's remarks indicated that Kremlin thinking was closer to that of the Russian shareholders. "I am speaking of external markets. On external markets, the interests of BP and TNK-BP could clash and BP is at the same time the owner of BP and the shareholder of TNK-BP so BP is in a more difficult position to find a compromise way out of the situation," he said. The Kremlin has so far said it will stay out of the dispute and wants the shareholders to reach agreement among themselves. But few believe that the Russian government will not get involved in the fate of one of the country's most important energy companies, particularly since many industry experts say one of Russia's state-controlled energy giants wants to take a big stake.
