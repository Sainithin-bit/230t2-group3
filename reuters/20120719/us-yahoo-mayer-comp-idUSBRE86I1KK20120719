 (Reuters) - Marissa Mayer, Yahoo Inc's new chief executive officer will make $1 million in annual salary, $12 million in restricted stock and stock options, and one-time retention and performance awards of $30 million vesting over five years. 
 As Google Inc's first female engineer and one of the earliest employees, Mayer's net worth is already estimated to be as much as $300 million. (Reporting By  Jennifer Saba ; editing by  Andre Grenon )
