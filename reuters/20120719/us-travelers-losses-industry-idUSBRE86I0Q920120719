 (Reuters) - The insurance industry appears to have lost more than $10 billion in the second quarter on natural disasters, substantially more than historical trends would suggest, executives of Travelers Cos Inc ( TRV.N ) said on Thursday. 
 Travelers itself lost $357 million on natural disasters in the quarter, which Chief Executive Jay Fishman said would have been a more reasonable annual loss not that long ago. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
