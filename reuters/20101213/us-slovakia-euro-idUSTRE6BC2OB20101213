 BRATISLAVA  (Reuters) - Slovakia should draft a plan to potentially exit the euro zone if the currency club fails to bring its debt crisis under control, the country's parliamentary speaker and leader of a junior coalition party said on Monday. 

 Slovakia, the most recent adherent to the single currency, joined in January 2009 in the hope of ducking under its shield in times of crisis but has instead had to help out richer peers and dissented from proposals to bail out Greece. Richard Sulik, head of the Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) party, criticized the purchase of state bonds by the European Central Bank (ECB). In a column in daily Hospodarske Noviny, he said any attempt to use the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) rescue fund to help Spain, which is struggling to reassure investors it is in better fiscal shape than Greece or Ireland, would pose a risk to the euro. "It is irresponsible for other countries to take on the debt of indebted countries with euro resources and then get into problems themselves," Sulik, co-author of Slovakia's flat tax system introduced back in 2002, wrote. "Because of this, it is time for Slovakia to stop unquestionably trusting in the euro zone leaders' words and prepare a plan B. This would be a re-introduction of the Slovak crown." The bloc's poorest member, Slovakia agreed to the creation of the EFSF but refused to contribute to a loan to Greece, receiving a reprimand from the European Commission for breaching solidarity principles. "Because we are too small a country to significantly influence the actions of the EU, we must at least protect the values which have been created by people living in Slovakia," he wrote. Last week, Finance Minister Ivan Miklos rejected the idea of issuing common euro zone bonds and said he could not imagine a common fiscal union among euro states, which some are pushing for. No member of the right-of-center cabinet has yet to propose a plan to leave the 16 member currency zone. Sulik's SaS is the ruling coalition second strongest party and holds the economy ministry portfolio. (Reporting by Martin Santa; Editing by John Stonestreet)
