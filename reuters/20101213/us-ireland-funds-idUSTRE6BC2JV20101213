 LONDON  (Reuters) - Ireland's future as a magnet for international investment funds is secure even if its euro zone partners demand a shake-up of its corporate tax regime to boost its finances and curb risk of default on Irish sovereign bonds. 

 Fund managers, custodians and administrators who have flocked to Ireland to exploit its 12.5 percent corporation tax are more likely to swallow a rate hike than give up the swift route to market and the 'hands-off' approach to regulation that have become the hallmarks of an Irish domicile. "We are not looking at any other jurisdictions. We have a number of funds that we are due to launch and we are not considering changing at all," said Christopher Day, director of long-short fund platform Merchant Capital. Ireland has chipped away for several years at the dominance of longer-established fund hubs like Luxembourg. Funds domiciled in Ireland had $1.04 trillion in net assets at end-June, up 11.6 percent year on year, compared with 8.4 percent growth seen in Luxembourg's $2.2 trillion industry over the same period, data from Thomson Reuters Lipper showed. Ireland is also home to a large slice of the global hedge funds custody and administration business, with about 42 percent of the world's hedge funds assets, according to data from the European Fund and Asset Management Association. The once booming Celtic Tiger economy, that saw years of rapid growth in financial services, had to call on the European Union and the International Monetary Fund last month for an 85 billion euro ($113 billion) bailout to fix the country's huge budget deficit. That has sparked doubts over whether the country can protect its envied corporate tax rate -- one of Europe's lowest -- as it fights to restore confidence in its ability repay its debts. There has been talk of an exodus of businesses to rival Luxembourg or new centers like Malta but the costs, efforts and consequences of quitting Ireland could far outweigh the benefits, managers said. "You can't just call Luxembourg and say: 'We're dumping Dublin, can we have an umbrella set up for this time next week?'. The response would be 'no'," said Michael Warren, investment director at Thames River, a unit of 108 billion pounds fund firm F&C Asset Management. "There's a big local workforce, which is now very experienced in what they do. Also, you can get your funds to market quite speedily and efficiently... That might be viewed by some as worth a small rise in tax rates," he said. NO SOVEREIGN RISK Ireland's former premier John Bruton, who set corporation tax at 12.5 percent in 1997, said tax receipts had exceeded forecasts in the first 10 months of 2010 by 300 million euros. "Clearly it would make no sense (to increase the tax), at a time when they want us to repay what we have borrowed fully and on time," said Bruton, now the chairman of IFSC Ireland, the body promoting Ireland as a global financial center. Nervous Chilean regulators provided a scare for the country's industry early last month, when they put Ireland's fund management industry on watch amid fears Chile's $6 billion of Irish-based investments were in danger. But fund management experts have rejected the view that the Irish funds industry has been fatally wounded by the country's near-junk credit rating. They point out that funds domiciled in Dublin are authorized by the central bank but are not dependent on the Irish economy. "The real risk in the funds world is who's holding your assets, namely: the custodian. There is no link to Irish sovereign risk," Mark White, head of the investment management group at Dublin-based law firm McCann Fitzgerald. White said he was seeing "a considerable increase" in new funds launched in Ireland, echoing sentiments from some hedge fund administrators who said the economic downturn had made the country more, not less, attractive as a global funds hub. "We've had two of our best-ever marketing trips in the last three weeks, to Russia and Brazil," said Peter O'Dwyer, director of Trinity Fund Administration, adding that costs have fallen since the crisis, with wages down in dollar and absolute terms. "I fail to see how discussions over the bailout have an impact on the funds industry," he said. Lobbyists for the Luxembourg funds industry have so far resisted temptation to entice managers away from Dublin, preferring instead to highlight their strengths and allow firms to draw their own comparisons. "What we're seeing is a very strong emphasis on long-term stability and that is social, political and fiscal stability," said Thomas Seale, vice chairman of the Association of the Luxembourg Fund Industry. But experts like Oliver S'Jacob, a partner at law firm Reed Smith, said Ireland was still better equipped to deal with applications for innovative funds than Luxembourg, where the regulator sometimes got "a bit bogged down" in detail. "It would cost half as much and take half as long in Ireland than if (clients) were to do it in Luxembourg," S'Jacob said.
