 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Supreme Court said on Monday that it deadlocked by a 4-4 vote and will not decide a copyright infringement case involving Costco Wholesale Corp over reselling luxury imported Swiss-made watches produced by a Swatch Group unit. 

 In a case between the top U.S. warehouse club and the world's largest watchmaker, the justices simply affirmed a U.S. appeals court ruling that Swatch's Omega unit retained the rights to watches it made and sold abroad that later were imported into this country. The Supreme Court's action was not a ruling on the merits of the dispute and it does not set a national precedent, but it does have the result of resolving the case in Omega's favor.
