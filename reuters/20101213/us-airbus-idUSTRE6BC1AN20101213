 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - Airbus ( EAD.PA ) raised its 20-year forecasts for aircraft demand and passenger traffic on Monday on the back of a "stronger than predicted" recovery in airlines powered by emerging markets. 

 The world's largest planemaker predicted deliveries of almost 26,000 new passenger and freight aircraft worth $3.2 trillion between 2010 and 2029, an increase of 900 compared with its previous annual forecast. "Demand for travel is doubling every 15 years ... but in places like India and China we expect to double in the next six years," Airbus sales chief John Leahy told a news conference. The EADS ( EAD.PA ) subsidiary forecast average annual growth in passenger traffic of 4.8 percent over the 2010-2029 period, up from a previous 20-year forecast of 4.7 percent. Rival Boeing ( BA.N ), which includes some aircraft below 100 seats in its forecasts, is predicting 30,900 total plane deliveries worth $3.6 trillion over 20 years.
