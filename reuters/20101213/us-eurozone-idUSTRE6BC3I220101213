 PARIS/BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Two major international financial institutions said Germany aggravated the euro zone crisis with talk about making bond investors pay, but Berlin seems set to get its way at this week's European Union summit. 

 EU leaders are not expected to announce new measures on Thursday and Friday to ease concerns about the region's debt, though one source reported intense efforts behind the scenes to find ways to shield Spain early next year from market pressure. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the head of the European Investment Bank (EIB) both said German Chancellor Angela Merkel's drive to make private bondholders share losses in any future euro sovereign default had intensified the crisis. "The surge in sovereign credit spreads began on October 18, when the French and German governments agreed to take steps that would make it possible to impose haircuts on bonds should a government not be able to service its debt," the Basel-based BIS said in its quarterly review. EIB president Philippe Maystadt said Merkel was absolutely right to demand a private sector contribution to financial rescues after an emergency safety net expires in 2013, "but the way it was presented created total confusion." EU leaders are set to approve a two-sentence amendment to the 27-nation bloc's Lisbon treaty that would create a permanent European Stabilization Mechanism to lend to distressed member states on strict conditions. They will also endorse a statement by euro zone finance ministers that private sector investors will be expected to contribute, on a case-by-case basis, in any sovereign debt restructuring after 2013. But at the insistence of Berlin and Paris, they are unlikely to increase the existing rescue fund or to take any action on a proposal for common European bonds to help resolve the crisis. EU sources said euro zone finance ministers would work in January on a more systemic response to the crisis, which has already forced Greece and Ireland to take EU/IMF bailouts and threatens to spread to Portugal, Spain and even Italy. NO ACTION ON E-BONDS Euro zone bond markets have entered an end-of-year lull as investors close their books, with yield premiums on peripheral debt just a touch wider on Monday. But EU officials fear another potential wave of selling early in the new year. The European Central Bank disclosed on Monday that it had increased purchases of euro zone government bonds to 2.667 billion euros ($3.5 billion) last week from 1.965 billion euros the previous week. It was the biggest weekly amount since late June but well below the levels reached in the first weeks of the disputed program. The ECB has bought 72 billion euros in bonds -- exclusively Greek, Irish and Portuguese, analysts believe -- since it began intervening in May to stabilize markets. The purchases have been "sterilized" by withdrawing liquidity to prevent any inflationary impact. ECB policymakers have repeatedly signaled that the central bank cannot bear the brunt of fire-fighting, urging governments to increase reform efforts and boost EU contingency funds. A German government spokesman said indications were that the summit would not take up a proposal for common euro zone bonds made by Jean-Claude Juncker, chairman of the currency area's finance ministers, and Italian Economy Minister Giulio Tremonti. The spokesman also told a news briefing he was not aware of any examination of an extension of the existing European Financial Stability Facility, as reported by the Financial Times. The newspaper said European officials were considering using the EFSF to buy bonds of distressed states without resorting to fully fledged bailouts. However, the German spokesman said that would be a bad idea and a senior euro zone source told Reuters it would breach EU rules and was not being seriously considered. Another EU source said intensive work was focusing on ways to make European crisis management instruments more flexible and better able to help countries before they get shut out of credit markets. The crucial aim was to ringfence Spain, the fourth largest euro zone economy. Madrid was taking energetic measures to avoid being sucked down with the crisis, the source said. Bank of Spain Governor Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez said on Monday that market attention to Spain's debt problems had come late but must be heeded. Although Spanish banks had performed well in EU-wide stress tests in July, "the markets seem to have forgotten about this and are following the logic (that) if Ireland had property and banking problems, something similar could happen in Spain," he said. The best response was for Spanish banks to give detailed quarterly reports on their exposure to property developers and bad loan ratios, Ordonez said, adding that Spanish banks were reasonably well capitalized and investors would have a great opportunity to buy into restructured savings banks next year. The EU source said experts were studying how to access the EFSF's full 440 billion euros if necessary, despite pledges to maintain a cash buffer given to secure a top notch AAA credit rating for the rescue fund. Luxembourg Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn said the 'E-bond' proposal, designed to reduce the borrowing costs of troubled euro zone states and prevent speculation against their debt, had been excluded from the EU summit agenda. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast a subdued economic recovery for the euro zone due to deficit-cutting austerity measures. However, it endorsed the EU's drive to give budget consolidation priority over boosting growth.
