 (Reuters) - A panel of lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate agreed on Friday on legislation giving regulators oversight of the $615 trillion market in over-the-counter derivatives for the first time. 

 The proposals are part of a sweeping package of reforms in the wake of the financial crisis, which regulators say was exacerbated by OTC derivatives. The bill will return to the full House and Senate for approval, and lawmakers hope to have it to President Barack Obama for his signature into law by July 4. The reforms will fundamentally alter the unpoliced market, dominated by banks like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Bank of America. Exchanges stand to gain traffic, such as CME Group Inc and IntercontinentalExchange Inc. Also affected will be hedge funds, insurance companies and other speculators who seek profits in the swaps market -- as well as a wide range of manufacturers, commodity producers, small banks and other businesses that rely on swaps to hedge price and other risks. Here are the key elements of the swaps reforms: BANK SWAPS DESK SPIN-OFF * Objective: prevent taxpayer funds from bailing out swaps entities. * Requires banks to spin off swaps dealing desks for handling agricultural, energy and metals swaps, equity swaps, and uncleared credit default swaps into separately capitalized holding companies. * Allows banks to trade the largest classes of OTC derivatives in-house -- foreign exchange and interest rate swaps -- as well as gold and silver swaps, and derivatives designed to hedge their own risk. CLEARING OF SWAPS * Objective: reduce systemic risks from bad trades by sending "standardized" swaps through clearinghouses, which would require margins and guarantee payment. * Regulators can require particular swaps or types of swaps to be cleared. * "End-users" allowed exemptions from clearing to prevent hedgers from being saddled with new costs, as long as they explain to regulators how they are meeting their financial obligations. * Financing arms of manufacturers do not have to clear swaps used to help sell the parent company's products. * Clearinghouses can accept non-cash collateral for swaps. MANDATORY TRADING * Objective: increase transparency, lower costs. * Cleared swaps to be traded on exchanges or electronic platforms. HIGHER MARGINS FOR UNCLEARED SWAPS * Objective: Reduce risk by ensuring traders put up adequate margin and capital as defined by regulators. REPORTING OF SWAPS * Objective: increase transparency and make it easier for regulators to police trades. * All swaps to be reported to trade repositories or regulators. REGULATION OF CLEARINGHOUSES * Objective: give regulators oversight of clearinghouses. * Clearinghouse boards to include market participants. * Clearinghouses not forced to accept credit risk from other clearinghouses. * Clearinghouses can receive federal funds in emergencies if Federal Reserve governors and the Treasury secretary agree. REGULATION OF DEALERS AND MAJOR SWAP PARTICIPANTS * Objective: ensure major market players do not become systemically risky. * Registration required with regulators, which would set capital and margin standards, and other requirements. * Firms engaged in a "de minimis" amount of swap dealing with or on behalf of customers will be exempt from new rules. POSITION LIMITS * Objective: give regulators the ability to limit swaps positions held by a trader or class of traders. (Reporting by  Charles Abbott  and  Roberta Rampton )
