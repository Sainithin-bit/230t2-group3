 TORONTO  (Reuters) - The German government will not have to try to find more savings than already announced to comply with G20 recommendations on reducing budget deficits, Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told Reuters in an interview on Sunday. 

 After two days of meetings in Canada, world leaders from the Group of 20 rich and emerging nations agreed on Sunday that member countries would halve their deficits within three years. Schaeuble said Germany would not have to make changes to its austerity package to reach that goal. "The measures Germany has already agreed for the specific German situation correspond to this exactly," he said. He said Germany, Europe's largest economy, had not been criticized for its austerity package, adding that the country had a "very growth-friendly deficit reduction plan". Washington had appeared to be at loggerheads with Berlin over deficit reduction measures in the run-up to the Canada summit. U.S. officials had expressed concerns that a nascent recovery from the global recession could be derailed by accelerating austerity moves in much of Western Europe. German Chancellor Angela Merkel launched an 80 billion euro savings package this month targeting budget cuts and taxes over the next four years. "The biggest obstacle in Germany to boosting domestic demand is the uncertainty, the worry about too-high public deficits," Schaeuble said. "Therefore -- this is true for Germany at least -- when we reduce public deficits in a reasonable, clever and growth-friendly way, then we are boosting sustainable growth." Schaeuble said Germany would soon present a draft law on dealing with banks threatened by insolvency. "The draft law will be presented in the summer break," he said, adding that solutions are needed on an global level too. "What is clear is that we are all agreed we need to avoid the taxpayer being liable for risks in the financial sector in the future. And this means corresponding restructuring procedures are necessary to prevent systemic risk." He said the U.S. package on financial reform was encouraging because it showed the two countries were on a similar path. U.S. lawmakers hammered out a historic overhaul of financial regulations on the eve of the G20 summit that may crimp the industry's profits and subject it to tougher oversight and tighter restrictions.
