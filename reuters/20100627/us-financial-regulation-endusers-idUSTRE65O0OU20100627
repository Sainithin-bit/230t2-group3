 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The financing arms of so-called end user companies would not have to send their swaps through clearing houses when they assist in selling the parent company's products under language proposed by U.S. House of Representatives negotiators on Friday. 

 If accepted by Senate negotiators, the language would become part of a financial reform bill. Representative Gary Peters said the exemption would save end users from higher costs and would not be limited to business-related work. Companies such as Ford Motor Co, Deere & Co, Caterpillar Inc and Boeing have financing arms. (Reporting by  Charles Abbott , editing by Jackie Frank)
