 (Reuters) - Here are some developments as leaders of the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies meet in Canada. 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * World leaders put the finishing touches on plans to build a more stable global economy but backed away from one-size-fits-all pledges as two years of crisis give way to an uneven recovery. AUSTERITY VS STIMULUS * With sluggish growth in many developed countries, Washington fears Europe's drive to slash post-recession debt could derail the recovery, a worry also voiced by other G20 leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. * G20 leaders are set to announce a concerted effort to halve public sector deficits within three years and stabilize government debt. At the same time, they recognize the start of that process will take place at different speeds, according to a draft communique that Reuters obtained. BANK LEVY * The draft statement shows the G20 agreeing to give countries a choice on whether to levy a tax on banks in order to recoup the cost of bailouts. The United States and Europe have pushed for such a tax, while countries including Canada objected on the grounds their banks acted conservatively during the credit boom and should not be punished for the recent financial crisis. CHINESE YUAN * G20 sources said there would be no reference to China's yuan currency in a final statement to be issued when meetings conclude. An earlier version of the document, obtained by Reuters, had welcomed Beijing's recent move to loosen its grip on the yuan. PROTESTS * Police arrested more than 400 people after a demonstration against the summit turned violent on Saturday in downtown Toronto and they braced for more possible trouble. QUOTES * "This will be part of the final communique," German Chancellor Angela Merkel on G20 agreement to halve public sector deficits by 2013 and stabilize government debt. "Frankly spoken, this is more than I expected." "What we saw yesterday ... is a bunch of thugs that pretend to have a difference of opinion with policies and instead choose violence in order to express those so-called differences of opinion," Dimitri Soudas, spokesman for Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, on the protest violence.
