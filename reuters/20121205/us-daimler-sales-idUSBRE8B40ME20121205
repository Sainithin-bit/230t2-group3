 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Sales of Daimler's ( DAIGn.DE ) Mercedes-Benz luxury brand climbed 5.7 pct to 120,346 vehicles in November, an all-time high for that month, as rising U.S. volumes fully offset a decline in China. 
 Mercedes sales chief Joachim Schmidt reaffirmed the brand was on track to see record sales this year, adding: "I am particularly pleased about the favorable response to our new vehicles. Above all, the A-Class is developing excellently." While volumes in the United States rose 13.1 percent to 30,315 vehicles last month, they fell 6.6 percent to 16,876 in China, a key growth market for premium brands. Larger rivals Audi ( VOWG_p.DE ) and BMW ( BMWG.DE ) have been increasing their vehicle sales in China at double-digit rates, by comparison. (Reporting By Christiaan Hetzner)
