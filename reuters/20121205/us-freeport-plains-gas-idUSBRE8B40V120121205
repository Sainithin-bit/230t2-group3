 (Reuters) - Plains Exploration & Production Co will not have to sell gas assets to fund a recent acquisition as a result of its deal to sell itself to Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc, the chief executive of Plains said on Wednesday. 
 On a conference call to discuss the deal, Jim Flores also said he was bullish on natural gas prices from 2015 onward. (Reporting By  Ben Berkowitz ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
