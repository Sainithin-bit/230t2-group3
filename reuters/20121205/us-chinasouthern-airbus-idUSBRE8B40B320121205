 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - China Southern Airlines Co Ltd ( 1055.HK ) ( 600029.SS ) ( ZNH.N ), the country's largest carrier by fleet size, has agreed to buy 10 Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A330-300 aircraft for about $1.9 billion, to be delivered in stages from 2014 to 2016. 
 The deal is the second involving Europe's Airbus and a Chinese airliner since the European Union agreed on November 12 to "stop the clock" on plans to force non-EU airlines to adopt its Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). China Eastern Airlines ( 600115.SS ) ( 0670.HK ), one of the country's top three carriers, said in late November it had agreed to buy 60 Airbus A320 aircraft for about $5.4 billion. Chinese airlines have been buying aircraft from Airbus and rival Boeing ( BA.N ) over the past few years as more Chinese travel. China Southern said in a statement that the new aircraft would be funded through internal resources and loans from commercial banks and that the catalogue price of one Airbus A330-300 aircraft was $188 million, though airlines usually pay a lower price tag after negotiations. Shares of China Southern closed up 2.3 percent in Hong Kong, in line with a 2.2 percent gain for the benchmark Hang Seng Index  .HSI .
