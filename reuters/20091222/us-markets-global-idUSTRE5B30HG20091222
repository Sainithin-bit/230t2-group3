 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. and European shares closed around 14-month highs on Tuesday as surprisingly strong sales of previously owned U.S. homes boosted optimism about an economic recovery, also driving up the dollar. 

 The renewed appetite for risk sent prices of safer U.S. Treasuries down for the second consecutive day. Gold prices also hit a seven-week low. The dollar hit a two-month high against the Japanese yen and traded near a 3-1/2-month high against the euro as investors speculated the U.S. Federal Reserve may be forced to raise interest rates faster than forecast. U.S. existing home sales jumped 7.4 percent in November to an annual rate of 6.54 million units, the fastest pace since February 2007. Economists had expected sales at a pace of 6.25 million units. The housing data outweighed a disappointing final reading for U.S. third-quarter gross domestic product, which the government said expanded at an annual pace of 2.2 percent, below the 2.8 percent it had reported last month. "Further improvement in the housing market is likely to lend support to the equity market as we finish the year," said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at RidgeWorth Investments in Richmond, Virginia. "The housing market has been a key concern for equity investors all this year, so further progress is an encouraging sign as we get ready to start 2010." The housing data boosted construction shares, driving the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction index .DJUSHB up 3.9 percent and the S&P 500 to its highest closing in 14 months. Technology bellwethers also underpinned the market and helped the Nasdaq log a fresh 15-month high. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended up 50.79 points, or 0.49 percent, at 10,464.93, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 3.97 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,118.02. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished up 15.01 points, or 0.67 percent, at 2,252.67. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares rose 0.7 percent 1,035 points, its highest closed since October 3, 2008. The pan-European index is up more than 24 percent so far this year and up more than 60 percent from its lifetime low hit last March. Energy shares in Europe gained on Tuesday even as oil prices were lower earlier on the session. Heavyweights BP ( BP.L ), Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.AS ) and Total ( TOTF.PA ) rose between 1.1 and 1.9 percent. U.S. crude oil prices rebounded later on the session, however, to close up 68 cents, or 0.92 percent, at $74.40 per barrel. Oil prices rose ahead of weekly oil inventory reports expected to show that crude and distillate stocks fell last week. DOLLAR KEEPS RALLYING Higher Treasuries yields and expectations of a stronger U.S. economic rebound allowed the dollar to keep strengthening against major currencies. Against the Japanese yen, the greenback firmed 0.74 percent at 91.82. Earlier in the session, it hit 91.86 yen, its strongest level since late October. The euro dropped to $1.4219, according to Reuters data, the lowest level since early September. It was last down 0.21 percent at $1.4253. "The stronger housing market number helped dollar bulls regain control," said Kathy Lien, director of currency research at GFT Forex in New York. "Any negative sentiment from the U.S. GDP report was offset by another strong month for existing home sales." The stronger dollar also encouraged investors to sell gold, which fell below $1,080 per ounce to its lowest level since early November. Spot gold prices lasted traded down $8.30, or 0.76 percent, at $1,083.40 per ounce. The economic optimism drove investors away from U.S. Treasuries for the second consecutive day, but analysts said the moves were exaggerated by very thin volumes in a holiday-shortened week. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was trading 19/32, with the yield at 3.7538 percent, up from 3.68 percent late on Monday and the loftiest since mid-August. The Treasury yield curve remained at record steep levels, with the spread between two-year note yields and 10-year note yields holding at its widest on record at 285 basis points.
