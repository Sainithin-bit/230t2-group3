 CHICAGO/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. chicken producer Pilgrim's Pride Corp PPC.N said on Thursday it would post a significant quarterly loss and that, as a result, it expects to be out of compliance with a credit covenant, sending its shares down as much as 40 percent. 

 The company issued the statement in response to Wednesday's 38 percent slide of its share price, prompted by investor concerns the U.S. financial crisis would limit its access to credit. That admission led Standard and Poor's to lower its credit rating on the poultry company even deeper on Thursday, into junk territory to CCC+ from BB-. The rating agency said Pilgrim's has about $26 million in interest payments on November 1. Pilgrim's Pride has struggled more than competitors in the meat industry due in part to a heavy debt load. "This is an income statement issue. They will have to get chicken prices to go up or corn prices to go down in the next four weeks and I doubt that is going to happen," said Morningstar analyst Ann Gilpin. "Bankruptcy is a very real possibility here." Asked to comment on speculation it may seek bankruptcy protection, Pilgrim's Pride spokesman Gary Rhodes said in an e-mail: "We don't comment on rumors or speculation. As we said in our press release, our focus right now is on finalizing a written agreement with the banks to provide a temporary waiver on the fixed-charge coverage ratio covenant. "We have reached an understanding, now we need to complete the agreement." In its statement, Pilgrim's Pride did not quantify the expected quarterly loss, which it attributed to high feed costs, weak demand and prices for chicken breast meat, and a major negative impact of hedged grain positions. Analysts had forecast a loss of 99 cents a share, excluding special items, for the fourth quarter ending on September 27, according to Reuters Estimates. The company has reported losses in each of its previous three quarters. Due to the expected loss, Pilgrim's Pride said it recently told its lenders it did not expect to be in compliance with its fixed-charge coverage ratio covenant under its principal credit facilities for this fiscal year. Gilpin said that might mean the company's operating profit may not be enough to make interest payments on the debt. The company said it thought it had reached an understanding with its lenders to temporarily waive that covenant through October 28 and to provide continued liquidity under those facilities for that time. It expects to be in compliance with all other covenants as of the end of fiscal 2008. Pilgrims shares closed down 39.72 percent at $3.84 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after falling to $3.26 earlier in the session, the lowest since the early 1990s. BUYING TIME? "No lender is going to be calling them on these loans. I think all the lenders are in agreement that they will let them survive at least for another couple of months, at least to see if chicken prices improve," said Rich Nelson, an analyst at Allendale Inc. "I don't think it is as dire as the market is trading right now, but certainly Pilgrim's is in a bad financial situation." The chicken industry has suffered this year due to high prices for feed and fuel. Ample meat supplies have prevented companies from raising prices enough to cover higher costs. A weak U.S. economy has also caused consumers to shift to cheaper foods and to dine out less. Pilgrim's Pride has struggled more than most, in part because of some $1.5 billion in long-term debt it took on after its January 2007 purchase of smaller rival Gold Kist Inc. To cope, the company has closed plants and reduced production. It has shortened the length of its meat contracts with customers to more quickly pass on the higher costs. The shares of competitors Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) and Sanderson Farms Inc ( SAFM.O ) rose on Thursday after being down on Wednesday amid the fallout at Pilgrim's. Neither Tyson or Sanderson is in immediate danger of covenant violation, JPMorgan analyst Ken Goldman said in a note early on Thursday. Tyson shares rose 7.9 percent, while Sanderson gained 6.15 percent. (Additional reporting by  Ajay Kamalakaran  in Bangalore; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
