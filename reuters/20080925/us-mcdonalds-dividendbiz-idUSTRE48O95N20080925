 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hamburger chain McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) said on Thursday it would raise its quarterly cash dividend by 33 percent to 50 cents per share as strong sales helped boost its overall cash from operations. 

 Shares in McDonald's rose almost 1 percent to $62.83 in after-market trade following the announcement, which brings the company's quarterly dividend payout to more than $550 million. "We are confident in our ability to invest in key growth opportunities and maintain a strong credit rating even as we return a significant amount of cash to shareholders," McDonald's Chief Executive Jim Skinner said in a statement. McDonald's has been outperforming most of its rivals in the restaurant industry by focusing on value and convenience. The Oak Brook, Illinois-based company plans to return $15 billion to $17 billion in cash to shareholders from 2007 to 2009. It returned $5.7 billion to shareholders in 2007 and $5.1 billion so far this year via a combination of dividends and share repurchases. McDonald's has raised its dividend each year since its first payout to shareholders in 1976. Shares in the company, which closed at $62.27 on the New York Stock Exchange, are up nearly 6 percent so far this year.
