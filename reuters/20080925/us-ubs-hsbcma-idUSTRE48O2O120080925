 ZURICH/LONDON  (Reuters) - HSBC is not in talks to buy UBS, a person familiar with the matter said after renewed speculation about interest from Europe's largest bank lifted the Swiss bank's shares more than 5 percent on Thursday. 

 There has been frequent talk that Britain's HSBC ( HSBA.L ) is interested in UBS ( UBSN.VX ), which is the world's largest wealth manager but has lost billions of dollars from its exposure to U.S. subprime mortgage related assets. Speculation of a possible merger with direct rival Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) has also been doing the rounds in the market and it fueled a rally last week. Shares in UBS were up 4.98 percent at 21.08 Swiss francs at 1200 GMT, making it one of the best performing stocks among European banks and outperforming a 1.08 rise in the DJ Stoxx index of European lenders .SX7P. HSBC shares were up 0.32 percent at 868.25 pence. "There's a rumor of HSBC for UBS again, unconfirmed," said one trader earlier on Thursday. But the person familiar with the matter said HSBC was not in talks with its Swiss peer about a deal. UBS and HSBC declined to comment. HSBC executives have said they will target deals and growth plans on emerging markets, playing down the prospect of big deals in the United States or Europe. But they are also keen to build up its private banking business and UBS, despite its troubles, is a well-respected franchise in Asia and globally, and some analysts regard it as a better fit for HSBC than other western banks it is regularly linked with. HSBC is seen as a potential rescuer of many banks as it has strong capital, liquidity and deposit base, and its shares have outperformed rivals during the credit crisis. Yet, analysts believe Swiss regulators would not easily swallow a takeover deal that would put one of Switzerland's most prized assets into foreign hands.
