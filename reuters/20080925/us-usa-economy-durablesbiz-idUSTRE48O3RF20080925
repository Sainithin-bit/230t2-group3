 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for long-lasting manufactured goods dropped by a sharper-than-expected 4.5 percent in August as demand for transportation equipment and many other costly items plummeted, the Commerce Department said on Thursday. 

 Last month's slump in orders for durable goods - items intended to last three years or more -- followed a revised 0.8 percent July increase, previously reported as a 1.3 percent gain. Wall Street economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a 1.6 percent decline in August orders. Excluding transportation, August durables orders were down 3 percent after edging up 0.1 percent in July. The fall in orders excluding transportation was the steepest since the beginning of 2007. Transportation orders tumbled 8.9 percent in August after rising 2.8 percent in July. Non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, seen as a barometer of business spending plans, were down 2 percent after increasing by 0.4 percent in July.
