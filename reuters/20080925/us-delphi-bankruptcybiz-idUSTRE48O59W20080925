 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delphi Corp DPHIQ.PK on Thursday said it had reached a preliminary agreement with its creditors' committee and former parent General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on changes to GM's support for the auto-parts maker's plan to emerge from bankruptcy protection. 

 Pending final agreement, the creditors would withdraw their objections to the plan, which calls for GM to provide $10.6 billion in support, including the assumption of $3.4 billion in pension obligations for Delphi's hourly workers. Possible scenarios include GM accepting preferred Delphi shares, or splitting administrative proceeds 50-50 with Delphi's unsecured creditors. Delphi's board has approved the changes, and GM is expected to do so later on Thursday, Delphi lawyer Jack Butler told the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. A court hearing on the matter will resume later on Thursday. Delphi has argued increased GM support was crucial to its emergence from bankruptcy protection, which it has said it hopes to do by the end of this year. The company has operated under court protection since October 2005. Under its revised proposal -- which earlier met opposition from creditors concerned it would reduce their payout -- much of the financial support that GM had planned to offer upon Delphi's emergence from bankruptcy would be paid out earlier.
