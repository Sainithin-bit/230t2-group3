 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil settled more than $2 higher on Thursday as U.S. lawmakers hammered out a $700 billion agreement to rescue the ailing banking sector. 

 Oil traders said the deal could help the world's largest energy consuming nation avoid a deep recession that would cut deeply into fuel demand. "We are going up because we are rescue happy today. I think people are just kind of getting giddy over the bailout again," said Phil Flynn, analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago. U.S. crude rose $2.29 to settle at $108.02 a barrel while London Brent crude rose $2.15 to $104.60. U.S. lawmakers appeared close to a final agreement on the massive bailout, which would add up to more than the total lending by the International Monetary Fund since its inception after World War Two. "My hope is that we can reach agreement (on a bailout) very shortly," U.S. President George W. Bush said. The move comes after an agonizing stretch for Wall Street, in which investment bank Lehman Brothers LEH.N filed for bankruptcy, insurer AIG ( AIG.N ) was bailed out by the government and Merrill Lynch MER.N was forced to sell itself to Bank of America ( BAC.N ). Concerns about the weakening U.S. economy have pushed crude prices down from a record high above $147 a barrel hit in the middle of July, with mounting evidence of slowing fuel demand. A U.S. government report released on Wednesday showed demand in the top oil consuming nation over the past four weeks running 5.3 percent below last year, hit by high fuel costs and the wider economic crisis. Analysts said a slow recovery in oil and gas production in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico from Hurricane Ike, falling U.S. inventories and lower OPEC supplies were also supportive for prices on Thursday. As of Thursday morning, nearly 60 percent of the crude oil production from the Gulf of Mexico remained shut because of the impact of hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Over the past month, more than 30 million barrels of U.S. crude production have been lost to the storms along with more than 50 million barrels of refined fuel production, pushing U.S. gasoline inventories to their lowest level since 1967. But the International Energy Agency said it sees no need to release emergency supplies. "We don't have to mobilize," IEA Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka said. "The market is now taking care of the current situation." (Additional reporting by  Jane Merriman ,  Joe Brock ,  Alex Lawler  in London and  Fayen Wong  in Perth; editing by  Matthew Lewis )
