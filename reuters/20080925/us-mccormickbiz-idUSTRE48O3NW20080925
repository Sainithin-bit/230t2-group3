 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Spice maker McCormick & Co Inc ( MKC.N ) posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by price increases and a boost to its product marketing. 

 Net earnings rose to $68.6 million, or 52 cents a share, in the third quarter ended on August 31 from $56.8 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items such as a gain on the sale of the Season-All business, earnings were 50 cents a share, ahead of the analysts' average forecast of 48 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 9 percent to $781.6 million. In the consumer business, sales rose 14 percent, helped by volume growth and price increases. In its industrial business, the company reported a 3 percent sales increase. McCormick said a decline in sales to restaurant clients in the Americas and Europe mitigated higher prices. The company, which sells spices, seasons and food coloring, said it still expected fiscal-year sales to show an increase of 9 percent to 10 percent. It raised its view for full-year earnings per share by 1 cent to a range of $2.04 to $2.08 because of a higher-than-expected gain for the sale of Season-All.
