 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Dell DELL.O, the world's second biggest computer maker, expects to grow faster than other companies in the business, Chief Executive Michael Dell told a news conference on Thursday. 

 "You will see Dell grow faster than the rest of the industry in Europe and in the world," Dell said. Asked what impact the turmoil in financial markets would have on Dell's business, he said, "I am sure there will be some impact -- what impact is not exactly clear given the nature of the situation," adding that Dell's business was well diversified and growing in Brazil, Russia, India and China. He was speaking after meeting European Union officials on his company's plans to be a leader in environment-friendly technologies and in producing energy-efficient devices. Dell said his company would continue to expand a network of retail stores, focusing on the United States and China, but also growing in Europe. "Give us a couple of quarters and you will see the retail presence double in Europe," he said. Dell has recently switched from a pure online and phone sales model to build an expanding network of retail stores, putting its PCs and laptops within the reach of consumers without Internet access. Dell declined to comment on a newspaper report that his firm was trying to sell factories around the world to improve profitability. "This is a rumor and I don't comment on rumours. We have our own factories and we contract manufacturing," he said. He said Dell, which has bought nine companies in the last two years, would continue to make acquisitions but they would be small. Asked if Dell would launch its own mobile telephone, following the example of Google ( GOOG.O ), he said: "Not this year" and added that Dell's devices with communication chips were getting smaller and smaller anyway. Asked if a Dell mobile phone could be expected next year, he said: "Ask me next year." (Writing by  Marcin Grajewski ; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
