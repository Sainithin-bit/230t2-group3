 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services ( DFS.N ), the fourth-largest credit-card network, on Thursday posted an 11 percent drop in net income, as its provision for loan losses rose sharply. 

 The Riverwoods, Illinois-based company said quarterly net income fell to $180 million, or 37 cents a share, from $202 million, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue net of interest expense increased to $1.25 billion from $1.16 billion a year earlier. Discover's provision for loan losses more than doubled to $364.8 million from $145.8 million in the year-ago period, as net charge-offs rose. Managed loans grew 6 percent to $50 billion in comparison with the  same period last year, but the company said its 30-day delinquency rate rose to 3.58 percent from 2.81 percent a year ago. Discover's shares have fallen close to 30 percent in the last year, but have recovered some ground since hitting a 52-week low of $11.17 last week. The shares closed at $15.22 on Wednesday.
