 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mississippi's attorney general said on Friday he would propose legislation to force State Farm, the largest home insurer in the United States, to continue writing new policies in the state. 


 But his efforts were not supported by other state officials, including the governor and insurance commissioner. State Farm has said it will stop writing new policies for homeowners and small businesses in Mississippi following legal battles over claims in the state from Hurricane Katrina in 2005. On Friday, Attorney General Jim Hood condemned the company's decision, calling State Farm a "robber baron" and accusing it of "decadent actions" in Mississippi. The battle between Hood and State Farm has become increasingly bitter since January 26 when a federal court judge rejected a settlement between the company and 1,000 Gulf Coast homeowners with Katrina-related claims. Insurers like State Farm, which insures more than 30 percent of Mississippi homeowners, say their policies do not cover damage from flood waters. Hood has insisted that insurers are liable for flood as well as wind damage caused by hurricanes. Hood said on Friday that he had asked Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour and Insurance Commissioner George Dale to issue emergency orders requiring insurance companies to continue writing home policies until the state legislature can act. But Barbour said in a statement that he had no authority to force State Farm or any private company to sell its products in Mississippi. Dale said the state should "proceed cautiously and carefully to make sure we ... do not jeopardize our already fragile insurance market." State Farm fired back at Hood, saying he was part of the problem. "This is a remarkable response to what was just a business decision, but it does underscore the legal and political challenges faced in Mississippi," spokesman Fraser Engerman said. "We want to continue to serve our customers in Mississippi, but it seems some are intent on making that more difficult." Engerman said Hood's actions "show just how unpredictable and untenable the current environment can be." LOOKING TO FLORIDA Hood said he had based his proposal on recent legislation passed in Florida, which temporarily prohibited cancellation and non-renewal of homeowner policies until the new Florida insurance statute goes into effect. Dale, the insurance commissioner, urged caution. "We are seeing companies leave Florida and rate increases ... up to 1,100 percent in many areas of that state," he said. Under Hood's proposed legislation, a company selling auto insurance in Mississippi, and both auto and home insurance in other states, would be required to also sell homeowner insurance in the state. State Farm has said it wants to sell auto insurance, but not new homeowner policies.
