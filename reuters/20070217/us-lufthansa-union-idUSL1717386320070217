 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German service union Verdi said on Saturday it had agreed with Deutsche Lufthansa ( LHAG.DE ) a pay deal giving around 42,000 ground and cabin crew in the Germn airline a 3.4 percent increase in wages. 


 The union said in a statement the deal included a one-time payment of 525 euros ($689) for the months of January to April. Separately, Lufthansa said the deal would be valid until the end of May 2008, but excluded 15,000 cabin crew who were part of an existing wage contract valid until the end of 2008. Lufthansa had offered workers a 2.6 percent wage rise while Verdi wanted 5.8 percent.
