 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Corp. ( HOG.N ) said on Friday it had reached a tentative agreement to end a strike by 2,800 workers at its largest plant. 


 The U.S. motorcycle maker declined to disclose details of the proposed deal that would end a walkout at its plant in York, Pennsylvania, which entered its third week on Friday. The company said it would not specify when production would resume at the plant, which makes its Touring and Softail motorcycles. Harley said the agreement was subject to ratification by workers and that a vote was expected some time next week. A spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents the striking workers, confirmed that an agreement had been reached. Picketing is expected to stop tomorrow, and a vote by the rank and file will likely take place next week. The strike, the first at the motorcycle maker in 16 years, began on February 2, after the workers rejected the company's "last, best and final" offer for a new three-year contract. Harley, which has a number of major union contracts expiring over the next year, had been seeking a variety of concessions from workers, including a new two-tier wage-and-benefit plan. Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based based Harley said the concessions were necessary to help the company, which is enjoying growing sales and profit, avoid finding itself "in the same position that the Detroit auto industry is in now" 10 years down the road. The walkout was already hurting Harley and its suppliers, with Harley warning that its first-quarter shipments would not meet forecasts and that layoffs at motorcycle component plants in Wisconsin that supply the striking plant were likely. Analysts estimated that each day of the strike cost Harley $11 million in lost sales, and about one penny per share in earnings. (Additional reporting by  Franklin Paul  in New York)
