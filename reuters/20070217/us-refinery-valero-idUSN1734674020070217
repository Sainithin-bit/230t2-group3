 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Federal safety investigators headed for a Texas refinery on Saturday, a day after an explosion and fire shut the plant operated by leading U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp., a government spokesman said. 


 Three workers were in a Lubbock, Texas, burn center following the explosion in a residual oil unit at the 158,000 barrel per day (bpd) refinery in the city of Sunray, Texas, Valero spokeswoman Mary Rose Brown said on Saturday. Three other refinery workers were expected to be released from area hospitals on Saturday, Brown said. Thirteen workers were treated and released by hospitals on Friday. Valero was just beginning the process of examining when repairs could be made to the refinery and production resume, Brown said. It has already had to buy gasoline, diesel and other motor fuels to make up for the supply lost from the refinery, the company said. Investigators for the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board will initially focus on the explosion at the Sunray refinery, but could widen their probe to include three other fires this year at Valero refineries in Texas City, Texas, and Delaware City, Delaware, said CSB spokesman Daniel Horowitz. "We've certainly noticed there have been a number of incidents," Horowitz told Reuters in phone interview. "But, first and foremost we're going to look into the Sunray incident." Brown said the fire, which broke out in a propane deasphalting unit, was "essentially extinguished" by Saturday morning. Valero L.P., a pipeline operator spun off this year from the refiner, has shut crude-oil pipelines leading to the refinery from central Texas and Colorado, according to a statement. Valero L.P. has also shut pipelines that carry gasoline and other motor fuels to north and west Texas, New Mexico and Colorado. A lengthy CSB investigations and injured workers lawsuits have proved costly for refiners in recent years. The deadly BP Texas City blast, which killed 15 workers and injured 170 workers, is still be probed by the CSB and has forced the company to set aside $1.6 billion to settle lawsuits.
