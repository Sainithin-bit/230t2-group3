 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Insurer Coventry Health Care Inc. CVH.N said on Monday it would acquire the owner of Vista Healthplans for $685 million to expand its presence into Florida. 

 Vista has annual revenue of about $1.2 billion and about 295,000 members. About 85 percent of the membership is in the South Florida market with the rest in North Central Florida and the state's panhandle. "This acquisition will expand Coventry's health plan footprint into one of the nation's fastest growing states," Coventry CEO Dale Wolf said in a statement. The deal would add 153,000 members to Coventry's health plans serving employers, as well 83,000 members in Medicaid low-income plans and 26,000 in Medicare Advantage plans for the elderly. The Bethesda, Maryland-based company would also gain 33,000 members in plans sold directly to individuals, doubling Coventry's membership in that area from the first quarter. Coventry, the sixth-largest U.S. health insurer by market value, reported nearly 4.1 million total members as of the end of March. Coventry expects the acquisition of Florida Health Plan Administrators LLC, the owner of Vista Healthplans, to close within 180 days and help 2008 earnings per share by 8 cents to 11 cents. Analysts on average expect Coventry to earn $4.47 per share next year, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Coventry shares fell 10 cents to $60.17 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
