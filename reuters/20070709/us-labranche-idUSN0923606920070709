 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - LaBranche & Co. Inc. LAB.N, which runs one of the largest equity specialist trading outfits on the New York Stock Exchange floor, may consider selling all or part of itself to salvage its floor-trading business, a person familiar with the matter said on Monday. 

 LaBranche may also consider going private to fix its specialist business, the source said. The news sent LaBranche shares up more than 5 percent. LaBranche announced in a statement on Monday a strategic review of its business, but declined to give specifics. The company also said it would sell its equity specialist operation on the American Stock Exchange to Cohen Specialists Llc for an undisclosed sum. It expects to report a second-quarter net loss due to charges related to its stake in NYSE Euronext NYX.PA NYX.N, the New York Stock Exchanges' parent. LaBranche has a market capitalization of $486 million and owns about 3.1 million shares of NYSE Euronext. Further, the company said it expects to incur a substantial non-cash charge for a write-down of its intangible assets related to its entire specialist business. SPECIALISTS ON THE EDGE LaBranche's decision to undertake a strategic review comes at a time when growth in electronic trading volume has led Wall Street to discount the role of human specialists in trading. The NYSE floor itself is rife with speculation about which of the seven specialist firms will be the first to leave. Traditionally, specialists facilitate buying and selling of particular stocks through auctions and maintain order. But with new regulations and the NYSE's adoption of a "hybrid" model that increases the use of automation, LaBranche and the other specialists have seen their revenues plummet. LaBranche has reduced its headcount on the floor by more than half since last year. It also reported a first-quarter loss as trading revenue plunged 59 percent. LaBranche said in a May filing it was focusing on building electronic trading algorithms to stem revenue losses and boost specialist participation, but could not guarantee higher profits. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N, which acquired the remainder of Bear Wagner Specialists to manage the struggling business better, said in May it would write down $225 million from its 2001 investment as electronic systems siphon more trading business from specialist firms. The Dutch parent of another specialist firm, Van Der Moolen Specialists USA, said in a June filing that electronic trading had substantially cut into the stock order flow executed by specialists. "If conditions do not improve or deteriorate further, our revenues will continue to be adversely affected," Van Der Moolen Holding NV said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. NYSE Euronext officials have repeatedly said the trading floor will continue to be central to its exchange, although it is expected to shrink further within a year. "Specialists are an important part of our marketplace and provide great value to investors and issuers," said NYSE Euronext spokesman Richard Adamonis. Excluding charges and losses related to its NYSE Euronext investment, LaBranche said it would post a profit for the second quarter. The company will retain investment advisory firm Freeman & Co. Securities Llc and law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP to assist in the strategic review process. LaBranche shares were up 39 cents at $7.90 on the NYSE.
