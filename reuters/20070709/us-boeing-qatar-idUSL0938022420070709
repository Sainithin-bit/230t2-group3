 LONDON  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) confirmed on Monday that Qatar Airways is a customer for its new 787 Dreamliner model which rolled out of the factory at the weekend. 

 "Qatar is a customer, but we cannot discuss their order," a spokesman for the planemaker said. An order for 30 787s, worth almost $5 billion at list prices, was recorded on Boeing's online order book in April, attributed to an unidentified customer. People familiar with the deal have said Qatar was the buyer. The Boeing spokesman declined to comment on that deal. A spokeswoman for Qatar Airways said the airline had not announced a 787 order. The airline's brand was among those painted on the livery of the first 787 which rolled out of Boeing's plant in Everett, Washington, on Sunday. CEO Akbar al-Baker told reporters late last month they would have to wait for an announcement from the airline regarding the 787.
