 (Reuters) - Data storage company EMC Corp.'s ( EMC.N ) subsidiary, VMware, said it expects its initial public offering to be priced between $23 and $25 per share. 

 In an amended filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission, the software company registered 33 million shares of its Class A common stock. Following the offering, VMware will have two classes of common stock, Class A and B, and EMC will continue to be the controlling stockholder. EMC will own 32.5 million Class A and all 300 million Class B shares, representing about 89 percent of the company's outstanding shares, the filing said. Underwriters include Citigroup ( C.N ), JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), Lehman Brothers LEH.N, Merrill Lynch MER.N and Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ). The company has granted its underwriters an option to purchase up to 4.95 million additional shares of Class A stock to cover over-allotments. VMware expects net proceeds of about $741.4 million, assuming an offering price of $24 per share. It plans to use the proceeds to repay about $350 million of debt owed to EMC to fund a dividend, to buy headquarter facilities and for working capital, among other things. The Palo Alto, California-based company reported net income of about $85.9 million on total revenue of $703.9 million in 2006. VMware said its Class A common stock has been approved for listing on New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "VMW." In the filing, the company also said Intel Corp.'s ( INTC.O ) investment unit, Intel Capital, has agreed to invest $218.5 million in VMware's Class A stock at $23 per share, subject to conditions.
