 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private-equity firm Apollo Management raised its offer for U.S. chemical company Huntsman Corp. ( HUN.N ) by 75 cents a share Sunday night to $28 a share, The Wall Street Journal Online reported on Monday. 

 The new offer values Huntsman at around $6.5 billion, according to the report, which cited a person familiar with the negotiations. None of the companies was immediately available to comment. Dutch-based Basell BASL.UL, controlled by U.S. industrial group Access Industries, last month agreed to buy Huntsman for $5.6 billion, excluding debt, or $25.25 per share. Huntsman shares closed Friday at $28.
