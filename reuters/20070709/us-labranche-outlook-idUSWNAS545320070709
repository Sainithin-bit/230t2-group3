 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - LaBranche & Co. Inc. LAB.N, which runs one of the largest equity specialist trading operations on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, said on Monday it would begin a strategic review of the company, sending its shares up more than 5 percent in morning trading. 

 The company also said it would sell its equity specialist operation on the American Stock Exchange and report a second-quarter net loss due to charges related to its stake in NYSE Euronext NYX.PA NYX.N. The company said it expects to incur a substantial non-cash charge for a writedown of its intangible assets related to its specialist business. LaBranche will sell its Amex operation to Cohen Specialists, Llc., which focuses on mid-market companies, for an undisclosed sum. The company will retain investment advisory firm Freeman & Co Securities Llc and law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP to assist in the strategic review process. It did not disclose what the "strategic alternatives" would be. LaBranche has been hurt by the Big Board's move to electronic trading. Human "specialists," who facilitate buying and selling of stocks on the floor through auctions, have seen trading volumes drop after the NYSE introduced its "hybrid" model that increases use of automation. LaBranche has reduced its headcount on the floor by more than half since last year. It also reported a first-quarter loss as trading revenue plunged 59 percent due to the Big Board's shift to electronic trading and the elimination of commissions. Other NYSE specialists too have felt the squeeze on earnings. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N, which acquired the remainder of Bear Wagner Specialists to manage the struggling business better, said in May it will write down $225 million from its 2001 investment as electronic systems siphon more trading business from specialist firms. The Dutch parent of another specialist firm, Van Der Moolen Specialists USA, said in a June filing that electronic trading has substantially cut into the stock order flow executed by specialists. "If conditions do not improve or deteriorate further, our revenues will continue to be adversely affected," Van Der Moolen Holding NV said in its U.S. SEC filing. NYSE Euronext officials have repeatedly said the trading floor will continue to be central to its exchange, although it is expected to shrink further within a year. "Specialists are an important part of our marketplace and provide great value to investors and issuers," said NYSE Euronext spokesman Richard Adamonis. Excluding charges and losses related to its NYSE Euronext investment, LaBranche said it would post a profit for the second quarter. LaBranche shares were up 39 cents at $7.90 on the NYSE.
