 PARIS  (Reuters) - French food group Danone ( DANO.PA ) said on Monday it expected its acquisition of Dutch food group Numico NUMCc.AS to increase its net debt by 7 billion euros ($9.54 billion). 

 The 12.3 billion-euro deal comes after Danone agreed to sell its biscuit business for 5.3 billion euros. "This is a good opportunity to put more debt on our balance sheet," Danone Chief Finance Director Antoine Giscard d'Estaing said in a conference call with analysts. "...even if the net debt generated with this acquisition is 7 billion euros.." Giscard d'Estaing also said the deal would boost Danone's revenues in the medium term. "We think that on the top of the existing exceptional growth of Numico we will have a capacity to accelerate this growth and between years three and four, we should be able to generate additional sales between 120 and 140 million euros," Giscard d'Estaing said.
