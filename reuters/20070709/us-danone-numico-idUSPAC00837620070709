 PARIS  (Reuters) - Danone ( DANO.PA ) said it expected its acquisition of Dutch food group Numico NUMCc.AS to benefit its revenues more than its costs after announcing the all-cash deal on Monday. 

 Asked where the synergies would come from, Danone Chief Executive Franck Riboud said in a conference call: "It's a combination of both of them (revenue and cost saving) but we probably have far more (synergies) in top line impact." Numico Chief Executive Jan Bennink said he planned to resign after the deal closed. "Once you have been CEO it is quite hard not to be CEO...Two captains on the same ship is probably not ideal so we came to an agreement that on the deal's closure I will probably step down," Bennink said in the conference call.
