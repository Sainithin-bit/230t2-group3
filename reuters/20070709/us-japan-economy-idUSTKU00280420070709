 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's core private-sector machinery orders, a key gauge of corporate capital spending, rose 5.9 percent in May from the previous month, government data showed on Monday. 

 That compared with economists' consensus forecast for a 2.3 percent increase, following 2.2 percent rise in April, the Cabinet Office said. Compared with a year earlier, core orders, which exclude those for ships and machinery at electric power firms, fell 3.1 percent, against a median forecast for a 6.7 percent decline. The Cabinet Office said in May that core orders, a highly volatile series regarded as an indicator of capital spending in the coming six to nine months, were expected to show a fall of 11.8 percent in April-June from the previous quarter.
