 (Reuters) - Huntington Bancshares Inc. ( HBAN.O ) expects second-quarter earnings below analysts' estimates, primarily due to a charge of 11 cents a share related to higher loan loss provision and merger-related costs. 

 The U.S. Midwest regional bank sees earnings of 34 cents a share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 45 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore)
