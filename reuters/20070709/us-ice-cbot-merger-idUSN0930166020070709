 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The head of the IntercontinentalExchange Inc. ( ICE.N ) on Monday declined to say whether the ICE would offer a higher bid for the Chicago Board of Trade. 

 ICE is in a battle with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange CME.N to purchase the Chicago Board of Trade BOT.N. The CME on Friday increased its takeover offer for CBOT to $11.9 billion, besting the ICE's current offer worth about $11.8 billion. "I can't talk about it. Give me a break," ICE Chairman Jeffrey Sprecher told Reuters before testifying at a Senate hearing on excessive speculation in U.S. natural gas markets. Sprecher also declined to say if the ICE would wait to make a decision on whether to make a new bid until after CBOT shareholders finish voting on Monday on the CME's offer. As for what is next for ICE if it loses the CBOT bid, Sprecher would not say if his exchange could become a takeover target itself.
