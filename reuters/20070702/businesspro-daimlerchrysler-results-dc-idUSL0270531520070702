 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE will 
postpone until August 29 its full second-quarter results, which 
were originally due on July 26, the world's fifth-biggest 
carmaker said on Monday. 

  It cited the complexity arising from its sale of a majority 
stake in U.S. arm Chrysler to Cerberus Capital Management 
CBS.UL as behind the delay.  Headline numbers for other group divisions will be 
announced on July 25, the company said in a statement.  "Chrysler Automotive and Chrysler Financial will be shown 
in the Q2 financial statements as 'discontinued operations'. 
For this reason, it will not be possible to publish the full 
interim report as planned on July 26," it said.  "It will not be possible to report Financial Services' 
figures separately for Chrysler and Daimler on July 25, because 
the accounting work of separating the business volume of 
Financial Services that is to be allocated to the Chrysler 
Group will not have been completed by then," it added.  The company will release preliminary figures for unit 
sales, revenues, and earnings before interest and taxes for the 
Mercedes Car Group and Truck Group divisions as well as for the 
Van, Bus, Other segment on July 25.  DaimlerChrysler shares slipped 0.7 percent to 68.09 euros 
by 1225 GMT while the DJ Stoxx European car sector index was 
down 0.5 percent.
