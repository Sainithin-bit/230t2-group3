 LONDON  (Reuters) - A leveraged buyout of Virgin Media VMED.O would rely heavily on tax benefits for returns to any private equity buyer, just as the industry faces mounting criticism over the use of other types of tax breaks. 

 The UK cable operator said on Monday it appointed long-time adviser Goldman Sachs to find a possible buyer after receiving a takeover approach. Private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL was behind the offer, people familiar with the situation say. The $8 billion provider of cable and telecom services, whose largest shareholder is flamboyant entrepreneur Richard Branson, rejected a private equity takeover attempt last year at what was considered too low a price of $32 a share. Any takeover would likely tap into Virgin Media's more than 12 billion pounds ($24.1 billion) of unclaimed capital allowances, which could be used to offset the profits from another UK company housed in the same group. Virgin Media and its predecessor companies have been cutting costs and have taken on more than 6 billion pounds of debt over the last few years, reducing the scope for a private equity firm to use two of its favorite methods of boosting returns. The losses relate to the money spent laying cable across Britain by predecessors of NTL and Telewest, the two cable operators that were combined last year. It then bought Virgin Mobile and took on the Virgin Media name. It has struggled to combine the three businesses and analysts say a private equity firm could operate the company more efficiently out of the limelight, especially as a battle with rival BSkyB ( BSY.L ) intensifies. ITV BID The company had planned to use the potential tax offsets to its own advantage last year when it tried to buy profitable UK broadcaster ITV Plc ( ITV.L ). The bid was foiled, however, by satellite operator BSkyB, which swooped to acquire an 18 percent stake in ITV, a move under review by regulators. Although such tax advantages are not specific to private equity, they are likely a tempting factor to make the numbers work on a leveraged buyout of a business such as Virgin Media. JP Morgan estimates that at least 1.5 billion pounds of tax benefits from a Virgin buyout could be applied almost immediately after any takeover. At a $30 a share purchase price, a takeover would value Virgin's equity at about $10 billion. Any buyout would require at least $4 billion of equity based on the way such deals are typically structured. "Clearly there are huge tax losses in Virgin, which if one could utilize any time in the near term could be worth another $5-$10 a share beyond our valuation of $25," Nomura telecoms analyst Martin Mabbutt said. RBS credit analysts estimated that a private equity firm could bid $35 a share, take Virgin Media's leverage to more than six times estimated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.3 billion pounds, and still generate an internal rate of return of 30 percent. Still, the amount of debt in any such deal would leave little wiggle room for a buyout to generate the requisite IRR to satisfy private equity investors, putting more emphasis on the tax benefits of any deal. The tax breaks used by UK-based private equity partners have come under fire by politicians because they often pay a 10 percent rate or less on their large capital gains instead of the typical 40 percent income rate. Other critics have raised the question about whether private equity should be able to deduct the full amount of interest paid on the large amounts of debt it uses in takeovers, but there has been less willingness to alter that provision in Britain.
