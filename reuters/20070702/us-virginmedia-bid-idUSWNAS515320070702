 LONDON  (Reuters) - British cable operator Virgin Media VMED.O has received a bid approach from an unnamed group but has not engaged in negotiations, it said on Monday. 

 The group said it had already started a review of its strategic options, including a sale of the group, and this proposal would be considered as part of that process. Virgin Media said the proposal, which carries a number of conditions, also stated that it would be withdrawn if its terms were publicly disclosed. "The proposal is based on public information and is subject to various conditions, including a due diligence examination and a period of exclusivity," the company said in a statement. Sources familiar with the situation told Reuters on Sunday that Virgin Media had appointed Goldman Sachs to seek a possible buyer. The sources said Carlyle Group CYL.UL had approached the company over a possible bid but declined to disclose the price put forward. Earlier on Monday Virgin Media's U.S.-listed shares opened up over 15 percent at $28.20. By 1425 GMT the shares had fallen back to be up 14 percent at $27.78. Virgin Media, which sells cable television, telephone, Internet and mobile phone services, was formed from the merger of cable operators NTL and Telewest and Virgin's mobile phone division.
