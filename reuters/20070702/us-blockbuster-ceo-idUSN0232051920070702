 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Video rental chain Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N named on Monday James Keyes as its new chairman and chief executive to replace current CEO John Antioco. 

 Keyes was formerly president and CEO of convenience store chain 7-Eleven Inc. His appointment takes effect on Monday, Blockbuster said. Antioco had planned to leave the company by the end of the year after a fight over compensation with Blockbuster's board.
