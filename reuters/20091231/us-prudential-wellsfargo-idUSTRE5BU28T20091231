 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Prudential Financial Inc said on Thursday it completed the planned sale of its minority stake in a retail brokerage to Wells Fargo & Co for $4.5 billion in cash. 

 The second-largest U.S. life insurer also received $418.4 million in principal and interest on a note connected to the joint venture, according to a regulatory filing. San Francisco-based bank Wells Fargo inherited a majority stake in the joint venture, originally agreed between Wachovia and Prudential, when it acquired Wachovia last year. Prudential said earlier this month in a filing that it expected a gain on the sale of about $2.3 billion before tax, or $1.5 billion after tax. Shares of Prudential were down 14 cents or 0.3 percent at $50.40 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay , editing by Matthew Lewis)
