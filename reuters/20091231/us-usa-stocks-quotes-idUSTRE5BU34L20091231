 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street is ending 2009 on a strong note after rebounding from the 12-year lows of early March as confidence returned to the markets. The benchmark S&P 500 is up 24 percent, marking its first annual advance in two years. 

 Even so, 2009 was a roller coaster year as investors initially feared more trouble for the banking sector and worried about the profit outlook and fallout from mounting job losses. Below is a snapshot of quotes on some of the key market developments of 2009: - - - - "While our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken, though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this: We will rebuild, we will recover," U.S. President Barack Obama, in a televised speech to a joint session of Congress on February 24, five weeks after taking office. Jittery investors had sent U.S. stocks to a 12-year low the day before his speech. "I don't think this (deal) is good news. But I haven't heard good news in 24 months. I don't think I'm going to for a lot longer than that," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey on February 27 following news that the U.S. government was taking a large common equity stake in embattled Citigroup. "We are talking about a form of nationalization." "The fear is that there is no end in sight for bailouts for the 'too big to fail' banks," said Fred Dickson, market strategist and director of retail research at D.A. Davidson & Co in Lake Oswego, Oregon on March 2, the day that the Dow ended under 7,000 and the S&P 500 hit 700. "The step-in by the government to basically launch the third round of bailouts for Citigroup and the fourth round of bailouts for AIG has unsettled investors." "What you're now seeing is profit-and-earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you've got a long-term perspective on it," Obama said during a brief press conference in the Oval Office with British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on March 3. "The loss of confidence is pervasive. There isn't any magic bullet here that's going to save Citi or Bank of America. The only thing that might save them is if the government comes in and sponsors a bankruptcy," John Schloegel, a vice president of Capital Cities Asset Management in Austin, Texas, on March 5 as Citi shares traded below $1. "Until we have some meaningful discussion about doing the right things instead of just throwing money at things like AIG and General Motors, we're not going to solve the crisis we're in." "There are, unfortunately, no guideposts to allow investors to get a better sense of direction of where the market is going, where corporate America is going," Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago, on March 8, the day before the S&P 500 bottomed out, launching what would be a nine-month long run-up. "Short of that, we're going to likely have to rely on Washington. Unfortunately, it just seems like Washington's relationship with the stock market is strained." "I don't think this strong rally we've had in March guarantees we will continue this for the rest of the year," Brian Daley, sales trader at Conifer Securities in New York, on March 31 as U.S. stocks closed out their best month since October 2002. "Better conditions in financial markets have been accompanied by some improvement in economic prospects," Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke told the House of Representatives Financial Services Committee on July 21. "Despite these positive signs, the rate of job loss remains high." "The (Fed) believes that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be appropriate for an extended period," he added. "From a technical perspective, the recession is very likely over," Bernanke, at a September 15 Brookings Institution conference. "You can't continue to bail out this economy without negative ramifications," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey on September 24 after world central banks said they would reduce infusions of U.S. dollars into their banking systems. "All the money printing crack addicts who are waiting for more of it are not getting their money printed and they are going to throw a hissy fit." "People are starting to realize that things are coming back. There are some pockets of weakness, but overall, we're healing globally, and the overall trend is very positive," Thomas Belesis, chief executive officer at John Thomas Financial in New York said on December 1 as the Dow climbed to its highest close in 14 months and worries about Dubai's debt problems faded. "Friday's fears about Dubai were overblown ... Investors know the situation is out there, but they're putting that aside." "With the job report from Friday bolstering confidence in an economic rebound, there seems to be a growing talk that interest rates will rise," Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in North Brunswick, New Jersey, on December 7, a day after the government issued a surprisingly upbeat November non-farm payrolls report. "There's only so much money that can be thrown at the economy. At some point it has to end, and the fear is, it's not going to be pretty." (Reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
