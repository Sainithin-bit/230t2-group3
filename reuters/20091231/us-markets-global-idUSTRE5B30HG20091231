 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar gained on Thursday but world stocks edged lower as a number of equity markets posted their best annual performance in years in anticipation of recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s. 

 Many commodities, stocks and even bonds posted double-digit gains in 2009 while some assets, such as copper futures and emerging market equities, doubled in price as investment returned to markets drained by the deep downturn in 2008. Equity markets worldwide glowed. Asia stocks racked up a 68 percent gain for the year, regional European shares climbed 25 percent -- their best annual performance since 1999 -- and Wall Street closed out its best year since 2003. The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 23.5 percent for the year, the Dow added 18.8 percent for 2009 and the Nasdaq climbed 43.9 percent from its close on December 31, 2008. Signs of economic strength, including a record percentage of companies beating profit expectations, pushed the broad market up more than 60 percent from the depths of the biggest bear market since the Great Depression on March 9. "It shows how much of a recovery there's been," said Charles Lieberman, chief investment officer of Advisors Capital Management, LLC in Paramus, New Jersey. "It really was a turnaround year." MSCI's all country world index slipped almost 0.2 percent but gained about 31.5 percent for the year. Oil rose 78 percent in its biggest annual climb in a decade and gold sealed its largest annual gain in three decades, rising for an unprecedented ninth year in a row. Gold climbed 23 percent for the year and silver jumped almost 49 percent. Copper futures notched a 139 percent year-on-year rise, as fund buying and a looming mine strike in Chile buoyed prices on the final trading day of 2009. MSCI's Latin American stock index ending the year about 98 percent higher. Volumes were thin on the last day of 2009 with little economic data to trade on. The dollar rose to its highest level in more than three months against the yen after a report showed U.S. jobless claims fell to their lowest since mid-2008, affirming optimism about the economy. A growing sense that recovery is taking hold helped oil finish the year above $79 a barrel, as it posted a seventh straight session of gains. Crude prices have risen 14 percent in just over two weeks. U.S. stocks slipped after a reading on Midwest business activity was revised downward and investors sold some of the year's winners to lock in 2009's strong gains. The Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed down about 1 percent, dropping the most just before the close. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 120.46 points, or 1.14 percent, at 10,428.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index fell 11.32 points, or 1.00 percent, at 1,115.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index slid 22.13 points, or 0.97 percent, at 2,269.15. The dollar benefited from year-end buying after being sold off for most of 2009, as fund managers squared up their portfolios at the end of the year. The greenback also erased losses against the euro. The euro was down 0.12 percent at $1.4315, and against the yen, the dollar was up 0.53 percent at 92.95. The ICE Futures' dollar index was down 4.1 percent this year, but for December it was up about 4 percent, its best monthly performance since January. The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the dollar index up 0.04 percent at 77.944. U.S. crude for February delivery settled up 8 cents at $79.36 a barrel, almost half the all-time high of $147.27 hit in July 2008. U.S. February gold futures settled up $3.70 at $1,096.20 in New York. Spot gold rose about $220 an ounce this year, a gain eclipsed in recent history only by 1979's $286 surge. U.S. Treasuries prices eased in thin pre-holiday trade after lower-than-expected weekly jobless claims bolstered expectations of an economic recovery and undermined bonds' safe-haven appeal. Benchmark 10-year notes traded 11/32 lower in price to yield 3.84 percent. The yield earlier reached as high as 3.90 percent, the loftiest since early August and just below the year's high closing yield of 3.95 percent in June.
