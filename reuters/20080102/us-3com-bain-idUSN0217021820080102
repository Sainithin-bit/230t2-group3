 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Bain Capital said on Wednesday it continues to have "constructive" discussions with the U.S. committee reviewing its planned $2.2 billion acquisition of network-equipment maker 3Com Corp. 

  COMS.O The Financial Times reported that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) was expected this week to extend a review of the deal by an additional 45 days. In October, 3Com agreed to be acquired by Bain for $2.2 billion in a deal that would also give China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd HWT.UL a 16.5 percent minority stake. CFIUS is an inter-agency U.S. governmental panel that reviews corporate acquisitions involving foreign buyers. After an initial 30-day review of a transaction, the panel can extend the scrutiny by 45 days into a full investigation. "The review ... is a confidential process to which we submitted voluntarily," Bain said in a statement. The private equity firm said it was "working closely with CFIUS to provide U.S. officials with information about the proposed transaction." 3Com could not be immediately reached for comment. In October, eight U.S. lawmakers were backing a bill suggesting that the planned buyout 3Com "threatens the national security of the United States." 3Com previously said that Huawei would not have access to sensitive U.S. technology or U.S. government sales. Huawei also would lack operational control or the ability to make decisions for the company, 3Com previously said. "We believe CFIUS will conclude that the company will remain firmly in the control of an American firm, has only a small minority foreign shareholder, and that the deal presents no risks to national security," Bain said. Huawei can increase its stake in 3Com by up to an additional 5 percent, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchanges Commission.
