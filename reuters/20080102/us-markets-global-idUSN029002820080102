 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The new year got off to a shaky start on Wednesday as oil surged to a record at $100 a barrel while stocks and the dollar plunged after weak manufacturing data raised fears the United States may be heading into a recession. 

 Investors seeking safety also sent U.S. Treasury debt prices soaring and gold to a record peak above $850 an ounce. Oil's first-ever foray into triple-digit territory darkened an already gloomy U.S. economic outlook and stoked fear about inflation. Fresh violence in oil exporter Nigeria fed worries about supplies, at one point sending U.S. crude futures to $100 before settling at $99.64, up $3.66, or 3.81 percent, on the day. Oil rose nearly 58 percent in 2007, the biggest annual gain this decade. "Higher oil prices lead to a slower economy, lower interest rates and higher inflation," said Ron Simpson, director of currency research at Action Economics in Tampa, Florida. "That's not good for any dollar asset class." Another big worry on Wednesday was Institute for Supply Management data that showed U.S. manufacturing activity contracted last month to its weakest level since April 2003. That followed a clutch of reports last week showing sharp declines in U.S. housing prices and home-building activity and heightened concern that the credit crisis that has rattled markets since August is beginning to hurt the real economy. "The (manufacturing) report created most of the initial damage to the stock market, but the second hundred-point down on the Dow had to do with oil rushing to $100," said Jim Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. "The combination is much more devastating than any single report. The tone of the newspapers tomorrow will be about recession." On Wall Street, the main indexes all fell by more than 1 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average down 263.78 points, or 1.99 percent, at 13,001.04 and the Standard & Poor's 500 Index down 26.06 points, or 1.78 percent, at 1,445.20. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 53.06 points, or 2 percent, to 2,599.22. European shares also ended the first trading day of 2008 in negative territory, with the FTSEuorfirst 300 index closing down 1.2 percent. Last year it recorded its worst annual performance since 2002. Germany's DAX lost 1.4 percent. Markets expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates this month to stave off a recession, and minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting released on Wednesday reinforced that view. Members of the bank's rate-setting committee worried at their December meeting that a credit crisis could sharply slow U.S. growth and require addition cuts to benchmark rates. The Fed cut borrowing costs by 25 basis points to 4.25 percent at its December meeting, and a cut of equal size this month would bring them in line with euro-zone rates, erasing the dollar's yield advantage over the euro. That send the dollar sharply lower on Wednesday. Against a basket of six major currencies, it was off 0.9 percent. It also shed nearly 2 percent against the yen to 109.45 yen. The euro rose 0.9 percent to $1.4725. In 2007, the dollar recorded its worst year in the last four, falling 8.4 percent against the currency basket. "It all looks a bit dark for the dollar at the moment," said Niels Christensen, FX strategist at Nordea in Copenhagen. The weakening dollar also helped spot gold surge to a record high of $859.30 an ounce before easing to around  $856.20. Risk-averse investors also sought the safety of U.S. Treasuries, with the benchmark 10-year note up 1-2/32 to yield 3.90 percent. The cumulative drop in 10-year yields over the past four trading sessions was the biggest drop over a similar stretch in nearly 5-1/2 years. The two-year Treasury note was up 11/32 with the yield at 2.88 percent.
