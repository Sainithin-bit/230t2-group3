 LONDON  (Reuters) - Spot gold hit a record high at $855.10 an ounce on Wednesday in buying fuelled by a struggling dollar, surging oil and simmering geo-political tensions, traders said. 

 The metal was quoted at $855.10 an ounce by 11:03 a.m. ET, compared with $832.70/833.50 quoted in New York late on Monday. Spot gold was fixed in London at a high of $850 an ounce on January 21, 1980. (Reporting by  Veronica Brown  and Atul Prakash; Editing by  David Evans )
