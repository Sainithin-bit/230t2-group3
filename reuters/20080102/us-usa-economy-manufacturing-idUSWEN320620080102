 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity contracted in December to its weakest since April 2003, according to an industry report released on Wednesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity fell to 47.7 in December from 50.8 in November, below economists' median forecast for a reading of 50.4. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the sector. (Reporting by Chris Reese:; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
