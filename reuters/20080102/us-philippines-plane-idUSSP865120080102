 MANILA  (Reuters) - A plane operated by a budget airline overshot the runway as it landed in the central Philippines on Wednesday, but no one was hurt, officials said. 

 The Asian Spirit plane was landing at Masbate island after a flight from Manila. Forty-three passengers and four crew were aboard the Japanese-made NAMC YS-11 plane. "The plane was not damaged but it has to be towed," Rodolfo Garcia, Asian Spirit's vice-president for operations, told local radio. "One of its wheel sets was outside the runway." Asian Spirit is a Manila-based airline that flies to about two dozen domestic destinations. (Reporting by  Raju Gopalakrishnan ; Editing by  David Fogarty )
