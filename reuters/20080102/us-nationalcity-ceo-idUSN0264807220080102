 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National City Corp NCC.N Chief Executive Peter Raskind said on Wednesday he expects the U.S. housing market to be under pressure through 2008. 

 "I don't see a reason to believe these conditions will improve markedly any time soon," he said in an interview. "The pressure in the housing market is not going to abate any time soon," including "through calendar year 2008." The Cleveland-based bank is largely done writing down mortgage assets it had planned to sell, Raskind said. It set aside $700 million for fourth-quarter loan losses on December 17. "Write-downs of mortgage assets held for sale, and no longer salable because the market dried up, is largely behind us," he said. Earlier Wednesday, National City slashed its common stock dividend by 49 percent, and said it will eliminate 900 jobs as it stops making home loans through brokers. It has cut 3,400 jobs, largely mortgage-related, since the middle of 2007. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
