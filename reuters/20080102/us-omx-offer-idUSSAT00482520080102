 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - OMX OMX.ST said on Wednesday its board had unanimously recommended a takeover bid by Borse Dubai, which had teamed up with U.S. firm Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ) to purchase the Nordic and Baltic exchange owner. 

 State-run Borse Dubai offered 265 Swedish crowns ($41.41) per share for the firm. After the purchase it will transfer ownership of OMX to Nasdaq in exchange for a stake in the U.S. exchange. The offer has been approved by regulators in the United States and Sweden.
