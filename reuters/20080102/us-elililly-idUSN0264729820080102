 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co ( LLY.N ) plans to submit a U.S. application next week for its experimental blood-clot preventer prasugrel, the most important drug in its pipeline, a company spokesman said on Wednesday. 

 Lilly previously said it and partner Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd ( 4568.T ) were seeking to submit the application by the end of 2007. "We anticipate submitting the (application) no later than sometime next week," Lilly spokesman Joedy Isert said. Isert said the companies remain on track to seek European approval for the product in the first quarter. Analysts have predicted prasugrel could become a multibillion-dollar product, but some believe its prospects have dimmed since mixed results from a large study were released late last year. In the study, the drug proved better able to prevent heart problems than Plavix, the huge-selling blood-clot treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co ( BMY.N ) and Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ). But prasugrel caused a higher incidence of serious bleeding, raising doubts about whether U.S. regulators will approve the drug before a planned new large trial is completed. Lilly is counting on prasugrel to help make up for expected plunging sales of several drugs set to lose U.S. patent protection in coming years, including its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug. Lilly shares were off 44 cents, or less than 1 percent, at $52.95 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, underperforming the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical index .DRG, a broad gauge of drug stocks.
