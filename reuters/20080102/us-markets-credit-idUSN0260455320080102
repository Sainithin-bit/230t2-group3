 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Target Corp's ( TGT.N ) bonds have suffered in recent months and the new year is unlikely to bring much relief as the retailer faces pressure to boost its share price, possibly at the expense of bond investors. 

 The No. 2 discount retailer sharply cut its December same-store sales forecast late last month, fueling concerns about some retailers' sales this holiday shopping season. Making matters worse, at least for debt investors, Pershing Square Capital, an activist hedge fund managed by William Ackman, said it had raised its stake to nearly 10 percent and met management to discuss ways to boost Target's share price. The increased likelihood of actions that could weigh on Target's balance sheet, such as share buybacks financed by issuing more debt, has some credit investors spooked. Share repurchases are one way for a company to boost its stock price. "Instead of cutting costs and preserving cash in light of increasing economic uncertainty and these baffling sales and earnings misses, the company is increasingly likely to become more aggressive with its financial policies," said Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson in a report on Wednesday. The cost to protect Target's bonds from default jumped about 20 percent to 71.75 basis points on Wednesday, meaning it costs about $71,750 annually to insure $10 million of Target's debt for five years, according to Markit Intraday. The company's debt protection costs stood at 42.6 basis points as recently as December 3. Back on May 1, they stood at 10.4 basis points. Yield premiums on Target's 5.375 percent bonds due in 2017 have jumped more than 45 basis points to 176 basis points over U.S. Treasuries since October 2, according to MarketAxess. TARGET VERSUS WAL-MART Of course, many U.S. retailer credits have been battered in recent months by rising energy costs, falling house prices and slowing economic growth, all of which could pinch the wallets of the middle-income households that Target caters to. But Target may fare less well than other retailers like Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ) if it carries out aggressive financial maneuvers. "Let's compare Wal-Mart to Target," said Ee Lin See, an analyst at Credit Suisse in New York. "Wal-Mart is more conservative in their financial policies," and is also reducing its capital spending. "I don't think people should (be) long the name even though it has widened," she added, referring to a "long" bet that Target's debt prices will rise. "They are getting more aggressive with stock buybacks." Pershing Square's Ackman has pressured Target to sell its credit card assets, but such a sale may be unlikely given that the financial firms that would be possible buyers are struggling themselves, See says. Meanwhile, Target in November announced a $10 billion share buyback program, which prompted Fitch Ratings to cut Target's credit rating. Moody's Investors Service also cut Target's rating to "A2," the sixth-lowest investment grade ranking, from "A1," on November 27. "Recent events have shown an increasing bias towards shareholder rewards," said James Goldstein, an analyst with CreditSights, in an e-mail. "The company has previously announced intentions to complete a 'significant' portion of its recently announced $10 billion repurchase program during fiscal year 2008 -- which will likely lead to a weakening of credit metrics," he said. "We are underweight Target, relative to Wal-Mart, which we expect to be a better performer in coming months," he added. (Editing by Frank McGurty)
