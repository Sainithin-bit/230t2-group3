 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks sank on Wednesday, with the Dow getting off to its worst-ever start to a year, after data showed a surprise contraction in manufacturing and oil surged to $100 a barrel, raising the specter of stagflation. 

 A broad range of sectors sensitive to energy costs and business cycles suffered on the day, contributing to the Dow's 220-point plunge and steep declines in the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O led transport stocks lower, falling more than 10 percent on the jump in oil prices, while Intel Corp ( INTC.O ) dropped 5 percent after Bank of America downgraded the semiconductor group on growth concerns. Any hope for a New Year's rally was dashed early in the session after the Institute for Supply Management reported that factory activity shrank unexpectedly in December. The ISM data poses a quandary for the Federal Reserve, which must cope with rising prices while trying to stave off recession. Major manufacturers fell hard on the report. U.S. Steel X.X shares dropped 6 percent to $113.64, and Textron ( TXT.N ), the maker of Cessna corporate jets and Bell helicopters, fell 6.3 percent to $66.81. "A likely scenario is stagflation. That's the worst of all worlds. You can't lower rates without stimulating inflation pressures and you can't raise rates because the economy is stalled," said Hugh Moore, partner with Guerite Advisors in Greenville, South Carolina. "The Fed is trying to keep options open, but they really have limited flexibility." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 220.86 points, or 1.67 percent, at 13,043.96. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 21.20 points, or 1.44 percent, at 1,447.16. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 42.65 points, or 1.61 percent, at 2,609.63. For the first trading day of a year, it was the worst ever point decline for the Dow. On a percentage basis, it was the worst annual kickoff since 1983. For the S&P, it was the worst post-New Year's open since 2001. The market briefly bounced off its session lows after minutes from the Fed's last rate-setting meeting, released on Wednesday afternoon, said a credit crunch could sharply stall economic growth and may require "substantial" monetary easing. Home builder stocks slumped after a report showed private home-building fell to its lowest rate since August 2003. The Dow Jones home builder index .DJUSHB dropped 8.7 percent. U.S. crude oil prices rose more than $4 to $100 a barrel amid violence in OPEC members Nigeria and Algeria that caused concern about supply. Among the rare gainers were energy stocks and other commodity-related shares. Oilfield services provider Schlumberger Ltd ( SLB.N ) rose 2.3 percent to $100.58 and Newmont Mining Corp ( NEM.N ) climbed 7.3 percent to $52.39. In a sign of mounting fears of recession, health care stocks also traded higher. Drug maker Pfizer Inc ( PFE.N ) was the sole gainer on the Dow. Medco Health Solutions Inc MHS.N, a pharmacy benefits manager, gained 2 percent to $103.47 on the New York Stock Exchange. The health care sector is seen as a defensive play, more immune to economic downturns. (Reporting by Jennifer Coogan; Editing by Leslie Adler)
