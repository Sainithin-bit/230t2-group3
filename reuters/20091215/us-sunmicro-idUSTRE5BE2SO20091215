 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc said on Tuesday it won intellectual property cases in both the United States and Britain. 

 Sun said that in the U.S. case it obtained a federal court judgment against Sun Valley Technical Repair, describing it as a major counterfeiter of its products. The owner is required to make a "substantial" monetary payment, it said. Sun said the U.K. High Court of Justice ruled that British firm M-Tech Data infringed Sun's registered trademarks by importing Sun product into Europe without authorization. Sun sold itself to Oracle after several years of failed attempts to turn itself around. The deal, currently being reviewed by EU competition regulators, is seen as a way to transform Sun into a diversified technology vendor of computers and software.
