 (Reuters) - Boeing Co plans to fly its new, carbon-composite 787 Dreamliner on Tuesday. 

 The test flight, more than two years behind schedule, could help restore credibility for the No. 2 plane-maker behind Airbus. Here are five facts about the 787 Dreamliner: * The 787 Dreamliner promises greater fuel efficiency through the use of durable, light-weight composite materials. * Planes in the 787 family have list prices between $150 million and $205.5 million. * Boeing has taken orders for 840 Dreamliners. * The most recent delay results from a structural problem within the side-of-body joint of the aircraft -- the connection of the wing to the fuselage. * The 787 will use 20 percent less fuel for comparable missions in similarly sized airplanes.
