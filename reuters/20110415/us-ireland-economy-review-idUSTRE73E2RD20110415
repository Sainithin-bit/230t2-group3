 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland faces challenges from low economic growth but has so far succeeded in implementing the terms of its 85 billion euro ($120 billion) bailout, a team of IMF/EU experts said on Friday. 

 The experts from the International Moneteary Fund the European Commission and the European Central Bank on Friday completed a two-week review of Ireland's progress. "The teams' assessment is that the program is on track but challenges remain and steadfast policy implementation will be key," the team said in a statement. The team predicted that a fall in domestic demand would continue, albeit at a slower pace, pushing growth forecasts down from those on which the bailout program was based. The team complimented Ireland's progress in dealing with its banking system, saying a round of stress tests whose results were released late last month were "a major step toward restoring the Irish banking system to health."
