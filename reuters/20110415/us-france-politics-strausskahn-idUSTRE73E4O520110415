 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - With skills honed in three decades of politics, Dominique Strauss-Kahn has fielded dozens of questions at this week's IMF spring meetings in Washington but not the one France's media are dying to hear the answer to. 

 Will he quit his job running the multilateral lender to contest France's presidential elections next year? "The ... question is irrelevant," Strauss-Kahn told a news conference when a French journalist plucked up the courage to ask if this would be his last meeting as managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Speculation over the future of the former finance minister, who polls suggest would beat center-right President Nicolas Sarkozy if he stands for the opposition Socialist Party, has been fed by Strauss-Kahn's coy refusal to rule out his candidacy. But he cannot duck the question much longer. Candidates for the Socialist nomination have to put their names into the hat by July 13. With rival candidates already announcing or stepping up their informal campaigning, Strauss-Kahn risks losing political momentum. An opinion poll in France's Le Point newspaper this week showed his approval rating sliding 10 percentage points to 69 percent below Francois Hollande, who has announced his candidacy, and Socialist Party chief Martine Aubry. Publicly, party allies of "DSK," as he is known in France, have said the tumble was expected as his stratospheric levels of popularity could not sustained as others stepped up campaigning. But it may bring back haunting memories of 2006 when Strauss-Kahn, a talented orator with a PhD in economics, lost the Socialist nomination to Segolene Royal despite polls showing the French people thought he was better qualified. That prompted the then U.S. ambassador to say Strauss-Kahn lacked the "fire in the belly" for a presidential campaign. "Strauss-Kahn was really unsettled by Segolene Royal's victory in 2006: he didn't really understand what happened," said Stephane Rozes, head of consultancy Cap and a professor at Science Po university. "He is waiting to see how things unfold in France. He would like to avoid a tough primary." RISKS TO RUNNING Strauss-Kahn has a lot to lose: his work at the IMF, which he has been credited with revitalising during the crisis, has brought him international prestige and an annual salary of over $400,000. He would have to resign the moment he confirms his interest in running. His period at the IMF and his detached demeanor have earned him a statesman-like standing which many French say the impulsive Sarkozy lacks. Polls show Strauss-Kahn ranks as the most presidential of the potential Socialist candidates. But, despite being regarded as the intellectual architect of the 35-hour week, a cause celebre of the French left, Strauss Kahn is seen as to the right of his own party. Perhaps with that in mind, he has taken care recently to stress the labor aspects of his work at the IMF tackling the global crisis. With a reputation as a ladies' man, he also runs the risk rivals will dig up any dirt they can find on him. He had to make a public apology to his third wife Anne Sinclair, a former television presenter, over a brief affair with an IMF official. A source close to Strauss-Kahn said his slow decision making is typical of an intellectual who prefers to keep his options open to the last minute. But the source suggested the scales seemed to be tipping in favor of a presidential run. Political analysts say if that is the case, he has little time to lose. "The French are starting to think that if Strauss-Kahn is waiting so long it's because he thinks he doesn't deserve it or doesn't want it, that's why he's slipping in the polls," said Rozes. He added Sarkozy was setting Strauss-Kahn a trap by moving the debate from economics to multiculturalism, where his more liberal views jar with many French voters. "Strauss-Kahn has everything in place to win the presidency but he needs to realize it will be an exchange, a conversation with the French people," Rozes said. (Editing by Sophie Hares)
