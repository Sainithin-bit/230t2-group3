 MOSCOW/LONDON  (Reuters) - BP's partners in its Russian venture TNK-BP rejected the UK oil major's offer to settle a dispute caused by its $18 billion tie-up with Rosneft, casting further doubt on the deal. 

 BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley told reporters on the sidelines of a Russian Geographical Society meeting in Moscow on Friday that BP's billionaire partners had rejected its offer to buy their 50 percent stake in TNK-BP for $27-$28 billion. He also said that he didn't discuss BP's planned share swap and Arctic exploration deal with Rosneft with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin when he met him on Friday. "It was just a greeting today. You expect the prime minister of the Russian Federation to encourage foreign investment in the country, and he gave his greetings and welcome, though it was not a detailed discussion about current events," Dudley told reporters. BP, which owns the other half of TNK-BP, believes the Russians' AAR consortium is angling to be bought out of the venture at a high price -- possibly over $35 billion. Dudley has said he will not overpay for the stake in Russia's third-largest oil company. Stan Polovets, AAR chief executive said in a statement: "Now is the time for sensible proposals from BP to resolve the problems that have been created." Polovets said AAR was not planning to sell out of TNK-BP. He said the Russian shareholders wanted BP to conduct its planned $16 billion share swap and $1.2 -$2 billion Arctic Sea exploration deal with Rosneft through TNK-BP instead, in line with the joint venture's shareholder agreement. Rosneft President Eduard Khudainatov said the state-owned company was not discussing a joint bid with BP for the 50 percent stake in TNK-BP. A BP spokesman said the company was no longer in negotiations with AAR. AAR convinced an arbitration panel to block both elements of the Rosneft deal pending a settlement between the two sides. Analysts and investors are growing increasingly pessimistic the deal, which was supposed to signal BP's recovery after last year's Gulf of Mexico oil spill, will be sealed. "We believe it is unlikely that the final decision from the panel will wave the deal through," analysts at the Royal Bank of Scotland said in a research note. When Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg was asked at BP's annual general meeting on Thursday if he was confident the Rosneft tie-up would be completed, he could only say that he was "realistic." On Thursday, BP and Rosneft extended the deadline to complete the share swap element of the deal by a month, giving more time for BP and its oligarch partners in TNK-BP to hammer out a settlement. "We trust that BP will use the extension it has got from Rosneft to ensure that both the Arctic opportunity and the share swap are pursued through a structure consistent with BP's obligations under the TNK-BP shareholder agreement," Polovets said. It is unclear where TNK-BP would get the cash to buy $8 billion in Rosneft shares and Rosneft has said it is not interested in having TNK-BP, which has no offshore experience, participate in the exploration venture. BP shares traded down 0.7 percent at 1330 GMT, compared with a fall of 0.1 percent in the STOXX Europe 600 Oil and Gas index.
