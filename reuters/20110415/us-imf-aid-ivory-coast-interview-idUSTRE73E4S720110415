 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund is exploring ways it can be of help to Ivory Coast's new government to stabilize the economy, a senior IMF official said on Friday. 

 The global financial institution suspended assistance to the West African cocoa grower during months of post-election violence that ended with the arrest of its former leader Laurent Gbagbo on Monday. IMF Director for Africa, Antoinette Sayeh, told Reuters she would meet with Ivorian Finance Minister Charles Koffi Diby this weekend during IMF and World Bank meetings to discuss support and to map out policies to help stabilize the economy. "In the next couple of days we're looking at options for our reengagement and of course we want to discuss that with the government to see what they would like us to do," Sayeh said in an interview. "We are considering the tools that we might use but we will certainly be able to respond very quickly, provided of course the government allows us to," she added. But Sayeh, who was finance minister of Liberia when it emerged from war after 2005, cautioned that the security situation in Ivory Coast was still "fluid and fragile". Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara vowed on Wednesday to quickly restore security and prosperity to Ivory Coast after a four-month violent power struggle in which Gbagbo, who ruled the country for 10 years, rejected the outcome of November presidential elections and refused to hand over power. The standoff ended when French forces helped to arrest Gbagbo on Monday. Among options the IMF is considering for Ivory Coast is emergency funding and policy advice through its quick-disbursing Rapid Credit Facility, which is especially designed for poorer countries hit by natural disaster or war. The facility provides money at lower rates and comes with limited conditionality to help countries cope. "The idea would be to then move on to a program like Ivory Coast had in the past, and to make sure the track record they need for ultimately reaching the HIPC completion point is established," she said referring to a global program that would eventually provide the country much-needed debt relief.
