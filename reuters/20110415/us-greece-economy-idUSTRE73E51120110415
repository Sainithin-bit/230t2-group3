 (Reuters) - Greece on Friday unveiled the outline of a package of fiscal measures and privatizations to achieve deficit reduction targets under an EU/IMF bailout, hoping to convince investors it will not need to restructure its debt. 

 Here is a timeline of economic events in Greece since 2010: January 2010 - Greece unveils stability program on January 14, saying it will aim to cut its budget gap to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009. February - Greece must refinance 54 billion euros ($66.6 billion) in debt, with a crunch in Q2 as more than 20 billion euros becomes due and market yields for Greek debt soar. March 5 - Package of public sector pay cuts and tax increases is passed to save an extra 4.8 billion euros. VAT to rise 2 percentage points to 21 percent; public sector salary bonuses cut by 30 percent; tax on fuel, tobacco and alcohol rises; state-funded pensions frozen in 2010. -- Euro zone leaders and the IMF agree to create joint financial safety net to help Greece and try to restore confidence in the euro. April 11 -- Euro zone finance ministers approve 30 billion euros ($40.67 billion) emergency aid mechanism for Greece. April 15 - Greek parliament passes law that seeks to tackle tax evasion and shift tax burden to higher earners. April 22 - Eurostat says Greece's 2009 budget deficit is 13.6 percent of GDP, not 12.7 percent as reported earlier. April 23 - Prime Minister George Papandreou asks for activation of an EU/IMF aid package. April 27 - Standard & Poor's downgrades Greece's credit rating to junk status. May 2 - Prime Minister Papandreou says Greece has sealed deal with EU and IMF, opening door to a bailout in return for extra budget cuts of 30 billion euros over three years. -- The aid package amounts to 110 billion euros over three years and represents the first rescue of a member of the then 16-nation euro zone. May 4/5 - Public sector workers stage 48-hour nationwide strike. Up to 50,000 protest in Athens, and hundreds fight with police. Three people are killed when a bank is set on fire. May 6 - Greek parliament approves latest austerity bill. May 9 - The IMF unanimously approves its part of the rescue loans, with 5.5 billion euros being provided immediately. May 10 - Global policymakers install an emergency safety net worth about $1 trillion to bolster financial markets and prevent the Greek crisis from damaging the euro. -- The package consists of 440 billion euros in guarantees from euro zone states, plus 60 billion euros in European debt instruments. EU finance ministers say the IMF will contribute a further 250 billion euros. May 18 - Greece receives a 14.5 billion euro ($18.7 billion) loan from the EU and can now repay its immediate debt, a development that helps to steady global investors' jitters.

January 2011 -- Fitch becomes the third rating agency to cut Greek debt to "junk" status. February 11 -- EU and IMF inspectors approve 15 billion euros of fresh bailout funds, but warn its fiscal program could go off the rails unless it accelerates reforms and scales up privatizations.
