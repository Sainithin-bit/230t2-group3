 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc beat quarterly sales expectations and gained market share on strong demand for its mainstay Barbie dolls and newer lines such as Monster High, sending its shares up 5 percent. 

 The No. 1 toy company said sales rose at all units except one, reassuring investors it was in a good position to raise prices to cope with higher input costs. Higher expenses for items like resin and litigation costs dragged down Mattel's quarterly profit by 33 percent, forcing it to take a high-single-digit price increase, effective April 1. Mattel's results came the day after smaller rival Hasbro Inc also reported a huge drop in profit due to higher costs, but beat sales estimates in the seasonally weak first quarter. The strong sales numbers from Mattel and Hasbro made BMO Capital Markets analyst Gerrick Johnson more optimistic about worldwide demand for toys and other kids products. He expects a good sales quarter for smaller toymaker Jakks Pacific as well. Shares of all three were up on Friday. Mattel's sales rose 8 percent to $951.9 million, well ahead of the analysts' average estimate of $903.7 million. Global sales for Barbie were up 14 percent. "They are in the early stages of a cyclical upturn. Barbie just looks so much better," Johnson said. He has an "outperform" rating on the toymaker. This is the first time the Barbie brand has had double-digit sales growth in the first quarter since 1997. "In the toy business, the sales line is always the most important thing because it is a fashion business," Johnson said. "You can expand your gross margins and operating margins if you have strong topline growth because there is a lot of fixed costs in the structure." RISING PRICES Mattel's net income fell to $16.6 million, or 5 cents a share, from $24.8 million, or 7 cents a share, a year earlier. The earnings met the analysts' average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Mattel's recent price increases were justified, its CEO said. "These are cost-justified price increases. So despite the fact that none of us likes to go up in price, I think everybody understands it," Chief Executive Robert Eckert said, citing a 35 percent rise in oil prices and a 20 rise in minimum wage in China. Both Mattel and Hasbro are paying more for fuel, resin and freight, as well as fighting higher labor costs in China, where most of their toys are made. Hasbro has also been spending on its new television channel. COSTLY FIGHT WITH MGA Mattel has also been spending a lot on litigation in its long-running copyright lawsuit against rival MGA Entertainment Inc over the popular Bratz dolls. A verdict on the case is expected soon. Wells Fargo analyst Tim Conder said he expected Mattel shares to benefit from "legal clarity over the next few months" and recommended the stock to investors in the leisure space. On a call with analysts, CFO Kevin Farr said more than half of the year-to-year dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, or $26 million, is due to higher litigation and legal settlement-related costs. Mattel shares were up 4.8 percent at $26.99 on the Nasdaq on Friday afternoon. Hasbro shares were up 0.7 percent. (Reporting by Dhanya Skariachan; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Matthew Lewis )
