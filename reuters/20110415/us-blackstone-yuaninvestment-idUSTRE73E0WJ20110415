 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) won approval from Shanghai authorities allowing it to invest money raised abroad in China without seeking permission from the country's foreign exchange regulator, Bloomberg said, citing two people with knowledge of the matter. 

 Blackstone's 5 billion yuan ($765 million) domestic fund was approved for the Qualified Foreign Limited Partner program (QFLP), the agency said. Blackstone could not immediately be reached for comment. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore)
