 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Finance ministers from the Group of 20 major economies on Friday approved methods to measure three major indicators for identifying unsustainable trade and financial imbalances, a G20 official said. 

 The official said the G20 would soon be able to name the countries that would be subject to a second stage of analysis, which would include assessments of undervalued currencies and accumulation of excess reserves. Currencies and reserves are not included in the imbalance indicators themselves -- a proposal that China opposed at the February G20 meeting in Paris. The Washington deal on measurement applies to the indicators agreed to in Paris in February -- public debt and fiscal deficits, private savings and borrowing, and the trade balance and other components of a country's balance of payments. The G20 agreed on four methods of measuring these to determine whether more analysis was needed, the official said. The official declined to name the countries that are expected to be on the list as a result of preliminary analysis work to develop the methods. Other sources, however have said the analysis list was expected to include the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France and other European countries. If a G20 country's imbalance is above norms in two of the four measurements, the country would be selected for further analysis, the official said. The measurements include: -- An estimation what a particular country's imbalance should look like using economic models specific to that country; -- Comparisons with imbalances in groups of similar countries between 1990 and 2004; -- Comparisons with imbalances in the G20 as a group between 1990 and 2004; -- Comparisons with that country's historical norms between 1990 and 2004. The 1990-2004 period was selected because that represents the period before the buildup of massive trade and financial imbalances that helped spark the recent financial crisis, the official said. Discussions among G20 ministers about France's agenda to revamp the international monetary system did include criteria to broaden the basket of currencies that make up the Special Drawing Rights, the International Monetary Fund's unit of account, the official said. But the ministers did not voice support for an increased role of the SDR in the monetary system or its use as a reserve currency, as some ministers have proposed.
