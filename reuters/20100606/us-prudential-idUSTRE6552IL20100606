 LONDON  (Reuters) - Some of UK insurer Prudential's ( PRU.L ) largest shareholders have approached former chief executive Mark Tucker over a possible return to the helm of the company, British media reported on Monday. 

 Current CEO Tidjane Thiam has faced calls from some shareholders to quit following the company's botched bid to take over AIG's ( AIG.N ) Asian unit, although other Pru owners told Reuters on Friday it would be premature to force him out. Thiam is expected to apologize to shareholders at Prudential's annual general meeting on Monday. The Financial Times said at least two top-15 investors had touted Tucker as a possible successor, though other investors were concerned he might push for a break-up of the insurer. "Mark Tucker was the real architect of the Pru's growing success in Asia, UK and U.S. If he could be encouraged to return for a period, Thiam could go immediately," an unnamed investor told the FT. In a separate Times report, an unnamed shareholder told the paper Tucker had refused to comment on any possible return to the company until Thiam's future had been resolved.
