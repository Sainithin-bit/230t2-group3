 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CIT Group Inc said on Monday it secured a $3 billion credit facility from bondholders and would start a comprehensive restructuring, in moves seen crucial for the company to avoid a bankruptcy filing. 

 The company, which lends to nearly one million small and mid-sized businesses, also said as a first step in its recapitalization plan, it has started a cash tender offer for its outstanding floating rate senior notes due August 17. The offer will be for $825 for each $1,000 principal amount of notes tendered on or before July 31. (Editing by Carol Bishopric)
