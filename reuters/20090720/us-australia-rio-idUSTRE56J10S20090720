 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Australia's trade minister said on Monday that Australia wants more details on the detained employees of miner Rio Tinto from China quickly, but said the case would not hurt economic relations if handled properly. 

 "As for the economic relations between our two countries, I don't believe -- particularly if this case is handled properly -- it will have any impact on these relations," Simon Crean told reporters ahead of a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade ministers in Singapore. Chinese authorities earlier this month arrested four Rio Tinto employees, including top iron ore salesman in China, Australian Stern Hu, alleging they were involved in stealing state secrets. Crean said no charges have been filed against Rio's executive Hu. (Reporting by Neil Chatterjee and  David Fogarty )
