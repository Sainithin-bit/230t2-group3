 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks built on last week's rally on Monday, climbing strongly on better-than-expected corporate earnings results and a last-minute rescue package for troubled U.S. lender CIT. 

 Asian shares outside Japan hit a 2009 high. European shares were up 1.5 percent. Wall Street looked set to join in. Foreign exchange traders moved into riskier currencies, sapping yen strength and taking the dollar to a six-week low against a basket of major currencies .DXY.

MSCI's all-country world stock index .MIWD00000PUS was up 0.9 percent, adding to a 6.6 percent gain last week. Its emerging market counterpart .MSCIEF gained 2.4 percent. The catalyst for the recent rally in stocks has been a series of better-than-expected corporate earnings reports, notably from IBM ( IBM.N ), Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and Intel ( INTC.O ). Sentiment was also helped by news CIT Group Inc ( CIT.N ) had clinched a last-minute $3 billion rescue by a group of bondholders and probably escaped bankruptcy. CIT lends to nearly one million small and mid-sized U.S. businesses. "With some big numbers this week, we will be hoping to see some better numbers which in turn could help us add yet more to this rally as earnings boost the good feeling surrounding the economic recovery," said Nick Mitchell, a dealer at CMC Markets.
