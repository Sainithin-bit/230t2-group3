 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Germany's state controlled bank KfW plans to buy a 4.8 percent indirect stake in aerospace company EADS from a investor consortium known as Dedalus, Austria's cartel office said on Monday. 
 The consortium made up of private financial institutes and German public sector owners, including KfW, holds a stake in EADS equivalent to 7.5 percent, for which Daimler controls the voting rights. KfW will buy a 65 percent stake in the holding firm, Dedalus GmbH & Co KGaA, the Austrian competition authorities said on Monday. (Reporting By Edward Taylor)
