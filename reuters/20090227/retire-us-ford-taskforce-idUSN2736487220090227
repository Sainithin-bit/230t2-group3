 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Top executives of Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) met on Friday with the Obama administration task force weighing restructuring of the U.S. auto industry, Ford said in a statement. 

 The automaker said the meeting was part of an ongoing dialogue with the government and did not signal any change in the company's position on bailouts. Ford, unlike its U.S. rivals General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) and Chrysler LLC, has not sought bailout funds as it restructures its operations. "Ford is in a different position and our situation has not changed," the automaker said in its statement. "We did not and are not seeking emergency financial assistance from the government." Ford did not say which executives were meeting with administration officials. GM and Chrysler executives met with the task force on Wednesday and Thursday to review each company's restructuring plans. The task force, run by Treasury Department and White House officials, has until March 31 to determine whether GM and Chrysler, already recipients of bailout money, deserve more aid. GM is seeking more than $16 million in new bailout funds while Chrysler wants an additional $5 billion. (Reporting by  John Crawley , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
