 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co said on Friday it will drop the name of its recently acquired Wachovia Corp from an upcoming PGA golf tournament, saying it would send "mixed signals about our priorities." 

 The Wachovia Championship, to be held on April 27 to May 3 in Charlotte, North Carolina will be renamed the Quail Hollow Championship, after the name of the course. Wachovia was based in Charlotte, and was acquired by Wells Fargo for about $12.5 billion on December 31. "Given the merger integration with Wells Fargo and Wachovia, we believe it no longer makes sense to invest in promoting the Wachovia brand via the tournament," said David Carroll, head of wealth management at Wells Fargo. "In the current environment, we also believe that promoting this event with our brand could send mixed signals about our priorities to many of our stakeholders." Wells Fargo also said it will not host any client entertainment events associated with the event. The bank plans to honor the terms of the tournament sponsorship contract, which expires in 2014, spokeswoman Mary Beth Navarro said. The San Francisco-based lender received $25 billion of taxpayer money from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. Like many TARP recipients, Wells Fargo faces pressure from shareholders and governance critics to reduce spending seen as unnecessary. In response to criticism, the bank canceled some Las Vegas events this month, and Chief Executive John Stumpf said it would cancel all major employee recognition events this year. Earlier this week, lawmakers in Congress criticized TARP recipient Northern Trust Corp for spending at a recent company-sponsored golf tournament in southern California.
