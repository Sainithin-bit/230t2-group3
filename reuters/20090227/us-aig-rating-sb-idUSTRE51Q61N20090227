 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. government may need to backstop American International Group's risky credit default swap portfolio if the insurer is to avoid further rating downgrades, which could tip the company into insolvency and have potentially global consequences. 

 AIG is in talks with the government about a wide range of options designed to shore up its liquidity and avoid a credit rating downgrade. Losses taken from its structured finance business, in which it sold protection on risky mortgages and other assets with credit default swaps, are expected to cause the insurer to post a record loss of around $60 billion when it reports fourth-quarter results, said a source familiar with the matter. "A loss of that magnitude could spark another round of downgrades," said Rob Haines, analyst at CreditSights in New York. "Its kind of a viscous circle, because if AIG is downgraded then you'll have additional collateral calls, which will pressure the company's liquidity." "Without any kind of restructuring of the federal bailout, the company could technically become insolvent," he added. Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's both have AIG on review for downgrade from the seventh highest investment grade. S&P has said the company would be rated junk without government support and Moody's also said its current ratings depend on government support. Ratings downgrades would be potentially disastrous for AIG as they could trigger new collateral payments with its counterparties amounting to tens of billions of dollars, depending on the extent of the downgrade. These payments would exceed the amount the insurer has left of its government loan, said CreditSights' Haines. A downgrade of AIG's short term rating would also make it ineligible for the Federal Reserve's Commercial Paper Funding Facility, and it would need to repay the $15 billion it has borrowed under the program. AIG is in talks with the government over options that include the government financing the purchase of some of AIG's business and taking direct stakes in others. Bloomberg reported on Thursday that AIG is considering handing its property and life casualty operation to the government as a way to retire some of its debt and protect the operation from losses at its other operations. "Rating agencies are still rating them as an independent entity. Is it really independent if the U.S. government steps up and assumes control over the casualty and life part of the business?" said Scott MacDonald, head of research at Aladdin Capital in Stamford, Connecticut. "If the U.S. government buys the property and casualty business, that is AIG." Separating the life and casualty business in this manner would also fail to address the CDS portfolio, which is the core problem at the company. "The massive swap book is what got the company into trouble, not the regulated insurance subsidiaries," said CreditSights' Haines. "Somehow that's got to be ringfenced and addressed, because without completely ringfencing that, or some sort of backstop there, we'll just never know what the ultimate liquidity needs at AIG are going to be." The credit default swaps portfolio, with ties to major European institutions, also cannot be allowed to fail without creating a potentially systemic chain of losses, Haines said. AIG sold more than $300 billion of protection on securities with CDS to European banks, which were able to gain regulatory relief with the insurance policies under the rules of Basel II. "The government can't just walk away from it," Haines said. "If that swap book were wiped out, all the European counterparties would get hit and that would be a systematic risk to the entire market."
