 CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands  (Reuters) - For the past three years, as Allen Stanford's company was allegedly selling fraudulent CDs from his bank in Antigua, the Texas billionaire feathered his nest on the nearby Caribbean island of St. Croix, raising hopes that have now been dashed. 

 The flamboyant financier bought at least 19 pieces of property here worth $34.7 million and leased another 37 acres with grand plans to build a global management center on St. Croix, the largest of the three main U.S. Virgin Islands, 1,100 miles southeast of Miami. Stanford sponsored a local concert series, opened at least two offices, hired about 80 people and promised to employ many more. Frequent sightings of construction equipment and freshly painted buildings excited residents. The prospect of a big spender moving in was uplifting. "I thought Stanford was a godsend for the improvement of King's Alley," said bar owner Otis Pleasant, referring to the cobblestoned, lushly landscaped arcade near the Christiansted Harbor that is home to his bar, Pleasant's. Pleasant said that after buying property on King's Alley, Stanford made some improvements. But Stanford's company did not renew tenants' leases when they expired. Pleasant said that as a result, King's Alley tenants now pay month-to-month, and they are worried about their future because Stanford's assets are now under control of a U.S. court-appointed receivership. Pleasant wants to sell his bar, but he cannot because potential buyers are not interested in a business that could be forced to move at any time because of a monthly lease. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Stanford, 58, two of his colleagues and three of his companies with fraudulently selling $8 billion in certificates of deposit (CDs) with improbably high interest rates from his Stanford International Bank Ltd (SIB), headquartered in Antigua. No criminal charges have been filed against Stanford and he has not been arrested. Late on Thursday, Stanford's Chief Investment Officer Laura Pendergast-Holt was charged with obstruction by the U.S. Justice Department. She made an initial court appearance in Houston, Texas, after her arrest there by FBI agents. Stanford's offices on St. Croix have been shuttered and men working on behalf of the attorney overseeing his assets have been seen entering his sprawling home and office compound with video equipment to survey the property, while armed security guards in T-shirts that say "police" stood outside. "It's unfortunate what's happened to Stanford," Pleasant said. "But what happens to us? We don't have deep pockets. We don't even have pockets." UNFINISHED BUSINESS A stone's throw from Pleasant's place is a fenced-in dirt lot with a muddy pool in the center. This is where the Anchor Inn used to be. Residents are disappointed that what they once hoped would become a modern, high-end hotel may remain an eyesore on the boardwalk until Stanford's affairs are settled. Some of them worry that could take years. Few may be more upset than Walter Golden, general manager of Virgin Islands Asphalt Products Corp, which demolished the inn. The company filed a lien against Stanford's Christiansted Downtown Holdings on February 20 for $229,391.75, its payment for the demolition. There are seven liens by contractors and architects against Stanford, totaling $1.2 million, according to public documents. "It will probably be drawn out for years," Golden said. "Generally, when things like that happen, if you even get paid, you might just get 25 or 50 cents on the dollar." Stanford surrendered his passport to U.S. authorities last week as regulators seized his banks and companies in Antigua, and Barbuda. One of Stanford's companies has been dropped from a U.S. Virgin Islands tax incentive program designed to bring businesses to the islands. The congressionally approved U.S. Virgin Islands Industrial Development Program provides exemptions from nearly all local tax and up to 90 percent of federal income tax to companies that invest at least $50,000 in a business in the Virgin Islands and employ at least 10 people. The program is administered by the U.S. Virgin Islands Economic Development Commission (EDC). William Blum, an attorney with Solomon Blum Heymann and Stich who specializes in Virgin Islands tax policy, said the program is unique because it allows U.S. citizens to file their taxes in the Virgin Islands and satisfy their income tax obligations to the United States. In other words, they can take their income from the Virgin Islands to the mainland and not be taxed again. He said business owners who take advantage of this program must live in the Virgin Islands for 183 days each year, thereby treating it as a primary residence. Blum had no business with Stanford. Michael Dembeck, executive director of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce, said Stanford's problems would have an immediate impact on employment on St. Croix. "The long-term impact is hard to say. I think the scrutiny our EDC companies receive from Treasury and the IRS will intensify," Dembeck said. BROAD SWEEPS Even though Stanford lived here and contributed to some extent to the community, locals say he kept to himself, either spending time at his $7.7 million mansion in town or on his 120-foot yacht, now unable to move from the St. Croix Marina. Eight people who did business with Stanford or his companies painted the picture of a sharp and enthusiastic entrepreneur who had a tendency to be demanding and arrogant. "We did a lot of real estate personally on a handshake, and the paperwork would come later. His word was his bond," said Julie San Martin, a real estate broker with RE/MAX, who sold Stanford a $9 million estate on Recovery Hill. She called him "an enthusiastic, charismatic, charming guy who is well-suited for the Caribbean", where people are "a little less well-behaved." Stanford had the three homes and conference center at the Recovery Hill estate torn down. He planned to rebuild them, according to Twila Wilson, Stanford's interior designer. Many people here viewed his destruction of those buildings as an excessive display of wealth, tearing them down "because he could." But Wilson said Stanford loved the way the homes looked, but he was worried about their integrity since they had endured several hurricanes. Nothing has been built in their place. Wilson said Stanford liked the color green, and that he was fond of the Caribbean's decorative hallmarks, such as hard woods and tile work. She called him a great communicator, saying: "He's Texan. He speaks in broad sweeps." Working with Stanford was fun, she said, but she always had to be aware of his image as a tycoon. "We always had to keep that in mind," Wilson said. A restaurant owner who had ties to Stanford described him as "extremely arrogant" and said people were often "on pins and needles" in his presence. "It wasn't about you, it was about him," he said. "The beauty of the United States is that you're innocent until proven guilty," said the man, who did not want to be named. "But if Stanford is found guilty, I hope he does hard time for all the hard times he's causing." (Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by  Toni Reinhold )
