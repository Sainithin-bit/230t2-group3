 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks fell on Friday after the U.S. government said it will take a large stake in Citigroup ( C.N ) in a move that sent skittish investors to the safety of gold and the U.S. dollar. 

 Data that showed the U.S. economy shrank more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2008 pushed oil prices down more than 3 percent and lifted euro zone government debt as investors focused on the deepening global recession. The dollar rose broadly and gold extended gains as investors worried that other U.S. banks might need a similar show of support as the government extended to beleaguered Citigroup ( C.N ), moves that could dilute holdings of current shareholders. U.S. Treasuries erased most early gains and turned mixed after U.S. stocks pared losses. Investors fear a rebound in stocks will take money away from looming debt sales. The Citigroup move, one of the most dramatic efforts by the U.S. government to prop up ailing banks, pushed the benchmark S&P 500 to lows last seen in April 1997, before bargain-hunting lifted the market off its lows. The government will swap up to $25 billion of its preferred shares into common stock of Citigroup, and the bank will stop paying dividends on its preferred and common stock and promised to shake up its board of directors. Citigroup's ( C.N ) shares fell more than 37 percent to $1.55 and Bank of America ( BAC.N ) stock fell 18 percent to $4.35. "It's not good for shareholders, the news this morning, and that is driving bond prices higher," said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. Treasury trading at Jefferies & Co. in New York. Before 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 46.03 points, or 0.64 percent, at 7,135.89. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 8.79 points, or 1.17 percent, at 744.04. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 5.46 points, or 0.39 percent, at 1,386.01. European shares fell on the Citigroup news and as a big loss at Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) hit British banks. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares fell 1.78 percent to close at 719.40 points. "Citigroup was the main thing today," said Howard Wheeldon, strategist at BGC Partners in London, "even though everybody knew it's been coming for a while." The deal is "a creeping step toward full nationalization," he said. Lloyds ( LLOY.L ) fell 22.3 percent after it unveiled a big loss for 2008 and said it had not yet finalized details of its plan to put billions of pounds of assets into a UK government-backed insurance scheme. U.S. gross domestic product shrank at a revised annual rate of 6.2 percent in the fourth quarter, much steeper than the government's initial estimate of 3.8 percent. It was the sharpest contraction since early 1982. The data helped push up bund prices. Bund futures jumped as high as 125.57 after the U.S. GDP data landed, but trimmed gains to end the regular trading session at 124.70 as U.S. stocks pared some losses. "The U.S. data underlined the weak economic and market landscape. Stocks are weak, and in these factors are bringing about demand for government bonds," said Everett Brown, European bond strategist at IDEAglobal in London. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was down 9/32 in price to yield 3.03 percent. The dollar rose against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.23 percent at 88.04. The euro fell 0.35 percent at $1.2686, and against the yen, the dollar fell 0.65 percent at 97.75. U.S. light sweet crude oil fell $1.21 to $44.01 a barrel. Spot gold prices fell $6.80 to $937.70.
