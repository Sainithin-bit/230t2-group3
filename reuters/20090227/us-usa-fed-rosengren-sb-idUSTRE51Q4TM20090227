 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy will begin recovering in the second half of this year, but growth could stay below potential until financial markets stabilize, a top Federal Reserve policy-maker said on Friday. 

 "We need to be sure that actions to support the stability of the financial system are taken without delay," Eric Rosengren, president of the Boston Federal Reserve Bank, said in remarks prepared for a monetary policy forum in New York. At the University of Chicago Booth School of Business/ Brandeis International Business School forum, Rosengren said the U.S. economy is "likely to shrink significantly" in the first half of this year. The Fed's rapid reduction in interest rates to close to a range of zero to 0.25 percent in December 2008 from as high as 5.25 percent in September 2007 "has mitigated the downturn" and cushioned the economy against some of the shocks of the past year he said. Over time, the Fed's continuing policy actions and the Obama administration's recently enacted stimulus package "should in my view help pull the economy out of the severe recession," he said. Rosengren is not a voter in 2009 on the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-setting panel. TRANSPARENCY A HELP The Fed's recent move to provide longer-range forecasts for growth, inflation and unemployment should help the central bank attain its policy goals by preventing inflation expectations from falling too far, Rosengren said. With short-term interest rates effectively at zero since December and likely to remain there for some time, falling inflation expectations would imply a higher "real" interest rate -- effectively tightening monetary policy at the worst possible time for the struggling economy. "The added clarity on the long-run intentions of monetary policy ... might keep inflation expectations well anchored and real interest rates low enough to help get the economy moving again," the policy-maker said. The Fed's first long-run core inflation forecast, released on February 18, was 1.7 percent to 2.0 percent, and was seen as the bank's biggest step so far toward an explicit target. But Rosengren said two brushes with deflation and zero or near-zero interest rates in this decade alone suggested the long-run inflation goal might need to be revised. "Some might conclude that the implicit inflation target has been too low," he said. "A fruitful area for future research would be to reconsider the likelihood and the cost of hitting the zero lower bound, and what that cost implies for setting inflation target." BALANCE SHEET SHRINKAGE Addressing concerns that the sharp expansion in the Fed's balance sheet could ignite inflation once the economy picks up, Rosengren said much of the expansion would reverse naturally. "The largest components of the expansion ... are likely to become unappealing to market participants as financial conditions improve and interest rate spreads decline," he said. Already, central bank liquidity swaps have dropped from a mid-December peak of $583 billion to $375 billion on February 18, Rosengren said, as the interbank dollar-lending market has stabilized. The Fed's large-scale purchases of mortgage-backed and agency securities have helped conventional mortgage rates fall to between 5 percent and 5.25 percent recently from around 6 percent when the program was announced, Rosengren noted. The Fed could potentially expand that program "to help further lower the market rates on home financing," he added. Rosengren did not mention the possibility of the Fed buying long-term Treasury debt, an idea floated by the FOMC in December that seems to have fallen from favor. Rosengren said the various Fed programs to reduce the cost of credit to a variety of borrowers would be more successful in turning the economy around than the "quantitative easing" pursued by Japan during the 1990s. "Increasing reserves when financial intermediaries are capital-constrained," the theory behind Japan's policies, "is unlikely to have much impact," Rosengren said.
