 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Following are key quotes from a Congressional Oversight Panel hearing on the Troubled Asset Relief Program on Tuesday with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. 

 > For a text of Geithner's prepared testimony, see:  here GEITHNER ON ECONOMY: Our economy is still going through an incredibly difficult period. Millions of Americans are still looking for work and are suffering from the damage of a deep recession. The impact of this crisis will be lasting... GEITHNER ON TARP AND THE ECONOMY Actions the government took have helped stabilize the financial system and restore economic growth. ... TARP has been critical to this progress, and it has helped restore financial stability at a much lower cost than anticipated. We have already recovered more than half of total disbursements under the program. And TARP investments have generated $24 billion in additional revenue for taxpayers. GEITHNER ON THE END OF TARP: Like this Panel and most of the American public, I look forward to the day when TARP is no longer needed and taxpayers have recovered every dollar invested through it. On October 3, 2010, we will cease making new commitments through the program.
