 LONDON  (Reuters) - British finance minister George Osborne unveiled on Tuesday swingeing spending cuts and tax rises in the tightest budget in a generation and the first big test for the coalition government. 

 Following are reactions to Osborne's first budget. CHRIS SANGER, HEAD OF TAX POLICY, ERNST & YOUNG "The announcement today of a reduction in the corporation tax rate by 1 percent a year for the next four years will make the UK tax rate the 11th lowest in the OECD, and 5th lowest in the G20. This is clearly an element in achieving the coalition government's aim to make the UK's corporate tax regime the most competitive in the G20 by the end of the next Parliament. "This rate reduction will be funded in part by the deferral in tax allowances for capital investment, through the reduction in the Annual Investment Allowance and a reduction in the rates for tax depreciation. Overall this is a tax cut for business, but one funded out of current cash flow." LIZ PEACE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, BRITISH PROPERTY FEDERATION "Cutting the housing benefits bill is long overdue and we have long said that housing payments need to again be made directly to landlords to avoid the money being taken by tenants and spent on other things. "In introducing a cap on housing expenditure, it is vital that claimants in more expensive areas of the country are not sidelined and forced out of homes they have lived in for years. This would create more problems than it would solve, as it is vital that we do not end up creating more ghettos or forcing people to travel miles to work." MIKE TRIPPITT, ANALYST, ORIEL SECURITIES "As far as the hit to banks is concerned, it's 2 billion pounds rather than (earlier estimates of) 3 billion pounds. And that's not just going to be the quoted banking sector, it's also going to be the UK operations of overseas banks and building societies, particularly Santander and National Australia Bank. It does seem to be a bit less. It's a tad better (than expected)." PHILIP SHAW , CHIEF ECONOMIST, INVESTEC "From the point of view of public spending, the cuts are pretty severe and it looks as though the Chancellor has not so much taken an axe to benefits programs but a chainsaw through them. It just shows how much needs to be done from the bottom up to achieve the savings which the Chancellor is talking about. "The fiscal plans are very close to what had been speculated over the past week not so no huge surprises there. From what we've seen of the macro forecasts again no huge changes from Monday's OBR." RICHARD HYMAN, STRATEGIC ADVISOR, DELOITTE "VAT going up will have a very significant impact on retailers' performance. "I think (the rise in) VAT will hit (retailers') margins, because I don't think the consumer can absorb that price increase." "The consumer spending pot is going to be constrained in any case, VAT going up will shave a fair bit off retailers' margins." "The extent to which it shaves amounts off retailers' margins depends how much on the cost side retailers can further shave." GEORGE BUCKLEY, CHIEF UK ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE BANK "They seem to have taken two percentage points off the budget deficit by the end of the period - I guess we need to remember that these cuts are in addition to the cuts that had already been announced. "In total, including the previous government's tightening, that amounts to about nine percentage points of GDP - bigger than that of the mid-to-late 1990s." JONATHAN LOYNES, CHIEF UK ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS "It seems to be a tighter budget than people generally were anticipating. By the look of the borrowing numbers, there's a bigger squeeze here than most people were expecting. "The forecasts for the deficit are to come down rather further than we and other people had anticipated so assuming that's the result of the measures introduced in the budget, then it is tougher (than anticipated)."
