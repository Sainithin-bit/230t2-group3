 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's budget on Tuesday set challenges for the coalition government that will ultimately decide whether the alliance has a long-term future or will crumble under the weight of a record peacetime deficit. 

 Finance minister George Osborne announced plans to increase VAT sales tax to 20 percent from 17.5 percent next year and raise two billion pounds through a tax on bank balance sheets. The emergency budget came just over a month after the center-right Conservatives and smaller, left-leaning Liberal Democrats formed an unlikely alliance, Britain's first coalition government since World War Two. * The increase in sales tax and 11 billion pounds in annual cuts to welfare spending are certain to prove unpopular and put pressure on the coalition. * Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg warned members on the eve of the budget that it "is one of the hardest things we will ever have to do" but added that there was no alternative to rescue the economy from debt. * Some in the Lib Dems fear that they are being used to provide political cover to help the larger Conservative party drive through swingeing cuts. They are worried that the party will take the blame for harsh medicine and not get much credit for any eventual upturn. * Compromise was evident on the divisive issue of capital gains tax on the sales of assets such as second homes. The rate will go up to 28 percent from 18 percent for higher rate taxpayers -- a middle ground between Lib Dem demands for it to rise to 40-50 percent and Conservative resistance to a rise. * Lib Dems will also take succour from an increase in the income tax threshold, taking 880,000 of the lowest earners out of the tax completely. * The real pain will start to be felt later this year. Most government departments face spending cuts of 25 percent over four years, with details of where the axe will fall to be set out in a spending review in October. * Britain's biggest public sector trade union has said it will fight government attempts to impose a pay freeze and curb pensions for its members. A stormy autumn looms, with protests likely to spread once departmental cuts start to bite. * A failure to deliver on reform to the voting system -- a key Lib Dem demand -- and falling poll ratings could fuel opposition to the coalition in the coming months. A Reuters Ipsos/MORI poll published on Monday showed Lib Dem support had sagged since last month's election and some in the party fear it will lose its identity in the coalition. * Labour revival: The party is in transition after defeat in last month's election ended 13 years in power and Gordon Brown's departure as party leader. It will elect a new leader in September, with former foreign secretary David Miliband the favorite for the crown. Once Labour regroups, it is certain to step up its attacks on the government's economic program and could win over disenchanted Lib Dem supporters. (Editing by Mark Heinrich
