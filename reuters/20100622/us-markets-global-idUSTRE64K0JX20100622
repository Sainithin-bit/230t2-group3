 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Uncertainty over Washington's ban on deepwater oil drilling, coupled with weak May U.S. housing data, sank stocks and lifted Treasuries on Tuesday, while a high-profile credit downgrade rattled Europe's banks. 

 Fitch's downgrade of French bank BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) hit Europe's banking stocks, leading to the end of a nine-day rally, and pushed prices for gold higher on safe-haven flows. The euro suffered a broad sell-off as questions over Europe's banking sector were brought back into focus. The dollar, however, was mixed, although it did manage to rise against a basket of its major trading-partner currencies. China's weekend announcement to emphasize a flexible currency rather than the de facto peg to the U.S. dollar appeared to have fully dissipated as investors acknowledge this would not lead to a sharp appreciation of the yuan. A U.S. judge blocked the Obama administration's six-month ban on deepwater oil drilling, complicating efforts to improve safety of offshore operations after the worst spill in U.S. history. Oil companies opposed the moratorium, but energy-related shares fell as the decision remains in doubt after a vow from the White House to appeal the ruling. Cabot Oil & Gas Corp ( COG.N ) shares dropped 7.63 percent to $33.18. The S&P energy sector index.GSPE fell 2.70 percent. "The notion that the regulatory environment is changing, coordinated with a tougher economic outlook for consumption, would suggest (energy) stocks stay under pressure," said Joe Battipaglia, market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus in Yardley, Pennsylvania. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  fell 148.89 points, or 1.43 percent, to 10,293.52. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 17.89 points, or 1.61 percent, to finish at 1,095.31. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  dropped 27.29 points, or 1.19 percent, to end at 2,261.80. Technology shares, including a 1.36 percent rise in shares of Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) to $273.85 after reporting 3 million iPad tablet computer sales in 80 days, were not enough to keep the Nasdaq in positive territory. SLOWDOWN ON THE HOME FRONT Sales of previously owned U.S. homes fell 2.2 percent month over month in May, well below expectations for a rise of 5.5 percent. Analysts said the data bodes ill for the months ahead, now that a key federal tax credit for home buyers has expired. "It was generally expected that sales would be up, given earlier contract signings because of the tax credit, so it is a little surprising," said Paul Kasriel, senior vice president at Northern Trust in Chicago. "It's going to be a two-step forward, one-step backward housing recovery." MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS fell 1.34 percent, its first loss since June 7. European shares lost ground with the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  falling 0.43 percent to 1,050.79, breaking a nine-session win streak. After Fitch's move on BNP Paribas sent its shares down 1.92 percent, the entire sector weakened, with the STOXX Europe 600 banks index .SX7P off 0.79 percent. "Now everybody thinks that BNP is one of the most solid banks, so the heat is more on SocGen and Credit Agricole, and the latter gave a grim update on its exposure to Greece today," IG analyst Philippe De Vandiere said. Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) warned of worse-than-expected losses at its Greek unit Emporiki and said it would take a big write-down. Earlier, Japan's Nikkei  .N225  slid 1.2 percent to close at 10,112.89, a day after bouncing to a one-month high. EURO HURT BY BANK WORRIES Funding concerns of European banks led to a second day of losses for the euro against the greenback. The euro came off its lows, but still lost 0.35 percent to $1.2263. The euro barely reacted to the German Ifo business climate index, which hit a two-year peak in June, while the expectations index fell. The euro fell to an all-time low of 1.3590 Swiss francs after the Swiss central bank's vice chairman said the bank would not intervene in markets for now. The dollar hit 90.45 yen, down 0.45 percent. British Finance Minister George Osborne unveiled spending cuts and tax increases in the tightest budget in a generation. He cut growth forecasts only slightly, but slashed borrowing projections more than expected. The pound, however, erased earlier losses against the greenback to rise 0.40 percent to $1.4806. In the credit markets, benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose 22/32 of a point in price, pushing the yield down to 3.170 percent. Europe's 10-year Bund yield dropped 5.9 basis points at 2.691 percent. A barrel of U.S. light sweet crude oil settled at $77.21, down 61 cents or 0.78 percent. Spot gold rose $8.40, or 0.68 percent, to $1,240 an ounce.
