 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ), responding to a British newspaper report that a consortium was preparing a $50 billion bid for the company, said on Monday it has had no discussion about a leveraged buyout. 

 The statement sent Dow shares down 1.1 percent to $46.10 in after-hours trading, after they had risen 4.9 percent to $46.63 during trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts, meanwhile, expressed skepticism about a possible buyout, saying a strategic joint venture was more feasible. "The company has had no discussion about a leveraged buyout," Dow said in a brief statement after the NYSE closed for the day. The chemicals company said its board of directors "fully supports Dow's management team and its plan to continue enhancing value for all shareholders through the execution of its strategy." It said its statement was reiterating comments made earlier on Monday by Andrew Liveris, its chairman and CEO. Earlier on Monday, Dow had said it would not comment on market rumors and speculation. But a Dow spokesman, Chris Huntley, did say: "We harness tremendous power from integration, we are not going to move away from that strategy ... so a friendly takeover is not going to happen." He said most analysts agree that a hostile takeover is unlikely as Dow is too large and too integrated to allow such a bid to be successful. The Sunday Express, a British tabloid, had reported that an approach valuing Dow at $50 billion or more could come by the end of the week. The report, which quoted sources close to the deal, said at least half of the capital was being provided by investors from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, UAE and Oman, with the rest contributed by a number of U.S. buyout firms, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL. The Midland, Michigan-based company has been the subject of much speculation over the last few months. Besides being a suspected buyout target, it has been linked to joint ventures and other deals. In late February, the Sunday Express, without naming any sources, reported Dow might be the target of a leveraged buyout worth $54 billion. J.P. Morgan analyst Jeffrey Zekauskas said in a research note late last month: "We believe there is a low probability that a buyout will take place, but a reasonable probability that Dow can conclude a strategic joint venture for its Basic petrochemical assets, and perhaps other units as well." Citigroup analyst P.J. Juvekar said in a research note late last month: "We do not expect some kind of LBO or private equity buyout of Dow, it may do a deal in commodities, but we do not believe that selling the entire company or splitting off specialties from commodities is likely." Dow shares are up about 13 percent since mid-January, when the company was first reported to be a possible buyout target. Despite the rise, the shares trade at only 11.8 times projected 2007 earnings, compared with an average multiple of 18.2 for the components of the Standard and Poor's Chemical Index .GSPPM. HSBC analyst Hassan Ahmed said Dow has about $3 billion in cash and, based on conservative estimates, is in a position to generate about $14 billion in distributable cash over the next five years, making it attractive to private equity players. "Whether the deal takes this form or some other form, to a private equity player Dow is undervalued," Ahmed said.
