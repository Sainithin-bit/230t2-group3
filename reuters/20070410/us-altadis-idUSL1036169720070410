 MADRID/LONDON  (Reuters) - Franco-Spanish tobacco firm Altadis ALT.MC ALDS.PA rejected an improved 12 billion euro ($16 billion) bid proposal from Imperial Tobacco ( IMT.L ), but the British group said it would continue to pursue the deal. 

 Altadis, which makes Gauloises, Gitanes and Fortuna cigarettes, said on Tuesday it had received a new cash bid proposal of 47 euros per share from Imperial, up from the previous indicative offer of 45 euros a share, but said the 4.4 percent increase was not enough. "The board believes that the revised Imperial proposal ... reflects neither the strategic value of the company nor the diversity of its unique assets, nor its future growth prospects, and so it has unanimously decided to reject it," Altadis said in a statement. Imperial, which makes Lambert & Butler, Rizla rolling papers and Richmond cigarettes in Britain, and West and Davidoff in Germany, said it believed the offer was a fair price but said it would pursue the acquisition, leaving the door open for a higher offer. "The board of Altadis has rejected the revised proposal and has not granted Imperial Tobacco's request for limited due diligence," Imperial said in a statement. "Imperial Tobacco continues to believe that a combination with Altadis is strategically compelling and in the interests of both companies' shareholders," it added Analysts estimate Imperial would be able to make savings of at least 270 million euros a year from merging with Altadis and reckon Imperial could raise their offer further or even go hostile and approach shareholders directly. "We can see Imperial bidding 50 euros and still have the deal double digit earnings enhancing," said analyst Charles Manso de Zuniga at Dresdner Kleinwort. "I would imagine Imperial can raise the bid further but at some point if Altadis is not willing to consider the offer, Imperial will look to make the offer to shareholders." "We imagine they will be quite receptive," he added. Hostile bids are viewed as difficult to execute in the tightly regulated tobacco sector and have not been attempted in recent years. However Altadis's biggest shareholder, U.S. fund management firm Franklin Mutual Advisers, has already said it supports Imperial's approach. CLOSE THE GAP Imperial, the world's fourth biggest tobacco firm, is looking to buy fifth largest Altadis to close the gap with the top three tobacco companies, Altria Inc. ( MO.N ), British American Tobacco Plc ( BATS.L ) and Japan Tobacco Inc ( 2914.T ). At 1040 GMT, Altadis shares were down 0.3 percent at 47.45 euros. Imperial was up 0.3 percent at 22.70 pounds. The bid comes as companies in the industry look to make cost savings and expand in emerging markets to offset a decline in smoking in western markets, aggravated by smoking bans in public places in a number of European countries. Japan Tobacco agreed to buy Britain's Gallaher for 7.5 billion pounds in December, while Imperial agreed a $1.9 billion deal for Commonwealth Brands in February. Altadis said it was still studying its options and sources familiar with the matter said it had hired Merrill Lynch as a fourth defense adviser, to work alongside Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and NM Rothschild. The company is the second-biggest cigarette player in France and Spain and sold 118.6 billion cigarettes last year, with 2006 revenue from cigarettes of 1.7 billion euros. It has repeatedly said it sees itself as a buyer of assets, not a target, and has no plans to sell any of its three units -- cigarettes, cigars and logistics -- after its formation when Spain's Tabacalera and France's Seita merged in 1999. Last year the company was savaged by low-cost rivals, tough tax changes and a partial smoking ban in its biggest market, Spain. Though cigarette volumes tumbled 12.3 percent, management said 2006 was an exception and growth would return. (Additional reporting by Eleanor Wason and Elisabeth O'Leary)
