 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Workers at the U.S. unit of Britain's Rexam ( REX.L ), the world's largest can maker, went on strike on Tuesday after the company rejected their contract counterproposals. 

 The United Steelworkers union (USW) said its members at nine Rexam plants voted to strike after twice rejecting Rexam proposals that would replace labor agreements that expired on February 24. Rising health-care costs for current and retired workers remains a key stumbling block in the talks, the USW said in a statement. A spokesman for Rexam Beverage Can North American Co. said the company and the union had twice previously reached agreements, but both were voted down by the workers. "Our fair and competitive offer is still on the table. We are hopeful for a swift end to the strike," spokesman Greg Brooke told Reuters. Production would continue without the approximately 900 striking workers, he said. The USW gave no details of either tentative agreement with the company, the second of which was voted down April 4. USW International Vice President Fred Redmond, the chief negotiator for the union, said on Tuesday members were unhappy with health provisions. "The members have been emphatic in telling us that health care is too costly for both active employees and future retirees and the company has not done enough to meaningfully address their concerns," he said. "In addition, the company's conduct at all locations has undermined the bargaining process, making it impossible to reach a settlement that the members will ratify," he said. "The union will be filing unfair labor practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board," Redmond said. Plants hit by the strikes are in Chicago; Phoenix; Birmingham, Alabama; St. Paul, Minnesota; Whitehouse, Ohio; Chatsworth, California; Bishopville, South Carolina; Oklahoma City, and Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
