 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. ( TTWO.O ) said on Monday that Chief Financial Officer Karl Winters had resigned, marking further management upheaval at the troubled video game publisher. 

 The company, which is behind the blockbuster "Grand Theft Auto" video game series, will fill the CFO position on an interim basis with Lainie Goldstein, the current senior vice president of finance. A search for a permanent CFO is underway, it said in a statement. Winters' departure comes after dissident shareholders last month replaced the company's board and ousted its chief executive. At that time, the investors, who own about 46 percent of the company, had promised to review whether to keep Winters. The dissident investor group includes OppenheimerFunds Inc., D.E. Shaw Valence Portfolios and S.A.C. Capital Management. Shareholders have long lobbied for new management at the company, which has depended on "Grand Theft Auto" to drive revenue while failing to turn out new hits at the rates of its rivals. In addition, Take-Two has been hit with back-to-back scandals prompted by accounting issues, undisclosed sexual content in "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas" and improper stock options grants. The stock option troubles were back in the news last week when the company disclosed that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had issued a formal order of investigation into the matter. Shares of Take-Two fell 49 cents, or 2.3 percent, to close at $20.76 on Nasdaq prior to news of its CFO's resignation.
