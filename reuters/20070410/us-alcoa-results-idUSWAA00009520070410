 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), the world's largest aluminum company, said on Tuesday first-quarter profit rose nine percent, driven by higher metal prices and sales in the aerospace, building and construction and industrial product markets. 

 Net earnings were $662 million, or 75 cents per diluted share, compared with $608 million, or 69 cents per share in the same quarter last year, the Pittsburgh-based company said. Income from continuing operations was 77 cents per share but excluding restructuring charges, the company said it earned 79 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 77 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue for the quarter rose 11 percent to $7.9 billion from $7.1 billion, Alcoa said, adding that the increase was driven by higher metal prices and sales to the aerospace, building and construction, and industrial product markets. "Our focus on higher value-added solutions, such as aerospace products, and productivity programs helped to continue our momentum this quarter," said Alain Belda, Alcoa's Chairman and chief executive. Alcoa said production of alumina -- the raw material for aluminum -- was down 4 percent as a result of lower shipments, the impact of a strike in Guinea and a stronger Australian dollar.
