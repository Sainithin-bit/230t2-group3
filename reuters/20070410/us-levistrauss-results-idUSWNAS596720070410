 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Levi Strauss & Co. 9836.Q reported a 61 percent rise in quarterly net profit on Tuesday as a shift to higher-priced denim and apparel boosted sales. 

 Net profit in the first quarter rose to $87 million from $54 million in the year-ago period. Total sales rose 7 percent to $1.04 billion, the privately owned San Francisco-based company said. The manufacturer, whose iconic name dates back to the California Gold Rush, has been striving recently to make more premium, or higher-priced, denim in the face of a host of global competitors. The company has added premium retail accounts around the world and opened its own Levi's stores. "Our premium products are doing well with consumers in many markets," said Chief Executive John Anderson in a statement. The company managed last year to turn around years of declining sales. But challenges remain in Japan and with the company's low-cost Signature brand, which has lost shelf space at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), Anderson said. Operating income rose 11 percent during the quarter, helped by a $25 million benefit-plan curtailment gain related to the closure of a U.S. distribution center, lower interest expense and a lower tax rate, the company said.
