 FRANKFURT/PARIS  (Reuters) - French retailer PPR on Tuesday made a 5.3 billion euro ($7.07 billion) bid to hitch German sportswear company Puma to its line-up of iconic fashion brands Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. 

 PPR agreed to buy a 27 percent stake in Puma from German billionaires Guenter and Daniela Herz and make an offer for the rest of Puma, whose shoes have been worn by tennis star Serena Williams and the Italian soccer team. The French group said its 330-euro per share offer was definitive. Puma's management welcomed the move. But Puma shares traded well above the offer price as analysts speculated a counterbid could emerge from a rival such as Nike or that PPR might raise its offer. Puma said it had not received an approach from Nike, but its shares, which rose nearly 10 percent before the Easter holiday on market talk of a bid, were still up 8.2 percent at 339.85 euros in early afternoon trade. HVB raised its investment recommendation on Puma to "buy" from "hold", saying it believed a fair value for Puma shares would be more than 400 euros per share, including a takeover premium of at least 20 percent. Kepler Equities analyst Cedric Lecasble also said: "A counterbid might still be a possibility." PPR shares were up 2.3 percent at 131.91 euros, the top gainer in France's benchmark CAC-40 index, as analysts said PPR looked to have bought Puma cheaply. "The Puma deal looks cheap, certainly relative to luxury targets," Deutsche Bank said in a research note. It kept a "buy" rating on PPR shares. PUMA TO BOOST PPR EARNINGS Puma has often been the subject of bid speculation, especially in the wake of rival Adidas's $3.8 billion acquisition of Reebok last year. A senior, Paris-based trader said PPR's offer represented a multiple of 12 times Puma's enterprise value (EV) to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation) -- less than the 13 times EV/EBITDA multiple in Adidas's takeover of Reebok. PPR added it was open to further acquisition opportunities. "The company's strategy is one of organic growth. We don't need to make acquisitions to grow but we will be able to take hold of any other opportunities," Chief Executive Francois-Henri Pinault told analysts. PPR said the Puma acquisition would speed its sales growth and improve profitability and earnings per share. It expects to complete a five-week offer for Puma shares in early July. It said the highly recognizable Puma label would fit its brand portfolio and that PPR's resources would improve Puma's access to international markets and help expand its high-end product lines. Puma said cost cuts were not necessary in a deal with PPR, while PPR said it aimed to expand Puma's presence in the key United States market. Brokerage Natexis Bleichroeder kept a "buy" rating on PPR shares, saying: "We remain confident over PPR's track record in acquisitions." Based on latest prices, PPR shares have risen around 16 percent since the start of 2007, outperforming a 14 percent gain in the DJ Stoxx European retail sector. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Rothschild & Cie are advising PPR on the transaction.
