 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Puma ( PUMG.DE ) welcomed an intended takeover offer from French fashion retailer PPR ( PRTP.PA ) that values the company at about 5.3 billion euros ($7.1 billion) and said on Tuesday it would recommend the bid to its shareholders. 

 "The Puma board of management unanimously believes that PPR's engagement is in the best interests of the company and that the announced offer price per share of 330 euros for the voluntary public takeover offer is fair," Puma said. PPR said earlier it would make a public offer for the rest of the German sportswear group after agreeing to buy a 27-percent stake from Puma's largest shareholder, Mayfair.
