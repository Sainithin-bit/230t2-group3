 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Confidence among U.S. consumers slumped to an 18-month low in April, spooked by fears of a recession along with high gasoline prices and inflation worries, according to a survey released on Tuesday. 

 Investor's Business Daily and TechnoMetrica Market Intelligence said their IBD/TIPP economic optimism index fell to 45.5 from 50.8 in March. April's reading is the lowest since late 2004. The last time the index was below 50, indicating pessimism, was in August 2006. "Not surprisingly, a lot of talk about a possible recession, a scary one-day market shakeout, surging gasoline prices and inflation worries have given a negative tone to the economy," said Terry Jones, associate editor of Investor's Business Daily. "Despite solid economic indicators, like last month's 180,000 new jobs, fear more than anything seems to be hurting optimism," he added. Consumer sentiment is considered a predictor of spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.
