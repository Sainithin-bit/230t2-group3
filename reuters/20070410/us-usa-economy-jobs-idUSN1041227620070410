 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Employees left their jobs in February at a slightly faster pace than in January despite a second straight monthly drop in available positions, a government report showed on Tuesday. 

 The so-called quits rate rose to 2.0 percent in February from 1.9 percent in January, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Opening and Labor Turnover report. The slight rise in the quits rate, which represents voluntary departures, comes against a backdrop of a solid labor market. The rate of people leaving their jobs rose in the South, fell in the Northeast and was unchanged in both the Midwest and West, the report showed. The total rate of separations, a wider measure that covers all terminations of employment, fell to 3.3 percent in February from 3.4 percent the previous month. Fewer jobs opened in February and employers hired fewer workers. Labor Department data released early last month showed the U.S. economy added 97,000 jobs in February, the smallest gain in more than two years, while the unemployment rate edged down to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent. The overall job openings rate fell to 2.9 percent from 3 percent in January, while the hires rate fell to 3.5 percent from 3.6 percent. The monthly survey lags many job market gauges, but it can provide additional insight on labor market dynamics. Over the 12 months through February, hires averaged 4.9 million per month and separations averaged 4.6 million per month. For the comparable year-earlier period, hires averaged 4.8 million and separations 4.5 million.
