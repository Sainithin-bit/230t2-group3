 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. gasoline supplies appear to be adequate to meet summer driving demand, U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said on Tuesday. 

 "I think that we will see that supply will meet the demands of the driving season that is upcoming this summer," Bodman told reporters after addressing an energy conference at the Federal Trade Commission. Bodman pointed to high crude oil prices and refinery outages that have "added to uncertainties in the marketplace." The Energy Department's analytical arm is set to release later on Tuesday its forecast for U.S. summer gasoline prices and motor fuel supplies and demand. Traders are closely watching gasoline supplies in the United States prior to the peak summer driving season. Stocks of the motor fuel have dropped nearly 10 percent since early February amid refinery outages. Separately, Bodman said forming an international natural gas producers' group to control gas supplies and prices would lead to problems for both gas producing and consuming nations. "When you have anti-competitive activity it generally leads to problems for both the consuming nations as well as the supplying nations," Bodman said. Bodman declined to label the group as anti-competitive because "I don't know what they are yet," he said. "When you see all the suppliers gathering together in one place at the same time, or many of the suppliers, one has to worry about it," he said. Leading natural gas producers like Algeria and Russia met in Qatar on Monday and took a small step toward setting up an OPEC-style group, but sought to reassure consumer nations it was business as usual for now. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum, at its first meeting in two years, decided to establish a group of experts to study how to strengthen the previously toothless organization. In other comments, Bodman said the U.S. government was on track to begin in July supplying royalty oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its current capacity of 727 million barrels. The oil will come from energy companies who will turn over to the government a portion of the crude they drill on federal leases as royalties in lieu of cash royalty payments. In addition to using royalty-in-kind oil, the Energy Department plans to buy 11 million barrels of crude that will be put into the emergency stockpile.
