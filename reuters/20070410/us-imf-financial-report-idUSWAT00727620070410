 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The stability of the global financial system is underpinned by favorable economic prospects, but some financial markets risks have risen, the International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday. 

 "Global economic conditions have been supportive of a benign financial environment, but underlying risks and conditions have shifted somewhat since ... September 2006, and have the potential to weaken financial stability," the IMF said in its semi-annual Global Financial Stability Report. The fund pointed at the U.S. subprime mortgage market, involving borrowers with poor credit history, as one area of risk. It said the deterioration of the subprime market was more rapid than expected at this point in the downturn in the housing market as a whole. While the fallout in the subprime mortgage market has been limited to a small number of lenders, the IMF warned the problems could spread to other asset markets. In particular, the IMF said the looser underwriting standards may have gone beyond the subprime sector into portions of the so-called "Alt-A" mortgages, the next riskiest area. And there could be losses in other consumer credit markets, including credit card and subprime auto loans asset-backed securities, it said. "Financial supervisors need to identify the potential for spillovers from the cooling of the housing market and continue ensuring that mortgage underwriting standards are maintained," the IMF said. It also said the recent wave of massive corporate buyouts and mergers reveal a weakening of credit discipline. "So far, target firms are mostly those with high cash flows and low leverage," the fund said, adding: "However, there are signs that credit risks have risen as valuations of target companies are rising along with leverage, while credit discipline is eroding reflected the continued weakening of loan covenants. A collapse in one or more high-profile deals could expose banks and trigger a wider reappraisal of risks across a broader range of credit product, the IMF cautioned.
