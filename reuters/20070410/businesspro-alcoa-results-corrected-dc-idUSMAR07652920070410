 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ), the world's largest 
aluminum company, said on Tuesday first-quarter profit rose, 
driven by higher metal prices and sales in the aerospace, 
building and construction and industrial product markets. 

  Net earnings were $662 million, or 75 cents per diluted 
share, compared with $608 million, or 69 cents per share in the 
same quarter last year, the Pittsburgh-based company said.  Income from continuing operations was 77 cents per share.  Excluding restructuring costs, the company said it earned 
79 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate of 77 
cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Revenue for the quarter rose to $7.9 billion from $7.1 
billion, Alcoa said.
