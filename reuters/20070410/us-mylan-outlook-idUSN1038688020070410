 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Mylan Laboratories Inc. MYL.N on Tuesday raised its fiscal 2007 earnings forecast, citing the strong performance of its generic drugs business, pushing its shares up more than 3 percent. 

 The generic drugmaker boosted its 2007 forecast to a range of $1.60 to $1.63 per share, from its previous guidance of $1.50 to $1.55 and excluding any contribution from the late March launch of amlodipine besylate, a generic version of Pfizer Inc.'s ( PFE.N ) blockbuster Norvasc blood-pressure drug. Wall Street analysts had, on average, been forecasting adjusted earnings of $1.53 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Analysts said the forecast increase was likely driven by better-than-expected sales of generic forms of the Duragesic pain patch and the bladder control drug Ditropan. Last month, Mylan launched its generic version of Norvasc after a federal court ruled Pfizer's patent was invalid. Pfizer is planning to launch its own generic version of the drug, which had sales of $2.7 billion. The Pittsburgh-based drugmaker has exclusive rights to sell a generic form of Norvasc, pending a decision expected April 11 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA will rule on whether Mylan will get 180 days of exclusive selling rights typically granted to the first generic on the market. A court has prohibited the FDA from approving more generic versions from April 11 through at least April 13. That would allow Mylan time to respond should the agency decide to approve more generics. Mylan Chief Executive Robert Coury said the forecast excludes the Norvasc launch, pending the FDA decision. In any event, Coury said he expects Norvasc to add additional upside to its revised guidance. Mylan stock rose 65 cents, or 3.07 percent, to $21.85 on the New York Stock Exchange in afternoon trading.
