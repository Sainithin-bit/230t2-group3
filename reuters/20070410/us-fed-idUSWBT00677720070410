 MCALLEN, Texas  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Tuesday that policy-makers have "more work to do" to ensure that inflation does not run too high. 

 "We have a responsibility to make sure inflation does not get out of the bag, and I am among those in our school that believe we still have more work to do on that front," he told a community luncheon in this town near the Mexican border. Fisher, not a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting committee this year, also noted inflation remained too high. "The inflation rate that we currently see being measured on a 12-month average ... for the trimmed mean is about 2.3 percent, 2.3-2.4 percent, a little bit too high," Fisher said. The Dallas Fed calculates a trimmed mean of the personal consumption expenditures index that takes out the most volatile components of the series every month to get at the underlying inflationary trend. But he also stressed that monetary policy acts with a lag, and policymakers were watching price pressures to see whether the cumulative effect of interest rate increases over the last several years were biting. "We went through a series of tightening measures ... upward from very low levels to their current rate of 5.25 percent. It takes a while for that to kick in and have its impact, and impact expectations. "We are monitoring very carefully where inflation is presently, and of course will make sure we are able to carry forward that dual mandate," he said, referring to the Fed's legal obligation to seek full employment and low inflation. The Fed left interest rates unchanged at its policy meeting last month but removed an explicit reference to additional policy firming, a step toward a future rate cut if growth turns out to be weaker than expected. Fisher said the U.S. economy was in a soft patch right now, held back by a correction in the housing market, but should gather steam in the course of 2007. "I believe we will continue to grow, and the pace of growth will pick up as we go through the year," he said.
