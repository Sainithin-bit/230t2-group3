 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Media conglomerate Viacom Inc. said on Tuesday it chose Yahoo Inc. to provide search advertising for 33 of its Internet sites in a pact that Viacom sees expanding over time. 

 The deal is a high-profile boost to Yahoo's new Web ad system, dubbed Project Panama, which was launched in early February and is seen as a key test of its ability to compete with Web search leader Google Inc. The multiyear, exclusive advertising partnership with Yahoo covers broadband sites for Viacom's MTV, VH1, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon television networks and could expand to more than 140 additional sites worldwide, Viacom said. "There's a lot of compatibility between our company and Yahoo," Viacom Chief Executive Dauman said in a telephone interview, highlighting Yahoo's commitment to protect copyrighted material on its sites. "It would not surprise me that, over time, our relationship with Yahoo will grow." Viacom is in the midst of a $1 billion lawsuit against Google and its video sharing site, YouTube, over illegal use of its copyrighted entertainment. Dauman said the company had held discussions with Yahoo rivals Google and Microsoft Corp. before signing a deal with Yahoo on economic terms that were "highly satisfactory to us both in absolute and relative terms." "Clearly, this will enhance our digital revenue," he said. The company has forecast about $500 million in digital revenue this year, mostly from ad sales, but Dauman would not say whether the new deal would affect that expectation. Yahoo will provide search tools and serve up contextual advertising based on what a user is viewing online. "The quality of their Panama search capability was very impressive to us," Dauman said. The tie-up between Viacom and Yahoo highlights new competition to Google, which aims to translate its dominance of Web search into more traditional media and advertising formats, from television to publishing. It also marks renewed momentum for Yahoo after a year of setbacks, as Google won deal after deal in search, analysts said. Financial terms were not disclosed. "This is the most high-profile partnership since the launch of Panama," said Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Derek Brown, who rates Yahoo a "hold" and Google a "buy." UBS analyst Ben Schachter said the agreement could also help Yahoo secure more deals outside of search, with its ability to offer visually based display ads on Internet sites. "It's a positive for Yahoo. They're getting a good quality partner and inventory, which they need in their network," Schachter said. Google provides Web search on some of the Internet's largest networks, including News Corp.'s social networking site MySpace and Time Warner Inc.'s AOL. But media companies and Internet rivals have begun to challenge Google's ambitions. News Corp. and NBC Universal are set to launch an online video network to compete with YouTube. Online auctioneer eBay Inc. has ratcheted up its use of Yahoo search advertising this year. Yahoo also signed an ad partnership with 176 U.S. newspapers to let them use its technology to sell help-wanted advertising. "It is just not as straightforward as saying that Viacom signed a deal with Yahoo because Panama works," Brown said. "There are complex industry dynamics, to say the least." Yahoo declined to comment on the financial terms of the deal. "It is our typical revenue-sharing deal we use with most of our partners," said Yahoo spokeswoman Gaude Lydia Paez. Yahoo shares rose 5 cents to close at $31.69, while Viacom Class B shares fell 40 cents to $40.60. Google shed $1.71 to close at $466.50. (Additional reporting by  Eric Auchard  in San Francisco)
