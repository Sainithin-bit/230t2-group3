 BRIDGEWATER, Va  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin said on Tuesday the Fed has effectively anchored U.S. inflation by taking policy actions that have kept price rises low and stable. 

 "In recent years, the Federal Reserve has been quite successful in maintaining a nominal anchor," Mishkin said in an address at Bridgewater College. "Not only has the inflation rate remained within a reasonably narrow range, but inflation expectations, as measured by the spreads between inflation-indexed and non-inflation-indexed Treasury securities and by surveys of professional forecasters and the general public, have also been well anchored," he said. Mishkin's address was academic in nature, rather than focused on current economic conditions. He dwelt on the Fed's commitment to a dual mandate to guide its policy decisions by aiming for maximum sustainable employment and low inflation. Mishkin said a commitment to a "nominal anchor" allows the U.S. central bank to be ready to act more aggressively if necessary to counter negative shocks. "Moreover, with a strong commitment to a nominal anchor, supply shocks to inflation, such as a rise in relative energy prices, are likely to have only a temporary effect on inflation," he said, adding that has been the case for the United States. "Because people are confident the Fed will not allow inflation to remain high, the recent sharp run-up in oil prices did not lead to a sustained rise in longer-run inflation expectations," Mishkin said. But he said Fed policy-makers could not similarly anchor employment levels because that might put the broader economy at risk. "Any attempt to use stimulative monetary policy to maintain employment above its long-run sustainable level will inevitably lead to an upward spiral of inflation and therefore will actually undermine the productive capacity of the economy, with severe adverse consequences for household income and employment," Mishkin said.
