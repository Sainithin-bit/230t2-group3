 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Subprime lender New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ) has asked a federal bankruptcy judge to speed up the auction and sale of its main lending business while it still has value, court papers show. 

 New Century wants to sell its loan origination business by early May and sees an "exigent and immediate need" to set up bidding procedures, according to a late Monday filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Wilmington, Delaware. The Irvine, California-based company previously said it planned to sell major assets within 45 days of its April 2 bankruptcy filing, or around May 17. New Century stopped making loans last month, after making nearly $60 billion in 2006. "There is a narrow window of opportunity," wrote Marcos Ramos, a lawyer at Richards, Layton & Finger PA representing New Century. "Indeed, it might be difficult to pursue and complete a sale of the loan origination platform after early May because the debtors have ceased originating loans." New Century asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Carey to schedule an April 17 hearing to set up bidding procedures, and a May 15 hearing to approve a successful bid. The company previously agreed to sell its loan servicing unit to hedge fund Carrington Capital Management LLC for $133 million, down from an original $139 million. It also agreed to sell some loans to Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc's ( RBS.L ) Greenwich Capital Financial Products Inc. unit for $50 million. U.S. Trustee Joseph McMahon on Monday objected to the Greenwich Capital sale. He said it is unfair for New Century to pay a $1 million fee if the sale falls apart, and that it was unclear how well New Century is protecting consumer data. New Century was the largest independent U.S. provider of home loans to people with poor credit histories before seeking Chapter 11 protection. The company collapsed amid rising delinquencies and defaults, a federal criminal probe, and orders by or agreements with at least 17 U.S. states to stop lending. It fired 3,200 employees, or 54 percent of its work force, on April 2. Separately, Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) said it cut its stake in New Century to 2.51 million shares, or 4.5 percent, as of March 31 from 2.85 million shares, or 5.1 percent, a month earlier. Citigroup disclosed the lower stake in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing on Tuesday. It had been New Century's third-largest shareholder, Thomson ShareWatch said. New Century shares closed down 5 cents at $1.09 on the Pink Sheets. To view additional stories about the subprime lending crisis, click on nN16195443.
