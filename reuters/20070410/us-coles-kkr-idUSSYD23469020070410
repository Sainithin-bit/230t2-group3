 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Australia's Coles Group Ltd. said a Kohlberg Kravis Roberts-led consortium may top a A$19.7 billion ($16.1 billion) bid for the retailer by Wesfarmers Ltd., potentially triggering a bidding war and pushing Coles shares to a record high. 

 Australia's second-largest retailer has already attracted the country's biggest ever takeover offer from Wesfarmers, a home improvement-to-energy conglomerate, at A$16.47 a share. Last year, Coles rejected a KKR-led offer of A$15.25 a share. "It looks like it could turn into a bidding war. KKR have obviously done a lot of work on Coles," said Constellation Capital Management analyst Richard Norris, a Coles shareholder. Coles Chairman Rick Allert said in a statement on Tuesday that KKR was confident it could equal or beat the Wesfarmers bid price for Coles, which put itself up for sale in February. Coles shares rose as much as 2.7 percent to A$17.42, well above the Wesfarmers' offer, before closing up 2.1 percent in an overall market up 1.2 percent. Constellation's Norris suggested the bids were getting expensive, even taking into account the potential to turn around Coles' lagging core supermarkets business. "Normally, acquirers don't pay for what they haven't done yet," he said. He said Wesfarmers could "just as happily" take a profit on its Coles stake if KKR comes up with a higher offer. Potential bidders will get a look at Coles' books this week, in a process that has been accelerated by Wesfarmers' surprise offer last week. KKR, with other private-equity firms Bain, CVC, Blackstone Group, Carlyle Group and TPG, will be looking for more detail on what Coles is worth. Coles did not engage in detailed discussions last year with KKR, which made two failed bids. HOPES FOR A TURNAROUND Coles urged shareholders on Monday not to sell until the board had considered all alternative proposals, and said it had not indicated it would recommend Wesfarmers' offer. Argo Investments Managing Director Rob Patterson, holder of 2.6 million Coles shares, said he would wait for the board's recommendation, but noted Wesfarmers' bid would allow shareholders to take part in the company's improved performance. "The other bidders would be hard pressed to deliver that," he said. Perth-based Wesfarmers has won the backing of privately-owned Hedley Group, taking its voting control in Coles to 12.8 percent. The Myer department store chain, which was sold by Coles last year, turned in an 80 percent profit increase last month under new private equity owners, raising hopes for a turnaround at Coles, which has been losing market share to larger rival Woolworths Ltd. "Coles has always had a lot of upside potential for someone who would run it better," said Tyndall Investment Management analyst Craig Young. A spokesman for Wesfarmers said on Tuesday the company, which owns the Bunnings hardware chain, would take out advertisements in Australian newspapers this week to reach Coles' 350,000 shareholders, most of whom own less than 10,000 shares. The company's strong Australian focus would be mentioned, he said. Foreign ownership has been a political issue in the proposed takeover of Qantas Airways Ltd. and is often a sensitive issue for Australian companies. The proposed deal could lift Australia into the top spot in Asia for merger and acquisitions activity this year, according to Thomson Financial, with $31.3 billion in deals already announced in the first quarter. The A$16.47 a share bid values Coles at about 25 times forecast earnings, according to Reuters Estimates, on a par with Woolworths. A spokeswoman for Woolworths declined to comment on a report in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that the retailer was considering joining with private equity in a bid for Coles. Woolworths has expressed interest in the past in Coles' Officeworks and Target units, but would likely face an insurmountable obstacle with competition regulators in a bid for all of Coles, including the core supermarkets and liquor business. Woolworths holds about 40 percent of the food and liquor market in Australia, against around 35 percent for Coles. ($1=A$1.22)
