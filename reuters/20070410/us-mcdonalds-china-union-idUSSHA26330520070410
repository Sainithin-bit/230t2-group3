 SHANGHAI  (Reuters) - McDonald's ( MCD.N ) said on Tuesday that employees in southern China's Guangdong province would set up branches of the state-backed labor union, which last week accused the U.S. fast-food chain of breaching minimum wage laws. 

 "Since November last year, McDonald's China has been in productive discussions with Guangzhou city union officials, making progress in setting up a union branch," said McDonald's spokesman George Gu. "We will set up a union in Guangzhou this year." He denied Chinese media reports that the decision to cooperate with the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong, and elsewhere in the province, was a response to the recent wage issues. State-backed ACFTU said last week that McDonald's, Pizza Hut and KFC broke minimum wage laws in Guangzhou, urging tougher enforcement of employment laws. Guangzhou set the minimum wage for part-time workers at 7.5 yuan ($0.97) an hour at the start of this year, but the U.S. fast-food companies paid workers less than that, the union said. The companies are not under any legal obligation to sign contracts with students, who are not officially seen as part of the workforce, the Guangdong labor authority said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. The ACFTU had already set up branches at McDonald's restaurants in locations including Shanghai and Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, Gu said. Most of the subsidiaries in China under main rival Yum Brands Inc. ( YUM.N ), owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, have joined the ACFTU. Spokespersons at both companies said they were still working with labor authorities in Guangdong to investigate the salary issues, and said that they had followed Chinese laws. Last year, an official of the ACFTU said its goal was to double the amount of union branches to 60 percent of foreign businesses in China, naming computer maker Dell Inc. DELL.O, and photography company Eastman Kodak Co. EK.N among those that would be targeted. Employees at Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), the world's biggest retailer, set up the company's first trade union in the country last July. Within weeks, unions had been established at all of Wal-Mart's 60 outlets in 30 cities across China. In China, where independent unions are illegal, belonging to the state trade federation does not necessarily mean better labor standards or higher wages. With increasing numbers of Chinese workers leaving the state sector and working in private and foreign companies, analysts say the drive to unionize could be aimed at trying to bring more employees under state control.
