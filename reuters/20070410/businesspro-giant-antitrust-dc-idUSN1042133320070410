 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Antitrust lawyers at the U.S. 
Federal Trade Commission are recommending that the agency go to 
court to block plans by oil refiner Western Refining Inc. 
( WNR.N ) to acquire Giant Industries Inc. GI.N, two sources 
familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday. 

  The commission was scheduled to take up the recommendation 
at a Tuesday meeting that began at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) and 
could vote on whether to block the deal later in the afternoon, 
the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Western Refining has agreed to pay $77 per share, or about 
$1.13 billion, for Giant in a deal that would create an 
independent refiner and marketer with capacity of about 216,000 
barrels per day largely in Virginia, Texas, Arizona and New 
Mexico.  The deal won unanimous approval from the board of directors 
at both companies.  The purchase plan was originally announced on August 28 
when Western said it would pay $1.22 billion for Giant. The 
agreement was amended to $77 per share in November from the 
original $83 per share after two fires at Giant's refineries.  The deal would give Western a foothold in the eastern 
United States with Giant's Yorktown refinery, and let it expand 
in the fast-growing southwestern market with the Ciniza 
refinery.  In February, Western Refining said the deal was delayed by 
a request from the FTC for additional information.
