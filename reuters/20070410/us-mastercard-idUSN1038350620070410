 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc. ( MA.N ), the second-largest credit card company, said on Tuesday it would change its ownership structure to free up more shares for public trading, and it announced a $500 million stock buyback. 

 The company also said it awarded Chief Executive Robert Selander $22.26 million of compensation for 2006, when MasterCard went public after decades under the ownership of financial institutions. MasterCard has about 25,000 partner institutions, which together still hold a 41 percent stake. MasterCard said it will let the institutions convert a limited number of Class B shares, which are not publicly traded, into Class A shares each year. It previously said it planned to start the conversion in 2010. MasterCard shares have nearly tripled since their May 24 initial public offering. "This gives financial institutions an opportunity to sell shares in the open market," said Charles Rauch, a director at Standard & Poor's. "It also allows them to redeploy funds elsewhere, and realize a gain." For 2007, the institutions may convert up to 13.4 million Class B shares into Class A shares. To offset possible dilution, MasterCard said it would buy back up to $500 million of Class A shares, or 5.8 percent of those outstanding. Both moves require shareholder approval at the Purchase, New York-based company's June 7 annual meeting. MasterCard said speeding up the conversion would limit possible disruption in 2010 were the institutions to dump many shares at once. Rauch said the changes "overcome certain structural shortcomings of the current system," and come as "shareholders' calls to return some of MasterCard's approximately $2.5 billion of cash are getting louder." On a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Chris McWilton said the changes were neither "designed or in response to demands from any particular set of shareholders," nor in response to litigation developments. Retailers have filed many lawsuits against MasterCard and larger rival Visa, accusing them of price-fixing that costs merchants and consumers tens of billions of dollars a year. S&P assigns MasterCard a "BBB-plus" credit rating, a low investment grade, with a stable outlook. CEO PAY Selander's pay included a $900,000 salary, $4,886,000 of non-equity incentive awards, $14.02 million of stock and option awards, and $2.45 million of other compensation, according to a proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Most of the other compensation related to awards under incentive and defined contribution plans. It also included $11,748 for car service and $3,193 for a home security system. Selander, 56, also realized $2.9 million from the vesting of 29,465 shares and could receive $73.13 million of awards and benefits upon a change in control, MasterCard said. Compensation is based on salary, bonus, the value of stock options and other awards granted during the year, and incentives and perks. MasterCard shares rose $2.29, or 2.1 percent, to $110.63 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They went public at $39 each. Visa in October said it might go public in 12 to 18 months. (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb )
