 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O, the world's second-largest personal computer maker, said on Monday that Nasdaq had informed the company it was out of compliance with listing requirements. 

 Dell received the letter on April 5, 2007, it said, after it delayed filing its annual report for fiscal 2007. It previously received a notice from Nasdaq related to its quarterly report. Earlier, Dell said Nasdaq would stay any future action to delist the company's common stock, pending further review.
