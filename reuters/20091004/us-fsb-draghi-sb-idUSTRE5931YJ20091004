 ISTANBUL  (Reuters) - The financial sector remains fragile and institutions should take advantage of continuing fiscal and monetary stimulus to strengthen their capital, Financial Stability Board President Mario Draghi said on Sunday. 

 "The financial sector is certainly more solid than five to six months ago but it is still fragile and there is a strong need of capital," Draghi told reporters after addressing the International Monetary Fund. "There is a better climate due to the continued fiscal and monetary system and institutions should take the opportunity now to strengthen their capital position." Draghi gave short shrift to concerns by some bankers over FSB recommendations for tighter financial regulation. "We must dispel expectations that business can go on just as before; the world has changed," he said at a news conference. However, Draghi stressed that the FSB was engaged in constant consultation with the financial sector and had no wish to impose change in a rushed way. "There should be an assessment of each single change but also the overall impact that all these changes will make on the system," he said. Areas the FSB is working on include a more regulated market for derivatives, strengthening accounting standards, improving compensation practices, strengthening banks' capital framework and expanding oversight of the financial system. The body was set up by the Group of 20 advanced and emerging economies last year to oversee stability of the financial system, and ensure that regulatory systems agreed globally are applied consistently in each country. It succeeded the Financial Stability Forum, which Draghi headed since 2006. Draghi defended stress tests published last week which showed Europe's foremost banks would be sufficiently resilient, even to a stronger-than-expected economic downturn. The tests have been criticized in some quarters as lacking transparency, but Draghi said they were accurate. "They are good tests, because they are bottom-up, not top-down," he said. The FSB has not yet discussed the tests, he said. He warned that the economic recovery in the euro zone was likely to be "very slow and fragile." Draghi, who is widely tipped to become the next president of the European Central Bank when Jean-Claude Trichet's term expires in 2011, declined to comment directly on this speculation. "We have an excellent president: Jean-Claude Trichet," he said. (Editing by  Andrew Torchia )
