 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - MGM Resorts International ( MGM.N ) reported lower fourth-quarter earnings at most of its resorts in Las Vegas, the company's most important market, sending its shares down nearly 4 percent. 

 MGM, reported to be planning a public listing of shares in its Macau joint venture at the end of February, posted a narrower net loss for the quarter as it cut expenses. "It's all good in Macau," said Sanford Bernstein analyst Janet Brashear, referring to MGM's joint venture with Pansy Ho, daughter of gaming billionaire Stanley Ho, which is gaining market share. "But in Las Vegas the trend is down, and we want the trend to be up by now." At MGM's high-end Bellagio resort in Las Vegas, earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization rose 10.5 percent to $75.5 million, but earnings fell 30 percent to $32.5 million at the MGM Grand. At the Mirage resort, EBITDA fell 12 percent during the quarter to $21.5 million. Wells Fargo analyst Carlo Santarelli said the company's overall fourth-quarter EBITDA of $252 million was roughly $21 million below his estimate. The operator of Las Vegas casinos ranging from Bellagio to Circus Circus opened its flagship CityCenter project on the Las Vegas Strip at the end of 2009 and has struggled during the recession and downturn in consumer spending. "We are encouraged in early 2011 by the level of business activity we are seeing," Chief Executive Officer Jim Murren said in a statement. "Our forward booking pace is currently ahead of last year, led by a stronger convention mix which we believe will position our company to have a better year than last." He predicted that MGM's Las Vegas revenue per available room -- a measure of lodging industry health -- would increase by 10 percent in the current quarter from a year earlier. MGM posted an adjusted fourth-quarter loss of 20 cents per share, compared with analysts' average forecast of a loss of 22 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The net loss was $139.2 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $433.9 million, or 98 cents a share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose to $1.47 billion from $1.45 billion, in line with analysts' estimates. MGM owns 10 resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, where it makes the bulk of its profits, as well as casino-resorts in Mississippi and Michigan and joint ventures in New Jersey and Macau. The company's Macau joint venture, which originally filed early last year for an anticipated Hong Kong initial public offering, is expected to raise about $800 million with the upcoming IPO, according to sources. MGM Macau has fourth-quarter operating income of $119 million, up from $22 million a year earlier. Shares of MGM have gained about 30 percent over the past 12 months, compared with an increase of 70 percent for the Dow Jones U.S. Gambling Index .DJUSCA. The company's shares were down 59 cents at $14.95 on the New York Stock Exchange early Monday afternoon.
