 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan may revise its economic assessment upward on Tuesday on signs that an end to stagnation is near but will stick to its ultra-easy policy bias, wary of risks to the outlook such as a spike in commodity costs. 

 A rebound in exports and factory output, driven by robust demand in fast-growing Asia, has underscored the central bank's view that the economy is heading toward a moderate recovery after hitting a soft patch. BOJ policymakers thus see no imminent need to ease policy further through an increase in asset purchases and will instead focus on assessing the strength of the recovery. "The economy is no longer stalling so there's a good chance the BOJ will revise up its assessment," said Kyohei Morita, chief economist at Barclays Capital Japan. "With the economy now on course to expand moderately, it's unlikely the central bank will ease policy again this year." The BOJ is widely expected to keep interest rates on hold at a range of zero to 0.1 percent. Japan's economy shrank slightly in the final quarter of last year. But firm exports, driven by a rise in shipments to China, convinced many in the BOJ that the economy will perform as forecast with the resumption of a moderate recovery toward the middle of this year. Governor Masaaki Shirakawa voiced such optimism when he said last week that the economy was emerging from a temporary pause and showing "good signs." That should be evident in the BOJ's language on Tuesday after its rate review. Last month, the BOJ described exports as "somewhat weak" and output as declining. It is expected to change its wording to reflect the rebound. The BOJ may also strike a more optimistic note on the overall economy, dropping or modifying a phrase it has been using that growth was "pausing momentarily," although some central bankers may feel it is too early for a rephrasing. COMMODITY SPIKE MAY HURT With the yen off a 15-year peak against the dollar hit late last year, the central bank has no need to ease policy further. But it will reiterate that it will stick to its ultra-easy monetary policy and near-zero rates for years until an end to deflation is in sight. Inflationary pressure from rising commodity costs is a far less imminent problem for the BOJ, which is battling with deflation, than it is for some of the bank's counterparts in Asia and Europe. The BOJ last year cut interest rates effectively to zero and set up a 5 trillion yen ($60 billion) pool of funds to buy assets ranging from government bonds to private debt, aiming to support a fragile economy and pull Japan out of deflation. BOJ officials have said topping up the asset buying plan is a clear option if downside risks to growth materialize, although expectations of an imminent monetary easing have diminished on growing signs that Japan's economy will soon emerge from a lull. Still, the BOJ remains on guard against potential risks to growth, such as Europe's debt woes and an increasing market focus on Japan's bulging public debt, which could trigger disruptive market moves. Inflation fears stemming from rising commodity prices have nudged several Asian central banks to raise interest rates, threatening to hurt demand in Japan's key export destinations. Rising raw material costs, which boosted Japan's annual wholesale inflation to a two-year high in January, could become a headache for the BOJ. While the higher costs may eventually push up consumer prices and ease deflationary pressures, they will squeeze corporate profits as weak domestic demand makes it difficult for companies to pass on rising costs to consumers. Markets are focusing on what Shirakawa has to say in his news conference about the potential impact of the spike in commodity costs on the fragile economy and the BOJ's price forecasts. The BOJ expects Japan to achieve core consumer inflation of 0.3 percent in the year beginning in April and 0.6 percent in the following year. ($1=83.41 Yen) (Editing by Edmund Klamann)
