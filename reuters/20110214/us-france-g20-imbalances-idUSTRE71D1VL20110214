 PARIS  (Reuters) - The Group of 20 economic powers will discuss whether current account and trade balances should be included in a range of indicators used to track economic imbalances, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday. "Among the indicators, there is the current account balance, which is quite logical," Lagarde told a news conference presenting France's aims for a meeting at the end of the week of G20 finance ministers and central bankers in Paris. 

 She added that there was also "a long debate on whether to include the trade balance with its flows of products and whether to include flows of services." Bank of France Governor Christian Noyer said that the debate was not intended to be an exercise in point fingers at countries with large deficits. (Reporting by  Daniel Flynn  and  Leigh Thomas )
