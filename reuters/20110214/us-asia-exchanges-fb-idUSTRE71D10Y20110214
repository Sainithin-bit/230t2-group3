 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - The proposed tie-up between NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse, along with the London Stock Exchange's move for Canada's TMX Group, has prompted talk the global exchange market is set to shrink to two or three big players. 

 But a reluctance by many Asian nations to cede control to foreign ownership and the struggle to improve capital-market integration means their exchanges are unlikely to have a seat at the table. Here are some key facts about major Asian stock exchanges: Tokyo Stock Exchange: * Total market value of companies traded: 314.7 trillion yen ($3.8 trillion). * Companies listed: 2,290 * Average daily traded value: 1.467 trillion yen (Nine months to January 1) * Ownership: Closely held. Has no plans to list. It has 114 shareholders, mostly banks and brokerages. * Restrictions on ownership: No specific restrictions on foreign ownership, but shareholders unlikely to approve any buyout bid. * Partnerships and plans: Has tieups with several bourses. Looking for an alliance with a bourse outside Asia in a separate time zone. Interested in linking up with higher-growth exchanges. Not in any specific deal talks now. HONG KONG * Total market cap of companies traded: $2.7 trillion. * Total market cap of the exchange: About $20 billion; the world's most valuable exchange. * Number of companies traded: 1,420 * Ownership: Listed. The Hong Kong government is the biggest shareholder, followed by other institutions such as Blackrock, Oppenheimer and JP Morgan Asset Management. About half of the board members are Hong Kong government-appointed. * Restrictions: Anybody seeking to buy 5 percent or more would have to seek the Hong Kong government's approval. Any company that wishes to make a bid for the exchange will need Hong Kong government consent. * Partnerships and plans: No significant tie-ups recently. There were talks a few years ago on Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges possibly merging. However, a merger failed to materialize then due to technical and logistics issues, such as currency convertibility. Exchange operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd said it is not in talks with any other exchanges for mergers or alliances. However, it said it may seek strategic alliances if they presented "strategically compelling benefits consistent with our focus on markets in Greater China. SHANGHAI * Total market cap of companies traded: $2.76 trillion * Number of listed companies: 901 * Ownership: Unlisted. Shanghai stock exchange is a membership institution directly governed by the China Securities Regulatory Commission(CSRC). Its members include securities firms such as state-linked CITIC Securities, UBS Securities and Shenyin & Wanguo Securities. The exchange is not open to foreign companies, which means that they cannot list on the exchange. * Restrictions: The exchange ownership is now based on a membership structure and so, any deals might require a change into a company, equity-based structure. * Partnerships and plans: No significant tie-ups recently. There were talks about two years ago on Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges possibly merging. However, Shanghai was not keen on a merger. SHENZHEN * Total market cap of companies traded: $1.26 trillion * Number of companies traded: 1,200 * Ownership: The Shenzhen stock exchange is a self-regulated legal entity supervised by the CSRC. Like the Shanghai stock exchange, it is also based on a membership structure. * Restrictions: The exchange ownership is now based on a membership structure and so, any merger and acquisition deals might require a change into a company, equity-based structure. * Partnerships and plans: No significant tie-ups recently, except for some memorandum of understanding with regional bourses such as Osaka Securities Exchange to boost information exchange. Singapore Exchange * Total market cap:S$899.8 billion * Number of companies listed: 785 (SGX also has a large derivatives, commodities and OTC settlement businesses) * Ownership: The biggest shareholder is Financial Development Fund (Controlled by the central bank but it holds non-voting shares); Tokyo Stock Exchange (4.99 pct) * Restrictions: No party can acquire 5 pct or more of SGX without clearance from the central bank. * Partnerships and plans: SGX has offered to buy Australian bourse operator ASX for a mix of cash and shares in a deal worth $7.9 billion. Bombay Stock Exchange: * The oldest stock exchange in Asia; was established in 1875 * Companies listed have a total market capitalization of more than $1 trillion. * Number of companies listed: More than 4,900. * Ownership: Unlisted.
