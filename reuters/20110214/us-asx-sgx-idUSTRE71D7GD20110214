 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australian bourse operator ASX ( ASX.AX ) said it was in talks with suitor Singapore Exchange ( SGXL.SI ) about changes to proposed board arrangements as the sides seek to win political and regulatory support for their proposed $7.9 billion tie-up. 

 ASX shares were placed in a trading halt Tuesday at the company's request pending an announcement. "ASX makes the request pending the announcement of the progress of discussions concerning changes to the governance arrangements in connection with the ASX-SGX merger proposal," the company said without giving further details. The deal needs the support of the Australian government which sources and local media say wants the ASX to have greater board representation in the merged group. ASX requested the trading halt for two days or until the company requests the halt be lifted. The exchange is scheduled to release half-year results on February 17. A wave of consolidation at stock exchanges globally has thrown the spotlight on Asia's bourses and sparked a rally in ASX shares last week on expectations the deal now had a greater chance of overcoming political hurdles. Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) announced last week it was in talks to buy NYSE Euronext NYX.N, while the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) has agreed to buy Canadian market operator TMX ( X.TO ).
