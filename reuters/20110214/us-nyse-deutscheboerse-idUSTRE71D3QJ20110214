 NEW YORK/FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Deutsche Boerse ( DB1Gn.DE ) and NYSE Euronext NYX.N are expected to side-step thorny political issues as they announce a deal on Tuesday to create the world's largest exchange operator. 

 The two have hammered out a broad framework for a deal that focuses on functions and personalities, with several executives chosen for key posts across Europe and the United States, three people familiar with the plan said. Among the issues they will leave in the too-hard basket for now are what to call the merged entity, how exactly it will cut costs, and which technologies it will favor, the sources said. Putting these off may only add to the questions being asked by some politicians on both sides of the Atlantic about whether the deal should be approved. Any delay could also open the door to rival bidders for NYSE Euronext -- one news report on Monday cited CME Group Inc ( CME.O ) as a potential buyer. Some issues facing Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext, which could still derail the plan, would need to be resolved over the coming weeks, said the sources, who requested anonymity because talks continue. "The biggest question mark in general is obviously the European political and regulatory landscape coming out of this," one source said. The boards of NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse are set to vote Tuesday, and a formal deal announcement could come by mid-morning (Eastern Time), two sources said. The Frankfurt- and New York-based companies were centerstage in the merger frenzy that erupted last week, and which heated up on Monday as Brazil's BM&FBovespa ( BVMF3.SA ) said it was eyeing its own prospects and as traders buzzed that CME Group could jump into the fray. Fox Business Network reported that CME Group, currently the world's top derivatives exchange group, may make a hostile bid for NYSE Euronext, citing bankers. A spokesman for Chicago-based CME declined to comment. CME officials have been guiding investors away from expectations that the company would do a merger deal. BM&FBovespa, the world's fourth-largest financial exchange operator, is closely watching for tie-up opportunities, Chief Executive Edemir Pinto told Reuters. Pinto said BM&FBovespa is interested in China and India as markets where it could pursue expansion because of their growth potential and similarities in terms of products. He added that a partnership with CME also has "room to grow," but did not elaborate. 'SENSITIVE AND COMPLICATED' NYSE Euronext's general counsel, chief operating officer and global head of technology are all set to retain their positions in the combined group, two people familiar with the plan told Reuters on Monday. The companies had previously announced that NYSE Euronext head Duncan Niederauer would head the combined company, Deutsche Boerse Chief Executive Reto Francioni would be chairman, and that the German company's shareholders would get about a 60 percent stake. Job cuts in technology and other issues still need to be worked out in detail, sources said. One source said deciding on a name is "sensitive and complicated," and would take time. Negotiations over a name and where to locate various operations highlight some of the difficulties in bringing together companies that are both operationally complicated and symbols of national pride. Past merger attempts have failed over such issues. The announcement last week that Deutsche Boerse and NYSE Euronext were in talks came within hours of another blockbuster deal in the exchanges sector: London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) agreed to buy Canada's TMX Group ( X.TO ). On Monday, Industry Minister Tony Clement said Canada will review the LSE bid under the Investment Canada Act. Clement has 45 days from the moment the review begins to make a decision on whether the deal is of net benefit to Canada. He said he expected that period to begin in one or two weeks. He can extend that period by a further 30 days, and lawyers have said that scenario is likely. The four Canadian provinces where TMX has operations -- British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec -- are also reviewing the deal. Nasdaq OMX ( NDAQ.O ), a notable odd-man out in the merger frenzy, suffered a setback on Monday when it lost Chief Financial Officer Adena Friedman to private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL. Friedman, who joined the exchange in 1993 and took the CFO's job in August 2009, led Nasdaq's purchases of OMX AB and the Philadelphia Stock Exchange. OUTRAGE In Germany, the deal is being sold as a German takeover of the NYSE or as a merger of equals. Any suggestion that the NYSE management team will be in control counters that public stance and could create an obstacle to the deal getting done. According to the sources, NYSE Euronext Deputy CEO Dominique Cerutti would be head of global IT at the combined company and would be based in Paris; NYSE Euronext's Lawrence Liebowitz would stay on as chief operating officer and head of global listings and cash markets and would be based in New York; NYSE Euronext General Counsel John Halvey would also retain his post. Andreas Preuss, CEO of Deutsche Boerse's Eurex derivatives unit, would likely be deputy CEO of the merged companies and would be responsible for derivatives operations, one of the sources said. Still a supervisory board member at the German exchange said Deutsche Boerse risks ceding control to NYSE Euronext. "Just like in the Euronext deal, it will be a matter of time before the Americans take control. We should be wary of this. It won't be possible to undo the deal once it is signed," Johannes Witt, a labor representative, said. Remarks made on Sunday by U.S. Senator Charles Schumer that a tie-up would give NYSE managerial control served as a warning, he added. Under Germany's system of corporate governance, companies operate under a two-tier board structure, with a management board, consisting of executives, and a supervisory board which is half composed of labor representatives. Labor representatives such as Witt play a powerful role in German supervisory boards, which control management boards. The financial regulator at the German regional state of Hesse, home to Deutsche Boerse, reiterated that it would seek to preserve the interests of Frankfurt as a financial center, when reviewing the plans. The regulator, part of the state's financial ministry, bestows the license to operate a stock exchange in the state of Hesse and must approve any merger agreement. A spokesman for the German Finance Ministry said the role of the national government in the merger would be limited. France has also voiced worries over the role of Paris, formerly home of Euronext, in the combined group.
