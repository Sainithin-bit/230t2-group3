 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Obama administration is turning to the pharmaceutical industry to squeeze out more savings to help reduce the deficit and cover other health initiatives such as the implementation of last year's healthcare overhaul. 

 In his fiscal 2012 budget proposal released on Monday, President Barack Obama took another shot at cheaper versions of generic biologic drugs by seeking to cut the number of years drugmakers could exclusively market brand-name biologics from 12 years to seven. Under the healthcare reform law passed last year, brandname drugmakers won 12 years of exclusive sales under an new U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process to allow generic versions of biologics. Such medicines treat conditions ranging from cancer to arthritis and are made from proteins, which can make them more complex to manufacture and more costly. Generic drugmakers had fought for a shorter period of exclusivity, and on Monday the Obama administration said 12-years of protection could harm consumer access to much needed drugs. Its 7-year proposal "strikes a balance between promoting affordable access to medication while at the same time encouraging innovation to develop needed therapies," the White House said in budget documents. The administration also set its sights on ending controversial "pay-for-delay" deals that affect traditional, chemical drugs by giving the U.S. Federal Trade Commission power to block them. Under such deals, brandname and generic drugmakers settle patent legal challenges with payoffs that keep lower-cost rival drug from the market for a certain period of time. Obama's budget also again proposed industry fees to pay for the review of new generic drugs. Other proposed fees would cover FDA reinspections of drug and device manufacturers as well as additional FDA food safety fees starting in 2013. (Reporting by  Susan Heavey ; Editing by  Sandra Maler )
