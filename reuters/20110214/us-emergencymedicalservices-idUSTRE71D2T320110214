 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice said it would buy healthcare and physician services company Emergency Medical Services Corp EMS.N for a discount price of about $3 billion. 

 At $64 a share, the deal is 9 percent below EMS' closing price of $70.66 on Friday. Canadian private equity firm Onex Corp ( OCX.TO ), which holds a 31 percent stake, said it supported the buyout. Shares of the company had surged some 30 percent since mid-December, when Emergency Medical said it was reviewing its strategic alternatives. They fell 10.9 percent to $62.98 in morning trading after the deal was announced. "It's obviously a discount, but I'm not sure we're calling this a discount on value yet," said Kaufman Bros analyst Dawn Brock, who said she was still sorting through recent changes in EMS' debt and cash levels as well as the transaction fees involved. "There were clearly changes in the capital structure that I wasn't banking on in my valuation," Brock said. The price values Emergency Medical at 8 times EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), where the market was expecting a deal of around 9 or 10 times, according to Oppenheimer & Co analyst Michael Wiederhorn. "We are surprised that EMS did not command a premium valuation given its long-term growth opportunities from acquisitions and healthcare reform," Wiederhorn said in a research note, although he said he believed the deal had been "fully vetted" by private equity companies and potential strategic buyers. Emergency Medical's American Medical Response Inc unit provides ambulance services, and its EmCare Holdings business provides physician services to hospitals. The Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company provided services in more than 2,200 communities last year. The parties valued the deal at $3.2 billion on Monday. It is worth about $2.9 billion, based on the number of shares and options outstanding, according to two sources familiar with the situation. One of the sources said there would be no "go-shop" provision which is typically a 30-45 day period that allows potential rival bidders to come in. Both strategic and financial buyers had reviewed the deal, but the market had gotten ahead of itself on the deal price, the source said. "If you tried to run the math on an acquisition of $70, you would quickly understand that it would be a very challenging deal for anyone to do especially a financial sponsor that is looking to make a decent return," the source said. "The equity investors were overzealous on this one," the source said. "We expect there will be some kind of lawsuits from people." Plans call for the deal to close in the second quarter, after which EMS shares will no longer be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Onex said it planned to vote in favor of the sale. Under the deal terms, Onex and its co-investors will sell their remaining 13.7 million Emergency Medical shares, or 31 percent equity stake, for $878 million. According to the press release from CD&R and EMS, Onex and its affiliates "have sufficient voting power to approve the merger." The source familiar with the situation said Onex had at least 80 percent of the voting power. Based on the per-share cash cost of $6.67 to acquire the business in 2005, Onex is selling the stake for about 10 times what it paid, it said. Another source familiar with the matter had told Reuters on Sunday that Clayton, Dubilier & Rice was close to a deal for Emergency Medical. Rival private equity firm Bain Capital had also been pursuing Emergency Medical Services, a source familiar with the matter previously told Reuters. Private equity firms are sitting on substantial capital to invest and scouring the market for companies to buy, but in some recent cases have found themselves outbid. Buyout firms including TPG Capital TPG.UL, Blackstone Group ( BX.N ), Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Apollo Management APOLO.UL recently lost out in an auction of Beckman Coulter BEC.N when the medical diagnostics company sold itself to Danaher Corp ( DHR.N ) for $5.8 billion. Goldman Sachs & Co ( GS.N ) and BofA Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ) acted as financial advisers to EMS, while CD&R was advised by Barclays Capital ( BARC.L ), Deutsche Bank Securities Inc ( DBKGn.DE ), Morgan Stanley & Co ( MS.N ), RBC Capital Markets ( RY.TO ) and UBS Investment Bank ( UBSN.VX )( UBS.N ).
