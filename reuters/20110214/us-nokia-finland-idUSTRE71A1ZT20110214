 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia is set to cut thousands of jobs in Finland as part of the strategic overhaul which it unveiled on Friday, the chairman of the local labor union said on Friday. 

 "It seems it means thousands of jobs in Finland," said Chairman Antti Rinne from white collar union Ammattiliitto Pro. Nokia's chief executive Stephen Elop confirmed to a press conference in London the company will cut jobs in Finland and elsewhere. "There will be substantial reductions in employment in various locations around the world, and that too will affect Finland," Elop said, adding it was too early to estimate how many jobs might be cut. The Finnish government said it was prepared to help people find new jobs. "This is the biggest structural reform which has ever impacted new technology in Finland," Economy Minister Mauri Pekkarinen said in a statement. "Finland will remain our home," Elop told the press conference. Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks employed some 132,000 people at the end of last year, of those 19,800 in Finland. More than 6,000 people work for Nokia's research and development in four Finnish cities. (Additional reporting by Victoria Klesty; Editing by Greg Mahlich)
