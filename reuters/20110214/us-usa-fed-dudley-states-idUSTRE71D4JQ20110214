 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The condition of state and local finances is "dire" in some places in the United States, but the size of the budget gaps is "pretty small" compared to the size of the national economy, New York Federal Reserve Bank President William Dudley said on Monday. 

 "If you sum up the amount of the budget gaps across the country in all states, it amounts to roughly 1 percent of GDP. It's bad, but in the aggregate, if you compare it to the overall size of the national economy, it's pretty small," he told reporters at a press briefing. Dudley also said he currently wouldn't view events in Egypt as having repercussions that would affect the U.S. economic outlook.
