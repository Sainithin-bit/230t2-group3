 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell criticized President Barack Obama's fiscal 2012 budget on Monday, saying it locked spending at "completely unsustainable" levels. 

 "The president talks like someone who recognizes that spending is out of control, but so far it hasn't been matched with action," McConnell said in a statement. "Americans don't want a spending freeze at unsustainable levels. They want cuts, dramatic cuts. And I hope the president will work with us on achieving them soon."
