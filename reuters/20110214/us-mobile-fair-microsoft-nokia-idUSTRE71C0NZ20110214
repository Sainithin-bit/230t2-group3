 BARCELONA  (Reuters) - Nokia's decision to use Microsoft's Windows Phone operating software in its smartphones will have repercussions for many companies attending this week's annual Mobile World Congress industry fair in Barcelona. 

 Following are some of the companies affected: MICROSOFT - Hitherto a very distant challenger to the market leaders for smartphone software. Microsoft has tried to conquer the mobile market for years without success and held just 4 percent market shares last year. After the Nokia deal all top phone vendors except Apple support Windows, but others have only a few Microsoft phones in their offering. QUALCOMM - exclusive semiconductor provider for Windows Phone 7 operating system. GOOGLE - Nokia's move is likely to boost other smaller handset makers' investments in Google's Android platform in the near term. APPLE, RIM, HTC, SAMSUNG, MOTOROLA, SONY ERICSSON - Makers of iPhones, Blackberrys and Android phones are set to win market share this year and next as Nokia's new strategy takes time to produce the new phones it wants. FINLAND - Nokia is set cut thousands of jobs across its home country. With general elections due in April, the phone maker's strategy is also set to impact national politics. NOKIA - could have lost even more if it had stuck with its own Symbian software or jumped to the Android camp, but paying royalties to Microsoft is a bitter pill for the company, which created Symbian 10 years ago to stop Microsoft's expansion into the wireless space. INTEL - invested significantly in MeeGo, a merger of its Moblin and Nokia's Maemo software platforms, hoping to find a way into the wireless industry. ST-ERICSSON - The venture has been one of the key Symbian chipset suppliers for Nokia. It said on Friday plans for its new products and platforms remain on track, both with Nokia as well as with other top-tier customers. TIETO, TELECA - Have been key R&D subcontractors for Nokia, with a deep expertise in Symbian. YAHOO - Had a close cooperation with Nokia on maps and e-mail.
