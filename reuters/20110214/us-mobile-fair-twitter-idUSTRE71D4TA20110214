 BARCELONA, Spain  (Reuters) - Reports that Google has held takeover talks with Twitter that value the microblogging site at as much as $10 billion are "just a rumor," Chief Executive Dick Costolo said on Monday. 

 Asked at the Mobile World Congress fair in Barcelona whether Google could afford a $10 billion acquisition, Costolo replied: "I don't know where these things come from. It's just a rumor." He declined comment on a follow-up question on Facebook, which has also been reported to have held low-level takeover talks with Twitter. Twitter, which had 175 million users as of September, raised $200 million in a December financing round that valued it at $3.7 billion. (Reporting by  Georgina Prodhan ; Editing by Will Waterman)
