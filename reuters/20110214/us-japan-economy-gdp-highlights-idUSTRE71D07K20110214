 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank 0.3 percent in October-December from the previous quarter, Cabinet Office data showed on Monday, hurt by an expiry of government incentives for car purchases and a slowdown in exports. 

 It was the first contraction in five quarters, after revised growth of 0.8 percent in July-September. Following are key points from the gross domestic product (GDP) data: -- Annualized GDP for October-December shrank 1.1 percent from the previous quarter, logging the first contraction in five quarters but smaller than a 2.1 percent contraction projected by economists. -- Private consumption, which accounts for about 60 percent of Japan's economy, fell 0.7 percent after government incentives for purchases of fuel-efficient cars expired in September. -- Domestic demand trimmed 0.2 percentage point from GDP growth, the first negative contribution since July-September 2009. -- Capital spending rose 0.9 percent, up for the fifth straight quarter, but the pace slowed slightly from the previous quarter's 1.5 percent rise. -- Exports and imports both fell in October-December, the first time in seven quarters that both figures declined. -- Net exports shaved 0.1 percentage point off Japan's GDP growth in October-December, making a negative contribution for a second straight quarter. -- The GDP deflator fell 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, falling for a fifth straight quarter. -- On a seasonally unadjusted, nominal dollar basis, Japan's GDP was $5.4742 trillion in 2010, overtaken by China's $5.8786 trillion, a Cabinet Office estimate showed. -- Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano said Japan does not compete on GDP rankings but pursues policies to enhance people's livelihoods. The fact that China's economy is booming is welcome news for Japan as a neighboring country, he said. -- The Bank of Japan and the government share the view that Japan's economy is stalling but is expected to turn up, Yosano said.
