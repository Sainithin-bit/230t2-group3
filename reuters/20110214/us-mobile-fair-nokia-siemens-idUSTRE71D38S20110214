 BARCELONA  (Reuters) - Nokia Siemens Networks said a price battle in the market for wireless telecom gear had intensified over the last year, especially as Chinese players went after operators' modernization orders. 

 "During 2010 the level of aggressiveness went up," CEO Rajeev Suri told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress trade show on Monday. Many operators in Europe and elsewhere have started to go for full network modernization orders, which often also include a swap of old network gear -- creating a perfect entry point for challengers Huawei and ZTE to win market share. NSN has struggled to make a profit since it was formed in 2007, hit by falling operator spending and fierce pricing from Chinese rivals. However, NSN's fourth quarter profit beat average forecasts, while annual sales returned to growth. Last week it forecast further sales growth for 2011 and said underlying operating result would be in the black. (Reporting by  Tarmo Virki ; editing by Sophie Walker)
