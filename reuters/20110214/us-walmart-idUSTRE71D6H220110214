 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) named Cindy Davis as executive vice president of a new team that will study customer trends, an appointment that comes as the world's largest retailer tries to reinvigorate U.S. sales and continue its worldwide expansion. 

 Wal-Mart's "Global Customer Insights" team will help Wal-Mart and Sam's Club understand consumer trends and customers' needs and will create analytical tools, the company said. Wal-Mart's U.S. discount stores have reported six consecutive quarters of declining sales at stores open at least a year, as shoppers cut back on spending and switch some of their shopping trips to competitors such as dollar stores. Davis will continue to report to Sam's Club's President and Chief Executive Brian Cornell. Davis most recently served as executive vice president of membership, marketing and e-commerce at the Sam's Club warehouse store division. A successor in that role will be named at a later date, Wal-Mart said. Davis joined Sam's Club in 2007. (Reporting by  Jessica Wohl ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
