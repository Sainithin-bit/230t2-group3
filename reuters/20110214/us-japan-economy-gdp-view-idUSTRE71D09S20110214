 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's economy shrank slightly in the final quarter of last year, hurt by an expiry of government incentives for car purchases and a slowdown in exports. 

 The contraction was slightly less than expected. The export-reliant economy is seen on course for a moderate recovery this year on firm exports to fast-growing Asian nations and the United States, although growth will likely remain modest due to weak domestic demand. KEY POINTS: -- The 0.3 percent contraction in October-December GDP compared with the median forecast for a 0.5 percent shrinkage and follows a 0.8 percent gain in the third quarter. -- The growth translates into an annualized contraction of 1.1 percent, against a median forecast of a 2.1 percent fall. -- Private consumption fell 0.7 percent from the previous quarter, as government incentives for low-emission car purchases expired in September. -- External demand, or net exports, pushed down GDP by 0.1 percentage point, partly as the yen's spike to a 15-year high against the dollar during the period hurt exports. COMMENTARY: TAKESHI MINAMI, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NORINCHUKIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE "The main reasons for the contraction are the expiry of government stimulus measures and negative external demand. I am concerned about the drop in the pace of climbs for capital expenditure." "It is going to be difficult for the economy to emerge from a lull in the January-March period. At the earliest, it's likely to emerge in the April-June period ... (In fiscal 2011), we are unlikely to see the economy worsen, but the recovery will not be strong enough for people to actually feel it is happening." "External demand is a risk to Japan's economic outlook. The main scenario is that although emerging economies, which are maintaining high rates of growth despite various problems, are also tightening their policies and this could have some kind of a negative impact. The rising prices of resources is another risk." YOSHIKI SHINKE, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DAI-ICHI LIFE RESEARCH INSTITUTE, TOKYO "The data confirms that the economy entered a lull on a downturn in private consumption, but recent monthly economic indicators such as output and exports show it is unlikely that the lull will be prolonged. "The economy will continue to depend on external demand for growth, as domestic demand is likely to be capped by subdued income growth and the anticipated negative impact from the expiry of subsidies for energy-efficient electrical appliances. Still, a mild rebound is expected in January-March." JUNKO NISHIOKA, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND, TOKYO "I think the general view is that the contraction in the October-December period is down to policy issues. " "We see a return to growth in the January-March period. We can already see signs of recovery in some indicators. We are expecting an annual growth rate of 1.0 percent. There is steady growth in capital investment....there is a good chance that it will be more than one percent." SEIJI ADACHI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE SECURITIES, TOKYO "Capital expenditure is stronger than we expected. Looking at the BOJ tankan or other surveys, the corporate sector has strong demand for capital expenditure, centred on manufacturing and exports. This is an upside risk for the economy. "Looking at domestic auto sales, private consumption likely bottomed out in the first quarter. "In the first quarter GDP likely returned to growth. External demand will drive growth for this year. Capital expenditure will be the second contributor to growth. "The risk is the BOJ could exit its easing-bias too early as the economy improves. In the government's case. It will be very difficult for them to pass legislation." BACKGROUND: -- Japan's economy has been stagnating due to a soft patch in exports last year. But factory output and exports rose more than expected in December, giving rise to views that the economy is about to emerge from a lull and prompting the government to upgrade its economic assessment last month. -- The Bank of Japan may signal its growing confidence that an end to economic stagnation is near when its policy board meets for a two-day meeting until Tuesday. But it is expected to keep monetary policy on hold, with its eyes set on risks to the outlook such as a spike in commodity costs. (Reporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
