 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German government plans to work in close consultation with the French government on the planned merger between Britain's BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) and Airbus owner EADS EADS.PA EADS.DE, a German government source said on Thursday. 
 The French and German governments are both stakeholders in EADS. BAE Systems and EADS said on Wednesday that they were in advanced talks to create an industry giant that would overtake rival Boeing ( BA.N ) in sales and contend with defense cutbacks in Europe and the United States.
