 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The German government has been informed about the plan for Britain's BAE Systems ( BAES.L ) and Airbus owner EADS ( EAD.PA ) to merge and has been asked to give its support, a German economy ministry spokesman said on Thursday. 
 The spokesman said they were currently looking into all the relevant issues related to a planned merger. BAE Systems and EADS said on Wednesday they were in advanced talks to create an industry giant that would overtake rival Boeing ( BA.N ) in sales and contend with defense cutbacks in Europe and the United States. A newspaper report saying that the government had already given its blessing to the plan has been denied by industry and political sources. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller ; Writing by Michelle Martin)
