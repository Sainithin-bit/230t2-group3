 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Foreign central banks' overall holdings of U.S. marketable securities at the Federal Reserve rose in the latest week, data from the U.S. central bank showed on Thursday. 
 The Fed said its holdings of U.S. securities kept for overseas central banks rose by $1.777 billion in the week ended September 12, to stand at $3.575 trillion. The breakdown of custody holdings showed overseas central banks' holdings of Treasury debt rose by $1.826 billion to stand at $2.875 trillion. Foreign institutions' holdings of securities issued or guaranteed by the biggest U.S. mortgage financing agencies, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, fell by $50 million to stand at $700.35 billion. Overseas central banks, particularly those in Asia, have been huge buyers of U.S. debt in recent years and own more than a quarter of marketable Treasuries. China and Japan are the biggest two foreign holders of Treasuries. The full Fed report can be found on:  here  (Reporting by  Steven C. Johnson ; Editing by Leslie Adler)
