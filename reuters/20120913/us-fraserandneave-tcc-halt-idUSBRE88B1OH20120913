 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Singapore's Fraser and Neave Ltd ( FRNM.SI ) requested a trading halt on Thursday after a group linked to Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi made a $7.2 billion cash offer to take over the drinks-and-property conglomerate. 
 The offer came after Thai Beverage PCL ( TBEV.SI ) and TCC Assets, the vehicle linked to the billionaire, increased their combined stake in F&N to 30.36 percent, according to a stock filing to the Singapore Exchange. Under Singapore law, a bidder has to make a mandatory offer for a company if it buys a 30 percent stake. (Reporting by Eveline Danubrata; Editing by  John Mair )
