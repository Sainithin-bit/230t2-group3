 PARIS  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ) is recalling 51,000 vehicles to inspect them for a possible defect after a customer reported that a steering wheel became detached from a new Qashqai SUV. 
 Nissan has ordered the voluntary recall in Europe, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Australasia to address a manufacturing issue that may affect 600 Qashqais and NV200 vans, a company spokesman said on Thursday. (Reporting by Laurence Frost; Editing by  James Regan )
