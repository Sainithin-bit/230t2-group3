 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks surged on Monday and gold hit a new record above $1,110 an ounce, after the Group of 20 finance ministers pledged to keep economic stimulus programs in place until a recovery was assured. 

 The U.S. dollar fell to a 15-month low against a basket of major currencies, lifting gold prices and the euro above $1.50, after G20 policy-makers on Saturday underscored the perception global interest rates will remain low for some time. The message investors took from the G20 meeting in Scotland was that low rates will provide them access to cheap money with which to buy riskier assets like stocks, oil and gold. In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose to a 13-month high as U.S. stocks jumped 2.0 percent or more and helped dull the allure of government debt. An index of the U.S. dollar .DXY against six major currencies fell to its lowest since August 2008 and was headed for its biggest single-day decline in more than three months. "Central banks around the world are continuing to prop up the economy and support risk taking. There's very little regard for valuation," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago. "It looks to me like a pure risk rally and it is consistent with the G20 comments." The MSCI all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS of global stocks rose 2.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 203.52 points, or 2.03 percent, at 10,226.94. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  rose 23.78 points, or 2.22 percent, at 1,093.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 41.62 points, or 1.97 percent, at 2,154.06. U.S. interest rates are expected to remain near zero well into 2010, and analysts said that would keep the dollar weak. The precious metal extended last week's gains of nearly 5 percent after the tumbling dollar boosted gold's appeal as a hedge against a falling currency and potential inflation. "There's no risk of the Fed tightening in the near term, so the dollar is going to get weaker," said Jay Meisler, principal of Global-View.com, an online forum for investors and traders. The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 1.01 percent at 75.057. The euro was up 0.97 percent at $1.4991, and against the yen, the dollar was up 0.12 percent at 90.02. Oil settled above $79 a barrel after Hurricane Ida forced U.S. oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico to be shut as stocks rose and the dollar fell. Ida shut in 29.6 percent of oil production and 27.5 percent of gas output from the Gulf of Mexico, the U.S. Minerals Management Service said. "Crude is up on the weak dollar and the impact of Tropical Storm Ida, overshadowing some bearish news of the Saudis raising supplies available and China raising fuel prices," said Phil Flynn, analyst at PFGBest Research in Chicago. U.S. crude for December delivery rose $2 to settle at $79.43 a barrel. London Brent crude settled up $1.90 at $77.77. U.S. government debt prices were steady to modestly higher after strong demand for Treasury notes. Indirect bids, often viewed as a proxy for foreign demand, was more than $27 billion in the record-sized $40 billion auction of three-year notes. "As the results indicated and as price action showed, there's just been no let up in the demand for bonds," said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed-income analysis at Action Economics LLC in San Francisco. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 5/32 in price to yield 3.48 percent. Spot gold prices rose $9.20 to $1103.80 an ounce. "Investors have become concerned about the outlook for paper currencies and also for inflation. The natural move in this kind of environment is into gold," said Nicholas Brooks, head of research and investment strategy at ETF Securities. Copper rallied as demand prospects brightened after Chile's Codelco, the world's top copper miner, raised premium charges for Asian customers in 2010. A weaker dollar also helped boost industrial metals. Copper for December delivery ended up 1.50 cents to settle at $2.9675 a pound. Overnight in Asia, the MSCI index of Asia Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 2 percent, while Japan's Nikkei share average  .N225  finished 0.2 percent higher.
