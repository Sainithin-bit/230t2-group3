 DETROIT  (Reuters) - For analysts weighing the odds of survival for the embattled U.S. automakers, two measures now loom largest: remaining cash and time remaining until 2010. 

 With U.S. auto sales at 15-year lows, General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler LLC have been forced to rewrite restructuring plans on the fly in recent weeks by slashing production of slow-selling trucks. But continued cash burn is driving consideration of steps to raise liquidity between now and 2010, when the automakers capture billions of dollars in savings on health-care costs from new contracts with the United Auto Workers union. "It's a very difficult period, and it's all about cash," said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan. "There are multiple options, but the real question is how they deal with this cash monster." Analysts say GM could tap the capital markets as Ford did with a $23-billion secured offering in late 2006. Meanwhile, Ford is expected to face pressure to take up an offer from billionaire investor Kirk Kerkorian to infuse new capital, possibly through new common or preferred stock. "They all have moved to cut their cost structures, but the market has simply moved a lot faster than their ability to keep up," Fitch Ratings managing director Mark Oline said. GM, which ended the first quarter with $31 billion in cash and undrawn credit, is in danger of burning through much of that by 2010, analysts have said. Ford is in slightly better shape with cash and undrawn credit of $41 billion at the end of the first quarter. Privately held Chrysler, now controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, has said it ended 2007 with about $9 billion. Last week, it drew a $2-billion credit line from Cerberus and former parent Daimler AG. GAME PLANNING TO AVOID GAME OVER Because GM needs a liquidity cushion to pay suppliers and fund sprawling operations, analysts agree the automaker will need to raise between $5 billion and $10 billion. But securing financing for GM in 2008 will be much harder than it was for Ford, said Gimme Credit analyst Shelly Lombard. "GM does have an opportunity, but it's not as much of a slam dunk as when Ford did it," she said. Oline said it would be "prudent" for Ford and GM to both raise capital. Fitch downgraded GM and Chrysler with a negative outlook last week and said it was unlikely Ford's ratings would remain intact. "I think they will raise as much as the markets will give them," Oline said. GM's primary option could be to borrow against profitable and growing international operations such as in Brazil, China and Eastern Europe, analysts said. The other prospect for GM would be further asset sales, although options are dwindling. The No. 1 U.S. automaker is shopping Hummer around to prospective buyers thought to include Mahindra & Mahindra, but the SUV brand is expected to fetch far less than a billion dollars in any sale. FORD: LESS NEEDY Ford's ability to raise secured financing is limited after its 2006 borrowing -- an effort that pledged substantially all of its assets including the familiar blue-oval logo. But Ford might only need to raise $3 billion to $4 billion and could do that with a preferred stock or convertible debt offering to Kerkorian, Lombard said. Fitch's Oline said Ford would need to maintain over $10 billion to $11 billion in liquidity, but could benefit from a stronger new vehicle lineup in 2010 and 2011 than GM. "It's not a completely dark story for Ford," Oline said. "The market has simply moved too fast for them to keep up." Meanwhile, Ford could still opt to sell its Volvo brand, a step it says it is not considering. Ford held exploratory talks with Renault SA on Volvo, but the talks ended quickly due to differences on pricing, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters. Ford has also had talks with China's third-largest automaker, Dongfeng Motor Group, as a potential partner for Volvo, one of the sources said. Meanwhile, credit markets see rising risks for both Ford and GM. Credit option contracts that would pay out if Ford or GM default before September 2012 have ticked steadily higher. The contracts pointed to a roughly 32 percent default risk for GM and 40 percent for Ford a year ago, before contract talks with the UAW. Now the equivalent risk is near 70 percent for GM and in the high 60-percent range for Ford. "They've got to get to 2010," said S& P equity analyst Efraim Levy. "Hopefully, they can get their product portfolios and their cost basis in line by then, but the competition doesn't stand still." (Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
