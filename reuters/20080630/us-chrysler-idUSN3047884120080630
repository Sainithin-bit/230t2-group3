 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC said it scheduled a briefing on Monday afternoon to discuss an unspecified "manufacturing action" it plans to take in response to a slumping U.S. auto market. 

 Chrysler's larger rivals General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co have both taken steps to cut truck production in response to weaker sales in recent weeks. Chrysler, which is controlled by Cerberus Capital Management, relies on slow-selling light trucks for almost 70 percent of its sales. Chrysler June sales, which will be announced on Tuesday, are expected to show a 31 percent decline, according to Edmunds.com. (Reporting by  Kevin Krolicki , editing by Phil Berlowitz)
