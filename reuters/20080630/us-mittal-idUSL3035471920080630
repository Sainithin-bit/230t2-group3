 LONDON  (Reuters) - After conquering the steel industry two years ago, Lakshmi Mittal was soon looking for his next challenge. 

 Indian-born Mittal, the dominant shareholder in the world's largest steel group ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ), has been racing to boost control over raw materials such as iron ore and coal and has also landed a seat on the board of a top US investment bank. Named after Lakshmi, the Hindu deity of prosperity and wealth, Mittal has a fortune of $45 billion, making him the fourth-richest man in the world and No. 1 in Europe, according to Forbes magazine. After winning a takeover battle for Arcelor in 2006, Mittal has not only focused on further expanding his steel empire but also having more control over raw materials. The company is already self-sufficient for nearly half of its iron ore supplies and wants to boost this to 70 percent by 2012. The decision to buy iron ore and coal mines was a shrewd move, giving his group a key advantage over rivals who are fully exposed to iron ore and coal prices that have soared by 380 percent and 600 percent respectively since 2001. On Sunday, ArcelorMittal said it had increased its stake in Australian miner Macarthur Coal Ltd MCC.AX to 19.9 percent, the most allowed in Australia before a firm must make a full takeover bid, as part of a strategy to safeguard its raw materials supply. Mittal even considered joining a takeover battle for miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ) and buying a stake in the world's second-largest iron ore producer, but decided against the move. After piling up a fortune through a blistering series of takeovers that consolidated the steel sector, Mittal has become a director of investment bank Goldman Sachs, a mastermind of many top merger deals.  MILL WORK Mittal started work in his father's mill in Calcutta at a time when many had written the steel industry off. Born in the small Indian town of Sadulpur in 1950, he went on to make his fortune by transforming ailing steel mills around the globe into money spinners by cutting costs, exploiting economies of scale, and selling higher-value products into a growing market. Mittal shies away from the limelight, although his lavish spending often makes headlines. According to media reports, Mittal, who settled in Britain in 1995, spent 70 million pounds ($139.6 million) to buy the most expensive home in Britain in 2003, which has garage space for 20 cars and is decorated with marble from the same quarry that supplied the Taj Mahal. His path to success began after he branched out from working with his father to set up his own steel plant in Indonesia in 1976, using cheap labor and the best technology. He expanded into Trinidad in the 1980s, when many had dismissed the steel industry as unprofitable and highly localized, and also began acquiring former state-owned plants in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Mittal ran into controversy in 2001 after Britain's then prime minister, Tony Blair, wrote a letter supporting his takeover of Romania's biggest steelworks just months after Mittal donated 125,000 pounds to Blair's ruling labor Party. That "cash-for-favors" scandal appeared to make Mittal even more wary of the press. But he has been unable to avoid the inevitable publicity as his fortune has rocketed thanks to soaring demand from China which has driven up steel prices in recent years. Mittal has tight control of ArcelorMittal, taking on the chairman's job in May on top his previous role as chief executive. His son Aditya is the firm's chief financial officer. The Mittal family is the largest shareholder of the group, which accounts for 10 percent of global steel production, owning 43 percent.
