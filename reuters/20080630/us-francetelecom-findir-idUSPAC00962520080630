 PARIS  (Reuters) - France Telecom FTE.PA on Monday said returning cash to shareholders was a "more plausible" option after it withdrew an indicative offer for Nordic operator TeliaSonera ( TLSN.ST ). 

 "Today, it is more plausible," France Telecom Finance Director Gervais Pellissier told Reuters in an interview, asked about returning cash to shareholders. He said the subject had not yet been discussed by the board. He said France's leading telecoms operator also saw no concrete European alternative acquisition target now, but that in the medium term it would seek to strengthen its foothold in existing European markets. It added that the trend in the second quarter was similar to that of the first quarter in terms of sales and financial performance. (Reporting by  Astrid Wendlandt )
