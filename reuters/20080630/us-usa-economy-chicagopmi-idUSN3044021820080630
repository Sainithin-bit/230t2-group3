 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Business activity in the U.S. Midwest contracted in June for a fifth straight month but at a less severe rate than feared, a report showed on Monday. 

  KEY POINTS: * The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 49.6 from 49.1 in May. * Economists had forecast the index at 48.0. A reading below 50 indicates contraction. * The employment component of the index rose to 46.7 from 41.2 in May. Prices paid slipped to 85.5 from 87.5 and new orders fell to 52.0 from 56.1.  COMMENTS:  CARL LANTZ, U.S. INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, CREDIT SUISSE, NEW YORK: "The headline was stronger but the details were a little more mixed. "It's below 50 for the fifth straight month but this is the best of the sub-50 numbers that we've seen. "It had pushed the bond market a little lower in price initially on the headline but we've come back on the basis of the details."  NICK BENNENBROEK, HEAD OF FX STRATEGY, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "The currency reaction has been modest, and I think this number will be inconsequential. Even though it's stronger than expected, it doesn't really rank up there as a highlight this week, given that we get a nationwide manufacturing gauge from the ISM tomorrow and then the ECB decision and U.S. payrolls later in the week. So this will be old news by 10 a.m. tomorrow. "Also, our view is we are probably not quite at a bottom yet as far as the dollar is concerned. Payrolls has the greatest potential for surprise, and we think the risks are weighted toward disappointment. So even after what was a big drop for the dollar last week, there is probably still room for it to fall further."  MARK VITNER, ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, CHARLOTTE, NORTH  CAROLINA: "It is stronger than expected, which is kind of interesting because the Chicago region seems to be more closely tied to the automotive sector. The fact that we are hanging around 50 is consistent with an economy that is hovering right above recession level but is not in a recession."  SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST  PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The Chicago PMI was close enough to expectations. I think people were braced for a weaker number. It's not that critical compared with the rest of the week's calendar, including the employment numbers and the European Central Bank meeting."  GARY THAYER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WACHOVIA SECURITIES, ST. LOUIS,  MISSOURI: "The Chicago PMI index was a little better than expected. It still showed slight contraction in manufacturing, but not significant weakness at this point. It looks as if manufacturing in the Midwest is holding its own. The orders index was down a little bit, but still above 50 so it looks as if things aren't getting a lot better, but are stable at this point. The inventories component jumped which at this level still indicates that there's potential for further weakness."  RON SIMPSON, DIRECTOR OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESEARCH, ACTION  ECONOMICS, TAMPA, FLORIDA: "Slightly better than expected though not much reaction because the focus will remain on upcoming U.S. data this week such as non-farm payrolls on Thursday combined with the ECB decision. Depending on the data we could see hope for Fed hikes fade while the ECB remains on its tightening path. That would be bad for the dollar."  MARKET REACTION: * BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices add to losses * CURRENCIES: U.S. dollar holds gains against the euro * STOCKS: U.S. equity indexes rise * RATE FUTURES: Fed fund futures were unchanged, pricing in a 29 percent chance of a 25 basis point increase at the August FOMC meeting.
