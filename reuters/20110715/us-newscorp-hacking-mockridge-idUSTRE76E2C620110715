 (Reuters) - Rebekah Brooks resigned as chief executive of News Corp's British newspaper unit on Friday, yielding to political and investor pressure over a phone hacking scandal undermining Rupert Murdoch's media empire on both sides of the Atlantic. 

 Tom Mockridge, CEO of the company's Italian pay-TV arm Sky Italia, will replace Brooks. Here are some details about him: * Born in July 1955 in New Zealand, he was chief executive of Sky Italy since its creation in April 2003. * He moved to Australia in 1980 where he worked for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper. * Between 1984 and 1991, he was a member of Australian Finance Minister Paul Keating's staff. * In 1991, he joined News Corp in Sydney as assistant to Ken Cowley, chief executive of Australian subsidiary News Ltd. * In 1997, he became chief executive of Foxtel, a pay-TV company that News Corp owned through a joint venture with Australian telecommunications company Telstra. * In 2001, he was appointed managing director of Independent Newspapers Ltd, the largest publisher of newspapers and magazines from New Zealand headed by News Corp. * He was also president of Sky New Zealand, the pay-TV group in the country. * In 2002, Mockridge led the merger between Stream and Telepiu, which brought about Sky Italy. * In 2010, a war between Sky Italia and Mediaset, Italy's largest private broadcaster, erupted when Mockridge called for the removal of 2003 legislation preventing Sky from entering the terrestrial television market. -- The European Union ruled in July 2010 in Sky's favor, a position upheld by Italy's top administrative court last February. * British pay-TV broadcaster BSkyB appointed Mockridge as a non-executive director in 2009. Mockridge had been promoted to the additional role of chief executive of European television for News Corp in 2008.
