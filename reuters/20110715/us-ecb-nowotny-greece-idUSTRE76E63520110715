 VIENNA  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank is open to different plans for Greece as long as they do not cause credit rating agencies to assess the result as a default, ECB Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Friday. 

 Asked whether it made sense to reduce rates for Greek debt, Nowotny said: "The ECB does not say that this is the wrong way, the ECB says we are ready to go any way that brings relief as long as it does not have negative side effects. The negative side effects could be that rating agencies take this as a default," Nowotny told Austrian broadcaster ORF. He also said that discussions on extending maturities on Greek debt were "relevant." (Reporting by  Sylvia Westall  and Angelika Gruber)
