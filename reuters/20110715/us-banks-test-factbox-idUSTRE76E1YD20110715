 (Reuters) - A health check of European banks is expected to show that as many as 15 lenders need more capital to withstand a prolonged recession, with criticism growing that the tests do not encompass the impact of a Greek default. 

 Europe's bank stress test, to be published at 1600 GMT, will make 90 lenders reveal for the first time their profit forecasts, a breakdown of their sovereign bond holdings and funding costs, and will force the weakest to recapitalize. Here are the details of the methodology behind the stress test, provided by the European Banking Authority: MACRO ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS: The EBA says the adverse scenario used for its test is more severe than last year on a number of criteria. Its baseline assumption is the autumn 2010 European Commission's forecast. The stress test assumes a 4 percentage point drop in GDP from the baseline assumption over 2011 and 2012. That would see a 0.4 percent contraction in 2011 and flat growth in 2012 across the region. That includes a 4 percent contraction in Greece and a 3 percent drop in Portugal this year, and a 1.1 percent contraction in Spain each year. Unemployment across the EU would rise to 10 percent in 2011 and 10.5 percent in 2012, including a rise next year to 22.4 percent in Spain and near 16 percent in Ireland and Greece. EU inflation is assumed to be 0.1 percent lower than the official forecast in 2011 and 0.5 percent in 2012. House prices in EU countries are assumed to drop by 3.8 percent this year and 11.6 percent next year across the EU, with falls seen in most markets. UK house prices are seen dropping near 25 percent over the two years. Yields on bonds are affected by sovereign strains, with long-term interest rates assumed to rise by 66 basis points on average across the EU. Stock market prices are assumed to fall by 14 percent across the EU. CAPITAL ALLOWED/PASS MARK: The pass mark is high-quality core Tier 1 capital of 5 percent. SOVEREIGN DEBT SHOCK: The test assumes a fall in the price of government bonds, which will be applied to assets in trading books. These "haircuts" will apply to their fair value at the end of 2010. The haircut for 10-year sovereign bonds is 19.8 percent for Portugal, 14.6 percent for Spain, 13.1 percent for Italy and 3.5 percent for Germany. Banking book assets, which are regarded as longer term holdings, will not be subject to haircuts. Banks will be required to provide sovereign debt exposures by portfolio, country and maturity. The test includes some strain on banks' funding costs due to the sovereign stress. RAISING CAPITAL: Each country should have a backstop plan in place before the results come out to recapitalize banks that fail. Failing banks will be given a deadline to recapitalize. Some regulators may require banks that scrape a pass to recapitalize too. This could include raising funds with other instruments, such as contingent capital, for example. The test will be conducted on the assumption of a static balance sheet and banks maintaining the same business mix. Revenue and cost assumptions for the banks should be in line with zero growth, after last year's test was criticized for allowing banks to assume too much in retained earnings. The test will assume no mitigating action, such as selling assets in trouble. (Compiled by Steve Slater and Huw Jones)
