 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Publishing the latest set of results from EU-wide bank stress tests is a good way to increase transparency, the European Central Bank said on Friday, and added banks and governments should recapitalize where necessary. 

 "The ECB welcomes the EBA recommendations to promptly remedy the capital shortfall of the banks that do not meet the threshold ratio of 5 percent core Tier 1 capital and to strengthen the capital position of those banks that are above but close to the threshold," it said in a statement. "The ECB encourages the governments to fully implement the commitment they undertook ... to ensure that the necessary remedial actions are taken." (Reporting by  Sakari Suoninen )
