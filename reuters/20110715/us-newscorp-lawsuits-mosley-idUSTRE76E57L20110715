 LONDON  (Reuters) - Former motor-racing boss Max Mosley has agreed to underwrite lawsuits that victims of alleged intrusive reporting may bring against News International, the owners of the now-defunct tabloid News of the World, he told Reuters on Friday. 

 Mosley, who won damages from the News of the World after it published lurid revelations about his sex life, said he has agreed to cover the potentially large costs some people risk if they reject settlement offers and press forward with litigation against Murdoch-owned newspapers. Mosley told Reuters in a telephone interview that "in a few cases" in which plaintiffs have filed civil lawsuits against Murdoch-owned papers for damages in connection with allegations of hacking or other intrusions, he has, through his lawyers, assured lawyers for the plaintiffs that, "If you should lose, I'll do the necessary. I will meet the cost ... If the worst happens I'll take care of it." A British media executive earlier said Mosley had told him he was willing to underwrite the costs if plaintiffs sued and lost. "He said he's willing to do it," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "It's Mosley's revenge." Mosley told the American magazine Vanity Fair in May: "In a number of cases I've said to people: 'If you lose, I'll stand behind you,'" Mosley told the magazine. "In Britain, to bring a lawsuit, you either have to have no money at all or be eccentric." Mosley's statements to Reuters are more explicit: he said he has agreed to back "fewer than 10" plaintiffs in cases which would potentially carry high financial risks for them, because of the way the British legal system works. He said that he believes the legal risks for him are "small," although the amount of money ordinary people could put at risk in such actions is large. "I can afford to do this," Mosley said. Reuters is a competitor of Dow Jones Newswires, the financial news agency that News Corp acquired along with the Wall Street Journal in 2007. SEX CASE Mosley acknowledged his financial backing is designed to embolden plaintiffs with cases against News International to pursue their claims beyond any out-of-court settlement the company might offer, so that cases can reach a stage where more details about them would have to be aired. He said he believed the only way full details of questionable reporting practices used by Murdoch papers would become public was through persistently pursuing such civil claims. Without financial backing, some individuals may not be able to afford the risk of paying high legal bills. Under British law, plaintiffs who lose a case in court, or who win an award smaller than any settlement they have been offered have to pay not only their own legal fees but also part of those of the people they are suing, legal experts say. In a case which goes to trial, these can run to hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mosley is the son of Sir Oswald Mosley, late leader of a British fascist party who was detained by the British government during part of World War Two. Until 2009, Max Mosley headed the Formula One association, a non-profit group which governs Formula One motor racing around the world. Mosley's tangle with the News of the World was one of the more colorful trials in recent British legal history. In a 2008 page one story, the Sunday tabloid alleged he had consorted with five prostitutes in a "sick Nazi orgy." A British judge ruled the story violated Mosley's privacy, awarded him 60,000 pounds damages, and ordered the paper to pay Mosley's costs of another 450,000 pounds. Jonathan Caplan, a prominent British barrister specializing in media law, told Reuters that if Mosley makes good on his offer, he could face substantial bills. Mark Lewis, a lawyer who has represented some victims of allegedly controversial reporting by the paper, declined to comment on whether Mosley was backing any of the cases he is pursuing. On Wednesday, Prime Minister David Cameron said the government was setting up a wide-ranging inquiry into allegations about intrusive or illegal reporting methods used by Murdoch-owned and other British media.
