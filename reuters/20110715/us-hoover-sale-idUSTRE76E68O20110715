 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TTI Floor Care North America Inc, the owner of the Hoover and Dirt Devil vacuum cleaner brands, has put itself up for sale and is seeking as much as $900 million, the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday. 

 TTI Floor Care, a subsidiary of Hong Kong's Techtronic Industries Co ( 0669.HK ), has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ) to advise it on a potential sale, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. TTI Floor Care has about $100 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and is likely to attract interest from private equity buyers, the report said.
