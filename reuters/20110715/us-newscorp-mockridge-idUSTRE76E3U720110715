 MILAN  (Reuters) - In his previous job as head of Sky Italia, Tom Mockridge made a point of climbing the stairs to his seventh-floor Milan office instead of using the lift. 

 Now that he is the new boss of News Corp's British newspaper unit, he will need all the stamina he can muster to put behind the company a phone hacking scandal undermining Rupert Murdoch's media empire. A person who works closely with him said the 56-year old New Zealander's appointment came as no surprise. "He is not a Murdoch but he is very close to both James (Murdoch) and Rupert. He is highly trusted, he was sent in to fix things," said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In an e-mail sent to Sky Italia employees and seen by Reuters, Mockridge said he had been asked to go to London immediately to take on his new role and that the change at the top of News International had happened "very quickly." He referred to the "many challenges" facing News Corp's British newspaper unit, without elaborating. Aides describe Mockridge, once a journalist and aide to former Australian Finance Minister Paul Keating, as a reserved person who shuns social events and steers clear of politics. "He is not Rupert but he is very determined and focused, he doesn't get pushed around,~ said the person who works with him. "In a meeting, he is polite and not the yelling type. But if people wander off the topic, he cuts them short and gets to the point." Another person who had business dealings with him said he rarely lost his temper with his aides, but few dared to contradict him. In Italy, he will be remembered as the man who took on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Mediaset, the country's biggest private broadcaster, and often clashed publicly with him. Given News Corp's exposed public profile after the scandal that brought down his predecessor, Rebekah Brooks, a willingness to withstand government pressure may be an asset, but Mockridge aides say he does not want to be seen as a political figure. "He regrets being seen in Italy as a kind of counterweight to Berlusconi and at times being viewed as an ally of the center-left opposition. That annoys him very much and it's not a fair portrayal," said the person who works with him. "Left or right, whichever government is in charge, that doesn't matter for him. What he is after is the success of his business." PAY-TV SUCCESS At the helm of News Corp's Italian satellite TV unit since its creation eight years ago, Mockridge turned a niche outfit into a highly successful pay-TV businesses, reaching close to 5 million homes and changing the way Italians watch television. That put him on a collision course with Berlusconi who, as prime minister from 2001-05 and again from 2008, has held considerable influence on what was until then Mediaset's only domestic competitor -- state broadcaster RAI. Sky Italia has often complained that some of the measures passed by Berlusconi's government -- such as the doubling of tax rates on pay TV television in 2009 -- were tailor-made to favor Mediaset and hurt Sky's revenues. But Mockridge went a step further when at a news conference in June last year he took a strong position against Berlusconi's attempt to restrict media use of leaked wiretaps -- which have featured prominently in several scandals engulfing the premier. "It's a wrong law and we will fight it by all means. If the head of our news programs goes to jail, I am ready to go with him," he said. Mockridge is said to be particularly proud of Sky Italia's 24-hour news bulletins, which Sky describes as a rare model of independent journalism in Italy. But his outburst surprised even his closest aides. "It was out of his style," one said. Armed with Sky Italia's success, Mockridge was appointed in May 2008 to the additional role of chief executive for News Corp.'s European Television unit. Born in New Zealand in 1955, Mockridge began his career as a regional newspaper journalist before moving to Australia in 1980, where he worked initially for the Sydney Morning Herald. From 1984 to 1991, he was a member of Australian Finance Minister Paul Keating's staff, before joining News Corp in Sydney as assistant to the CEO of its Australian subsidiary.
