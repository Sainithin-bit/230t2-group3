 LONDON  (Reuters) - A key campaigner against British media abuses says he is not taking his foot off the pedal despite the closure of one of Rupert Murdoch's flagship papers and the end of the media baron's bid for pay-TV operator BSkyB. 

 Member of Parliament Chris Bryant has campaigned for years against malpractice at British newspapers, and was instrumental in starting a rare emergency debate in parliament last week that set Britain's political machine firmly against Murdoch's empire. The political pressure over phone hacking allegations at one of Murdoch's British newspapers forced his News Corp media conglomerate to abandon its $12 billion bid for 61 percent of BSkyB it does not already own. Bryant could also help end Murdoch's ownership of the remaining 39 percent, by showing that News Corp is not a "fit and proper" owner of a TV license, a key test demanded by Britain's media watchdog. Bryant is contacting News Corp non-executive directors to find out what they knew about phone hacking at News Corp-owned papers, allegations that have engulfed the firm in a firestorm of police investigations and public and political condemnation. The company's British newspaper arm News International is accused of hacking into the phones of some 4,000 people, including that of a missing schoolgirl who was later found murdered and those of the families of fallen soldiers. "The next thing is, I'm writing to all the non-executive directors, including the former Spanish Prime Minister Mr. Aznar and others of News Corp, to ask them what they knew, when they knew it, what actions they took to ensure that their newspaper was complying with police investigations," Bryant told Reuters. Police this week accused News International of obstructing investigations into the scandal, which has already seen the arrest of Andy Coulson, former newspaper editor and former communications chief for Prime Minister David Cameron. The affair has heaped pressure on News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, who has not resigned despite a call from former friend Cameron and other politicians to do so, and on Murdoch's son James, chairman of News International. "What did the directors do to check on what Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson said about phone hacking back in 2003 and did they know about hush money that was paid?" Bryant said. CRIMINAL CHARGES The threat to Murdoch's media empire, especially his lucrative TV operations, prompted the 80-year-old Australian born billionaire to fly into London to handle the crisis. "This company has shown itself completely unable to act within the law, and if it's not able to do that, if it's true as the police said on Tuesday that they had deliberately thwarted the police investigation, then I think they shouldn't have any share in a British media organization," Bryant said. For current and former News International executives, the possible end of News Corp's ownership of BSkyB could be the least of their worries, given the threat of criminal charges if they are found guilty of obstructing police inquiries. Brooks and the Murdochs will attend a parliamentary committee hearing next week to discuss the issue. "Rebekah Brooks and James Murdoch .... I hope that they will both appear the select committee and they may well end up facing criminal charges, because the police say News International deliberately thwarted a police investigation. That's a much more serious charge than actually hacking a phone," Bryant said. BARRIER BROKEN Bryant has been a victim of media intrusion himself -- a photo of him in his underpants was taken from a gay internet dating site and splashed across tabloid front pages. "That was after I had asked newspaper editors questions about payments to police officers in March 2003 .... I suspect (there's a link)," he said. Many politicians say they were afraid to criticize the press, and Murdoch's papers in particular, for fear of being targeted by their journalists or losing positive news coverage. News International owns the influential Sun tabloid newspaper and the high-brow Times and Sunday Times. "Yes I think that barrier has been broken. They used the newspapers to bully and intimidate people," Bryant said. "I don't think Murdoch's empire has the grip on British politics it once had," he added.
