 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Alpha Bank, Greece's third-largest lender, got approval at a shareholder meeting on Friday for a capital boost through a rights offering and convertible bond issue totaling up to 2.85 bln euros. 

 Greek banks, hit by the country's sovereign debt crisis, have been boosting their capital base to cope better with a protracted recession at home that has led to a rise in non-performing loans. Greece's central bank has told the country's lenders they will have to keep their core capital adequacy ratio (Core Tier 1) above 10 percent next year to cope with rising loan impairments as the economy goes through its third straight year of recession. Alpha Bank management is to raise up to 2.5 billion euros in equity -- as much as 100 percent of its share capital excluding preferred shares it has sold the government -- over the next 12 months to strengthen its capital adequacy. Shareholders have already given the green light to management to buy back 940 million euros of preferred shares the bank sold the government under a liquidity support scheme. Shareholders also authorized management to issue up to 350 million euros bonds convertible into shares over a span of three years. The convertible debt issue will be privately placed, with existing shareholders waving their rights. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos; Editing by Mike Nesbit)
