 LONDON  (Reuters) - News Corp Chief Executive Rupert Murdoch will apologize for any wrongdoing committed at his News of the World newspaper in a full page spread to be published in British national newspapers this weekend. 

 Under a large headline "We are sorry," the piece will contain the following message, according to the text obtained by Reuters. It is signed at the bottom by Murdoch himself. "The News of the World was in the business of holding others to account. It failed when it came to itself. "We are sorry for the serious wrongdoing that occurred. We are deeply sorry for the hurt suffered by the individuals affected. "We regret not acting faster to sort things out. I realize that simply apologizing is not enough. "Our business was founded on the idea that a free and open press should be a positive force in society. We need to live up to this. "In the coming days, as we take further concrete steps to resolve these issues and make amends for the damage they have caused, you will hear more from us. "Sincerely, Rupert Murdoch" (Writing by  Stefano Ambrogi ; Editing by  Elizabeth Fullerton )
