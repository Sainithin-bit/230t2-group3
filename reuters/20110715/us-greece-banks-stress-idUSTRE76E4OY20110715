 ATHENS  (Reuters) - State-controlled ATEbank and EFG Eurobank, Greece's second largest lender, failed a European stress test but the other four lenders tested passed the simulation, the banks said on Friday. 

 Eurobank scored a core Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio of 4.9 percent, below the 5.0 percent pass mark under the simulation's adverse scenario, and ATEbank said it had a capital shortfall of 713 million euros. Central Bank chief George Provopoulos said the banks which had followed instructions to raise capital boosted their position and lenders must continue to do so. (Reporting by George Georgiopoulos)
