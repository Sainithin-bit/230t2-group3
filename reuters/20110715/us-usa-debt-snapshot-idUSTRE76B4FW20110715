 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Here is what is happening on Friday in negotiations to raise the U.S. $14.3 trillion debt limit. 

 * President Barack Obama says at a news conference that any deficit reduction package should be balanced between spending cuts and tax increases. He says time is running out to raise the credit limit ahead of an August 2 deadline, when the United States will have trouble paying all its bills. Obama says a failure to raise the debt limit would amount to a tax increase for all Americans because interest rates would rise. * Republican members of the House of Representatives, in a closed-door session, decide to vote on a plan next week calling for immediate spending cuts, capping the level of federal spending to a percentage of the economy -- 18 percent by 2021 -- and sending a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget to the states for ratification. Republican lawmakers say a debt limit increase would be tied to Congress passing the balanced budget amendment. * House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi calls the Republican plan "outrageous" and hopes debt talks between Obama and congressional leaders produce a large deficit reduction package, which Democrats say must include tax increases to prevent deep spending cuts that affect the middle class and poor. * Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and White House chief of staff William Daley go to Capitol Hill for talks with congressional leaders. * Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Republican Leader Mitch McConnell are said to be discussing modifications of a plan put forward by McConnell that would raise the debt limit and put nearly all the burden on Obama to carry it out. * Lawmakers are under growing pressure from the U.S. business community and U.S. creditors to strike a deal. China, the United States' biggest foreign creditor with more than $1 trillion in Treasury debt, is urging Washington to adopt responsible policies to protect investor interests. * No face-to-face negotiations are planned over the weekend between Obama and congressional leader.
