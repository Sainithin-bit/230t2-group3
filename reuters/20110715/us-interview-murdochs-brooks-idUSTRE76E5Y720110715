 LONDON  (Reuters) - Media mogul Rupert Murdoch will face angry questions from politicians next week about suspicions that Britain's parliament was misled over allegations of phone hacking by one of his newspapers, a British MP said on Friday. 

 News Corp owner Murdoch, 80, will appear before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday together with his son James, 38, who chairs its British newspaper arm News International. Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 43, will also attend what has become one of the most hotly anticipated events at Britain's Palace of Westminster in years. John Whittingdale, who will lead Tuesday's questioning, told Reuters that the 10-member panel of politicians on the Culture, Media and Sport committee would focus on James' admission that parliament was misled over the hacking allegations. "There are a very large number of questions. The first reason why we were extremely keen to hear from the Murdochs and Brooks was the statement by James Murdoch that he now knows that during our previous inquiry parliament was misled," he said. "That is something we obviously take very seriously. Therefore we will want to know from him in what way exactly we were misled, who it was and how long that it's been known for, and why it's only now that it's becoming public." The Murdochs had initially declined to appear at the British parliamentary hearing next week, but on Thursday changed their minds amid escalating political and public condemnation of suspected media abuses at the News of the World tabloid. Murdoch last week shut down the best selling newspaper, which was accused of hacking into the phones of up to 4,000 people to access voice messages, with victims including murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler and families of dead soldiers. News International, News Corp's British newspaper operation, has previously pinned the blame for phone hacking crimes on a single "rogue" reporter who was convicted in 2007. In the last two weeks the scandal has escalated as reports suggested that phone hacking may have been far more widespread. Accusations that News of the World made payments to the police have surfaced, while the police this week said News International had thwarted their investigations into hacking allegations. Brooks quit her post on Friday after a chorus of calls for her to go, including from Prime Minister David Cameron and major News Corp shareholder Saudi Arabia's Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. "We want to question Brooks over the fact that hacking into the phone of Milly Dowler took place while she was editor of the News of the World. How that happened, how it was ever thought acceptable, who was responsible, and when she knew about it," Whittingdale said. "There's also a report that News International executives were made aware in 2007 in an internal report that far more people were aware," he added. The furor has galvanized political opinion against the Murdochs and their media empire, which in Britain includes a 39 percent stake in pay-TV operator BSkyB, the influential Sun tabloid as well as The Times and The Sunday Times broadsheets. The political pressure has forced Murdoch to abandon a $12 billion plan to buy the rest of BSkyB. Murdoch apologized in person to murdered schoolgirl Dowler's family on Friday, and News International plans to run apologies in all national newspapers under the headline "We are sorry." For Whittingdale, apologies are not the end of the matter. "An apology is long overdue. I hope that Rupert Murdoch and James Murdoch will make an apology directly when we see them, but we are still discovering the full extent of what has been happening and those inquiries are continuing," he said. "I think this investigation still has a long way to go." (Editing by  Maria Golovnina ) (Reporting by Mohammed Abbas)
