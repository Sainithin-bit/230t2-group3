 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), Japan's top automaker, said quarterly operating profit jumped more than five-fold to $3 billion and would treble in the current year as vehicle production roars back from post-disaster lows. 
 January-March operating profit increased to 238.5 billion yen beating a consensus estimate of 223 billion yen in a survey of 23 analysts by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Fourth-quarter net profit jumped to 121 billion yen from 25.4 billion yen a year ago. For the year to next March, Toyota forecast operating profit would rise to 1 trillion yen ($12.54 billion), its highest since the global financial crisis. Consensus forecasts have been for a full-year profit of 990 billion yen. Toyota shares have gained more than a third since the broad market trough in late-November, outperforming local rivals Nissan ( 7201.T ) and Honda ( 7267.T ), U.S. competitors General Motors ( GM.N ) and Ford ( F.N ) and Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ), but lagging BMW's ( BMWG.DE ) 41 percent jump. The main Topix share index  .TOPX  is up by a tenth over the same period. ($1 = 79.7750 Japanese yen) (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim ; Editing by  Ian Geoghegan )
