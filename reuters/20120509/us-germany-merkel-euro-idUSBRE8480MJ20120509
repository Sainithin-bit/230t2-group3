 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel reaffirmed on Wednesday that the euro zone must stick to previously agreed reforms on budget discipline. 
 Merkel is facing increased calls in the crisis-stricken euro zone to ease up on tough fiscal measures that have deepened a recession in peripheral countries such as Greece and to make reviving economic growth a bigger political priority. "We both concur that in the euro zone we must stick to the program and the rules that have been agreed," Merkel told a joint news conference with Slovenia's Prime Minister Janez Jansa. Echoing Merkel's tough line, Jansa said: "There is no 'either-or' when it comes to stability or economic growth. ... Such growth should not lead to higher public debts, which would not be good for future generations." Slovenia is a member of the euro zone.
