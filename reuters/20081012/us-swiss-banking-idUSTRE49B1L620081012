 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Swiss banks are coping with the financial crisis and Switzerland has not seen a banking crisis, the head of Switzerland's banking association was quoted as saying on Sunday. 

 "I am convinced that no Swiss bank will collapse," Pierre Mirabaud told Swiss newspaper Sonntag. "The Swiss banking system is healthy. The cantonal banks, the regional banks, the private banks -- they are all doing very well." "Switzerland is better positioned than many other countries. You cannot talk about a banking crisis here. We have more than 320 banks here. Only the two big banks are directly affected by the crisis," he said. But Mirabaud also sounded an upbeat note on UBS and Credit Suisse, saying they were not in the eye of the storm. "UBS recapitalized itself immediately after its problems. At that point there were still investors. Today such a recapitalization would be a lot more difficult," he said. "And Credit Suisse has been a lot less affected by the crisis from the start," he said. UBS's reputation as an icon of Swiss banking stability was badly bruised after investments in toxic U.S. assets forced the world's largest wealth manager to make $42 billion of writedowns. At the beginning of October UBS chairman Peter Kurer said the bank had fared "reasonably well through this turmoil of the last weeks" as it had responded quickly to the crisis, recapitalizing the bank early with nearly $30 billion of fresh cash and overhauling its business model. Mirabaud said UBS's capital ratio was twice as high as the largest British bank and said Swiss banks had the advantage that they had a lot of savings deposits, making them less dependent on the short-term money market.
