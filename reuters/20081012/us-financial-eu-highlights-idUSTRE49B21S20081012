 (Reuters) - Leaders of euro zone countries hold an emergency meeting in Paris on Sunday hoping to agree on specific, pan-European measures to prop up the battered financial sector and halt market panic. 

 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet were also in Paris for the meeting. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown met French President Nicolas Sarkozy, Barroso and Trichet ahead of the main gathering. Below are some of their comments. BELGIAN FINANCE MINISTER DIDIER REYNDERS "Each state between now and next Wednesday I hope will say what is the total amount they can provide." BRITISH PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN "I believe that our European colleagues will move ahead with the comprehensive plans that they are now discussing at the meeting that is taking place." GERMAN CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL "The goal is to define a coordinated common procedure for the euro zone that enables us in the next few days to take national steps to stabilize the financial market, but measures that do not discriminate against individual member states." "I think that the meeting today will send a very important signal to the markets." FRENCH PRESIDENT NICOLAS SARKOZY "I expect an ambitious and coordinated plan that will bring solutions." "On Wednesday we will try to pull all of Europe in the same coordinated and ambitious direction." "I expect Europe to speak with a single voice." EUROPEAN COMMISSION PRESIDENT JOSE MANUEL BARROSO "It is very important that this response is coordinated and coherent. That is why we are going to have this meeting today in the framework of the euro zone. We hope this will be a basis for a common decision next Wednesday (at a full EU summit). "The (G7) finance ministers adopted some measures. They are general principles which are very important but we must go beyond these and apply these principles by having a more detailed plan for the euro zone and for Europe."
