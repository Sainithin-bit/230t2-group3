 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Sunday central bank coordination demonstrates nations are unlikely to get into a race to lower currency values. 

 "The object is not to inflame a beggar-thy-neighbor policy," he said in response to a question after speaking at the Institute of International Finance. "We're extremely mindful of the fact that we're globally interlinked," he added.
