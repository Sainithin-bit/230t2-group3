 PARIS  (Reuters) - Leaders of the 15 euro zone countries have agreed to provide guarantees to help boost bank liquidity and will recapitalize any banks that need it, Belgian Finance Minister Didier Reynders said on Sunday. 

 Speaking after a summit of countries signed up to the euro currency, Reynders said the various states would announce in the days ahead aid for their own financial sector and added that he hoped to see changes to accountancy rules shortly. (Reporting by Yann Le Guernigou, editing by Crispian Balmer)
