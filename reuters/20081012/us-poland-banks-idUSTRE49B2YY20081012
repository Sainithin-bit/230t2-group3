 WARSAW  (Reuters) - Poland's Finance Ministry, the central bank and the country's financial watchdog are set to meet the chief executives of Poland's top 10 banks on Monday to discuss the current situation on the financial markets, a banking source said Sunday. 

 "The CEOs of Poland's top 10 banks were invited to the meeting with the Financial Stability Committee (KSF) on Monday at 1300 (1100 GMT)," the source said. The KSF comprises officials from the finance ministry, the central bank and the financial watchdog. The central bank was not immediately available for comment while the finance ministry declined to comment on the issue. A government source said, however, that an amendment to the Bank Guarantee Fund bill will be proposed to the parliament to increase the amount of guaranteed bank deposits and allow the government to decide on granting help to any bank that could require it. Both the government and parliament will work on the amendment on Tuesday and Wednesday, the source said. At a news conference on Monday scheduled for 0700 GMT, the heads of Poland's central bank and the country's banking association will outline measures to boost confidence in the banking sector, Krzysztof Pietraszkiewicz, the head of the Polish Banks Association, said on Friday. "Our banking system is very stable, but in the face of what's happening on the international markets, we want to present instruments ... to shield our banking system and our customers, not only by raising the guaranteed level of deposits," Pietraszkiewicz said, but did not elaborate.
