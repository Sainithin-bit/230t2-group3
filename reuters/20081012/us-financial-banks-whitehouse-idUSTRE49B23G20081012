 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House knocked down a British report that the United States was considering suspending bank stocks along with other leading industrial nations, saying on Sunday there was no change to the U.S. policy against market intervention. 

 Last week White House spokesman Tony Fratto said there were "absolutely no plans or discussions to interfere with the functioning of markets in the United States." "No change," Fratto said on Sunday when asked if there was any shift or change in the Bush administration's position. Britain's Sunday Telegraph reported that banking shares across the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, or G7, could be suspended on Monday as the governments tried to halt the financial crisis spreading around the globe. The G7 is made up of the United States, Germany, France, Japan, Canada, Great Britain and Italy. (Reporting by  Jeremy Pelofsky ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama  )
