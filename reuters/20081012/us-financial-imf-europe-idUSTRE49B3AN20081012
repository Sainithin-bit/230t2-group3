 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn on Sunday welcomed euro-zone steps aimed at stabilizing chaotic financial markets and praised actions taken so far by the United States. 

 "I welcome the meeting of the heads of state of the euro zone and the result," he said at a news briefing. "Not only is this action coordinated, but it's also proposing some details," he added. Strauss-Kahn declined to offer recommendations for how the United States should proceed in efforts to address credit turmoil, but praised steps taken so far. "I think that what has already been done in the United States is now going to work," he said. "It has to be done, the sooner the better." A $700 billion U.S. financial bailout package approved earlier this month is "the correct action," Strauss-Kahn added. (Reporting by  Lesley Wroughton  and  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Tim Ahmann )
