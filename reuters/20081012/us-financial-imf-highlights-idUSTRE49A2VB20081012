 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Financial officials from around the world are in Washington this weekend for the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meetings. 

 On Friday, top officials from the Group of Seven rich nations promised exceptional and urgent steps to deal with the global financial crisis. Below are key quotes from officials on Saturday: CHRISTINE LAGARDE, French economy minister, on euro zone crisis response and leaders summit scheduled for Sunday: The meeting will serve "not to talk about it but to put meat, muscles on the bones of that skeleton and to develop, follow up and execute upon it." "It is not my privilege tonight to share with you what will be the quality of the meat and what will be the texture of the muscles but I can assure you that you will not be disappointed and that it will be quite specific." GUIDO MANTEGA, Brazil finance minister and G20 chair, at post-G20 meeting news conference: "We are facing today a global financial crisis that is hitting virtually all countries. As the crisis became more acute, it brought consequences to developing countries as well." "I would say that the G20 today moved toward a more coordinated action. We need to be more agile and we need proper instruments for that." "The problems we have today in the world economy need to be jointly addressed by several countries." "Ideally, the G20 would have a situation room, such as you have when you are in a war. Indeed, this crisis is like a war." CHRISTINE LAGARDE, French economy minister, speaking to reporters about interbank lending guarantees: "Guarantees, whether they relate to certain loans, certain debt issues, certain interbank loans or deposits, have multiple dimensions and we have to examine them on a case-by-case basis to see whether they have a distortionary character." "We committed ourselves, in both the G7 statement and the conclusion of the Ecofin, to ensuring that any measure taken by a member state should take care to avoid distortionary effects in other member states." DOMINIQUE STRAUSS-KAHN, IMF managing director, at a news conference : "In the coming days ... what I expect is that the reaction by the different institutions will be positive enough to unfreeze the different markets and to restore the necessary funding." "The crisis is not only a crisis limited to advanced countries, but it also hit a lot of emerging countries, low income. And so we (the IMF) need to be ready to answer and we are already answering to many countries asking for support. To do that we have a lot of resources that are available...we're ready to help the country that needs some support." YOUSSEF BOUTROS-GHALI, chairman, IMF steering committee, at a news conference: "We are all committed to the (G7) plan of action ... this is an essential element for restoring confidence." "We are committed to resolving this crisis ... that is not a small achievement." "I am sure from the discussions there will be a number of measures that will be in the coming days coming forward." IMF steering committee communique: "The committee recognizes that the depth and systemic nature of the crisis call for exceptional vigilance, coordination, and readiness to take bold action. It underscores that the fund has a critical mandate to foster the multilateral cooperation needed to restore and safeguard international monetary and financial stability. The committee considers that, using its emergency procedures, the fund stands ready to quickly make available substantial resources to help member countries cover financing needs." GUIDO MANTEGA, Brazil finance minister, addressing IMF steering committee: "The world watches in disbelief as the unfolding crisis reveals serious systemic weaknesses and policy blunders in what used to be regarded as model countries, countries that were presented as references of good governance, as examples to be imitated. "The IMF itself used to take these countries' financial systems as the basis for devising so-called best practices in terms of financial management. "After the current turbulence is controlled, we will have to establish a new set of practices to strengthen and protect the financial system, but without a bias toward the practices of the advanced countries." GIULIO TREMONTI, Italian economy minister, on expanding the G7 and reforming market regulation "We propose to go beyond the G7 framework to adopt a larger structure," he said. He did not suggest which or how many new countries should enter the exclusive rich nations group, saying that for now he was calling it the GX. The rewriting of financial market rules should target "absolutely crazy bodies, like hedge funds which have nothing to do with capitalism." MIGUEL ANGEL FERNANDEZ ORDONEZ, European Central Bank Governing Council member, in an interview. "I think central banks, and especially the ECB, which does not have any responsibility in (market) supervision, do not have anything to do. Until now, the provision of liquidity and interest rate levels has been important," he said. "Now all that people here work for is something that is in the hands of treasuries and (market) supervisors and that is how to recover confidence. That is crucial at this moment," he said. TITO MBOWENI, South African Reserve Bank, to the IMF steering committee: "We all saw the dangers building up over the last few years, and knew the actions we needed to take to avoid a calamitous outcome. But this common knowledge was not enough to spur determined corrective action." "We were not able to act in unison, and the institutions tasked with facilitating a collective could not or were not allowed to realize their mandate. We must now acknowledge this profound failure."
