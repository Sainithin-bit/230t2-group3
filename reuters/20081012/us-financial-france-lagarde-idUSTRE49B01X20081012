 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The meeting of European leaders to be held in Paris on Sunday to discuss the financial crisis will come up with detailed, specific measures, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Saturday. 

 The meeting would serve "not to talk about it but to put meat, muscles on the bones of that skeleton and to develop, follow up and execute upon it," Lagarde told a dinner held by the Institute of International Finance in Washington, shortly before returning to Paris. "It is not my privilege tonight to share with you what will be the quality of the meat and what will be the texture of the muscles but I can assure you that you will not be disappointed and that it will be quite specific," she said.
