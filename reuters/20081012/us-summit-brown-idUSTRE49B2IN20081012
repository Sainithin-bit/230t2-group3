 PARIS  (Reuters) - Euro zone countries are expected to adopt comprehensive plans to shore up their banking sectors, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Sunday. 

 "I believe that our European colleagues will move ahead with the comprehensive plans that they are now discussing at the meeting that is taking place," Brown told reporters. Earlier Brown met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy ahead of an emergency summit of the 15 euro zone area called to thrash out measures to tackle the deepening financial market crisis.
