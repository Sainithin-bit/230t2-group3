 (Reuters) - The world's richest nations vowed this weekend to prevent vitally important banks from failing and to unfreeze credit markets in a bid to halt panic in financial markets. 

 European leaders from the euro zone on Sunday agreed on a three-part plan on how to achieve these goals. France and Germany said they would put forward legislation early this week to implement the plan, while Portugal and Norway moved ahead immediately.

The Treasury can lend an unlimited amount to the bank insurance agency to ensure depositors in failed banks are repaid. - ACCOUNTING: Securities regulators can suspend mark-to-market accounting, blamed for forcing financial institutions into insolvency when market value of assets plunge or are unknown. - LIQUIDITY- Federal Reserve operating various liquidity measures up to $900 billion, plus a commercial paper program, and loans to individual companies like AIG and JPMorgan.
