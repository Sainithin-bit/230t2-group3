 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - In a surprise move to calm panicky financial markets, the U.S. Federal Reserve on Friday cut the discount rate governing Fed loans to banks and signaled a willingness to lower benchmark overnight rates to cushion the economy from tightening credit. 

 The Fed cut the discount rate by a half percentage-point to 5.75 percent but left the federal funds rate -- its main economic policy lever -- unchanged at 5.25 percent. However, it said it stood ready to act to keep the U.S. economy on an even keel, giving an immediate boost to beleaguered stock markets. In a rare statement between scheduled meetings, the U.S. central bank's policy-setting committee said risks to economic growth "have increased appreciably" due to a global credit crisis and financial market turmoil. "The move this morning is a major shift in their economic viewpoint and is meant to send a message to the markets that their heads aren't in the sand and (that they) are proactive in addressing the credit crunch," said Chris Jarvis, an analyst with Caprock Risk Management in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. He added that "things must be bad for them to turn hard on their outlook." Just 10 days ago after a regular policy meeting, the Fed had said inflation -- not growth -- was its main concern, although it acknowledged that growth risks had increased "somewhat." In Friday's statement, the Fed said: "The committee is monitoring the situation and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets." "Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth." the Fed said. CREDIT CRISIS A credit crisis has snowballed in recent weeks, as defaults on U.S. subprime mortgages have choked off demand for risky high-yield loan derivatives, plunging some hedge funds into dire financial straits and causing banks to severely tighten lending standards. Markets worldwide have experienced sharp sell-offs. The discount rate cut could lower the cost of capital for banks and help keep credit flowing through the economy at a time when investors have shown a greater reluctance to lend. The Fed's Washington-based board, which approved requests from the New York and San Francisco Federal Reserve banks to lower the discount rate, said it took the action "to promote the restoration of orderly conditions in financial markets." It also decided to allow longer-term loans to banks. The discount rate usually moves in concert with the federal funds rate, and the surprise reduction on Friday showed how serious the Fed views the current financial market turmoil. The last time any rates were cut between regular Fed meetings was on September 17, 2001, just days after terror attacks that had brought the U.S. financial system to a virtual halt. Stock markets around the globe have sold off sharply in recent days as the credit squeeze threatened to choke off economic growth. The Fed and other central banks have been pumping funds into the banking system to maintain liquidity, but these steps had failed to calm volatile markets. Investors took Friday's move as a signal the Fed won't let market panic spin out of control and many said it was a major step toward a long hoped-for cut in the main benchmark overnight lending rate. "This is a noticeable change in their view of the economy and they want to take action," said A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. chief economist Gary Thayer in St. Louis, adding that he would look for a rate cut by the next meeting on September 18. "It's a pretty decisive step. They were seeing continuing deterioration in the housing and mortgage markets and growing concerns about access to credit and they didn't want lending to be tightened further," he said. U.S. Treasury debt prices initially fell after the announcement as stock markets rallied, but steadied at higher levels after a weaker-than-expected reading on consumer sentiment. The dollar fell broadly against major currencies as investors saw increased odds of a rate cut. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , which had dropped by more than 800 points in the previous six sessions, surged by more than 300 points in early trading but settled back and by early afternoon was up around 200 points. "The Fed is making sure liquidity is in place, but it doesn't mean they have to cut the fed funds rate. They are doing what's appropriate. They're putting liquidity into the system," said Cynthia Cole, a bond fund manager at Allegiant Asset Management in Cleveland.
