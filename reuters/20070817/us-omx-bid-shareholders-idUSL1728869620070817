 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - OMX OMX.ST shareholders gave a cautious response on Friday to Borse Dubai's $4 billion offer for the Nordic and Baltic bourse owner, which topped an earlier bid by U.S. exchange group Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ). 

 Borse Dubai's cash offer of 230 crowns per share trumps Nasdaq's cash and shares deal, which is backed by OMX management, but shareholders said price was not the only issue. Nasdaq's bid was worth around 198 crowns per share on Friday. Swedish investment powerhouse Investor ( INVEb.ST ), which has a 10.7 percent stake in OMX, said it was not clear that Borse Dubai's higher bid was better for OMX in the longer term. "We have said before that we see an industrial logic between OMX and Nasdaq and it is not obvious that a cash bid at this level is better in a time frame of a few years, but that is something we will now analyze," Investor spokesman Fredrik Lindgren said. One analyst who declined to be named said Nasdaq's bid was a dream scenario for OMX when announced in May. It offers OMX global reach and gives Nasdaq access to European markets and OMX's strong technology platform. But a number of major investment firms expressed worries at the time that companies listed in the Nordic region could be forced to conform to tougher U.S. regulations if Nasdaq succeeded in its bid. This might hurt OMX's competitive position and could lead some companies to delist, industry watchers had said. Exchanges around the world have been looking to tie up to meet the challenges of competition from nimble, electronic trading platforms, new regulations and the need to cut costs. The Swedish government, which is investigating whether there would be regulation creep from a Nasdaq takeover of OMX as well as the effect on the Nordic marketplace, said it was evaluating Borse Dubai's bid. It has a 6.6 percent stake in OMX. Banking group Nordea, with a 5.3 percent stake in OMX, said it was looking at the offer both as shareholder and exchange client. "We are naturally interested in OMX's future, we are clients," said Nordea spokesman Boo Ehlin. He said Nordea was considering its response but could not say how long it would be before Nordea decided on its stance. Borse Dubai said it has control of around 28.4 percent of OMX shares and wants to build on OMX's technology platform to expand into high-growth markets such as the Middle East, Africa and south and central Asia. While a takeover by Dubai would give OMX access to significant funding, the exchanges themselves are small, bringing little in terms of economies of scale for OMX. Furthermore, the analyst said that ownership by Dubai would bring the risk OMX might become less transparent as it would no longer be a listed company. Other shareholders contacted by Reuters declined to comment.
