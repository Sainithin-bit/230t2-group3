 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.N 
shares leaped higher on Friday after the U.S. Federal Reserve 
lowered a key borrowing rate, making it easier for lenders to 
obtain credit. 

  The gain followed six days of declines, in which shares of 
the largest U.S. mortgage lender had sunk 34.9 percent to their 
lowest level in nearly four years.  Countrywide was one of the biggest gainers among financial 
services companies, which enjoyed broad-based gains after the 
Fed cut the discount rate, charged on direct Fed loans to 
banks, to 5.75 percent from 6.25 percent. The move calmed 
investors worried about a global credit squeeze.  The cut came a day after Calabasas, California-based 
Countrywide, which operates Countrywide Bank, said it borrowed 
$11.5 billion from a group of 40 banks after having difficulty 
selling short-term debt.  Countrywide announced the drawdown just 10 days after 
saying it had access to $46.2 billion of "highly reliable" 
short-term financing.  "While a rate cut may not have been deemed desirable a few 
short trading sessions ago, the Countrywide move dramatically 
upped the ante," wrote Louise Purtle, senior analyst of macro 
strategy at CreditSights Inc. "The question for investors now 
will be -- is it enough?"  Countrywide shares rose $2.05, or 10.8 percent, to $21.00 
in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after 
earlier rising as much as 26 percent to $23.90. The shares are 
still down by about half since closing last year at $42.45.  Other lenders' shares also rose on Friday. The 24-member 
Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX was up 3.5 percent, 
including gains of 2.9 percent at Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), 3.5 
percent at Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and 4.4 percent at 
JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ).  The KBW Mortgage Finance Index .MFX, which includes 
Countrywide, was up 4.8 percent.  Shares of Countrywide bottomed at $15.00 in intraday 
trading on Thursday but closed well above that level at $18.95. 
Lehman Brothers Inc. analyst Bruce Harting wrote that 
Countrywide was a big beneficiary of speculation the Fed would 
pump liquidity into the financial system.  In a Friday statement, the Clearing House Association, a 
group of major banks, said the Fed move will encourage market 
participants "to take steps that would improve conditions in 
funding and credit markets."
