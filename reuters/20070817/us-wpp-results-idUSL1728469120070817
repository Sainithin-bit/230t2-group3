 LONDON  (Reuters) - WPP Group, the world's second-largest advertising company, said on Friday it had seen a strong like-for-like revenue increase in July and expected to beat the wider market this year and its own performance in 2006. 

 The group also said it had not felt the impact of recent turmoil in the financial markets. Reporting its first-half results, WPP said it had started the year well with a 5.3 percent rise in like-for-like revenue, reflecting good economic conditions in its major regions, and that July revenues were up 7.7 percent. "The pleasing thing about it is the first quarter was about 4.3 percent, the second quarter was about 6.3 percent and the third quarter has kicked off at a faster rate," WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell told Reuters in an interview. "The market is growing about 4 to 5 percent, we think we'll do better this year than last year and so far so good, we're well into the 5 to 6 range." WPP achieved 2006 organic growth of 5.4 percent. Shares in the group were up just under 1 percent at 674 pence at 6:23 a.m. EDT after earlier hitting 700 in a fluctuating market. By region, its like-for-like growth up was 10.9 percent in Asia Pacific, Latin America, Africa & Middle East, up 5.1 percent in North America, up 3.1 percent in Continental Europe and up 2.3 percent in the UK. WPP said its performance in the first half mirrored continuing good economic conditions in its markets, although it said the UK remained relatively weak. "As long as the United States economy holds up, 2008 should be a good year too," it said, citing expected advertising spend on the 2008 Olympics, the U.S. presidential election and the Euro 2008 soccer championship. "2009 may see slower growth ... as the new United States administration wrestles with the country's fiscal and trade imbalances." Sorrell said it had not yet seen any impact from the recent plunge in financial markets around the world, saying that what happens in the financial markets usually takes about a year to be seen in the "real world". "The question is what is the impact on consumer spending and what's the impact on corporate profitability, and corporate profitability has been very strong," he said. "What we are seeing, I think, is a liquidity crisis, and I think it will work its way through the system." MOMENTUM WPP, whose agencies include JWT and Young & Rubicam, reported first-half revenues of 2.92 billion pounds ($5.8 billion) and headline pretax profit of 338 million pounds. Analysts had expected like-for-like growth of 5.2 percent, revenues of 2.89 billion pounds and underlying pretax profit of 332 million, according to a Reuters poll of seven analysts. The like-for-like figure is a key industry metric that strips out the effects of acquisitions and currency. WPP Chief Executive Martin Sorrell said analysts would now expect growth of 5 to 6 percent this year. The operating margin was 13.1 percent, in line with the group's margin target for 2007 of 15 percent, because it usually benefits from a strong final quarter. Analysts said the results showed the group was enjoying good momentum and benefiting from its strong presence in China and India, where first half organic revenues were up almost 29 percent and 22 percent respectively. Panmure analyst Alex DeGroote said the 5-6 growth prediction was a "veiled upgrading of revenue assumptions" and said he saw solid scope for earnings per share upgrades in coming months. SG Securities analyst Anthony de Larrinaga said the group was well positioned for everything barring a significant deterioration in U.S. corporate profitability.
