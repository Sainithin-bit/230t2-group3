 LONDON  (Reuters) - Four years after he was forced to leave OMX OMX.ST, Per Larsson is back for a showdown with the Nordic exchange owner and Magnus Bocker, a man he hired and who went on to replaced him as CEO. Larsson is now CEO of Borse Dubai, which launched a $4 billion bid for OMX on Friday in a bid to derail an agreed deal OMX already has with Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) "This is a huge personality fight," said one banker who knows both men, but who is not involved in the deal. Larsson was asked to resign from OMX in May 2003 on the same day the exchange, then known as OM, unveiled a deal to buy Helsinki bourse owner HEX for $270 million. Larsson had been there for 18 years, seven of them as CEO. He is best remembered not for leading the Nordic consolidation, but rather for two failed ventures: a hostile bid for the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) and the launch of a pan-European electronic trading platform called Jiway. "I like leading companies through a period of change but I also like to work more internationally," Larsson said the day he left OM. He added that after the HEX deal, OM "would have too much of a Nordic focus." Bocker replaced him as CEO the same day Larsson left, though originally on a temporary basis. Larsson became the head of Dubai International Financial Exchange last year, and was appointed Borse Dubai's CEO when the holding company was formed earlier this month. CONTRASTS The two 46-year-old men are a study in contrasts, according to people who know them. Larsson is "very cerebral" while Bocker is considered more sociable and a consummate networker. Bocker has made no secret of his doubts about Borse Dubai's bid as Larsson tries to persuade OMX stakeholders by highlighting the liquidity and high growth markets that Borse Dubai brings to the table. Despite offering 230 crowns per OMX share in cash, a 16.6 percent premium to Nasdaq Stock Market Inc.'s NADQ.O cash and share offer of 197.2 crowns apiece, based on Nasdaq's closing price on Thursday, Borse Dubai has yet to win a recommendation from OMX management. But even if Borse Dubai wins the battle against Nasdaq, the world's biggest electronic exchange, Larsson might not wind up running the enlarged entity, Borse Dubai Chairman Essa Kazim told reporters during a conference call on Friday. Larsson, who initially hired Bocker as a salesman for OMX's IT systems, expects the OMX technology and Dubai's liquidity pool to create a combination that trumps the $150 million cost savings estimates of the Nasdaq offer. Though Larsson's experience at OMX may leave a bitter taste in his mouth about Bocker, the two men spoke to each other until recently, and their wives also know each other, Scandinavian insiders say. "They were good buddies in the past," said one source on condition of anonymity. "Magnus did not have anything to do in chucking Larsson out." Bocker is keen to move to New York to take up the post of Nasdaq deputy CEO, sources say. He and Nordea Bank ( NDA.ST ), which together represent 16.6 percent of OMX shares, have irrevocably accepted the Nasdaq offer. Other OMX shareholders, however, have only agreed not to consider any rival bid below 220 crowns per share. OMX said on Friday it would compare the Dubai bid to the Nasdaq offer and will update shareholders in due course.
