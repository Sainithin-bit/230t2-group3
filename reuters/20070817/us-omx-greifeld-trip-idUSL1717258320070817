 LONDON  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) Chief Executive Officer Bob Greifeld plans to travel to Sweden early next week to meet management and stakeholders of its bid target Nordic bourse operator OMX AB OMX.ST, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. 

 Greifeld is set to be in Sweden on Monday and Tuesday, where he is due to meet OMX's head Magnus Bocker, as well as shareholders in the exchange owner, regulators and the Swedish government, the sources said. The meetings will come days after the emergence of a higher rival bid to Nasdaq's agreed offer for OMX. Borse Dubai launched a $4 billion cash offer for OMX on Friday, trumping the agreed deal with Nasdaq, in a bid to create a group with global reach. Nasdaq declined to comment.
