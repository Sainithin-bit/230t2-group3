 ROYAL OAK, Michigan  (Reuters) - Falling stock prices, a slowdown in the housing market and tighter credit could hurt auto sales, although there has been no big impact yet, a senior General Motor Corp ( GM.N ) executive said on Thursday. 

 "It is never good when the stock market goes down. It takes wealth out of the economy...people feel poorer and decide to defer major purchases," Bob Lutz, GM's vice chairman and head of product development, told reporters. "So a declining stock market is not good for automobile sales." Lutz, however, described the downturn as a "momentary correction" and he said GM's own sales have been holding up well over the past few weeks. "We have a very serious credit crunch in the U.S., but that was triggered by a bubble-like prosperity due to sub-prime mortgages and a building boom that was unjustified," he said. "At GM, we are not seeing a big impact yet, but we could," he said, speaking on the sidelines of an event where automakers and car enthusiasts were invited to show off their favorite new and not-so-new models. GM's exposure to the crisis-hit subprime mortgage market is mainly through GMAC, its former finance arm. GMAC, which is still 49 percent owned by GM, posted a 63 percent decline in second-quarter profit, hurt by subprime mortgage losses at its home lending unit. Like many lenders, GMAC's ResCap unit has struggled as falling home prices, and rising interest rates have made it tougher for many homeowners to keep up with mortgage payments. GMAC Chief Executive Eric Feldstein said in July that "widespread weakness" in housing would persist this year. BETTER THAN EXPECTED As automakers face weaker consumer spending and tough competition, they are stepping up incentives to boost sales. Lutz said GM's U.S. sales have outpaced internal expectations in the past two weeks, thanks to incentives. Auto sales are watched closely by economists because they are one of the leading indicators of consumer spending and economic health. "We are reasonably pleased with what we are seeing so far," Lutz said. "For the last 10 to 15 days, every single day, we have been selling more than we expected to sell." GM's U.S. sales fell nearly 19 percent in July, hurt by weakness in the housing market, higher gas prices and tough competition. "The reason July was weak is we failed to match incentives, especially on the Tundra," Lutz said, referring to Toyota Motor Corp's ( 7203.T ) redesigned pickup truck, which it launched in February and on which it offered big incentives in July. "We've decided to be much more competitive this month...and the big pickups are moving well now," Lutz said. The market for pickup trucks, which accounts for nearly 13 percent of overall U.S. sales, has become the most fiercely competitive segment as automakers sacrifice margins in order to protect market share. GM is boosting incentives even as it has been trying to stick to a strategy of lower incentives and clearer pricing, after decades of big discounting programs that eroded profits.
