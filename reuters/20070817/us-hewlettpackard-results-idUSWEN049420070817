 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) reported on Thursday a 29 percent rise in quarterly profit on improving margins from cost cuts and falling component prices, surpassing Wall Street estimates and sending its shares up 1 percent. 

 The world's largest maker of personal computers and printers also forecast earnings and revenue for its current quarter that are ahead of analysts' expectations and fly in the face of growing economic concerns of consumers. Palo Alto, California-based HP grabbed the title of top PC maker from Dell last year and is benefiting while its rival attempts to revamp and cut costs. But HP executives played down expectations for its computer segment, saying it is not realistic to think HP's PC sales can keep growing at three times the pace of the overall computer market, which is currently increasing by about 10 percent. Net income in HP's fiscal third quarter rose to $1.78 billion, or 66 cents per share, from $1.38 billion, or 48 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, HP earnings came in at 71 cents per share. Revenue in the quarter rose to $25.4 billion from $21.9 billion a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected earnings per share before certain items of 66 cents and revenue of $24.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "HP had an unbelievable quarter. They generated $1 billion in upside in revenues in an environment of nervous consumer spending," said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities. "Very positive results." GROWTH MARKETS Chief Executive Mark Hurd, who has led a turnaround at HP since his arrival in 2005, said the company also cashed in on growth in emerging markets during a quarter that is typically slow. HP has benefited along with competitors including Dell Inc. DELL.O and Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) from sharp price declines for computer memory, disk drives and microprocessors this year amid a supply glut, analysts say. HP also has cut 15,000 jobs in the past two years, and is consolidating data centers and selling real estate to cut costs. For its fourth quarter, the company forecast net income per share of 75 cents to 76 cents, profit before items of 80 cents to 81 cents per share, and revenue of $27 billion to $27.2 billion. Analysts, on average, expect profit before items of 78 cents per share and revenue of $26.5 billion. The upbeat forecast could give a lift to the sector, which has been beaten down by investors in recent days on concerns that trouble in the credit markets could spill over to the broader economy and sap technology spending. "It's showing that IT spending is not that bad. It's positive for the market because it shows that maybe it's not as bad as people think it is," said Shaw Wu, an analyst with American Technology Research, who has a "buy" rating on HP. FULL POTENTIAL Progress in lowering costs is continuing to pay off, Hurd told analysts, but said the profit benefits from falling component prices are not sustainable in the future. "HP is beginning to show signs of realizing its full potential," Hurd said on a conference call with reporters. Third-quarter revenue in HP's personal systems group, which includes PCs, rose 29 percent to $8.9 billion, while operating profit was $519 million, or 5.8 percent of revenue, compared with 4.0 percent a year earlier. In imaging and printing, one of HP's biggest profit drivers, revenue rose 8 percent to $6.8 billion. The unit's operating profit was $981 million, or 14.5 percent of revenue, up from 14.2 percent a year ago. Enterprise storage and server revenue climbed 10 percent to $4.5 billion and operating profit was $464 million, or 10.2 percent of revenue, up from 7.2 percent a year earlier. HP's services revenue climbed 8 percent to $4.2 billion and operating profit in the business was $430 million, or 10.3 percent of revenue, up from 9.4 percent. In software, revenue rose 74 percent to $554 million and operating profit was $81 million, helped by last year's $4.9 billion acquisition of Mercury Interactive Corp. HP said in July it planned to buy software company Opsware Inc. OPSW.O for $1.6 billion to bolster its business of helping corporate customers manage computer systems. HP shares, up 12 percent in 2007, had closed 0.2 percent lower at $46.05 in regular-session trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They were up at $46.50 in after-hours trade. Shares of HP trade at 17 times expected 2007 earnings per share, compared with 16 for International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) and Dell's 20.
