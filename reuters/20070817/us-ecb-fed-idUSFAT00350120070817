 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said on Friday it had no comment on a surprise cut in the U.S. Federal Reserve's primary discount rate and also declined to comment on whether it had any similar plans. 

 "No comment," an ECB spokesman said to both questions. The Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank also had no comment on the move. The Fed, which left its benchmark federal funds rate unchanged at 5.25 percent, said it was prepared to act as needed to mitigate any adverse economic impact from financial market turbulence over the last week.
