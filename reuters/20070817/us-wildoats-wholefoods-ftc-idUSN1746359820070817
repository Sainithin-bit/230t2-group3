 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. antitrust authorities asked a federal court for permission to temporarily block organic grocer Whole Foods Market Inc.'s WFMI.O merger with rival Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O, a spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission said on Friday. 

 The Federal Trade Commission also asked Judge Paul Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to delay the order he issued on Thursday allowing the $565 million deal to go ahead. The FTC also filed a appeal on Friday to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia requesting that the merger be stopped while the agency determine if it would be a violation of U.S. antitrust statutes. Whole Foods, which has said it intended to move forward with the merger no sooner than Monday, said it was convinced that it would continue to prevail in court. "We have reviewed Judge Friedman's 93-page opinion supporting his denial of the FTC's request for a preliminary injunction. The opinion is firmly grounded in both the facts and the law," said Whole Foods attorney Paul T. Denis in a statement. "We are confident that the merger will be allowed to proceed," said Denis. Thursday's ruling was a blow to the FTC, which had argued that the deal could hurt competition in two dozen U.S. markets and could lead to the closing of some Wild Oats stores. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods operates nearly 200 stores in the United States and Britain, while Wild Oats of Boulder, Colorado, runs about 110. The judge's 93-page order allowing the deal to proceed was sealed. But Cliff Aronson, an antitrust lawyer representing Wild Oats, said on Thursday that he had read the order and that Judge Friedman had been unconvinced by the FTC argument that the chains dominated the premium organic grocery market. The two chains contend they face stiff competition from traditional supermarkets.
