 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - Borse Dubai, which has bid $3.98 billion for Nordic exchange owner OMX OMX.ST, said on Friday it hoped to close the deal before the end of the year. 

 OMX earlier agreed a $3.7 billion deal with U.S. exchange group Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ). "We believe we will be able to close the transaction this year," a Borse Dubai representative told a conference call.
