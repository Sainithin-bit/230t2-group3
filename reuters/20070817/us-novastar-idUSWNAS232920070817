 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NovaStar Financial Inc NFI.N, a subprime mortgage lender, said on Friday it will fire about 500 employees, or 37 percent of its work force, as it reduces home loans, given tough capital markets conditions. 

 The lender also said it will temporarily stop offering home loans through brokers, and instead continue to offer mortgages through its retail operations. NovaStar expects the job cuts to begin immediately and conclude in the fourth quarter. The cuts will affect its Kansas City, Missouri headquarters, and result in the closing of wholesale operation centers in Lake Forest, California and Independence, Ohio. Following the cuts, NovaStar will have about 870 employees, spokesman Dick Johnson said. That is 58 percent fewer workers than the 2,048 employees NovaStar said it had at year end. The company expects to incur a pretax charge of $17 million to $21 million in the third quarter for the cuts, which it called a "plan of termination." The cuts reflect a need "to adapt to industry-wide credit conditions and disruptions in capital markets," Chief Operating Officer Lance Anderson said in a statement. Tighter guidelines and adjusted pricing levels will reduce loan originations "until the secondary market shows signs of normalizing," he added. NovaStar said it is still funding all home loans it has committed to make, and that its servicing and portfolio management operations are not affected by the job cuts. Subprime lenders make loans to people with weaker credit histories. Dozens of subprime lenders have curbed lending, quit the industry or sought bankruptcy protection this year as defaults soared, housing prices stagnated, borrowing costs increased and investors stopped buying riskier home loans. Amstar Mortgage Corp., which said it makes more than $1 billion of home loans a year, announced the layoff of most office staff at its headquarters. Its Houston-based parent, Amstar Financial Holdings Inc AFLH.PK, is trying to divest it. NovaStar has said second-quarter loan volume fell 73 percent from a year earlier to $773.7 million, and that third-quarter volume should be "substantially" lower. David Pazgan, who led the wholesale business, is among those leaving the company. Anderson will takeover his duties as chief executive of the company's NovaStar Mortgage Inc. unit. NovaStar shares closed up 64 cents at $7.97 on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at $106.60, after adjusting for a 1-for-4 reverse stock split.
