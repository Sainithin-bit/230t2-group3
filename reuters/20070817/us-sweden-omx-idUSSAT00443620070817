 STOCKHOLM  (Reuters) - The Swedish government said on Friday it would review Borse Dubai's $3.98 billion offer for Nordic bourse operator OMX OMX.ST. 

 The Swedish state owns 6.6 percent in OMX, which had an agreed cash and share deal with U.S. exchange Nasdaq ( NDAQ.O ), currently worth $3.7 billion. "There is an ongoing review of that deal, and the review will now also include the offer from Borse Dubai," Financial Markets Minister Mats Odell said in a statement.
