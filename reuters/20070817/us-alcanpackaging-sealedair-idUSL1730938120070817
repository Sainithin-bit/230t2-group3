 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bubble Wrap maker Sealed Air Corp. ( SEE.N ) is close to a deal to buy the packaging arm of Alcan Inc. AL.TO ( AL.N ) for $4 billion to $5 billion in cash, people familiar with the situation said on Friday. 

 Montreal-based Alcan is selling the packaging arm following its agreed-upon $38.1 billion takeover by mining group Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ). The source said the deal, which is not yet final, could be announced sometime in the next few weeks. Bemis Co. ( BMS.N ), a U.S.-based packaging company, had also been interested in the unit, according to one source familiar with the situation. The purchase would more than double the size of the business in terms of sales of Sealed Air, which brought in $4.3 billion in revenue last year. The company, based in Elmwood Park, New Jersey, makes food packaging and protective packaging, including Bubble Wrap. "We consider acquisitions as part of an ongoing growth strategy, but as a general policy, we don't comment on any specific acquisitions, activity or speculation," said Sealed Air spokesman Ken Aurichio. Alcan and Bemis declined to comment. Alcan and Rio announced on July 12 that they had struck a deal, putting an end to U.S.-based Alcoa Inc.'s ( AA.N ) hostile takeover attempt on Alcan. At that time, Alcan said it planned to sell the packaging business and had prospective buyers. Alcan Chief Executive Dick Evans said then the company had been very near a decision on selling its packaging group -- which has annual revenues of $6 billion and is based in Paris -- before Alcoa made its $28.8 billion offer on May 7. Also at that time, another source familiar with the situation said that the interested buyers were U.S.-based companies, but not the private equity firms that had been seen as possible buyers for Alcoa's own packaging business. Analysts had long speculated that Alcan might sell the business, which makes packaging for food, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and tobacco products. The packaging sector is consolidating in part as the number of suppliers and customers decline. Alcoa had plans to sell its packaging assets, which had 2006 annual sales of $3.2 billion and includes food and beverage containers as well as Reynolds wrap foil, before it bid for Alcan. Sources have said the sale of that business may now be unlikely, in part because potential private equity buyers have pulled back from deal making as credit has tightened. Alcan shares were up $1.90, or 2 percent, at $94.20 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. Shares in Sealed Air were up 13 cents at $26.75, also on the NYSE.
