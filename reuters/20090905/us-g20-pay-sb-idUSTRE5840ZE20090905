 LONDON  (Reuters) - The G20 group of advanced and emerging nations have agreed on some curbs on bankers' pay, such as clawback for poor performance and forcing banks to disclose how much top earners receive, a G7 source said on Saturday. 

 "There would be a set of rules enforced through the FSB (Financial Stability Board) on pay structures of banks including clawback ... and disclosure," the source told Reuters.
