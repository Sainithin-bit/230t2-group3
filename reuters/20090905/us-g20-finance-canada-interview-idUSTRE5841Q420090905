 LONDON  (Reuters) - A meeting of Group of 20 finance chiefs here agreed banks should hold more and better capital but actual levels will be country-specific and there was no consensus on moves to cap bank bonuses, Canada's finance minister said on Saturday. 

 Divisions had emerged at the meeting in London over U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's proposals for reform of how much capital banks set aside, with some European officials saying changes already made to the existing "Basel II" rules did the job. But a U.S. Treasury official said earlier that Washington is committed to implementing Basel II and a G20 source said that the French were prepared to accept proposals on leverage ratios and capital requirement -- signs the group was coming to terms. "I think there is a consensus that increased capitalization is desirable and it will be left to national authorities to decide on what levels are appropriate in each country," Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the meeting. He confirmed reports from delegation sources that the meeting had failed to reach hard commitments on capping bank pay and would ask the Financial Stability Board to look further at the issue. "On the executive compensation there are some stressed countries on that issue. There are countries in which a lot of taxpayers' money has been put into banks and it appears that some of the banks are using some of that taxpayer money arguably for executive compensation. If I were one of those countries, I'd be upset too." "The G20 is not agreeing on a cap on bonuses. There is no consensus on that issue. What we are agreed on is putting more meat on the bones of the Financial Stability Board standard with respect to executive compensation."
