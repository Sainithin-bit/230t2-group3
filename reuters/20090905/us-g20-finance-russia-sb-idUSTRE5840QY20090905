 LONDON  (Reuters) - Russia is likely to stick by its borrowing plans next year even though budget revenue forecasts have been revised up due to a brighter outlook for oil prices, finance minister Alexei Kudrin said on Saturday. 

 Russia plans to tap foreign debt markets for the first time in a decade in 2010 to the tune of $17.8 billion. Some 844 billion roubles ($27 billion) of domestic bonds are also planned. An improved outlook for oil prices has seen next year's projected budget revenues revised up and that has led to speculation that borrowing plans could also be scaled back. "We are leaning toward keeping borrowing at the planned level," Kudrin told reporters, adding that the final decision would be made at a government budget commission this month. Keeping borrowing in tact could enable Russia to save some cash from its oil wealth funds as these are also set to be used in covering the budget gap. Next year's deficit will be smaller than the previously forecast 7.5 percent, but will still exceed 7.0 percent, Kudrin said. The brightening economic outlook also means Russia's banks will likely not need as much state help -- through capital injections via special OFZ treasury bonds -- as previously planned. A finance ministry official has said this year's issuance of such bonds may be cut to 150 billion roubles from the previously planned 210 billion. Kudrin said all of the 250 billion roubles reserved for the scheme in 2010 was unlikely to be needed. "Growth of bad loans had slowed and positive trends in the economy have started to appear more clearly, so this year there will be no critical situation," Kudrin said. "This year such need (for capital injections) will be minimal and next year we also think it will be minimal...but we need to reserve a certain amount for next year in case of a pessimistic scenario which most likely will not happen." He added that "by the results of the quarter we will be able to say that the Russia has come out of recession," but full year 2009 GDP is still on track for an 8.5 percent slump, thanks to the deep slowdown in the first half. Interest rates will continue to be cut as inflation -- which hit a 4-year low in August -- eases, Kudrin said.
