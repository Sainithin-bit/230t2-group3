 LONDON  (Reuters) - A U.S. Treasury Department official said on Saturday that the United States remains committed to implementing Basel II capital rules for banks. 

 Divisions have emerged in London over Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner's proposals for reform of rules for banks' capital set-aside requirements, with some European officials saying changes already made to Basel II did the job. "We are committed to moving forward to implement Basel II on the current timetable," a U.S. Treasury official said on the sidelines of the G20 meeting of finance ministers and central bankers.
