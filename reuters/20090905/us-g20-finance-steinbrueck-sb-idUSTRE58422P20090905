 LONDON  (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said on Saturday policymakers needed to prepare strategies to prevent worldwide inflation and to consolidate their budgets once the global economic downturn has passed. 

 Asked when he expected policymakers to implement so-called "exit strategies," Steinbrueck told Reuters television: "I can't define a timetable right now." "But policymakers will be well advised to be prepared because when this crisis is overwhelmed, we will have to think how to consolidate our budgets again, how to prevent worldwide inflation and how to get authorities to invest in infrastructure and R&D and not in stabilizing the banking system," he added.
