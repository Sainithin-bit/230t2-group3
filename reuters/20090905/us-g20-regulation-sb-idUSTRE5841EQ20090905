 LONDON  (Reuters) - G20 finance ministers are meeting in London to discuss tighter financial rules and address lessons learned from the credit crunch. 

 Progress is bogged down over how much to increase bank capital to make the financial system safer. There is also no agreement on putting specific caps on huge banker bonuses that have angered the public. WHY IS BANK CAPITAL SUCH A HOT TOPIC? U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner sparked surprise by coming out just days before the London meeting with a meaty proposal for a brand new global accord on bank capital which is tougher and more comprehensive than the Basel II rules used now. After using hundreds of billions of dollars to shore up banks, the United States wants to make sure banks have enough of a capital buffer so they won't need taxpayer money in a future crisis. Geithner wants the new accord in place by the end of 2012, an ambitious deadline as agreeing on the detail of what should be the higher level of capital won't be easy or quick. SURELY IT MAKES SENSE TO INCREASE BANK CAPITAL? Yes, it's a core lesson from the credit crunch and all G20 members agree on that. But France is furious at the way the United States is going about things. Geithner unveiled his proposal without warning G20 colleagues even though G20 leaders in April agreed that beefing up bank capital should be done by all countries fully adopting Basel II -- not by some new, alternative initiative. There is some suspicion the United States, which has not fully adopted Basel II, is seeking to impose its own framework. However, a U.S. Treasury official said in London the United States was committed to moving forward to implement Basel II on the current timetable. France says Basel II is being improved to plug gaps from the credit crunch but the Treasury proposal wants a more fundamental rethink of bank capital. The London meeting is likely to avoid the issue by making no specific mention of either Basel II or Geithner's plan. HOW ABOUT CURBING THOSE BIG BONUSES THEN? The G20 agreed on a set of principles in April that bank pay policies must not encourage excessive risk taking in the short term and thus threaten bank stability over the longer term. French President Nicholas Sarkozy called on the G20 to go a step further by taxing and capping bonuses as he sees banks returning to business as usual. But Britain says a cap is unworkable. Canada says a cap is unnecessary and a blunt instrument. The United States prefers using higher capital charges to dampen risk taking as trying to cap bonuses may only encourage banks to pay higher salaries. Unless all G20 countries apply a cap, it won't work as France itself admits. In summary, there is no consensus, so no cap for now. SO TRADERS SHOULD NOT CANCEL THAT PORSCHE ORDER THEN? Not for the time being. Although the London meeting is not backing Sarkozy's call for a cap it is asking the Financial Stability Board, which includes the G20 finance ministry officials, regulators and central bankers, to study the issue. The London meeting fleshed out some principles such as clawing back bonuses paid for performance that turns out not be so good, but it basically reiterated its backing for principles the G20 endorsed in April. There was also some broad agreement that there should be restrictions on guaranteed bonuses. Lawyers who advise banks over pay packages say what is being agreed in London won't make a difference in practice as banks are already structuring packages so that a chunk of a bonus is deferred over several years and paid in the form of shares as well as cash.
