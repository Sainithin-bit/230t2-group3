 LONDON  (Reuters) - The G20 group of leading economies has yet to reach a compromise on reform of the International Monetary Fund, where emerging market economies are pushing for a greater share of votes, Russian Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said on Saturday. 

 Brazil, Russia, India and China proposed a 7 percent shift in IMF quotas in favor of developing countries, more than the 5 percent the United States is proposing. Finance ministers from the so-called BRIC bloc discussed the issue with U.S. counterpart Timothy Geithner on Friday, but Kudrin said a compromise had yet to be found. "Geithner has his proposals. For now everyone is working on the basis of their own proposals and we are having consultations," Kudrin told reporters. The issue is on the agenda when G20 finance ministers meet on Saturday.
