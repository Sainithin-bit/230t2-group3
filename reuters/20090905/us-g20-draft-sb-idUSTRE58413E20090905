 (Reuters) - The G20 group of leading powers agreed on Saturday to continue expansionary fiscal and monetary policy until a global recovery was firmly secured, and to raise "significantly" emerging nations' say on the world stage, a draft statement showed. 

 The draft showed the meeting in London also agreed on global standards for curbing bankers' pay, including clawback for poor performance, but could not come to a deal on actual pay caps, instead asking the Financial Stability Board to study the issue. The statement, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, gave no details on reform of the IMF but said it expected "substantial progress" to be made on the issue at a summit of world leaders in Pittsburgh later this month.
