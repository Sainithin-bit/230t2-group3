 LONDON  (Reuters) - Finance ministers and central bankers from the G20 nations were meeting in London on Saturday to lay the foundations for a summit of leaders in the U.S. city of Pittsburgh later this month: 

 They have indicated they will keep economic support packages in place until recovery is certain and to reassure markets they will not withdraw extraordinary monetary stimulus quickly, even though the outlook for the world economy is gradually improving. Following are a selection of key quotes. For live G20 blog  r.reuters.com/tex64d ITALIAN FINANCE MINISTER GIULIO TREMONTI "The deal on banks compensations wants to send a wider message: it does not make sense that banks manage governments and politics" Tremonti said at the sidelines of G20 meeting. "It does not make sense that banks are larger than governments since their problems become governments' problems." "Banks have raised a lot of money from governments, especially abroad, but they are not lending enough to companies... this is a problem also for Italy" GERMAN DEPUTY FINANCE MINISTER JOERG ASMUSSEN ON EXIT STRATEGY "No one said the crisis is already over. We are seeing a stabilization." "No one said we should today withdraw the expansive monetary, fiscal stimulus and financial market stabilization measures, but there was a consensus that we should prepare so that in the future we should withdraw these measures in a coordinated and cooperative way." BRITISH PRIME MINISTER GORDON BROWN: ON G20 COOPERATION: "Twelve months ago people were afraid for their savings as bank after bank threatened to fall. Even six months ago people were still talking about the possibility of a Great Depression." We are at a new and critical juncture for cooperation in the global economy. This is not the time for complacency or over-confidence. ON REMOVING STIMULUS TOO EARLY It would be an error of historic proportions if we were to repeat the errors of the 1930s. ON IMBALANCES: "Making the recovery sustainable does mean, in my view, avoiding unsustainable imbalances between countries. "World growth has been driven, as everybody knows, by consumers in the United States and other deficit countries. Already in the United States, in Britain and other countries we are seeing savings increase. In the medium to longer term this adjustment should be complemented both by enhanced demand that we will see from emerging markets ... and by structural reforms also in emerging and advanced economies." "We need the world now to come together with careful and co-ordinated action ... It makes sense for countries with large current account deficits to boost exports. It makes sense also for countries with large current account surpluses to increase the demand for goods and services from other countries." "The positive growth forecasts we have now for 2010 are in many cases based on the key assumption that the effective global fiscal stimulus of 2010 will be of the same scale as 2009. "Given the risks we face this is clearly not the time for economic complacency. The stakes are simply too high to get these judgments wrong, so to decide now that it is time to start withdrawing and reversing the exceptional measures we have take would, in my judgment, be a serious mistake. "On the contrary, with more than half of the total five trillion (dollar) fiscal expansion yet to start, I believe the prudent course is for G20 countries to deliver these fiscal plans and the stimulus packages that have been put in place and make sure that they are implemented in full both this year and the next."
