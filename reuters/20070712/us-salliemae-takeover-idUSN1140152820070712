 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A group of private equity firms and banks have threatened to scuttle their planned $25 billion buyout of Sallie Mae, the student lender said on Wednesday, in the most dramatic sign yet that a once-booming takeover market may be cooling. 

 The Sallie Mae buyers blamed proposals to cut government subsidies to student lenders, but analysts said the group may want an excuse to pull out or to negotiate a lower price given recent difficulties in raising financing in the debt market. In another sign that buyers may be holding back, General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) and Abbott Laboratories Inc. ( ABT.N ) said on Wednesday they terminated a proposed $8 billion deal for the sale of two Abbott diagnostics units to GE, saying they were unable to agree on terms. Sallie Mae -- whose official name is SLM Corp. SLM.N -- in April accepted a $60-a-share leveraged buyout proposal from private equity firms J.C. Flowers & Co. and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, as well as JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp. SLM's shares fell almost 10 percent to $52.15, way below the offer price, on the New York Stock Exchange after the news. On Wednesday, Sallie Mae said the acquiring group said it believes that current legislative proposals "could result in a failure of the conditions to the closing of the merger to be satisfied." Sallie Mae said it "strongly disagrees with this assertion" and "intends to proceed towards the closing of the merger transaction as rapidly as possible, and will take all steps to protect shareholders' interests." The U.S. House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to slash federal subsidies paid to college student loan companies, such as Sallie Mae, Citigroup ( C.N ) and Bank of America ( BAC.N ). The takeover agreement allows the buyers to pull out of the deal if legislation has an impact worse than Sallie Mae disclosed in regulatory filings. The deal has a break-up fee of $900 million, but if the buyers could prove such legislation constituted a "material adverse impact" on the transaction, they would not have to pay the fee. NERVOUS MARKETS A collapse of the Sallie Mae buyout could rattle financial markets already jittery from rising subprime mortgage defaults and the recent collapse of several hedge funds. Amid fears that problems in the risky subprime market could spread to the wider economy, two leading rating agencies on Tuesday started to slash ratings for more than $17.3 billion of mortgage-related debt, rattling global financial markets. Recent market nervousness has spread to the U.S. junk bond market, where at least four deals have been pulled in recent weeks. A robust market for high-yield bonds is crucial for financing leveraged buyouts. "The buyers knew going into this deal that there could be legislation for student loans, and that any legislation would probably be detrimental," said Adam Compton, co-head of global financial stocks research at RCM Global Investors in San Francisco. "But the debt markets are looking tough now; there's a bit of a buyer's strike on LBO debt in the debt market. It could be a way for them to get out of the deal." J.C. Flowers was not immediately available for comment. JPMorgan Chase declined comment. Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri declined to comment, referring inquiries to J.C. Flowers. Friedman Fleischer & Lowe referred calls to Sallie Mae. "My guess is the buyers wanted leverage to renegotiate the deal," said Jason Polun, a financial services stock analyst at mutual fund firm T. Rowe Price. "If you ask me, this deal gets through, but it gets renegotiated at a lower price," Polun said, adding that other potential buyers could emerge for Sallie Mae. Kathy Shanley, analyst at corporate bond research firm Gimme Credit, said her firm could not blame Sallie Mae for disagreeing with the buyers on interpretation of the legislation "if it suspects the real reason the buyers want out is the turmoil and changing appetite for risk in the LBO debt markets." Shanley said bondholders would be happy to see the Sallie Mae deal collapse, since current debtholders are slated to be subordinated to the LBO financing. However, Shanley added: "But it's too soon to hope for a happy ending for bondholders, since one option would be for the company to renegotiate a lower price." Sameer Gokhale, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said: "I've heard some people say that Flowers might be having trouble getting funding lined up, but I'd be shocked if Bank of America or JPMorgan couldn't arrange the financing. My take is, they're probably finagling for a better price." (With reporting by Dan Wilchins, Joseph Giannone, Jon Stempel, Julie Vorman, Tim McLaughlin, Megan Davies)
