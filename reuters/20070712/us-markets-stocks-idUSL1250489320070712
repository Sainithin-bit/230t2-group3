 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks surged on Thursday, with the Dow hitting a record on its biggest point gain since 2002, after healthy retail sales reassured investors about consumer spending and a $38 billion mining takeover fed expectations for more deals. 

 The Standard & Poor's 500 index also closed at a new record and is now within several points of its lifetime high. "This is what we old timers call a melt-up," said Peter Kenny, managing director at Knight Equity Markets in Jersey City, New Jersey. "It's been a crazy day." Several mainstream retailers, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and J.C.Penney Co. Inc., offered upbeat sales outlooks for July, lifting optimism for back-to-school sales even in the face of high gasoline prices. Alcoa Inc., which got outbid for Alcan by Anglo-Australia mining group Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc, was a big contributor to the Dow's rally. It gained 6.7 percent in part on speculation that it now would be a takeover target.  Rio Tinto's move relieved investors' concerns that the takeover binge that has driven stocks higher this year could be ending. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 283.86 points, or 2.09 percent, to end at a record 13,861.73. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index shot up 28.94 points, or 1.91 percent, to finish at a record 1,547.70. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 49.94 points, or 1.88 percent, to close at 2,701.73. THE DOW'S BEST POINT GAIN SINCE 2002 The Dow also hit an intraday record high of 13,869.94, topping a previous record set June 1. The day's point gain was the Dow's best since October 15, 2002. On October 9, 2002, all three major U.S. stock indexes fell to their closing lows after the Internet bubble went bust. The Nasdaq rose to its highest in about six-and-a-half years. Intel Corp. jumped 5.8 percent to $26, its highest level since early 2006, and led the Nasdaq's major advancers after Banc of America Securities raised its second-quarter sales and earnings estimates for the chip maker. Intel is expected to report results next week. Alcoa's stock rose 6.7 percent to close at $45.29 on the New York Stock Exchange after climbing to a lifetime high of  $46.15. SOME SUBPRIME RELIEF Financial stocks were among the top gainers in the S&P 500, with an index of financial companies' stocks gaining 2.2 percent. Late in the session, Standard & Poor's corrected the volume of residential mortgage-backed securities it has placed under review for potential credit ratings downgrades on Tuesday to $7 billion from $12 billion. Financials "are pretty oversold, and there's a lot of negative news out there. To me, some of the subprime stuff is not as severe as everyone is making it out to be," said Rick Campagna, portfolio manager at Provident Investment Council in Pasadena, California. RETAILERS ON A ROLL Wal-Mart shares rose 2.4 percent to $48.83 on the NYSE, marking its biggest one-day percentage gain since early June. The retail sales "probably bode well for the back-to-school season. So many people have been concerned about the rising price of oil, and these comps have somewhat defied that," said John O'Brien, senior vice president of MKM Partners LLC in Cleveland, referring to June's comparable-store sales figures, which beat Wall Street's lowered expectations. Shares of Target rose 6.8 percent to $70.04 and hit a new lifetime high of $70.48 after the No. 2 U.S. discounter forecast July same-store sales up 5 percent to 7 percent. Target's stock extended gains after a report by Bloomberg that activist investor William Ackman has accumulated a stake of more than 5 percent in the discount retailer. The Bloomberg report cited "a person with direct knowledge of his plans." Department store operator J.C. Penney reported a June sales decline that was less than analysts had forecast and said it expects double-digit sales growth for July. Its stock added 6 percent to $75.46 on the NYSE. Major U.S. credit card companies' shares rose after the retail sales reports, and as the declining U.S. dollar lifted hopes for higher international revenue. American Express Co. gained 5.1 percent to $63.33 while Discover Financial Services Inc. rose 4.5 percent to $26.34 and MasterCard Inc. advanced 7.4 percent to $167.87. Trading was active on the NYSE, with about 1.67 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.28 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones by a ratio of about 3 to 1 on the NYSE and by about 7 to 3 on Nasdaq. (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel and  Kristina Cooke )
