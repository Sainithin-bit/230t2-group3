 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said on Thursday its commercial plane orders for the year stood at 580, on a par with last year's record-breaking performance, but trailing rival Airbus. 

 The Chicago-based plane maker, which unveiled its 787 Dreamliner on Sunday, reported 36 new orders in the past week -- 35 for 787s and one for a private 787 jumbo from an unnamed customer. German low-cost airline Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ) said at the weekend it would buy 25 787s, while Kuwait's Aviation Lease and Finance Co. ( ALAF.KW ) said it would buy 10 more 787s, on top of its existing order for 12. Boeing now has 677 firm orders for its lightweight, fuel-efficient 787, with Australia's Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) poised to order a further 20, according to remarks by the airline's chief executive at a Boeing event last week. The carbon-composite, widebody plane -- which is set to enter service in May -- is outselling Airbus' rival A350 XWB so far this year. But Airbus holds the edge in single-aisle planes. At the end of June, the European company had orders for 680 aircraft. Boeing won back the title of biggest-selling plane maker last year with a record-breaking 1,044 net orders. Airbus, a unit of EADS ( EAD.PA ), had held the lead in annual orders for the previous five years. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby ; Reuters Messaging: bill.rigby.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6122))
