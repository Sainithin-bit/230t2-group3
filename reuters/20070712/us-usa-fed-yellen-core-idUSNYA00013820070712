 ANCHORAGE, Alaska  (Reuters) - So-called core inflation, which removes food and energy costs, is a better way of forecasting future price pressures, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Janet Yellen said on Thursday. 

 Yellen, in response to questions following an address to a community leaders' lunch, acknowledged that consumers care about overall, or headline, inflation but added that effective monetary policy must concern itself with future risks to price stability. She said core inflation was "a better forward looking measure for total inflation." The Fed has kept U.S. interest rates at 5.25 percent for just over a year, and has said price pressures have eased a bit, though upside risks remain its main concern.
