 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. trade gap widened in May as higher oil prices and a rising tide of Chinese goods pushed imports to a record, overshadowing a strong export performance, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 A separate report showed the number of Americans applying for first-time jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, suggesting continued labor market strength. Financial markets largely dismissed the data, but better-than-expected June sales results from U.S. retailers helped give a big lift to U.S. stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed at a record 13,861.81 on its biggest point gain in 4-3/4 years. The May trade deficit widened to $60 billion from $58.7 billion in April, as imports grew 2.3 percent to $192.1 billion, the Commerce Department said. Exports rose 2.2 percent to an all-time high of $132 billion, led by robust shipments of aircraft and other capital goods and record consumer goods exports, giving both the Bush administration and manufacturers something to cheer about. "These are strong numbers. Exports are growing more than twice as fast as imports," U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said. For the first five months of 2007, the deficit has narrowed 7 percent from last year, he said. The oil import bill swelled to $19 billion, its highest level since September, as average prices for crude oil imports rose more than $2 per barrel to $59.36. "This is not a good month but it's not the worst month of the year either. We are still on track for improvement in the trade gap this year," said Kurt Karl, chief U.S. economist at Swiss Re in New York. Economists said the data suggested trade would add to U.S. economic growth in the second quarter, since rising oil prices accounted for much of the widening in the deficit and the government's main measure of growth is adjusted for inflation. EXPORTS RISING One big reason exports have grown faster than imports over the past 19 months is the weaker U.S. dollar, said Frank Vargo, a vice president at the National Association of Manufacturers. "We are now in surplus with Canada in manufactured goods, and our manufactured goods deficit with the European Union has fallen by more than one-fifth over the past year," Vargo said. The dollar dropped to a record low against the euro for a third day in a row on Thursday as concerns about a crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector spooked currency traders. Democrats saw nothing to cheer about in the trade data, which showed imports from China grew 4.5 percent in May to $25.3 billion, despite recent incidents that have raised concerns about the safety of Chinese goods. "From the rising costs of importing foreign oil to increasingly unsafe imports from China, the American economy and consumers are getting pummeled," said Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat. Imports from China totaled $121.0 billion in the first five months of the year, and are on track to surpass last year's record of $287.8 billion. Still, economists are hopeful rising overall exports will help keep the U.S. economy on solid ground, even as a slump in the housing market and high gasoline prices temper consumer spending. U.S. home foreclosures fell in June from a 30-month peak in May, but default rates are expected to rise as homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages face higher payments in coming months, real estate data firm RealtyTrac said on Thursday. Consumers already appear to be feeling a pinch. U.S. retailers reported modest June sales on Thursday, although the results topped downbeat Wall Street forecasts. The International Council of Shopping Centers said U.S. chain stores sales rose 2.4 percent in June, after a 2.5 percent gain in May and a 3 percent increase in June of last year. In its report on claims for jobless benefits, the Labor Department said the number of U.S. workers applying for an initial week of aid fell 12,000 to 308,000, a level that economists aid suggests the job market remains solid.
