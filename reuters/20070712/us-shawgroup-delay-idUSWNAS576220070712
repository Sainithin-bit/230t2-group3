 (Reuters) - Shaw Group Inc. SGR.N said it will delay the filing of its second and third quarter results with U.S. regulators, due to the restatement of its first-quarter results. 

 The construction and engineering company expects a net loss of $74 million, or 93 cents a share, for the second quarter, including certain items. It expects revenue of about $1.2 billion. (Reporting by Savitha Kalyanaraman in Bangalore)
