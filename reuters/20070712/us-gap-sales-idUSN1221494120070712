 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a year fell 5 percent in June, hurt by weakness at its Old Navy and namesake Gap chains. 

 Analysts on average had been expecting a same-stores sales decline of 4.2 percent, according to a Reuters survey. San Francisco-based Gap, which also runs the Banana Republic chain, said net sales for the five weeks ended July 7 were $1.45 billion, down 4 percent from a year ago. Same-store sales at its Gap brand stores fell 9 percent in North America, and Old Navy North America same-store sales fell 7 percent. Gap, which has been searching for a new chief executive since January, has posted negative or flat same-store sales in every month but three since June 2004. The company, which operates more than 3,000 stores around the world, is trying to reinvigorate its apparel mix and appeal more to its base of female shoppers in their late 20s and early 30s, rather than to teenagers. Apparel chains as varied as Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) and J. Crew JCG.N have taken market share from the retailer, which is best known for khakis, T-shirts, jeans, and colorful cotton fashions.
