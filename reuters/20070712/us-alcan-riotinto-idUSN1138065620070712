 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto was near a deal to buy Canadian aluminum giant Alcan Inc. for about $100 per share, or $37 billion, The Wall Street Journal Online reported on Thursday. 

 A final deal should be announced early on Thursday, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the transaction. The reported price would represent a premium of nearly 12 percent above Alcan's closing price in New York on Wednesday, and trump a $28.8 billion offer from Alcoa Inc. "Boards of both Alcan and Rio have approved the transaction," the Wall Street Journal said, citing unidentified people familiar with the deal. Rio shares hit a record high on Thursday as investors bet it would launch a rival bid. A tie-up between Rio and Alcan would create the world's largest aluminum maker, with annual capacity of 4.4 million tons, according to Credit Suisse. Rival BHP Billiton, which is being advised by Merrill Lynch, has been cited in reports as interested in either Alcan or Alcoa. Some sources have said BHP, the world's biggest miner, may not be as far along as Rio in negotiations. "A takeover would give Rio much-needed diversification away for iron ore, where it is greatly exposed," said Keith Goode, an analyst with Eagle Mining Research in Sydney. Rio shares were up 2.07 percent to A$104.90 in Australian trade, after hitting a record A$105.19 earlier in the session. BHP shares rose as much as 2 percent to A$38.55 in Sydney. As for Rio, sources have said the situation was still fluid and could change ahead of any announcement. Britain's Times newspaper had reported on Wednesday that Rio was poised to offer $90 a share, or $34 billion for Alcan. "There is a lot of cash in the market and a lot of cash being generated in the mining sector generally, so you'll continue to see M&A across the board," said Greg Goodsell, equity strategist at ABN AMRO. Alcan's stock rose $3.46 or 4 percent to $89.60 on the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday, putting its market capitalization close to the reported Rio bid value. Its shares rose C$4.20 or 4.7 percent to C$94.40 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Alcoa's shares rose 77 cents or 1.9 percent to $42.43 in New York, which put the value of its offer for Alcan at $76.03 a share. Among other companies sources previously said have shown interest in Alcan is Brazil's CVRD "We believe we are entering a major round of M&A in the industry," Credit Suisse told investors in a report Thursday, noting CVRD, BHP and Rio Tinto were "standout stories for growth." Rio and BHP have refused to comment on any potential M&A activity they may be planning. Alcan, which has long said it was in talks with third parties as part of its efforts to fight off Alcoa, changed gears slightly this week in describing those negotiations. It said on Wednesday that it had signed confidentiality and standstill agreements with those parties, indicating it has moved further along in the negotiating process. But Alcan declined to identify the third parties, or say who it was talking to. The company has at least two investment banks -- Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group -- working for it, sources have said. According to Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper, Rio recently hired CIBC World Markets as well. CIBC had no comment. This week Alcoa extended its offer for Alcan to August 10. It also secured a $30 billion line of credit from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Citigroup Inc., which are advising it on the offer. ($1=C$1.05, A$1.16)
