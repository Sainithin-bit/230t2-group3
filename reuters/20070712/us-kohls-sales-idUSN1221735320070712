 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Department store chain Kohl's Corp. ( KSS.N ) said on Thursday that June sales at stores open at least a year fell 4.9 percent, hurt by a calendar shift of Memorial Day into its May sales period this year. 

 Wall Street, on average, had been expecting a same-store sales decrease of 2.1 percent, according to a Reuters survey. The retailer said total sales for the five weeks ended July 7 rose 2 percent to $1.35 billion. Kohl's said it continues to expect a second-quarter profit of 81 cents to 85 cents per share. Analysts on average expect 84 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The retailer said it expects July same-store sales to rise in the mid-single-digit range. (Reporting by  Sarah Coffey )
