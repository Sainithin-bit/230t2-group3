 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mortgage brokers and other loan sellers would be named in a national database under legislation introduced Thursday by the top Republican on a U.S. House of Representatives financial panel. 

 Spencer Bachus, the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee, said his Fair Mortgage Practices Act would curb unscrupulous lending and increase consumer protections. Failures among subprime loans offered to borrowers with damaged credit have sent shocks through financial markets and prompted consumer groups to call for tough mortgage standards. The bill would set licensing standards and a national database for mortgage brokers and others who sell home loans. Loan originators would have to submit to a criminal background check and FBI fingerprinting and loan originators recently convicted of fraud would not qualify under the new licensing standards, according to the legislation. The bill also would require mortgage lenders to weigh a borrower's ability to repay the loan and would restrict penalties against homeowners who refinance out of a high-cost loan. Those two provisions are already integrated into new subprime principles set by bank regulators last month. The bill also earmarks $100 million in federal funds for groups that offer homeownership and rental counseling. The cash would be available from 2008 through 2011 to state and local governments as well as non-profit groups. Separately on Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved $100 million in fresh funds to expand a federal foreclosure prevention program. Bachus's House panel has held several hearings on the subprime mortgage crisis in recent months. Legislation is needed that "maintains the benefits that subprime lending has brought to our citizens while strengthening protections against the abusive practices," Bachus, of Alabama, said in a statement. The bill was co-sponsored by two Ohio Republicans, Paul Gillmor and Deborah Pryce. Rep. Barney Frank, the chairman of the Financial Services Committee, has said he wants to pass legislation to deal with the subprime crisis and predatory lending by year end but has not yet introduced a bill of his own. "We are pleased there is growing bipartisan support for the need for legislation, and we look forward to working with all members on the committee on this issue," said Steven Adamske, a spokesman for the Massachusetts Democrat. Christopher Dodd, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has said he would like to see regulators try to drive out abusive lending practices before he considers legislation. The leading trade association for mortgage brokers on Thursday welcomed Bachus's proposal. "We want bad actors out of out this industry whether they work for a bank, a lender or a mortgage broker," said Roy DeLoach, a top lobbyist for the National Association of Mortgage Brokers.
