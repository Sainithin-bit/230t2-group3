 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales excluding cars increased 0.2 percent in June, as falling gasoline prices curbed overall sales growth, according to data from SpendingPulse released on Thursday. The seasonally adjusted gain was below May's 0.3 percent increase, according to SpendingPulse, the retail data service of MasterCard Advisors, an arm of MasterCard Worldwide ( MA.N ). Retail gasoline prices trended lower in June after reaching a record high of $3.22 a gallon in late May. However, the government said on Monday that regular unleaded gasoline prices averaged $2.98, rising for the first time in six weeks. The protracted housing slump has also hurt demand for furniture and other home-related items, SpendingPulse said. "Anything housing-related was generally negative in June," said Michael McNamara, SpendingPulse's vice president of research and analysis. Retail sales factoring out autos and gasoline, however, rose 0.6 percent after a slim 0.1 percent rise in May. Consumers were reluctant to spend at gasoline stations and at home improvement stores, but were willing to open their wallets at restaurants and fashion shops, McNamara said. SpendingPulse's June reading on "core" retail sales -- which exclude cars, gasoline and building materials -- showed a 0.8 percent jump, improving on a 0.2 percent rise in May. "There may have been some pent-up clothing demand in June. Restaurants also added to sales growth," McNamara said. The SpendingPulse data are derived from the aggregate sales in the MasterCard U.S. payment network, coupled with estimates on all other payment methods including cash and check.
