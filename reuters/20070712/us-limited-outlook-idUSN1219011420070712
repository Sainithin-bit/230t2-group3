 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Limited Brands Inc. ( LTD.N ), owner of the Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works retail chains, said on Thursday it expects sales at stores open at least a year to be flat in July. 

 During July 2006, same-store sales rose 7 percent from a year earlier as customers flocked to Victoria's Secret stores for bras and Pink-brand apparel. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller )
