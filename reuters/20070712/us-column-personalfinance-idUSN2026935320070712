 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Deciding how much to save for retirement and where to invest it is just a small piece of what's called "retirement planning." And it turns out to be the easiest part. 

 The greater challenge is figuring out what to do with your time and your life. Now, 35 years after "What Color Is Your Parachute?" became a best-seller by guiding readers through their "what-to-be-when-I-grow-up" decisions, author Richard Bolles has a sequel aimed at the pre-retired. "What Color Is Your Parachute? For Retirement: Planning Now for the Life You Want" By Bolles and John E. Nelson (2007, Ten Speed Press, $16.95) deals with questions of how to find money and how to find meaning once you've actually quit that day job. Written mostly by Nelson, a retirement planner (retirementwellbeing.com), the book uses probing questions, personality quizzes and philosophical digressions to provoke pre-retirees into serious self-examination. It's a nice complement to the more typical IRA-intensive school of retirement planning. Nelson does devote some time to money, taking a consumerist tone with items like "how to spot retirement hogwash." (Answer: with questions like "What's in it for the marketer?" and "What emotions is this sales pitch designed to trigger?") The investing aspects of the book are basic and don't break new ground, but their emphasis is on forcing readers to give up the idea that more and more money will give them a fulfilling retirement. The book -- the financial parts in particular -- has its limits. Some readers will be put off by the oversimplified and occasionally hackneyed analogies: describing investment portfolios as gardens, for example, or viewing life's choices as decisions between fast food and good home cooking. But pre-retirees who really aren't sure what they want to do may find more to like in the personality and life-style assessments that make up the more interesting parts of the book. Here are some of the highlights: -- What is your philosophy of medicine? Most people just chug along, following (or ignoring) doctors' orders. But this book pushes readers to decide what they really believe about medicine and how to get treatments based on their philosophy. Are they more conventional, putting stock in modern science and high technology, or more alternative, believing that low-tech, intuitive healing might be better? And, do they like higher or lower levels of intervention? Pre-retirees who seriously consider their feelings about those two questions will come away with a better idea of what kind of health-care providers and coverage they should seek in retirement, and what kinds of money they can be expected to spend for it. -- How do you really think about your home? Many pre-retirees spend long hours reading sales literature about planned recreational communities, thinking about downsizing, upsizing or simply staying in their current home. But they may not drill down into the emotions they are attaching to their home, and into the secret roles the home is playing for them. For example, some retirees view their homes as their new jobs, spending all of their time maintaining and caretaking. Others see their house as a museum, carefully curating the items that remind them of great places they've been and things they've done. Homes can also be projects, retreats, community centers, or bases of operations. Once you know what your home really means to you, it will be easier to decide how to live in it, or leave it. The book also offers a list of criteria for deciding where to live next. -- What makes you happy, and what kind of happy are you talking about? The authors posit that retirement happiness comes from three levels of function: pleasant activities, engaging activities and meaningful activities. The fully self-actualized retiree will have all three and will know the difference between happiness that is consumed (and costs big money) and happiness that is planned and created, or "home-cooked," as the authors would say.
