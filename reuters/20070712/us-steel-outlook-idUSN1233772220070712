 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. and global steel markets are poised for medium and long-term growth, two top global steel executives said on Thursday. 

 Lakshmi Mittal, chief executive of ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ) CELR.PA ( MT.N ), and John Surma, chief executive of United States Steel Corp. ( X.N ), told Reuters that demand has been growing for steel in North America and globally. "The medium-term view in North American steel is positive with some reasonable economic growth particularly in industrial activity," Surma said. He said that steel consumption in the United States has been rising at low rates but stressed that the relatively low value of the U.S. dollar coupled with high freight rates have made imports expensive and North American manufacturers very competitive. Surma declined to make short-term predictions about the steel market. Overall, Surma said his outlook for the U.S. economy was "not great, but OK." Mittal said that the U.S. manufacturing base is doing very well and believes the housing industry will see an improvement by the end of this year. He said his outlook for the global steel market was also positive, noting that demand has been growing for steel in Europe, Africa, South America, the Middle East and Asia. He said the European economy has performed much better than expected, citing growth in the 12 countries that have joined the European Union since 2004. "They have created a new dimension in the whole of Europe -- economic conditions in all these countries we see in a positive move," Mittal said. "So the steel outlook there is positive."
