 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co. Inc. ( JCP.N ) said on Thursday June sales at its department stores open at least a year fell a smaller-than-expected 1.5 percent, helped by strong early back-to-school sales, sending shares up 3.3 percent. 

 Analysts expected same-store sales to fall 4 percent, according to a Reuters survey. "They are continuing to be strong. I think you're going to see that growth continue," said Faith Hope Consolo, retail leasing and sales chairman at Prudential Douglas Elliman Retail Leasing. "They've retooled, refreshed and gone forward very strong." Shares of J.C. Penney, which earlier rose as much as 5 percent, were up $2.38 at $73.54 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The Plano, Texas-based company said total department store sales rose 1.4 percent in the five weeks ended July 7, while Internet sales were up 10 percent. Total direct sales decreased 10.9 percent, hurt by softness in its catalog and home categories. Women's and children's apparel and family footwear performed well in June, but fine jewelry and furniture continued to experience soft sales, the company said in a pre-recorded call. Penney reaffirmed its second-quarter outlook of 77 cents a share, below analysts' expectations of 79 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. The company said it expects July comparable department store sales to rise from the low double digits to mid-teens, and its comparable direct sales to be up in the low-single digits.
