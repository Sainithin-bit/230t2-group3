 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc. MAR.N, the top U.S. hotel operator, on Thursday reported an increase in second-quarter profit on higher room rates and robust travel demand. 

 Marriott, which typically manages hotels instead of owning them, said net income rose to $207 million, or 51 cents per share, from $186 million, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.
