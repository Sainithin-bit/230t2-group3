 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc ( HRB.N ), the largest U.S. tax preparer, said on Thursday a New York state judge dismissed much of a lawsuit accusing it of charging excessive fees on individual retirement accounts. 

 In March 2006, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, who has since become the state's governor, accused H&R Block of deceptive marketing of its Express IRA retirement accounts, and assessing fees that in some cases wiped out interest that account holders could earn. Kansas City, Missouri-based H&R Block said State Supreme Court Justice Karla Moskowitz excused the corporate parent and five units from the lawsuit. It said she let stand the portion of the complaint concerning another unit, H&R Block Financial Advisors Inc., but dismissed allegations of common law fraud. H&R Block said it believes the remaining claims lack merit, and that it planned to appeal.
