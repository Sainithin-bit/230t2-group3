 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity firm and hedge fund Fortress Investment Group ( FIG.N ) soon stands to own a harness racing track in central New Jersey and a riverboat casino in Sioux City, Iowa. 

 It's not alone in betting on gaming. The allure of assets like these was once lost on private equity, but a shifting leveraged buyout scene is causing firms to roll the dice on this business. A key reason is that gaming companies have real estate assets that look cheap compared with the office and residential sides of that sector. At the same time, a licensing bottleneck that had restricted gaming buyouts has fallen away. A Fortress-led group announced plans last month to buy Penn National Gaming Inc. ( PENN.O ) for $6 billion -- a 30 percent premium to the casino and racetrack operator's market capitalization at the time. The deal also valued Penn National at nearly 35 times projected 2007 earnings per share, according to Reuters Knowledge -- underscoring enthusiasm in an area private equity used to eschew. Casino operators Boyd Gaming Corp. ( BYD.N ) and Ameristar Casinos Inc. ASCA.O trade at multiples of around 25 times forecast earnings. "Five years ago few private equity firms had an interest in the gaming business," said James Stewart, U.S. head of gaming and leisure at UBS, which advised the board of casino operator Harrah's Entertainment HET.N on a $17 billion buyout announced last October. Times have changed in recent months. Led by the Penn National buyout, announced deals targeting U.S. gaming companies so far in 2007 total $12 billion, up from just $4 billion a year earlier, when no LBOs took place, said research firm Dealogic. This increased activity is raising the profile of a sector that's expected to see U.S. revenue grow an average of 6.7 percent annually through 2011, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers Entertainment & Media Outlook. ATTRACTIVE TO PRIVATE EQUITY One catalyst for the deals is increasing comfort with the regulatory licensing process for gaming facilities. The amount of disclosure required by state licensing boards had been a major deterrent for buyout firms, which once fiercely guarded their privacy. But as firms like Fortress go public themselves, licensing may be less of a concern. "The first hurdle was cleared when people realized being licensed wasn't so bad," said Drew Goldman, Deutsche Bank's managing director of real estate, lodging and gaming. "While it's invasive and requires personal information, it shouldn't prevent investing in the asset class." Private equity groups Apollo Management and TPG Capital TPG.UL were among the first to face an extensive licensing process with the Harrah's buyout. Deutsche advised these buyers and represented Fortress on Penn National as well as Colony Capital on a $5 billion management-led buyout of Station Casinos ( STN.N ) announced in December. Favorable real estate financing has also made gaming companies attractive LBO candidates, said Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Robert LaFleur. "Gaming hasn't historically been looked at as a real estate business," said LaFleur. "Part of its attractiveness to private equity is an emerging view that the significant real estate component involved in this business helps the economics of a privatization." Access to mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, has caused other markets to become more willing to lend to gaming companies. "Real estate financing like CMBS is available to gaming companies," said Stewart of UBS. "This is a relatively new trend, and it's definitely expanded the amount and cost of leverage that can be put against these buildings." 'KNOWING WHO TO WOO' But the dealmaking has reduced the number of targets available for future buyouts. "Ownership is pretty concentrated, so sizable deals from now on are going to be largely determined by principals or families that control most of these companies," said Deutsche's Goldman. "The next hurdle will be convincing the majority owners of the existing gaming companies to ultimately do a deal." Indeed, some companies that may attract private equity are substantially controlled by single groups. The Boyd family, for example, owns more than a third of Boyd Gaming's outstanding shares. Stewart considers this a mixed blessing. "This makes it easier for private equity firms because at least they know who to woo," he said. "But in other ways, it's harder because predicting individual behavior is more difficult than predicting corporate shareholder behavior." And the amount of private capital chasing a finite number of gaming targets could drive prices up to unsustainable levels. "From what I've seen private equity firms are showing discipline about returns and not convincing themselves to do something that doesn't make sense," Goldman said. Casino operator Trump Entertainment Resorts Inc. TRMP.O sent its shares plummeting this month by announcing it could not reach a deal with potential buyers. But Stewart sees a variety of roles for private equity within gaming. Expansion in hot spots like Macau should lead to future consolidation overseas, he said, and private equity may act as a catalyst for strategic deals in the United States.
