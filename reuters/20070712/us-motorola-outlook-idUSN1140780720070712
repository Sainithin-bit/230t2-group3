 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N warned investors of a second-quarter loss on Wednesday and said it no longer expected its mobile phone business to be profitable this year, blaming weak sales in Asia and Europe. 

 The warning came at the end of a day when Motorola shares had risen as much as 3 percent on rumors its chief executive, Ed Zander, could resign amid a campaign by an activist shareholder to oust him. Earlier this year, Zander had withstood pressure from another activist shareholder, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, but Wednesday's profit warning could trigger more speculation that he may be forced out, some analysts said. "He's toast," said Charter Equity Research analyst Ed Snyder. "With this type of performance and the bleak prospects facing the company for the rest of the year ... I don't think Zander's tenure is going to go much further." Motorola, which trails Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) in the mobile phone market, declined to comment on the speculation and did not mention him in the statement. Spokeswoman Jennifer Erickson said Zander remains chairman and CEO and continues to work closely with top management to help restore the profitability of the mobile device business. The company, which also named a new head for its mobile devices unit and postponed its annual analyst meeting, said it would post a second-quarter net loss from continuing operations ranging from 2 cents to 4 cents per share on sales of $8.6 billion to $8.7 billion. It had previously said second-quarter sales would be essentially flat with the first quarter's $9.4 billion. Wall Street, on average, had been looking for a profit of 2 cents per share on revenue of $9.2 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The actual results will be released on July 19. Motorola also backtracked on its previous target for the mobile unit to make a full-year profit, and said its second-quarter operating loss would be wider than in the first quarter. Shortly after Motorola's news, No. 4 mobile phone maker Sony Ericsson, a venture of Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) and Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ), reported its quarterly profit and its average phones sale prices were below analysts' estimates. Motorola said it shipped 35 million to 36 million handsets in the quarter, down from 45.4 million in the first quarter. The fall in shipments could cause Motorola to lose its ranking as No. 2 mobile phone maker to Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ), which is expected by some analysts to have sold 37 million phones in the quarter. "The shipment level was well below I think even the most pessimistic expectations," said Lawrence Harris, an analyst at Oppenheimer who had expected 44 million shipments. "What we need is products. Cost cutting is not sufficient," he added. "If there are no clear signs of a turnaround by year end, we could see additional changes in management." Motorola said Stu Reed, a supply chain executive, would become president of its mobile devices unit. It said Reed would report to Chief Operating Officer Greg Brown. The company also postponed its annual analysts' meeting until September, citing the management changes and other recent business realignments that will lead to new financial reporting segments. The meeting had been expected to take place on July 23. The company did not give additional details. Motorola, which has been criticized for a lack of hit phones since it launched its once-lauded flagship Razr phone in 2004, tends to launch its key upcoming products at the event. Erickson said Motorola would keep unveiling products throughout 2007. Motorola shares fell 1.3 percent in extended trading from their $17.95 close on the New York Stock Exchange. "The only silver lining for the shares at this point would be Zander's resignation. Absent that, the stock is going to trade off pretty hard," said Snyder. "I think people give him (Zander) another six months," said Jane Snorek, a tech analyst at First American Funds in Minneapolis who said she was not surprised by the warning. "Everybody knew they were having a bad quarter." An activist shareholder, Eric Jackson, called for Zander's ouster in a statement published online this week. He became the figurehead for widespread shareholder dissatisfaction at Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) after asking then-CEO Terry Semel to apologize to shareholders at Yahoo's annual meeting in June. A week later, Semel was replaced. Motorola had been criticized for having two people head the mobile unit instead of one, after its previous mobile phone chief resigned earlier this year. One of the two leaders, Terry Vega, left the company for personal reasons, said a Motorola spokeswoman, while the other, Ray Roman, will continue to lead the sales organization. Motorola said its television set-top box and network equipment unit were on track with its expectations. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg  and  Chris Sanders )
