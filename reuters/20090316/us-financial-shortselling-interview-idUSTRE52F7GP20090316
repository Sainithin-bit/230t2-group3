 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Two U.S. senators introduced legislation on Monday aimed at forcing securities regulators to reinstate a rule that was designed to limit short sales of stocks and was repealed two years ago. 

 Democratic Senator Ted Kaufman told Reuters he and Republican Senator Johnny Isakson would offer a bill ordering the Securities and Exchange Commission to act within 60 days to revive the so-called uptick rule and place other restrictions on short sellers. The SEC recently said it may meet next month on the issue but any plan to reinstate the uptick rule would likely be subject to a public comment period with a final rule possibly months away. "I think that there's a general consensus that we should put it back in again," Kaufman said in a telephone interview. "The main idea is to send a message to the SEC to do this." There is some support for reinstituting the rule among key lawmakers in the Senate and the House of Representatives. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank said he believed the SEC would revive it soon and Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd expressed support for such a move. The uptick rule, adopted after the 1929 stock market crash, allowed short sales only when the last sale price was higher than the previous price. The SEC abolished the rule in 2007, after concluding that advances in trading strategies rendered it ineffective. Short-selling is often blamed for precipitous declines in stocks but short-sellers defend their role, saying they prevent shares from becoming overvalued. "I think it will have an effect on the decline in the market," Kaufman said. "But also I think it sends a very clear message that things have changed." STRICT LIMITS ON SHORT SELLING The proposed bipartisan legislation would require the SEC to prohibit short sales that are not made on the increase of a stock price, which would prevent sellers from piling on to drive down the shares, according to Kaufman. Short sellers would also have to give priority to transactions by long sellers of a stock, according to a summary of the legislation. Under the bill, if the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve Board chairman agreed, short sales of financial institutions' securities would be allowed only if they are at least 5 cents higher than the prior transaction. Additionally, Kaufman said that to address the problem of some short sellers failing to deliver securities, the Senate measure would also require a short seller to have the ability to deliver the securities by the required settle date. The legislation would also require short sales to settle within three days, like long sellers, rather than the 13 days they currently have to do so, according to the bill summary. The SEC last year adopted short-term restrictions on short-selling but the measures were judged by some market watchers to have been largely ineffective. Short-sellers borrow stocks they expect will fall in price in the hope of repaying the loans for less and pocketing the difference. (Reporting by Jeremy Pelofsky; Editing by  Bernard Orr )
