 LONDON/PARIS  (Reuters) - Societe Generale defended receiving $12 billion of U.S. taxpayer cash following the bailout of insurer AIG, as European banks showed they were tackling the financial crisis without handing more stakes to governments. 

 The French bank, which headed a list of European lenders that benefited directly from the troubled insurer's rescue, said on Monday that the payment was "fully consistent" with the terms of its business arrangements with AIG. Barclays, which was confirmed on Sunday as also having received cash from American International Group, said is considering the sale of a core part of its fund management arm to boost capital, sending its shares up more than 20 percent. A third beneficiary, Deutsche Bank, said it would not need state aid. Deutsche and Barclays received $11.8 billion and $8.5 billion respectively while SocGen got $11.9 billion, marginally less than the biggest recipient of funds, Goldman Sachs. SocGen said the collateral posted by AIG and the amounts paid out were fully consistent with the terms of its counterparty agreements with the insurer. News that many European banks are receiving billions of dollars has contributed to a backlash in the United States over taxpayer funds going overseas, but the disclosures showed how seriously a potential collapse of AIG was viewed by regulators. U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in an interview with CBS news magazine '60 Minutes' that the failure of AIG would have brought down the financial system. The payments to AIG counterparties included the provision of collateral to back up credit default swaps, a form of financial insurance, and cover on other structured products. BARCLAYS MAY SELL UNIT Individual banks are taking more action to head off potential trouble, and Barclays said it may sell iShares, a fast-growing part of its fund management arm. The unit could fetch up to 5 billion pounds ($7 billion), according to UK press reports, which could pay the costs of its participation in a UK asset protection scheme, analysts said. "If they got a reasonable sum, say north of 3 billion pounds, they could probably participate in the asset protection scheme without raising more capital," said NCB Stockbrokers analyst Simon Willis. By 1136 GMT Barclays shares were up 21 percent at 90.1 pence, outpacing a 4.8 percent rally by the DJ Stoxx European bank index. SocGen shares were up 8 percent and Deutsche Bank added 4.3 percent. Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann said state aid in Germany has helped stabilize markets and helped his bank, which he maintained did not need state aid. Italy's Banco Popolare is to buy out loss-making affiliate Banca Italease, delist the leasing company and then break it up, Popolare and other shareholders said. Shares in Popolare, which last week became Italy's first bank to take government support on offer, fell 5.9 percent on concern it retains a hefty exposure to the leasing firm. Italease's shares jumped 11 percent. HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, said it had no need to raise any more cash once its $17.7 billion rights issue completes, soothing some concern it may need to return for cash. The company's shares rose 4.8 percent. A far-reaching shake-up at UBS looks set to continue as it nominated three new board directors while a newspaper said the Swiss bank plans to cut 5,000 more senior and management jobs in the next few weeks.
