 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some smaller software companies may be compelling acquisition targets, despite depressed stock valuations in the sector, business weekly Barron's reported in its March 16 edition. 

 A large software vendor, like Oracle Corp, could pick up companies like Informatica Corp, JDA Software, Manhattan Associates and Quest Software Inc, Barron's reported. The companies have little or no debt, and even if they are not bought out, their services are useful for companies maintaining and operating their businesses. On the Nasdaq on Friday, shares of Informatica closed at $12.32, JDA Software shares closed at $10.97, Manhattan Associates shares closed at $15.54 and Quest shares closed at $11.89.
