 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - U.S.-based iGate Corp's ( IGTE.O ) bid for fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services SATY.BO will be well short of the current market price, its chief executive told a television channel on Monday. 

 "I mean what we have picked up in terms of the financial, I do believe our bid will be quite a bit south of the 90 cents a share, which is currently the market price of Satyam," Phaneesh Murthy said on CNBC-TV18. At 0514 GMT, Satyam shares were trading 0.2 percent lower at 45.45 rupees rupees (88 cents). iGate is among a clutch of companies that have expressed interest in buying the Indian outsourcer that is battling for survival.
