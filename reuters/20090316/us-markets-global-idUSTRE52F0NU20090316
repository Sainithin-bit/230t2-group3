 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A rally on Wall Street fizzled on Monday after American Expressed said credit card defaults were on the rise, undermining hopes of bank stability that had eased safe-haven buying of gold, debt and the dollar. 

 American Express Co ( AXP.N ) said late in the session that U.S. credit card delinquencies rose to 8.70 percent in February from 8.30 percent the month before as job losses accelerated and the economy deteriorated. Optimism over a semblance of stability in banking shares had lifted stocks around the world for a fifth straight session before the American Express announcement dragged stocks lower. Oil rose more than $1 a barrel as the rally in global equity markets outweighed a decision on Sunday by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to keep production pat and not cut output further. The euro hit a five-week high against the dollar, U.S. and euro zone government debt prices fell and gold slipped as the worldwide equity rally cut the appeal of safe-haven assets. Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ) became the latest bank to say it began 2009 on a strong footing, echoing a refrain heard from the executives of major U.S. banks last week and helping spark on either side of the Atlantic. But investors were skeptical that the flight to safety was over, expressing that view even as U.S. stocks rallied more than 2.0 percent. "The jury is still out on whether we are seeing a dead cat bounce or if the rally in the euro is sustainable," said Matthew Strauss, a senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets in Toronto. The euro was up 0.35 percent at $1.2967, while the dollar was down against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 0.23 percent at 87.053. Against the yen, the dollar was up 0.30 percent at 98.24. Dan Cook, senior analyst at IGM Markets in Chicago, acknowledged the equity rally had fed risk appetite, but doubts remained. "While we've had a good run for a few days, there's still not much good news, so we're vulnerable to a reversal," Cook said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 7.01 points, or 0.10 percent, at 7,216.97. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  fell 2.66 points, or 0.35 percent, at 753.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slid 27.48 points, or 1.92 percent, at 1,404.02. Global stocks as measured by MSCI's all-country world index .MIWD00000PUS rose 1.2 percent, paring gains of more than 2 percent. Citigroup ( C.N ) closed up 30.9 percent, after rising as much as 51 percent during the session. Equity markets had shrugged off more dismal economic data and news that a record $148.9 billion in net overall capital outflows were recorded in January, the U.S. Treasury said. The outflows are a worrying development at a time when the government is rolling out a massive spending plan to break a 14-month recession. But comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on the CBS program "60 Minutes" on Sunday that the U.S. recession could probably come to an end this year and "we'll see recovery beginning next year" overshadowed the news. Shares in Barclays surged almost 23 percent, helping push European shares higher, with the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top shares was up 2.7 percent higher at provisional close at 720.88 points. Investors were still skittish about whether the stock rally can last, said Darren Winder, strategist at Cazenove in London. "I think this is a strong rally, but the corporate and macro newsflow is still quite poor so understandably people are questioning whether we see some retrenchment of these gains," Winder said. "We are probably going to run into some profit-taking in the near term," he said. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 17/32 in price to yield 2.96 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note fell 2/32 in price to yield 1.00 percent. Oil rose after OPEC's move. "We believe OPEC's decision not to cut production is a sign of strength, not weakness, and expect the markets to rally in conjunction with the global equity markets," said Chris Jarvis, senior analyst at Caprock Risk Management in Hampton Falls, New Hampshire. U.S. light crude settled up $1.10 at $47.35 after falling to as low as $43.62 a barrel earlier. London Brent crude, which expires Monday, settled down 95 cents, at $43.98. Gold ended lower as economic optimism and concerns about further consolidation in an overbought market kept bullion investors on the sidelines. U.S. gold futures for April delivery settled down $8.10 at $922.00 an ounce in New York. (Additional reporting by  Ellis Mnyandu ,  Steven C.
