 LONDON  (Reuters) - World oil consumption fell by 1.2 million barrels per day in 2009, the second consecutive annual decline and the largest volume drop since 1982, BP ( BP.L ) said in its annual Statistical Review of World Energy released on Wednesday. The world's oil production dropped by 2 million bpd, or 2.6 percent, which was also the largest decline since 1982, the British oil major said. It said global oil refining capacity additions totaled 2 million bpd last year, with Asia-Pacific accounting for 80 percent of the increase. The world's proven oil reserves stood at 1.33 trillion barrels last year, an increase of 700 million barrels from 2008. The world's gas reserve grew by 2.21 trillion cubic meters last year, while production fell by 2.1 percent, marking the first decline on record, BP said.
