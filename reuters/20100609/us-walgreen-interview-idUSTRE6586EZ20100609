 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ), which CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ) is dropping from its pharmacy benefits management network in a dispute, can make up for any revenue shortfall caused by the split, Walgreen's CEO said, noting that he sees no reconciliation. 

 "We've made our decision -- we certainly didn't take this lightly," Greg Wasson told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. The spat began on Monday when Walgreen said it would not be a provider for any new or renewed drug plans handled by CVS's pharmacy benefits manager, which it said favors CVS pharmacies. CVS responded earlier Wednesday by saying it would remove Walgreen from its pharmacy benefits management network within 30 days. The stocks of both companies fell on concerns that the dispute could hurt their revenues. Walgreen shares finished the day down 2.6 percent to $29.83, while CVS slipped 1.5 percent to $30.67, both on the New York Stock Exchange. Walgreen gets about 7 percent of its revenue from the CVS drug plan business. But Wasson said increased business from its other clients would offset the loss. CVS's pharmacy benefits management (PBM) business administers prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans, as well as a large mail-order pharmacy.
