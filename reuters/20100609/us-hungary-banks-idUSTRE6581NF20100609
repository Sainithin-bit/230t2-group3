 VIENNA/BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - Hungary's mostly foreign-owned banks face pressure on earnings, revenue and asset quality as a new center-right government plans to tax them heavily and take away their main lending growth engine. 

 Hungary's new prime minister, Viktor Orban, vowed on Tuesday to introduce a levy on banks and other financial institutions to fund tax cuts for everybody else, and to ban foreign currency mortgages, the toxic asset of choice for Hungarian banks and borrowers. The banks eventually proved a target too easy to be missed for Orban's populist streak: their profits expanded even while Hungary teetered on the brink of collapse, even though the credit boom they had fueled with cheap foreign currency loans was at least partly to blame for the country's problems. However, Hungary may pay a steep price for the moves because they could tighten already scarce credit even further and weigh on economic growth which has just started to pick up. "A ban on FX loans combined with the new bank tax is likely to hammer credit growth significantly in Hungary in a situation where credit growth is already very lackluster," said Lars Christensen, an economist at Danske Bank. Hungary's biggest bank with roughly a quarter of the market is domestically owned OTP. The next six banks in the pecking order are units of KBC, Erste Group Bank, Intesa Sanpaolo, Raiffeisen International, BayernLB and UniCredit. Shares in the banks geared most toward Hungary -- OTP, Raiffeisen and Erste -- had dropped sharply in the sessions ahead of Orban's announcement, and analysts said the drop had more than anticipated the earnings impact. "This is more than priced in," said Macquarie bank analyst Pedro Fonseca. "The valuations are very eye-opening, I'd certainly use the opportunity to invest in the banks." Erste, KBC and Raiffeisen were all among the top gainers in the FTSEurofirst 300 on Wednesday. OTP retreated slightly after rising on Tuesday. DETAILS SCARCE While details remain scarce, Orban said he would keep the bank tax for three years and aimed to raise 200 billion forints ($1 billion) this year alone. Hungary's banking sector had 306 billion forints in pre-tax profits in 2009. Hungary had originally budgeted for 13 billion forints in bank taxes before the increase. The government expects financial sector profits of some 500 billion forints this year, Orban said. That figure might prove elusive as bank profits last year got an enormous boost from trading profits which are unlikely to be sustainable. Some banks might also find it difficult to meet tighter capital adequacy criteria in the face of dwindling profits, which might force some of them into the red, the chairman of the Hungarian Banking Association said. Orban said he would talk to banks about how to design the levy, which would also apply to insurers and leasing firms, but said the headline amount was not negotiable. On top of this stiff -- albeit temporary -- hit, banks will also have to factor in lower revenue growth as the fx loan ban will make lending more expensive and more difficult to get for borrowers and therefore to further suppress credit demand. Both corporate and retail borrowers in Hungary are heavily addicted to Swiss franc and euro-denominated credit. Banks have been happy to oblige as they earn a higher spread with fx loans and can charge extra fees for the handling. "FX mortgages are one of the most profitable products for the banks, with margins nearly twice as large as in forint mortgages," said Peter Vidlicka of brokerage Wood & Co. "So, the ban will not only slow down new lending but will also reduce net interest margins going forward," he said. The practice has already before Orban's drastic step been on the top of policymakers agendas because it made the country vulnerable and limited its policy options in times of crisis because it could not opt to devaluate out of it. However, while Orban's ban may have a drastic impact on already sluggish credit growth, it will not do much to remove the vulnerability because the loan stock won't go away quickly. Some 70 percent of all existing household loans are denominated in foreign currencies, a big default risk for the banks in the event of a sharp fall in the forint. With a large part of that being mortgages with an average 13 to 14 years to maturity, this stock will decline only very slowly, Hungary's central bank has said. "If there was no more new lending in foreign currency in the future at all ... foreign currency loans would decline by around 13 percent by the end of 2011, and then the decline would decelerate," the central bank said in an April report. ASSET QUALITY Another hit could be in stock for the banks if the bad debt expansion accelerates again rather than slowing down because the new government's measures do not boost growth as hoped, while fiscal tightening holds back the economy. Hungary's central bank expects bad debt to peak this year, but Hungary's banks have been restructuring loans to avoid letting them become non-performing, and if the economy went down again, those restructured loans could eventually go bad. With the exception of domestic banks OTP and FHB, the combined Hungarian impact on its own will be relatively small for the dominant western banks in the country, most of which have a broad portfolio in the region. However, for Austria's Erste and Raiffeisen in particular, Hungary is not the only problem spot. Erste is also the biggest bank in Romania, another IMF-supported country with a fx lending habit, while Raiffeisen has an ailing Ukraine business. Both have their bright spots too -- Erste in the Czech and Slovak republics and Raiffeisen in Russia -- but analysts said banks' portfolio mix would move more into investors' focus. "If you have a good portfolio of operations, profits from the 'good' countries should help offset losses from the underperforming countries," said Stefan Nedialkov, a banking analyst at Citi.
