 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Dynamics Corp. ( GD.N ) said on Wednesday first-quarter profit rose, helped by strong sales of its military vehicles and Gulfstream business jets. 

 The No. 4 Pentagon supplier reported net profit of $434 million, or $1.06 per share, compared with $374 million, or 92 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.
