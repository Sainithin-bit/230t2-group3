 (Reuters) - The Netherlands' largest bank, ABN AMRO AAH.AS, received its second takeover proposal this week on Wednesday, a 72.25 billion euro ($98.6 billion) mix of cash, shares and its own final dividend for 2006. 

 Three banks led by Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ) said their potential deal was worth 39 euros per ABN share, or 13 percent more than an all-share offer from Britain's Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) that ABN agreed to on Monday. Following are some key points from the rival proposals: ** RBS said its consortium, which includes Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) and Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis FOR.BR, would pay about 70 percent in cash, or around 27 euros. The balance would be in RBS shares. The 39 euros value was obtained by including a planned 60 euro cent dividend set to be paid by ABN. ** Barclays offered 3.225 new Barclays shares per ABN share. Like Wednesday's rival proposal, Barclays used ABN's final dividend to boost the value of its offer. ** Barclays says its takeover plan would lead to 3.5 billion euros of annual savings, largely from cutting 23,600 jobs, but analysts have said the RBS-led consortium could extract even more costs and so offer a higher price. Under the RBS proposal, Santander is expected to get ABN's Brazilian and Italian businesses, with RBS taking the wholesale bank and LaSalle. Fortis would take the Dutch business. ** The fly in the ointment for the RBS consortium is a deal signed by ABN on Monday to sell its U.S. bank LaSalle for $21 billion cash to Bank of America ( BAC.N ), a move critics viewed as an attempt to block a competing bid. The RBS group said its proposal was contingent on access to ABN's books and on LaSalle remaining within ABN. The terms of the BoA/LaSalle deal give potential rivals only until May 6 to make a higher bid, which must be in cash and which BoA is allowed to match. "If Bank of America matches there is no further right to terminate the contract for a superior proposal," ABN said on its website. If BoA does not match any higher price it will receive a $200 million break fee from ABN. ** At 0930 GMT, the Barclays offer was worth 34.26 euros, a 6.2 percent discount to ABN's share price of 36.52 euros. The RBS offer was worth just under 39 euros, assuming exactly 70 percent of the purchase price is in cash.
