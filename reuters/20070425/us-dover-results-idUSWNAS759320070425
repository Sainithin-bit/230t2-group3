 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Dover Corp. ( DOV.N ) on Wednesday reported higher quarterly earnings from continuing operations, helped by better-than-expected revenue growth. 

 Profit from continuing operations rose 6 percent to $138.8 million, or 67 cents per share, from $131.3 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 18 percent to $1.78 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 73 cents per share on revenue of $1.72 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Net earnings, including discontinued operations in both periods, fell to $128.9 million, or 63 cents per share, from $203.8 million, or 99 cents per share.
