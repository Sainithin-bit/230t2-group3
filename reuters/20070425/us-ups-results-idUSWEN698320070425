 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Package delivery company United Parcel Service Inc. ( UPS.N ) on Wednesday reported a lower quarterly profit due to a charge related to aging aircraft and voluntary layoff expenses. 

 UPS also reiterated its full-year outlook, saying U.S. economic growth has been softer than anticipated but growth outside the country has been "rapid." The Atlanta-based company reported net income of $1.36 billion, or 78 cents a share, compared with $1.56 billion, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the one-time charges, earnings were 96 cents a share, in line with analysts' average forecast as compiled by Reuters Estimates. UPS reported first-quarter revenue of $11.9 billion, compared with $11.5 billion a year earlier. Analysts had predicted revenue for the quarter of $12.18 billion. "Strong gains in our international package and supply chain and freight businesses helped offset the impact of a slowing U.S. economy," Chief Executive Officer Mike Eskew said in a statement. The company said it expects second-quarter earnings per share in a range of $1.00 to $1.05. Analysts have forecast earnings per share for the quarter of $1.04. UPS also reiterated its full-year forecast for adjusted earnings per share growth in a range of 6 percent to 10 percent. "We will continue to invest aggressively to seize the growth opportunities created by the rise in global trade," Eskew said." In premarket trade UPS shares were down 68 cents or nearly 1 percent at $71.25 from Tuesday's close of $71.93.
