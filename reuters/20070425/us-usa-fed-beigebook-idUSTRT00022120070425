 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Economic growth in much of the United States was modest between the end of February and mid-April, while prices were generally stable, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. 

 "Most Federal Reserve districts noted only modest or moderate expansion in economic activity since the previous report" on March 7, the Fed said in its Beige Book summary of economic conditions. The Beige Book is based on reports by the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. This time it was assembled by the St. Louis Fed with information collected up to April 16, and will be used at the next meeting of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee on May 9. The Beige Book lent support to a U.S. stocks rally, with the Dow average rising above 13,000 for the first time, and the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 hitting multi-year highs. The Fed has acknowledged greater uncertainty in recent weeks about the outlook for both growth and inflation. Over the next two weeks, policy-makers will receive several waves of fresh economic information to consider at their meeting. The Fed will see the government's first estimate of U.S. GDP in the first quarter on Friday, and the April employment report on May 4. Those reports will shed light on how much U.S. economic growth has been hampered by the downtrodden housing market and surprisingly weak business investment. A report on personal income next week should also provide clues about whether inflation outside food and energy prices is moderating from elevated levels as the Fed expects. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Fed Vice Chairman Donald Kohn did not discuss the economy or interest rates in appearances on Wednesday. Bernanke advised high school students to learn the basics of saving and borrowing and to use credit cautiously. Kohn, testifying before a congressional financial services panel, warned against allowing commercial enterprises to offer banking services without expanding regulatory oversight. In the Beige Book, Fed banks reported tight labor markets, especially for skilled workers. Some districts experienced wage increases, modestly higher consumer prices, and higher prices for materials used in production, particularly metals and raw materials. A number of districts noted higher fuel and energy prices. "Consumer prices remained generally stable, with some districts experiencing only modest price increases," the Fed said. "Most districts, however, reported rising prices for inputs and energy." In response to higher prices for materials used to make products, some manufacturers in the Boston, Cleveland, Chicago, and Dallas regions were able to raise prices for goods they sold, the Fed said. At the same time, residential real estate markets and home building continued to decline in many districts, the Fed said. Meanwhile, commercial real estate markets were active and commercial construction expanded. Manufacturing activity remained slow overall, but varied among districts. For example, New York, Richmond, St. Louis and Kansas City reported a weakening among factories in recent months. Meanwhile, Dallas, Minneapolis, and Chicago saw a recent firming of manufacturing. Reports on retail sales in most districts were generally positive, the Fed said.
