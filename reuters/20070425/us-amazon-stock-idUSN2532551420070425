 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Shares of Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) rose as high as 27 percent on Wednesday, the largest gain in more than five years, validating bullish investors' belief that the Internet retailer's spending and its focus on boosting sales over profit would eventually pay off. 

 At least three brokerages -- Citigroup, Cowen & Co. and Piper Jaffray -- raised their ratings on the Seattle-based company, while at least five raised their target price on the stock. Amazon's surge was the biggest one-day advance since November 26, 2001, when the stock jumped more than 34 percent on optimism about that year's holiday shopping season. "The quarter was nothing short of impressive and we believe the results go far in validating our thesis, which is that Amazon is creating the most dominant e-commerce franchise in the world," wrote Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt, who upgraded shares to "buy" in January and has long contended that Wall Street does not take into account Amazon's long-term profit potential. But short sellers also played a part in pushing shares up, anxious to quickly stave off losses, after betting on a decline in Amazon's stock price. In a short sale, investors borrow shares and sell them, banking that the stock price will fall. The goal is to buy them back at a lower price and return them to the broker at a profit. If shares rise, however, they must scramble to buy before they lose even more money. "There is a significant short interest that's definitely a component of this," said Devitt. But, he said, Amazon's lifting the midpoint of its 2007 operating outlook by 17 percent was "an absolute justification for share appreciation." According to Nasdaq data as of April 10, more than 48.5 million shares of Amazon stock were held short, representing about 12 percent of outstanding shares. Short interest in Amazon rose about 4 percent in April from the previous month. THIRD PARTY, NEW CATEGORIES GIVE A BOOST The company on Tuesday posted revenue and earnings that beat Wall Street expectations, while gross profit margins, which have been declining due to intense investment spending in technology, content and marketing, were better than expected. The company also raised its full-year earnings and sales targets. Soleil Securities, which raised its price target to $63 a share from $49 on Wednesday, said that Amazon was emerging from a period of rapid reinvestment and that product and service advances "should contribute to overall profit and valuation improvement." Amazon's spending in recent years has concerned many on Wall Street. The company contends that investments in new product categories, Web services to make its site more user-friendly and digital media offerings will drive consumer loyalty and pay off in the long run. It has also said that the rate of spending will slow in 2007. Cowen & Co. analyst Jim Friedland, who upgraded shares to "neutral" from "underperform," wrote that fundamentals at Amazon had stabilized, due to strong demand, broader inventory and product categories and more sales of third-party goods, which carry higher margins. Citigroup's Mark Mahaney, who upgraded shares to "hold," said that a key part of his earlier "sell" thesis no longer applied to the company: "We thought Amazon had seen the likely end of margin boosts from third party sales ... and we were wrong." Shares rose to a high of $57.18, up 27.8 percent, before settling down 54 cents to $56.64 after Tuesday's close of $44.75 on Nasdaq.
