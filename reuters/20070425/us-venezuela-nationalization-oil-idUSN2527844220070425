 CARACAS  (Reuters) - Venezuela signed agreements on Wednesday with five foreign oil companies to hand over operations of four massive Orinoco heavy oil projects, with ConocoPhillips ( COP.N ) alone failing to sign the accords. 

 Leftist President Hugo Chavez in February decreed that the projects be converted to joint ventures with a majority held by state oil company PDVSA as part of a nationalization drive to advance his self-styled socialist revolution. ConocoPhillips has the heaviest presence of any foreign company in Venezuela's vast Orinoco belt, holding the largest stakes in two of the four projects that can turn tar-like crude into around 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) of synthetic oil. Oil Minister Rafael Ramirez complained about Conoco's negotiating tactics and warned that their refusal to sign a deal meant the U.S. company was less likely than the others to remain in its projects. "They have not understood anything. They'll see," the minister Ramirez told Reuters. "The path of signing this agreement here would have made this issue a lot easier for them," he told reporters. ConocoPhillips CEO James Mulva said during a Wednesday conference call that the company expected to hand operations over by May 1 without problems, but said discussions over future participation in the Orinoco would go on much longer. "In terms of the expropriation, of PDVSA increasing their ownership ... those discussions will continue on for some time beyond the first of May," Mulva said. Officials and company representatives said Wednesday's agreements involved formally starting negotiations over how to transform the existing companies into new joint ventures with a majority held by PDVSA. The ceremony also included agreements for private operators to give PDVSA control over risk sharing agreements signed during the 1990s, though Conoco and Italy's Eni ( ENI.MI ) did not sign these accords either. ORINOCO SHOWDOWN The takeovers pit the fourth-largest oil exporter to the United States against some of the world's largest companies in the struggle for control over four projects valued in total at over $30 billion. Exxon Mobil ( XOM.N ), Chevron ( CVX.N ), Britain's BP Plc ( BP.L ), France's Total ( TOTF.PA ) and Norway's Statoil ( STL.OL ) signed to hand over their operations on May 1 to the OPEC nation. The companies also have until June 26 to negotiate the terms and conditions of the nationalized projects in which they can remain minority partners with state oil company PDVSA holding at least 60 percent stake. Industry analysts say they expect most companies to work out a way of remaining as partners because Orinoco is one of the world's largest reserves and high oil prices allow them to return profits despite occasional harsh treatment by Chavez. The government plans to hold a ceremony with fanfare to mark the operations handover in what Chavez says is Venezuela reclaiming its sovereignty on the day leftists around the world celebrate workers' rights. "See you in the Orinoco May 1," Ramirez told reporters. (Additional reporting by Enrique Andres Pretel)
