 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) said on Wednesday first-quarter profit rose a greater-than-expected 27 percent, helped by higher commercial airplane deliveries, but held its profit forecast unchanged for this year and next, suggesting the extended aerospace boom may be leveling off. 

 Two other top-tier defense contractors, Raytheon and General Dynamics, also posted higher profit, but gave no signs of better-than-expected performance for the rest of the year. Shares of Boeing, the world's biggest-selling commercial plane maker and No. 2 Pentagon supplier, flipped around the unchanged mark, just below the all-time high level they hit last week. Raytheon shares rose slightly while General Dynamics shares fell. "The lack of a guidance increase is likely to disappoint," said Bank of America analyst Robert Stallard in a research note on Boeing. "But we think this is likely to reflect conservatism at this early point of the year." Stallard rates the stock a "buy" with a $110 price target. Raytheon left its full-year profit forecast unchanged, while General Dynamics said it would update its forecasts at the end of the current quarter. BOEING PROFIT UP Boeing, which vies with European rival Airbus for dominance in the jetliner market, reported quarterly profit of $877 million, or $1.13 per share, compared with $692 million, or 88 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. That beat Wall Street's average forecast for earnings of $1.01 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Both Boeing and Airbus, owned by aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ), have enjoyed a two-year spike of plane sales as resurging travel demand has pushed airlines to modernize their fleets. Boeing flew 106 planes to customers in the quarter, up from 98 in the same period last year. The commercial plane unit, which notched record sales last year and outsold Airbus, reported sales rose 7 percent to $7.6 billion. It said its new carbon-composite 787 'Dreamliner' jet -- which now has more than 500 orders -- was still on schedule for its first flight in late August and entry into service next May, although there were still risks of delay as it grapples with weight and schedule issues. Chicago-based Boeing still expects to deliver 440 to 445 commercial planes this year, which would be an increase from last year's 398. Boeing Chief Executive Jim McNerney said airlines were pushing Boeing to build more planes, but it was ramping up production "prudently", to avoid past problems with the supply chain. Boeing's defense unit also posted higher sales, up 7 percent to $7.7 billion, helped by improvements across the board of its military plane, electronic network and logistic support operations. For the full year, Boeing held its forecast for earnings of $4.55 to $4.75 per share, below Wall Street's average forecast of $4.80 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. It also kept its 2008 financial forecasts unchanged. Executives said they would update financial forecasts with second-quarter results in July. Boeing shares were up 47 cents at $94.14 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock, which has more than trebled in the last four years, hit an all-time high of $94.72 last week. DEFENSE FIRMS HOLD STEADY Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ), the No. 5 Pentagon supplier, reported first-quarter profit rose more than expected, but kept its full-year forecast unchanged. The company, known for its Tomahawk missiles, reported quarterly net profit of $346 million, or 76 cents per share, compared with $287 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 69 cents per share, excluding income from its business jet unit that the company sold earlier this year. On that basis, Wall Street was expecting 63 cents per share. For the full year, Raytheon held its forecast for earnings of $2.85 to $3.00 per share. Analysts are expecting $3.01 per share, on average. Its shares rose 26 cents to $54.93 on the  NYSE. General Dynamics Corp. ( GD.N ), the No. 4 Pentagon supplier, also reported higher profit, just ahead of Wall Street estimates, but did not update its forecasts. The company, which makes Abrams tanks and Gulfstream business jets, reported net profit of $434 million, or $1.06 per share, compared with $374 million, or 92 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Wall Street analysts expected earnings of $1.05 per share, on average. The company's chief executive said he would update financial forecasts at the end of the second quarter. General Dynamics' shares fell $1.07 to $79.00 on the NYSE. (Additional reporting by  Chris Reiter )
