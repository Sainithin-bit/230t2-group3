 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Lear Corp. ( LEA.N ), which plans to sell itself to an affiliate of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, posted increased quarterly earnings on Wednesday, supported by strength in its seating unit. 

 Lear, which plans a shareholder vote in June on Icahn's $36-per-share offer, raised its core operating earnings forecast for 2007, citing expected improvements outside North America. Lear shares rose as much as 3.7 percent Wednesday to $36.98. The stock jumped above $40 in early February on investor speculation that Lear might attract a sweeter offer, but shares had slipped below $36 in recent weeks. Icahn is Lear's largest shareholder and some other large shareholders have opposed the buyout as severely undervaluing the Southfield, Michigan-based company. Lear executives said in a conference call with analysts that the company had not received any competing offers at this point and the offer from Icahn remains binding. The results may give shareholders who have opposed Icahn's offer some support for their position, but at first glance may not change many minds, Morningstar analyst John Novak said. Net income rose to $49.9 million, or 64 cents per share, in the first quarter, from $17.9 million, or 26 cents per share, a year earlier. Net sales fell 5.8 percent to $4.41 billion. Analysts on average had expected net sales of $3.99 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "Despite a tough industry environment ... they seem fairly optimistic to make continued improvements through the remainder of the year," Novak said. J.P. Morgan analyst Himanshu Patel said in a note that the results were notably better than the consensus forecasts. Lear sold its European auto interiors business to the International Automotive Components Group joint venture led by billionaire investor Wilbur Ross last year and completed the sale of its North American interiors unit to Ross on March 31. Lear has taken a stake in International Automotive Components in exchange for the interiors businesses and is now focused on seating and electronics. Like many U.S. auto parts makers, Lear has been pressured by North American production cuts by U.S.-based automakers in recent quarters, including some very profitable vehicles. That pressure continued in the first quarter. New business outside North America and improved operations in Europe and Asia, supported the seating business, while lower production in North America, unfavorable pricing and higher copper prices pressured its electronics results, Lear said. Copper prices jumped 17 percent, but commodities costs were about neutral overall in the quarter, Lear said. Lear said it now expects core operating earnings ranging from $580 million to $620 million in 2007, up from a $560 million to $600 million prior forecast. The figure represents income before interest, other expense, taxes, restructuring costs and other special items. Lear cut its full-year 2007 net sales outlook excluding the divested interiors unit to about $14.8 billion, from about $15 billion previously. Analysts have expected $15.25 billion. Lear shares were up 94 cents, or 2.64 percent, at $36.60 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
