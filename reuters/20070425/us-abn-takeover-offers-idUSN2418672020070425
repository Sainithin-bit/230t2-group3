 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dutch takeover target ABN AMRO AAH.AS said it would consider a superior proposal to its roughly $87 billion takeover by British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) -- but that it has no responsibility to actively solicit a rival offer. 

 In a U.S. regulatory filing on Tuesday about the Barclays deal, ABN said in a "Q&A" document that a consortium including Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) and Spain's Santander ( SAN.MC ) has not made an offer and it is unclear if it will. "We have agreed to a specific transaction with significant upside potential for our shareholders and manageable execution risk to one that is yet unspecific, uncertain and will probably include very high execution risks," ABN said. To a question asking why ABN announced a deal with Barclays despite interest from the RBS consortium, ABN said: "If they decide to present us with a concrete and competitive offer, we will consider their proposal, in line with our responsibilities." Asked if it would give other banks a fair chance if they are willing to bid more, ABN said it would assess any serious bid on its merits, taking into account not only the price, but also execution risk, vision, strategy and business model. To another question on whether ABN is under responsibilities to solicit higher bids, ABN said: "We are not under responsibilities to actively solicit bids. However, if we receive a superior proposal that potentially delivers greater value ... than the Barclays proposal, we will consider it." The Dutch bank added: "We see no need to solicit other bidders." COMPROMISE? ABN also answered a question asking if the Barclays agreement is a "friendly compromise between the companies" that may not be the best outcome for shareholders, and if factors like choice of regulator, head office location and management composition played a more important role than price. The Dutch bank replied that it was merging with Barclays to create value for ABN and its shareholders and that "this includes choosing the most favorable elements of the combined structure going forward." ABN was not available to further explain the filing. Meanwhile, the Dutch bank is set to give more details on how a side-deal to sell its U.S. retail bank, LaSalle, can be terminated, sources close to the matter said on Tuesday. ABN and Barclays agreed an all-share deal that values the Dutch bank at about 64 billion euros ($86.8 billion), after a 3 percent fall in Barclays shares cut the deal's value. ABN said it will sell LaSalle to Bank of America ( BAC.N ) for $21 billion. ABN said on Monday a break fee is payable to Bank of America "if the agreement is terminated under certain limited circumstances". Some ABN investors have urged the Dutch bank's management to give more details on the circumstances under which the deal, subject to a $200 million break fee, can be nullified. The bank plans to announce more details as early as later on Tuesday, including a breakdown of LaSalle's valuation and more details on conditions required for a successful rival bid for the Chicago-based bank. Analysts said the move to sell LaSalle appeared to be partly a poison pill to prevent a hostile approach, as LaSalle is the asset that Royal Bank of Scotland most wants. The takeover of ABN by Barclays, announced on Monday, would be the world's biggest bank deal, and the threat of a counter-offer from the RBS consortium hinges on whether it can unravel the planned LaSalle sale, investors and bankers said.
