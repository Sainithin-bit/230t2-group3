 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) on Wednesday reported a 16 percent rise in quarterly profit, topping Wall Street estimates, as strong sales of its Frito Lay snacks helped offset weakness in its North American soft drink business. 

 The world's No. 2 soft drink company said net income for the first quarter increased to $1.10 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $947 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 61 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Pepsi's diverse portfolio -- which includes Gatorade sports drinks, SoBe energy drinks, Lay's potato chips, Quaker Oatmeal and Rice-A-Roni side dishes -- has helped it withstand an industrywide slowdown in soft drinks due to growing health consciousness. Rival Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ), by contrast, has relied on its presence around the world, especially in emerging markets, where consumers still eagerly consume soft drinks. Pepsi's quarterly net revenue rose 9 percent to $7.35 billion from $6.72 billion, helped by strong sales in the company's international division. PepsiCo, based in Purchase, New York, affirmed its outlook for the full year, saying it expects earnings per share of at least $3.30, cash from operations of at least $7 billion and net capital spending of $2.6 billion. Analysts on average are expecting $3.32 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $37.88 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
