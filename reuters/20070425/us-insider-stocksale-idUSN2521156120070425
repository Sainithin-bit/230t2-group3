 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Insiders at six companies sold stock last quarter before the companies warned they would miss their financial forecasts, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Wednesday. 

 Representatives at the companies -- Administaff Inc. ASF.N, Nautilus Inc. ( NLS.N ), Packeteer Inc. PKTR.O, Keithley Instruments Inc. KEI.N, Cutera Inc. ( CUTR.O ) and Power-One Inc. PWER.O -- could not immediately be reached for comment. But the Journal cited representatives of Administaff, Nautilus and Packeteer as saying executives sold shares before events that caused revisions to the forecasts. The paper also said the chief financial officer of Keithley declined to discuss the matter with it. The general counsel of Cutera said the company had a robust compliance program to prevent improprieties, the Journal reported. At Power-One, the paper cited a representative and disclosure statements as saying sale of shares during the period by the company's chairman were planned long before they were executed.
