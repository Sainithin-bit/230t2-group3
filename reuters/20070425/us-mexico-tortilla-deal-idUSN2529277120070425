 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - Mexico's government renewed a deal with producers and retailers on Wednesday to limit the price of tortillas and corn flour to try to control inflation and placate angry consumers. 

 Many retailers agreed to keep tortilla prices at 8.50 pesos ($0.77) per kilogram, with producers committing to hold the price of corn flour, the main ingredient in tortillas, at 5 pesos per kilogram. Economy Minister Eduardo Sojo told reporters the renewed accord would last until August 15.
