 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said at a congressional hearing on Wednesday that criminal charges may result from his widening investigation into conflicts of interest in the student loan industry. 

 Cuomo told the U.S. House of Representatives Education and Labor Committee that his inquiry has found two main problem areas -- improper links between colleges and banks that lend money to students; and improper links between individual financial aid officers and lending banks. In a handful of cases involving individual financial aid officers, Cuomo said, misconduct may be more serious than violations of consumer protection laws. "There is a potential for criminal charges," he said.
