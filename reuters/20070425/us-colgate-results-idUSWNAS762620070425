 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) posted a higher first-quarter profit on Wednesday, driven by strong sales of products such as Colgate Total toothpaste, and said Reuben Mark would step down as chief executive on July 1. 

 Mark, who has been CEO since 1984, said last year that he planned to hand over the CEO post to President and Chief Operating Officer Ian Cook in mid-2007. Colgate said Mark will stay on as chairman for up to 18 months after relinquishing the CEO role. The board plans to elect Cook as CEO when Mark retires from that post. Profit was $486.6 million, or 89 cents per share, compared with a profit of $324.5 million, or 59 cents per share, a year earlier. Results in the latest quarter include an after-tax charge of $8.2 million related to recall of certain Hill's Pet Nutrition cat food manufactured by Menu Foods MEW_u.TO. The results also include an after-tax gain of $29.7 million from the sale of most of the Latin America household bleach business to Clorox Co. ( CLX.N ), which was offset by restructuring charges. Excluding charges and other items, Colgate earned $421.1 million, or 77 cents per share, up from $371.3 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier. Those results matched analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 12 percent to $3.21 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $3.12 billion. Cook said in a statement that Colgate still expects to post double-digit earnings-per-share growth for the year, excluding restructuring charges and other items. Shares of Colgate, whose brands include Ajax, Palmolive and Softsoap, rose almost 2.4 percent during the quarter, outpacing shares of larger rival Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ), which declined 1.7 percent.
