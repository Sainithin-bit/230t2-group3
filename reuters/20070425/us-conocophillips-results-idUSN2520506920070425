 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips' ( COP.N ) first-quarter profit rose nearly 8 percent as one-time gains from asset sales outweighed lower crude oil prices, the third- largest U.S. oil company said on Wednesday. 

 Net income rose to $3.55 billion, or $2.12 a share, from $3.29 billion, or $2.34 a share, last year. Excluding gains of 29 cents a share from the asset sales, the company posted earnings of $1.83 a share in the quarter. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn $1.90 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company is in the middle of an effort started last year to sell off nonstrategic assets. "Their results came in a little bit behind consensus and very slightly behind what I was expecting," said James Halloran, an analyst with National City Private Client Group. "They made a ton of money from refining and marketing. Still, I thought they should have done a teeny bit better than they did. And their production volumes were just a teeny bit light," he said. Earnings at ConocoPhillips' refining and marketing unit more than tripled from last year to $1.14 billion. But the company's refining margins were not as strong as expected, because it paid higher prices for oil at its refineries than benchmark U.S. crude prices indicated. The Houston-based company said profits at its exploration and production business rose to $2.33 billion from $2.09 billion last year, as gains of $355 million from asset sales offset lower crude oil prices. Oil prices dropped sharply at the beginning of the quarter as geopolitical tensions seemed to ease, but renewed friction with Iran as well as concerns about gasoline supplies have pushed prices back up. ConocoPhillips' average price of crude oil fell 5.7 percent to $53.38 per barrel. Its average gas price fell about 12 percent to $6.35 per thousand cubic feet. Total revenue in the quarter fell more than 10 percent to $42.87 billion. VENEZUELA HEATS UP Also on Wednesday, Venezuela's oil minister threatened to seize ConocoPhillips operations next week after the company declined to sign an agreement to start formal talks over a planned state takeover of its assets in the country's vast Orinoco oil reserve. All the other foreign oil companies with projects in the Orinoco region signed the agreements, Venezuela said. The country has vowed to strip the six foreign companies -- including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), Chevron Corp. ( CVX.N ) and BP Plc ( BP.L ) -- of majority ownership in the projects. ConocoPhillips has stakes in three major oil projects in Venezuela, two of which are in the Orinoco region, and has long been in informal talks with the Venezuelan government. While not specifically addressing Venezuela's threat, ConocoPhillips Chief Executive James Mulva said the company plans to hand over operation of its Orinoco assets to Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA on May 1. "But in terms of the expropriation of PDVSA increasing their ownership to 60 percent, those discussions will continue on for some time beyond the first of May, as well as what are the terms and conditions going forward in those projects," he said on a conference call. The company said it produced 2.47 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, including 445,000 boepd from its stake in Russia's LUKOIL( LKOH.MM ). Excluding the LUKOIL stake, production rose about 25 percent from the year-earlier quarter, but dipped slightly from the fourth quarter of 2006. The company expects second quarter production to be lower due to scheduled maintenance, seasonal dips in Alaska, its exit from operations in Dubai and asset sales. It said it is on track to complete the asset sales by the end of the year, generating a total of $3 billion to $4 billion in profits over the course of the program. ConocoPhillips shares rose $1.40, or 2 percent, to $71.04 in New York Stock Exchange trading on Wednesday afternoon. Since the beginning of the year, ConocoPhillips shares are down 1.2 percent, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX, which rose about 7 percent in the same period.
