 TOULOUSE, France  (Reuters) - Airbus workers at the planemaker's French headquarters disrupted assembly on Wednesday evening over plans to abandon a discretionary profit-sharing scheme due to company losses in 2006, unions said. 

 Union officials compared the decision to an 8.5 million euro pay-off awarded to Noel Forgeard after he was fired as co-chief executive of parent EADS ( EAD.PA ) last summer. Airbus is in turmoil after delays to the A380 superjumbo and the on-off development of the A350 worsened cash-flow problems initially caused by a sharp fall in the value of the dollar. Forgeard lost his job over the A380 crisis in July, but the terms of his departure remained confidential until two weeks ago when they erupted into France's election campaign, already overshadowed by 10,000 planned job cuts at the planemaker. Airbus lost 572 million euros in 2006. Xavier Petrachi, an official with the CGT union, said Airbus had told French employees discretionary profit-sharing had been abolished for 2006 and that workers would receive an average of 5 euros each under a separate mandatory participation plan. "We've had enough. Especially when you know that Noel Forgeard left with 8.5 million euros after driving Airbus into the red," he told Reuters. Unions said the strike had begun at 1600 GMT and that so far no time had been set for it to end. It was not immediately clear how many workers had participated. Airbus was not available for comment. The dispute over wages comes amid a disagreement over dividends for shareholders and management-backed plans for a capital increase. The French government and both remaining candidates for the country's presidency oppose calls by German shareholder DaimlerChrysler for an EADS dividend, fearing it would send a damaging political signal in the wake of job cuts. The government owns 15 percent of Airbus. EADS shareholders are due to meet on May 4, the last day of campaigning for the May 6 run-off in the French election.
