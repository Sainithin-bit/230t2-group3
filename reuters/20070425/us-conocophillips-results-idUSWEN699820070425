 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips' ( COP.N ) first-quarter profit rose as one-time gains from asset sales outweighed lower crude oil prices, the third-largest U.S. oil company said on Wednesday. 

 Net income rose to $3.55 billion, or $2.12 a share, from $3.29 billion, or $2.34 a share, last year. The company said the asset sales added about 29 cents per share in this year's quarter. Total revenue in the quarter fell more than 10 percent to $42.87 billion. Oil prices dropped sharply at the beginning of the quarter as geopolitical tensions seemed to ease, but renewed friction with Iran as well as concerns about gasoline supplies have pushed prices back up. The average price of U.S. crude CLc1 was around $58 for the quarter -- about $5, or 8 percent, lower than year-earlier levels. The Houston company said it produced 2.47 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the quarter, including 450,000 boepd from its stake in Russia's Lukoil. ( LKOH.MM ) Excluding the Lukoil stake, the company's production rose about 25 percent from the year-earlier quarter, but dipped slightly from the fourth quarter of 2006. Since the beginning of the year, ConocoPhillips shares are down 3.2 percent, underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX, which rose 4.6 percent in the same period. ConocoPhillips shares closed at $69.64 on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
