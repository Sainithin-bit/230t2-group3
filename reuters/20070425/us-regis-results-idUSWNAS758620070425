 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hair salon operator Regis Corp. ( RGS.N ) on Wednesday reported lower quarterly net profit as it took a $19.6 million charge for its beauty school operations. 

 Regis, which owns the Vidal Sassoon, Supercuts and Jean Louis David chains, said net income in the third quarter ended on March 31 fell to $5.3 million or 12 cents a share, from $18.6 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding the charge for merging its beauty schools with Empire Education Group, earnings in the latest period were 55 cents per share, a penny over the analysts' average estimate.
