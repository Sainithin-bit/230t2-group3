 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Raytheon Co. ( RTN.N ) said on Wednesday that first-quarter profit rose, beating Wall Street forecasts, on higher sales of its missiles and electronic network systems. It kept its full-year forecast unchanged. 

 The company, which is the No. 5 Pentagon supplier, reported quarterly net profit of $346 million, or 76 cents per share, compared with $287 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations were 69 cents per share, excluding income from a business jet unit that the company sold earlier this year. On that basis, Wall Street was expecting 63 cents per share. Sales rose 6 percent to $4.9 billion, in line with the analysts' average estimate. For the full year, Raytheon held its forecast for earnings of $2.85 to $3.00 per share. Analysts are expecting $3.01 per share, on average.
