 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ) on Wednesday reported a 16 percent rise in quarterly profit, topping Wall Street estimates, on lower corporate expenses, a lower tax rate and strong international sales of snacks and beverages. 

 The world's No. 2 soft drink company, which affirmed its full-year earnings outlook, also said it was eyeing several tuck-in acquisitions for this year. "We have the richest acquisition pipeline I've seen," said Chief Executive Indra Nooyi on a conference call. "They range in size from $5 (million) or $10 million ... to businesses that if they pan out, could run a couple of billion dollars." Nooyi said the company usually only acquires one out of every 10 or 20 it considers, but this year it should be more aggressive, since the targets it is considering are "uniquely suited" to Pepsi's strengths. The company, whose recent acquisitions include Stacy's Pita Chips, Izze Beverage Co., and Naked Juice, said net income for the first quarter rose to $1.10 billion, or 65 cents per share, from $947 million, or 56 cents per share, a year earlier. The results handily beat analysts' 61 cent consensus estimate, according to Reuters Estimates. Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said underlying profit growth added just under 1 cent per share to the earnings beat, while lower expense and a lower tax rate each contributed just under 2 cents per share. It was an "overall strong quality quarter even after excluding the benefits of lower tax rate and lower expense," Pecoriello wrote in a research note. "International was the star." Pepsi, which is based in Purchase, New York, said quarterly net revenue rose 9 percent to $7.35 billion, as the international unit's revenue rose 19 percent. Pepsi's diverse portfolio -- which includes Gatorade sports drinks, Quaker Oatmeal and Frito Lay snacks -- has helped it withstand an industrywide slowdown in soft drinks due to growing health consciousness, whereas Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) has relied on its presence around the world, especially in emerging markets where people still eagerly drink soft drinks. But in the latest quarter Pepsi's international segment had a 13 percent increase in sales volume of snacks, helped by acquisitions and strength in Russia, Venezuela, South Africa and Turkey. International beverage volume grew 7 percent. "We believe that PepsiCo is only at the cusp of its international opportunity," said UBS analyst Kaumil Gajrawala. He noted that Pepsi only derives 27 percent of its profits from overseas, compared to 80 percent for Coca-Cola. "Moreover with steady profit stream from Frito and a big piece of investment spending (at the domestic beverage business) ending last quarter, we expect steady growth in the domestic base business as well," Gajrawala said in a research note. In North America, higher sales of oatmeal helped the Quaker Foods segment see volume and revenue each rise 5 percent. Frito Lay volume rose 3.5 percent, driven by strength of Doritos and SunChips, the company said. The North American beverage business, which was a sore spot for Coke, which reported earnings last week, saw volume rise 1 percent, driven by higher sales of noncarbonated drinks such as Aquafina water and Lipton tea. Morgan Stanley's Pecoriello said he had been expecting a 1 percent decline in volume. "Given the strength our first quarter we're feeling much more confident in that outlook," said PepsiCo Chief Financial Officer Richard Goodman, affirming the company's prior forecast for 2007 earnings per share of at least $3.30, cash from operations of at least $7 billion and net capital spending of $2.6 billion. Analysts on average are expecting $3.32 per share, excluding items, on revenue of $37.88 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Pepsi shares, which rose 45 cents to $66.86, are trading at 20 times expected earnings for the current fiscal year, a slight premium to Coke shares, which have a trading multiple of 19.9 times. Kraft, the largest U.S. food company, trades at 18.6 times expected earnings.
