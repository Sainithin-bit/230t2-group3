 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Sales of new U.S. homes rose 2.6 percent in March but fell short of the pace expected by analysts while the number of new homes for sale was little changed, according to a government report on Wednesday. 

 New single-family home sales rose to an annual rate of 858,000 units from a revised rate of 836,000 in February, the Commerce Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting March sales to rise to 888,000 from the previously reported rate of 848,000 units in February. In March, the median sales price of a new home rose $2,200 to $254,000 from $251,800 in February. There were 545,000 new homes for sale in March, slightly more than the 544,000 reported in February. It would take 7.8 months to clear that inventory at the current sales pace, slightly less than the 8.1 months recorded in February. The Commerce Department's data comes a day after a real estate trade group reported a weaker-than-expected month of existing homes sales. The sales pace of existing homes dropped 8.4 percent in March, the biggest tumble in more than 18 years, the National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday. Home resales, which represent 85 percent of the housing market, fell to an annualized 6.12 million units. Across the regions, the Northeast saw a 50 percent increase in new home sales in March while the Midwest recorded a more modest 9.8 percent increase. The South and West both saw slight decreases in sales of 2.7 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.
