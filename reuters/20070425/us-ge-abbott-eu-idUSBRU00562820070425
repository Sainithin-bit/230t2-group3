 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - U.S. conglomerate General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) won permission on Wednesday from the European Commission to buy two of Abbott Laboratories Inc.'s ( ABT.N ) diagnostics business units for $8.13 billion in cash. 

 "After careful examination, the Commission concluded that the transaction would not significantly impede effective competition in the European Economic Area (EEA) or any substantial part of it," the Commission said in a statement. GE said it would buy Abbott's primary in-vitro diagnostics, which involve routine laboratory tests, and its Point-of-Care diagnostics business -- tests done typically at a patient's bedside such as blood chemistry work. Abbott's more profitable molecular diagnostics business, including sophisticated tests for bladder cancer and susceptibility to breast cancer, and its lucrative diabetes-care businesses, are not part of the transaction.
