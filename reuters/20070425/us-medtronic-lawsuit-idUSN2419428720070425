 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc. ( MDT.N ) said on Tuesday that it would appeal a U.S. district court ruling that the medical device maker is liable for its use of certain stent patents. 

 The court ruling completes the liability phase of a patent infringement case filed against Medtronic by a unit of Guidant Corp. that is now owned by Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ). The damages phase of the case has yet to be conducted. Medtronic said the decision has no bearing on the ongoing reexamination of the so-called Lau patents by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. In February 2006, the patent office granted Medtronic's request for reexamination for each of the four patents and is now reconsidering whether they should have been granted in the first place, the company said.
