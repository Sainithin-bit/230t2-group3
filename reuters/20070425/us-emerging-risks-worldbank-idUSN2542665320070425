 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Emerging economies are now less vulnerable to financial crisis, but one should not minimize risks stemming from fast-growing, hard-to-monitor local and derivative markets, a World Bank senior official said on Wednesday. 

 Global financial conditions are expected to become less favorable in coming years as the world's economy slows down and interest rates rise, increasing concerns about the health of the weakest market players, said Uri Dadush, director of the World Bank's International Trade Department. "So where are the weak players?" he asked, adding that domestic debt markets and recently created derivatives instruments carry potential risks due to the lack of reliable data to gauge investors' exposure to them. "We do not have reliable statistics because it's a relative new phenomenon that foreign investors go and buy domestic debt in very poor countries," he told a New York conference about BRIC countries: Brazil, Russia, India and China. "Investors get a very nice yield, I'm sure there is a lot of carry trade going on, but we don't have the capacity to monitor these flows." In a carry trade, an investor borrows in a currency with a low interest rate in order to invest in currencies with higher yields. The role of hedge funds in local markets is increasingly important, but those funds remain relatively unregulated, the director said. "We don't know everything they are doing." Dadush also mentioned potential risks in credit default swaps, insurance-like instruments sold by commercial banks to protect creditors in the event of a debt default. "These are relatively new instruments and they may be solid but they have never been tested." According to the director, the new risks combine with the "traditional vulnerability" of emerging markets. "There are many reasons to say that emerging markets are in a better shape now than five, 10 years ago," Dadush said. "But these remain relatively less developed, less diversified economies, and many of them are commodity dependents," he warned, adding that, from his experience with the Asian crisis in 1997, he learned "never to stand up to say that a financial crisis is not coming."
