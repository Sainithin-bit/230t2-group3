 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wireless technology and chip developer Qualcomm Inc ( QCOM.O ) on Wednesday posted higher quarterly profit and revenue and raised its estimate for full-year earnings on strong demand for its chips for mobile phones with high-speed Internet connections. 

 Analysts said they were impressed Qualcomm was able to boost its outlook even as it said it would not be able to record royalty payments from Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ), the leading mobile phone maker, due to disputes over technology licensing. Qualcomm said it raised its full-year earnings-per-share outlook to a range of $1.84 to $1.88, excluding its investment arm, from its previous target of $1.72 to $1.77. It lifted its forecast for full-year revenue to a range of $8.4 billion to $8.7 billion from its earlier target of $8.1 billion to $8.6 billion. "They've upped their guidance even without Nokia, so that's a very strong quarter," said Charter Equity analyst Ed Snyder. Qualcomm said its net profit for the fiscal second quarter ended April 1 rose to $726 million, or 43 cents a share, from $593 million, or 34 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding its investment arm and other items, Qualcomm said its profit was 50 cents a share, just above its forecast last month for earnings per share of 48 cents to 49 cents. Qualcomm revenue rose to $2.22 billion from $1.83 billion a year ago, also slightly above its forecast range, $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. The results also bettered analysts' average forecasts of earnings of 48 cents per share and revenue of $2.19 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. "It just proved to be a quarter with a bit more demand than we expected," Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer William Keitel said in a phone interview with Reuters. He said demand was particularly strong for chips used in advanced phones. Rival chip maker Texas Instruments Inc TXN.N also cited a pick-up in demand for high-tech phones in its quarterly report earlier this week. Qualcomm shares rose to $45.80 in after-hours trading from their close of $45.33 on Nasdaq on Wednesday. NO NOKIA ROYALTIES The company said its forecast excluded expected royalty payments from Nokia of 4 cents per share to 5 cents per share for shipments in the quarter ending in June, which would have been recorded in its fourth quarter ending in September. Qualcomm is the dominant provider of chips for CDMA, the most widely used mobile-phone technology in the United States, and sells licenses and chips for W-CDMA, a high-speed wireless cell-phone technology that is gaining popularity. Qualcomm forecast third-quarter net earnings of 43 cents to 45 cents per share on revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.3 billion. It said the target includes $30 million in back-payments of royalty fees from Sony Ericsson, due to an arbitration decision in its favor related to phones sold from 2004 through the first quarter of 2006. Sony Ericsson is the phone venture of Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) and Ericsson ( ERICb.ST ). While Qualcomm is seen as a key beneficiary of rising demand for advanced cell phones, its shares have fallen 15 percent from their May 2006 year high on investor uncertainty about its legal battles. The potentially costly stand-off with Nokia over a technology license contract that expired earlier this month has been a key concern. Oppenheimer analyst Lawrence Harris said Qualcomm executives showed they were "assuming they're not going to reach an agreement with Nokia" by leaving Nokia royalties out of the outlook. "It's a sign of strength, the fact the company is being able to offset this impact in the September quarter through demand for its products," he said.
