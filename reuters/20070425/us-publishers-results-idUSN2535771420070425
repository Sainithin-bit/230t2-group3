 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - E.W. Scripps Co. said on Wednesday quarterly profit dropped with weak newspaper advertising and a loss for its Internet business, while magazine company Meredith Corp. posted revenue below Wall Street forecasts, sending both their stocks lower. 

 Scripps ( SSP.N ) shares fell as much as 6 percent while Meredith ( MDP.N ) shed 3 percent as both companies also forecast future earnings that fell short of analyst expectations. The results highlighted areas of media industry weakness -- declining newspaper advertising, lukewarm broadcast television growth and a surprising challenge to some Internet businesses. Scripps cable networks HGTV and the Food Network helped buoy results with double-digit growth, but newspaper and television station revenue fell and the company's Internet businesses posted a loss as they invested in beefing up sites. "If it weren't for the networks, it would have been a disaster," Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino said. "They had a huge collapse in the Internet business." Meredith defied some of the trends troubling other U.S. publishers with strong growth for its Family Circle and Better Homes and Gardens titles, but its view on broadcast group sales disappointed analysts' expectations. Scripps said first-quarter net income was $68.5 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with $75.1 million, or 45 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Income from continuing operations was 39 cents a share, compared with 49 cents a year earlier. Revenue grew 2 percent to $601.4 million. Analysts on average had forecast earnings per share of 36 cents, before special items, on revenue of $609.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates. "It looks like quite a meltdown in the interactive segments as increased competition in the online price comparison space and lower energy costs in the UK wreak havoc on Shopzilla and uSwitch," Morgan Stanley analyst Lisa Monaco wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday. Shopzilla is a Web site that lets shoppers compare prices that different sellers offer for the items they want to buy. USwitch, which operates in the United Kingdom, lets customers compare prices for electricity, gas and other utilities services. Scripps also forecast second-quarter earnings that would fall short of analysts' estimates. The company expects second-quarter earnings from continuing operations of 58 cents per share to 62 cents per share, down from 64 cents a year ago. Advertising at Scripps's papers was weak, particularly in Florida. A year without Olympic broadcasts or political ads for its television stations also weighed on results. Meredith said fiscal third quarter net income rose to $45.3 million, or 92 cents a share, from $40.6 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings excluding a one-time tax benefit totaled 88 cents per share, in line with analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 3.8 percent to $409.8 million, below Street expectations for $423.8 million. The company said it expects to meet its full-year forecast, but its fourth-quarter forecast of $1.04 a share fell short of analysts' estimates by 2 cents. "TV pacings (early indications of advertising) are running down in the mid- to high-single digits, below our mid-single-digit growth forecast," Citigroup analyst William Bird wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday, referring to early indications of television ad sales. Meredith shares fell $1.71 to $58.15 on the New York Stock Exchange. Scripps shares fell $1.71 to $43.44 after dropping as low as $42.
