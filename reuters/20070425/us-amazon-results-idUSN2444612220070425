 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Online retailer Amazon.com ( AMZN.O ) said quarterly net profit more than doubled, helped by a lower tax rate and robust sales, and raised its earnings and sales outlook for the year. 

 Its shares rose nearly 12 percent after hours on Tuesday as Amazon's gross profit margin decline was not as steep as expected, allaying some investor worries about declining margins amid increased investment spending. Analysts Aaron Kessler of Piper Jaffray and Martin Pyykkonen of Global Crown Capital said they were encouraged by the better-than-expected gross margins. Although the margins declined, the drop was not as big as in prior quarters. Amazon Chief Financial Officer Tom Szkutak told analysts that revenue growth, lower cost of goods sold and higher third-party sales drove that improvement. "The question is, can that (gross margin) get better over the next several quarters?" asked Pyykkonen. Net profit rose to $111 million, or 26 cents per share, in the first quarter from $51 million, or 12 cents per share, a year ago. Total sales rose 32 percent to $3.02 billion from $2.28 billion. The results beat both Wall Street's and Amazon's own sales and profit expectations. Analysts, on average, had been expecting earnings of 15 cents per share on sales of $2.92 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Szkutak said the growth rate for Amazon's technology and content spending in 2007 would be "significantly lower" than in 2006. Sales of electronics and general merchandise rose 48 percent in the quarter, while Amazon's media category rose 26 percent. SALES, RAISING ESTIMATES Amazon, which began as an online seller of books, has been beefing up its offerings in new digital media such as downloadable movies. Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said a new division that lets businesses rent computing and other Web services on demand is showing "excellent early traction" and that the market could be "potentially very large." The quarter's tax rate was 23 percent compared with 47 percent a year earlier. Operating income rose 38 percent to $145 million, well above the company's estimate of $82 million to $122 million. Amazon raised its operating income expectations for the year to between $463 million and $593 million, from an earlier range of $355 million to $505 million Amazon also raised its 2007 revenue outlook to $13.5 billion to $14 billion from an earlier range of $13 billion to $13.7 billion. Analysts, on average, have been expecting revenue of $13.39 billion. For the second quarter, Amazon said it expects net sales of $2.7 billion to $2.85 billion, which compared with an average analyst view of $2.69 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating income is forecast to be between $65 million and $105 million. Amazon also said its board authorized a buyback of up to $500 million of common stock within the next two years. Amazon shares trade at 48.4 times expected fiscal 2008 earnings, a premium to those of larger rival eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ), Internet business Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) and traditional retailer Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ). Pyykkonen called Amazon's valuation rich but added: "If margins are improving and the improvement can be sustained, that's what people have been looking for." Shares of Amazon rose nearly 12 percent in extended trade to $50.00 after closing at $44.75 on Nasdaq. Rohan said the large stock move was partly due to short-sellers, who own a large portion of Amazon shares. "There are a lot of investors betting against Amazon. When results are modestly ahead of expectations, those that shorted the stock have to run for the hills," Rohan said. (Additional reporting by  Lisa Baertlein )
