 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ) reported a 7 percent rise in first-quarter profit on Wednesday, helped by gains in membership, but the insurer projected a key medical-cost gauge would be worse than expected for the year. 

 Net income at the largest U.S. health insurer by membership rose to $783.1 million, or $1.26 per share, from $731.8 million, or $1.09 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected $1.26 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Membership rose about 2 percent to 34.9 million at the end of March, led by the company's national accounts and Medicaid plans for low-income Americans. Revenue rose 9 percent to $15.08 billion. The Indianapolis-based company said its benefit expense ratio -- which measures medical costs as a percentage of premium dollars -- worsened by 1.8 percentage points to 83.1 percent compared with the previous year. WellPoint cited "unacceptably high" ratios in two states where it implements Medicaid plans and said it was taking action to remedy the problem. Adjusting for the actions in the state-sponsored businesses, WellPoint forecast its benefit expense ratio for 2007 would come in at 81.9 percent, 0.4 of a percentage point worse than previously expected. However, the company's first-quarter sales, general and administrative cost ratio improved to 14.4 percent from 15.9 percent in the year-earlier period. WellPoint forecast net income of $1.35 per share for the second quarter and $5.54 for 2007, as well as 35.5 million members by year-end. Through acquisitions, WellPoint has grown into the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, but investors are worried that the market for employer-based health-plan enrollment is flattening and that competition will force insurers to cut their pricing. WellPoint shares have climbed about 5 percent this year, outpacing the stock performance of rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) and Aetna Inc. ( AET.N )
