 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp ( SHLD.O ) reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday as cold, wet weather and a reputation for poor service and run-down stores kept many shoppers away. 

 The company, led by hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, has been criticized for relying too heavily on cost-cutting to boost profit, rather than upgrading its stores and improving its merchandise mix and customer service. Like rivals Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) and Lowes Cos Inc ( LOW.N ), Sears has also been hurt by weak demand for appliances after a government stimulus program for energy-efficient models ended last year. Many shoppers continue to look for incentives to buy expensive items like washers and refrigerators. A colder-than-usual spring and rain or snow in many parts of the United States, Sears' main market, hurt sales of spring goods at the company's stores, which include the Kmart chain. "The service experience at Sears Domestic and Kmart is about the worst of any retailer in America today," Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said. Problems include understaffed stores, poor signage, closed cash registers, inconsistent inventory and, at Kmart, uncompetitive pricing, he said. Many retailers, from Lowe's to Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) to Target Corp ( TGT.N ), have been working harder to improve their in-store experience, Balter said, making it even more important for Sears to step up its customer service. "One can see the traffic leaving on a consistent basis, and as many extinct retailers have discovered, the customers don't come back," he said. Sales at Sears have fallen every year since it was formed through the merger of Sears and Kmart in 2005. Other retailers such as Dollar Tree Inc ( DLTR.O ) and Williams-Sonoma Inc ( WSM.N ) reported stronger sales on Thursday. Earlier this week, Sears Canada Inc ( SCC.TO ) reported a wider quarterly loss on a 9.2 percent decline in same-store sales. Sears owns a 92.4 percent stake in Sears Canada, according to Thomson Reuters data. Sears shares were down 2.7 percent at $73.83 in afternoon trading. DISAPPOINTING QUARTER Sears reported a net loss of $170 million, or $1.58 per share, for the first quarter ended April 30, compared with a year-earlier net profit of $16 million, or 14 cents per share. Excluding one-time items, the loss was $1.39 a share. On that basis, analysts had forecast a loss of $1.22 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. In early May, Sears estimated its first-quarter loss at $1.35 to $1.81 per share after reporting a 3.6 percent drop in sales at U.S. stores open at least a year. Sales fell 5.2 percent at its namesake brand and 1.6 percent at Kmart. Lampert, who is the company's chairman and owns a controlling stake, said then that there were "no excuses" for the poor performance and that Sears must do better. First-quarter sales fell 3.4 percent to $9.71 billion. Analysts were looking for $9.63 billion. Sears, which recently named a new chief executive officer, is revamping its clothing lines and expanding the variety of home services it offers in a bid to win share from rivals ranging from Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) to Amazon.com Inc ( AMZN.O ).
