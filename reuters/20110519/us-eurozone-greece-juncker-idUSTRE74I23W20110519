 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Eurogroup's Jean-Claude Juncker said on Thursday he remained opposed to a total restructuring of Greek sovereign debt but Athens had to prove it was serious about implementing budget reforms. 

 "Greece must know solidarity has its limits, if people get the impression that the Greek side is lacking the necessary solidity," Juncker told the Stuttgarter Zeitung daily according to a pre-publication report. "Greece now has the burden of proof in terms of solidity." (Reporting by  Stephen Brown  and  Annika Breidthardt )
