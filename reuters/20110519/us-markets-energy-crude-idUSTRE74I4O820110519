 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures extended losses and Brent crude turned negative as investors digested U.S. jobless claims data released early in the session, that raised concerns about the labor market in the world's largest oil consumer. 

 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for June delivery was down $1.18 at $98.92 by 1O:51 a.m. EDT (1451 GMT), after hitting a session low of $99.84 earlier. In London, Brent June crude was off 28 cents at $112.02. (Reporting by  Gene Ramos ; Editing by  David Gregorio )
