 LONDON, May 19 (IFR) - Shares in newly listed Glencore ( GLEN.L ) traded up on debut this morning after investors clamored to take part in the FTSE 100 newcomer's IPO. The US$10bn deal, rising to US$1bn if the greenshoe is exercised, had 31% allocated to cornerstones at the launch of bookbuilding. When the book closed, the remaining US$6.9bn was well over five times covered - nearly six according to one bookrunner. Over 900 different accounts participated, though many were left disappointed as over 100 accounts received nothing, while the top 50 took about two-thirds of the deal. Those in the middle received "gesture allocations" despite the pleading of salesmen anxious to get their accounts preferential treatment. The fact that an allocation call, which began at 7pm on Tuesday and was intended to be a brief chat about the top orders, ended up as a 13-hour marathon indicates the difficulty of parceling out the stock. Orders were received from around the world including the UK, US, Asia, Middle East and Brazil. About 10% went to high-net worth individuals and private banking clients, about a third to hedge funds and the rest to institutions and sovereign wealth funds. Hong Kong retail took just 2.67% of the offering. Index trackers were present and received allocations that ensured they got off to a good start by buying at the IPO price, but were sufficiently trimmed to ensure natural buying up to the stock's FTSE 100 weighting over the first few days. Even during the commodity sell off the deal maintained momentum. Meeting the US dollar pre-money market capitalization expectations of management became harder as the dollar has strengthened by seven big figures against sterling in the past three weeks. That meant that the 530p price, which had originally implied a US$53bn valuation for the company, in the end valued it at US$49.2bn. Shares were trading at 1.30am London time at 540p. The base deal saw 1.1bn shares issued to raise the US$10bn, of which US$7.9bn is primary. The US$1bn greenshoe is also primary. The free-float on the base deal is 16.9%. Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley are joint global co-ordinators on the deal. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and BNP Paribas are joint bookrunners. Barclays Capital, Societe Generale and UBS are co-bookrunners. (Owen Wild is deputy editor of International Financing Review, a Thomson Reuters publication)
