 LISBON  (Reuters) - Portugal's opposition Social Democrat leader said on Thursday the country has no room to fail in executing the austerity plan included in its 78-billion-euro bailout loan from the European Union and IMF. 

 "In the next four years we have no margin of error to execute the macroeconomic plan negotiated by the current government that is the condition for our desperate external help," Pedro Passos Coelho told a conference. "We have to fulfill this program." Social Democrat leader Passos Coelho leads polls ahead of a snap June 5 general election. The winner of the election will have to enact the economic plans included in Portugal's bailout. (Reporting by Sergio Goncalves and Daniel Alvarenga; writing by  Axel Bugge )
