 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Several hard-hit U.S. financial companies powered higher for a second day on Wednesday, as signs that banks such as Citigroup were on the road to recovery added to recent momentum in those shares. 

 While some companies, such as American International Group, benefited from short-covering, investors said sentiment has shifted in recent days in favor of Citigroup and regional banks that once appeared in danger of collapse. "The cyclical recovery is taking place and the credit environment has improved very significantly." said Chris Wang, portfolio manager at hedge fund SYW Capital Management LLC in New York. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) rose to a three-month high, having gained 11 percent in the last two days. American International Group Inc ( AIG.N ), whose appeal has also been bolstered recently by its move to sell off some of its units, is up more than 24 percent in two days. Option volume heated up on Wednesday, particularly in Citigroup, a sign of increased institutional support for the shares that has been bolstered since CEO Vikram Pandit told a congressional panel last week the bank no longer needs government funds. Options volume in Citi was five times greater than usual in afternoon trading. "You could not fail to see the huge call option volume in Citi on Tuesday which could only have been the weight of institutional demand. And that was confirmed in Tuesday's option volume in AIG as well," said Andrew Wilkinson, senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers Group in Greenwich, Connecticut. Citigroup shares rose 13 cents to $3.95 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it hit an intraday high of $4.07. Shares of AIG shot up $3.25 to $36.00. The latest run-up underscores a sharp reversal in bearishness that has shrouded these stocks during the financial crisis as investors fretted about the damage. At one time AIG and Citigroup were Dow components, with market capitalization in excess of billions of dollars. "The word on the Street is that the rally today is a short squeeze," Jud Pyle, chief investment strategist at Options News Network, a division of option market making firm PEAK6 Investments in Chicago, said in reference to trading in AIG. "I think that the options and stock action is hedge funds jumping on the momentum on a bet the stock will keep running." "Looking at the AIG chart, the stock has a long way to go up, so there's a combination of technicals and the fact that borrowing the stock (to short it) is not that easy right now," said Bill Rhodes of Rhodes Analytics in Boston. According to Reuters data, short interest in AIG shares accounts for roughly 23 percent of the current float. About 223,000 calls and 98,000 puts traded in AIG on Tuesday, Trade Alert data show. Fannie Mae FNM.N was up 2.8 percent at $1.10 and Freddie Mac FRE.N was up 2.3 percent at $1.31. The four stocks were among Wednesday's actively traded stocks by volume just as was the case on Tuesday. The SEC had no comment.
