 PARIS  (Reuters) - A top French minister on Wednesday attacked the United States' handling of an aerial tanker contract, which has seen Europe's EADS ( EAD.PA ) drop out of the race, and said the matter was not over yet. 

 "This has gone beyond acceptable," said France's European Affairs Minister Pierre Lellouche, who was speaking after a ministerial meeting. He added that as far as he was concerned, the multibillion-dollar matter was not closed and would lead to further developments. Earlier this week, the Pentagon said it may speed up awarding the contract after Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ) and EADS ( EAD.PA ) pulled out, leaving Boeing Co ( BA.N ) as the sole bidder. Northrop and EADS had won an initial bid for the contract in but later lost after U.S. government auditors upheld a Boeing protest.
