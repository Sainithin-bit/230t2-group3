 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday that the economy was recovering, but it may be some months yet before jobs are being created instead of lost. 

 "Most economists would say that, by the spring, we'll have positive job growth," Geithner said in an interview on ABC's "Good Morning America," conceding that it is unlikely there was any job growth in December. (Reporting by  Glenn Somerville ; Editing by  Padraic Cassidy )
