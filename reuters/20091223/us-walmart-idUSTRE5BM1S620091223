 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) will continue its holiday discounts and deals into the week after Christmas, the world's largest retailer said on Wednesday, as it introduces new deals and extends some old ones. 

 Beginning December 26, Wal-Mart will offer clearance discounts of up to 50 percent on many home holiday items and toys, besides introducing a $50 gift card with an Xbox 360 purchase and offering an eMachine netbook for $228. Wal-Mart has already rolled out aggressive price cuts ahead of the 2009 holiday season. It is offering more than 100 toys for $10 each, and it has cut prices on highly anticipated hardcover books by 60 percent or more, igniting a price-cutting war. On Wednesday, the company said it will also extend other previously announced deals such as its selection of top Blu-ray movies for under $20. Wal-Mart shares closed at $53.34 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Nivedita Bhattacharjee  in Bangalore; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott)
