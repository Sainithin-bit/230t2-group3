 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp, the world's biggest aerospace company and the Pentagon's No. 1 supplier by sales, has been hit by an unspecified cyber incident, the government said on Saturday. 

 The Department of Homeland Security said it and the Defense Department had offered to help determine the scope of a "cyber incident impacting LMCO," as the maker of fighter jets, ships and other major weapons systems is known. (Reporting by  Jim Wolf , editing by Will Dunham)
