 LONDON  (Reuters) - Following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the Reuters stories related to them. 

 1/ FRACTURING CONSENSUS Greek politicians' appetite for externally imposed austerity, reforms, and privatizations is being tested and may face bigger challenges given some are calling for an independent external body to run the privatizations. Opposition comments in the past week have highlighted the difficulties Athens faces in reaching a cross-party consensus, and financial markets are already nervy about the risk of a snap election or a referendum on austerity measures being called. The difficulties posed by a lack of domestic political consensus will be underscored at the end of the week by a Portuguese election that was triggered by just such a fracturing. The risk is that the political debate in Greece will become even more inflamed if the pace of privatization is forced by foreigners and foreign investors snapping up Greece's family silver at fire sale prices. Any such political ructions would only compound investor skepticism over whether Greece can avoid some form of restructuring. 2/ Saber RATTLING Political brinkmanship over how to solve Greece's debt crisis is rattling markets, driving peripheral euro debt bond yields higher and their CDS spreads wider. Throw in sharper political rhetoric, and the malaise that has affected Greek markets could take a heavier toll on asset prices of other highly indebted countries, such as Spain, Italy and Belgium. Financial markets' central scenario is that Greece will end up receiving the next tranche of bailout funds, which it needs before July repayments to investors are due. But they also view this as a stopgap en route to a debt restructuring. How much Spain and Italy will pay to sell their paper in the primary market in the coming week will reveal the extent to which contagion has spread to these countries. Foreign take up at these auctions may also give some indication of whether overseas investors could start substituting European Union bailout bonds for those issued by peripheral euro zone states given that the European Financial Stability Facility's next bond sale is scheduled for June. 3/ POSITIONING The euro/dollar implied volatility curve has flattened. Vols have risen faster at the shorter end than the longer end as the euro has lost ground due to differences between the ECB and politicians over Greek debt restructuring, domestic Greek political divisions, and Greece's still-unsustainable debt outlook. Speculators have been cutting long euro positions for some time, which has at least reduced the scope for position unwinding by short-term traders to cause a rout in the euro. But the currency could still cede ground if speculators show an inclination to build up short euro positions and/or longer-term investors reduce their exposure to it because of uncertainties about how Greece's conundrum will be resolved. One source of past support for the euro - the steady drip feed of Asian central bank reserve diversification flows - may be less present if the dollar gives Asian central banks less reason to fret. 4/ SAFETY IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER Benchmark German 10-year bond yields have probed below the psychologically significant 3 percent level but the flight-to-quality is far from a one-way bet. For one thing, the ECB is expected in the coming weeks to signal that it could raise interest rates as soon as July. The central bank's stated intent is to separate its monetary and liquidity policies. One factor feeding into its thinking will be whether money markets continue to show scant signs of stress, as is currently the case (barring some moves in euro/dollar cross currency basis swaps) despite the euro zone peripheral debt problems. The diverging monetary policies of the ECB and the Federal Reserve have had less influence over bond markets recently than the euro zone sovereign debt crisis. That could change if U.S. non-farm payrolls in the coming week -- the last before the end of the Fed's second round of stimulus -- changes what the Eurodollar strip is pricing. 5/ RECONCILING THE SIGNALS World stocks may have lost ground but the VIX is trading not too far from its 46-month low hit in late April as low valuations, signs of strength in the economic recovery and robust global liquidity help offset the gravitational pull exerted by concerns about Greece and other euro zone peripheral countries. Equity investors have been selective by focusing on defensive stocks with low valuation and strong cash flow, or high dividend stocks, or large caps with diversified interest, especially from emerging markets. But while valuations on some European financials may be cheap on a 10-year history, they are still too risky for the average investor given the past decade has seen nothing comparable in the way of sovereign credit risk.
