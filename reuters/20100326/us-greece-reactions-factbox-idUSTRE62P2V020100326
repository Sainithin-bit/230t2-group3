 (Reuters) - Reaction from Greek policymakers, executives and union bosses to a new EU safety net was broadly positive but economists warn much still needs to be done to restore market confidence and a bruised economy. 

 Here are comments in response to Thursday's deal: GEORGE PROVOPOULOS, GOVERNOR, BANK OF GREECE "The solution that was chosen (by the EU) seems to be a workable one which I think will not be used by Greece because measures that have been announced will start to bear fruit soon." PETROS CHRISTODOULOU, GREEK DEBT MANAGEMENT AGENCY CHIEF "Yesterday's developments are very welcome. The market is quickly pricing out any probability of default risk." "We anticipate a positive spread curve in due course." SPYROS PANTELIAS, VICE CHAIRMAN, HELLENIC POSTBANK "The important thing is the message that there is aid of last resort. But even stronger is the message that even in the event of further rating downgrades, Greek government paper will continue to be eligible for loans from the ECB. This is important not only for the government but for banks as well." "It is possible to see the 10-year Greek bond yield spread over German bunds returning to 290-295 basis points and a rebound in the stock market." VASSILIS RAPANOS, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL BANK "It's a message that shows confidence that Greece will stick to its stability and development programme," he told daily Ta Nea "I hope that in 2011, exactly because we will have proven that we are sticking to our plan, there will also be upgrades for Greek bonds from rating agencies." MOODY'S "The key credit question is whether, over the coming weeks and months, market confidence will be strengthened by the support package or whether it will be weakened by contentious conditions under which this package was agreed." ILIAS ILIOPOULOS, SECRETARY GENERAL, PUBLIC SECTOR UNION ADEDY "This was not the right decision ... It won't help Greece solve its problem. "We are sticking to our decision to move to a strike sometime in April." "Greece's sovereignty will be handed to foreigners who will be here only to collect money ... We will now have IMF visitors controlling us, imposing their opinion. They won't be here to help us make reforms that will secure prospect." STATHIS ANESTIS, SPOKESMAN, PRIVATE SECTOR UNION GSEE "It is undoubtedly a positive development. But things shouldn't have reached this point, because the country has suffered great financial losses. The EU should have expressed its solidarity a lot earlier. "For Greeks, the IMF involvement is positive, because it means a low interest rate and as far as we know the IMF is not demanding more anti-labor measures. Europe should have done this from the beginning ... not concede its rights to the IMF." GEORGE PETALOTIS, GREEK GOVERNMENT SPOKESMAN "We are satisfied for two reasons. Firstly, one positive is that there was a decision. This is very important in this phase of the EU and the euro zone, that in a world crisis there is a decision." "Secondly, it is important that the decision does not only concern Greece. The financial crisis in Greece was an opportunity for the EU and the euro zone to show they are really aware of their role. There is a danger of other countries suffering what Greece is going through today." YIANNIS STOURNARAS, FOUNDATION FOR ECONOMIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH "I don't think Greece will make use of the emergency mechanism because markets will soon begin to price in the fiscal measures. If the government is smart enough to accelerate structural reforms, on pensions and closed professions, I'm certain the situation will normalize by itself." "Spreads must not increase from current levels. If they fall, or stay at current levels, I believe Greece will meet its fiscal targets this year because the austerity measures provide enough breathing space to cope with such high borrowing costs." PETROS KOUTSORIZOS, HEAD OF TREASURY, PROTON BANK "Trichet's collateral decision and the EU summit will change the negative mood in Greece. They kill domestic rumors that the country is going bankrupt or that the central bank was secretly printing drachmas again. "The latest developments will improve the situation but they don't solve the problem. Greece's problems will only be solved when spending is cut and tax receipts rise." GOLDMAN SACHS "We think Greece is facing both a liquidity crisis and a potential debt sustainability problem, and we therefore expect that help will be needed, if not during April-May, then before the end of next year." "We expect this to lead to an 18-month IMF program with financing of up to 20 billion euros, split between the IMF and the European governments." IOANNIS SOKOS, BOND ANALYST, BNP PARIBAS "The EU decision is positive for Greece. A Greek default is out of the question now. This discourages everyone who bet on such an outcome, especially on the CDS market, which also affects bonds." "I expect a gradual decline of Greek government bond yields. I expect the 10-year bond spreads vis-a-vis German bunds to drop to about 250 basis points over the next two months. Spreads are already narrowing but Greece will have to issue new debt over the coming weeks and this will act as a break to the fall." "There is no ideal number for the spreads, and no specific threshold. The lower, the better, as simple as that." NIKOS GALOUSSIS, KAPPAS SECURITIES ANALYST "The ECB's move is very positive because it gives Greek banks a strong breather from current liquidity pressure. "The EU decision for a support mechanism to Greece is also expected to bring down borrowing costs both for the country and its banks. And this should increasing credit institutions' willingness to lend to businesses and households." JUSTIN KNIGHT, UBS STRATEGIST "I think yield spreads will come down on short covering, given the carry metrics. Still, there are questions to be answered about the aid package, such as when will market borrowing be seen as insufficient for Greece?" "At what level of spreads will the aid package be triggered? Another question is at what price will member states lend? It has to be a tighter level but what will it be?" "It is difficult to determine whether spreads will tighten as much as Greece would want them to." JUERGEN MICHELS, CITIGROUP ECONOMIST "It looks like we have a fund which Greece doesn't want to use and Germany doesn't want to pay for." "There are several open questions, mainly regarding how this fund would be activated and how big it would be. The risk of Greek insolvency is still there, in the medium term." "Greece can't go the IMF on its own now. If it did, it would be like saying that the entire EU decision was worth nothing." THANASSIS ATHANASSOPOULOS, 33, ARCHITECT "Austerity measures are inevitable, but they are unfair because it is politicians who brought the country to this point.
