 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP displaced several rival law firms to become the world's biggest adviser on mergers and acquisitions in the first quarter, as improved credit markets and risk appetite fed a rebound in deal making. 

 Through March 25, the New York-based firm advised on $90.8 billion of announced transactions, including the biggest, the $35.5 billion takeover of American International Group Inc's Asian life insurance unit by Britain's Prudential Plc, according to Thomson Reuters data. With just a few days to go in the quarter, total deal value was $520.4 billion for the year, up from $441.3 billion for the first quarter of 2009 through March 25. The pace is also ahead of all of 2009, when deal values totaled $2.07 trillion. "You are seeing the effects of pent-up demand after a lengthy period of very slow M&A activity, coupled with a strong equity market," said Frederick Green, co-chairman of Weil's mergers and acquisitions practice. "That has led to a marked increase in the number of stock-for-stock mergers, where the buyer's stock is used as acquisition currency." Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was second in transactions with $88 billion, followed by Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP at $80 billion and Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP at $77.2 billion. Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP was eighth, after ranking first in 2009. Weil was 10th for the year. Lawyers said rising stock market values have boosted the willingness of would-be targets to be acquired, while an improved economy may relieve the desire of potential acquirers to hoard cash and slash expenses to boost earnings. Banks, meanwhile, are gaining comfort extending loans. "Lenders are always driven by one motivation: they want to get repaid," said George "Gar" Bason, global head of mergers and acquisitions at Davis Polk. "For many of their credits, that depends on the economy. If banks see the economy improving, that drives a positive lending environment." Thomson Reuters rankings credit law firms with the entire value of their transactions, regardless of whether other firms work with them or whether they advise buyers or sellers. PICKUP Deal making is rebounding after a slide that began in mid-2007, which ended a boom in takeovers by private equity firms, sometimes called "financial" sponsors. The slide deepened when credit markets froze amid the September 2008 bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. But risk appetite is rebounding. Indeed, the perceived risk of owning corporate debt, measured by the extra yield premium it carries over U.S. Treasuries, has fallen by more than two-thirds to levels last seen in 2007, since the weeks after Lehman's bankruptcy, Bank of America Merrill Lynch data show. "It would have been almost impossible not to see a significant pickup," said Victor Lewkow, a partner in mergers and acquisitions at Cleary. "More importantly, we are seeing more interest in strategic deals. Buyers are feeling more confident in their businesses and general economic conditions than they were a year ago." Lewkow added that "stock prices have risen to a level that buyers and sellers now view as within the realm of being reasonable, for purposes of reaching an agreement." While private equity firms are making fewer acquisitions than they once did, several including Bain Capital Partners LLC and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co entered $1 billion or larger takeovers in the quarter. PRIVATE EQUITY "From 2005 through 2007, private equity buyers benefited from historically low costs of funds and covenant-lite structures," Bason said. "In many cases, financial buyers had significantly lower costs of capital than strategic acquirers. Now that funding costs for financial buyers have increased to more normal levels, strategic acquirers are benefiting." Five of the top seven advisers among law firms in the quarter worked on the Prudential-AIG transaction: Weil; Cleary; Davis Polk; Sullivan & Cromwell LLP; and Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, Thomson Reuters data show. Wachtell, meanwhile, is advising mall owner Simon Property Group Inc on a contested, roughly $30 billion takeover bid for rival General Growth Properties Inc, which is in bankruptcy, the data show. Weil is advising General Growth. Among non-U.S. firms, the highest-ranking merger and acquisition adviser in the quarter was Canada's Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP, which placed ninth. It is representing oilfield services company Smith International Inc on its estimated $12.2 billion takeover by larger rival Schlumberger Ltd. Britain's Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, which ranked second last year, has dropped to 18th in the first quarter, the data show. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by  Andre Grenon )
