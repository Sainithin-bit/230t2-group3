 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - B/E Aerospace Inc. ( BEAV.O ) said on Monday that quarterly operating profit rose 78 percent on higher sales and bigger margins and the world's largest maker of plane seats raised its 2007 earnings outlook. 


 On a net basis, the company, which fits out commercial and business jets with seats, oxygen masks, food carts and other gear, said fourth-quarter profit fell to $21.7 million, or 28 cents per share, from $62.1 million, or 96 cents per share, a year ago, hurt by the absence of a one-time tax benefit which boosted earnings in the year-ago period. Operating profit was $43 million, the company said. Net sales for the latest quarter, which ended December 31, rose to $321.6 million from $222.9 million a year ago. The company said it expects 2007 earnings of $1.40 to $1.42 per share, up from a prior forecast of $1.35 to $1.40 per share. B/E also said it expects 2008 earnings of about $2.00 per share and 2009 earnings that will rise 25 percent.
