 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) cut its 2007 revenue forecast on Monday after determining membership in its full-service Medicare plans for seniors will likely decline "modestly" this year. 


 The largest U.S. health insurer by market value took down its Medicare Advantage projection for the second time is as many months, even as rival Humana Inc. ( HUM.N ) said it picked up 100,000 such Medicare members in January alone. UnitedHealth's new Medicare Advantage forecast led analysts to speculate the company's performance has suffered as it tries to emerge from a stock options scandal. "The options inquiry is clearly a distraction and may finally be taking its toll on the company's ability to execute," Bank of America analyst Joseph France said in a research note. UnitedHealth shares dipped 0.8 percent. William McGuire, UnitedHealth's former longtime chief executive, left last year in the wake of a damaging report that found evidence of backdated stock options. The company has overhauled corporate governance procedures and changed its management structure, but still must become current with its regulatory financial filings and faces probes from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutors over the options issue. The Minneapolis-based insurer now sees consolidated revenue exceeding $78 billion this year, after previously forecasting revenues of "around" $79 billion last month. It maintained its net earnings forecast for the year of $4.7 billion to $4.75 billion. Medicare Advantage plans are full-service health plans provided by companies under Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors. UnitedHealth said it expects Medicare Advantage membership will decline in the first quarter by less than 100,000 people. It said last month it expected to add about 20,000 members in the quarter, a target which itself had been cut from an earlier forecast of adding 90,000 members. UnitedHealth had about 1.4 million Medicare Advantage members at the end of 2006. Recent data show more people are switching out of UnitedHealth's Medicare Advantage plans than had been anticipated when the company reported earnings last month, it said. The company expects to resume its growth in its Medicare Advantage offerings over the rest of the year. UnitedHealth cited lack of execution in sales and distribution efforts during the Medicare enrollment period last year. It said it was changing managers in sales, marketing and distribution at SecureHorizons, the brand-name for its Medicare Advantage plans. "To us, the bigger question is whether the company's recent problems in the Medicare business are indicative of broader execution issues," Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Borsch wrote in a research note, including possible distraction of management because of stock-option issues. Humana, meanwhile, said its Medicare Advantage membership rose by about 100,000 to 1.1 million members in January, and forecast as many as 1.2 million members by the end of the year. "UnitedHealth's loss appears to be Humana's gain, as Humana continues to gain a disproportionate share of the Medicare business," Bank of America's France said. UnitedHealth shares fell 43 cents to $52.48 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares are down about 2 percent in 2007.
