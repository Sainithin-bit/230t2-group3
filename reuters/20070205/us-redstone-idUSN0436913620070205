 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBS Corp. ( CBS.N ) and Viacom Inc. VIA.N Chairman Sumner Redstone have settled a lawsuit with his son, according to the online edition of the Wall Street Journal on Sunday. 


 The lawsuit, filed last year in the Circuit Court of Maryland for Baltimore, claimed that Redstone had tried to "freeze out" his son, Brent Redstone, from National Amusements, the family firm that holds a controlling stake in Viacom and CBS. Terms of the settlement were not disclosed, but according to people close to the suit, National Amusements repurchased the one-sixth stake held by the son, the Wall Street Journal said. Now the elder Redstone owns 80 percent of National Amusements while his daughter, Shari Redstone, owns 20 percent. Reuters/VNU
