 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nissan Motor Co. shares opened down 7.3 percent on Monday, knocking $4.1 billion off its market value, after the carmaker warned before the weekend that it would miss its original profit forecasts by a wide margin. 


 After first changing hands at 1,399 yen, Nissan was trading at 1,389 yen at 0110 GMT, down 8 percent from Friday's close. UBS Securities cut its rating on Nissan's stock to Reduce 2 from Buy 2, and its price target to 1,300 yen from 1,600 yen, saying the scenario for a near-term profit rebound was gone and medium-term growth track unclear. "Top management's policy of setting high targets, promising results and motivating employees, which had been effective in pulling the company out of dire circumstances, is apparently not a cure-all," UBS auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida wrote in a report dated Friday. "We think several rounds of results could be required to restore any lost confidence, and this is likely to take time." Nissan reported a worse-than-expected 23 percent slide in quarterly net profit on Friday, blaming a sluggish recovery in U.S. sales, and slashed its full-year forecasts to point to its first annual earnings drop in seven years. The news dragged Nissan's American Depositary Receipts down 8 percent on Wall Street later that day, to the equivalent of 1,420 yen. Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn has been credited for the turnaround of a near-bankrupt Nissan in 1999 into one of the industry's most profitable carmakers in just a few years, but many had begun to question his ability to sustain growth as Nissan's product pipeline ran dry last year and hurt vehicle sales around the world. Production cuts at Nissan also hit its main parts suppliers. Calsonic Kansei Corp., held 40 percent by Nissan, said late last year it would cut 1,000 jobs to cope with the lower production volumes. Ghosn, who also heads French alliance partner Renault SA PA> , on Friday expressed disappointment at the latest results and his first profit warning as Nissan's boss, and promised to map out a plan by April to ensure the company meets its goals under a three-year plan that runs through March 2008. Under the "Nissan Value-Up" business plan, the Tokyo-based carmaker has promised to achieve an operating profit margin at the top end of the industry and a 20 percent return on invested capital. Its vehicle sales target of 4.2 million units is slated for completion a year later, in the 2008/09 business year. Despite the launch of six new models during the third quarter, including the high-volume Sentra and Altima sedans in the United States, Nissan cut its net profit forecast to 460 billion yen ($3.8 billion) for the fiscal year to March 31 from a prior estimate of 523 billion yen. The new figure would represent an 11 percent fall from the previous year. Shares of other Japanese automakers also faltered, with Toyota Motor Corp. losing 1.9 percent and Honda Motor Co. down 3 percent, underperforming the main Nikkei average's 0.9 percent fall. Calsonic Kansei fell 3.5 percent to 662 yen. ($1=121.06 Yen)
