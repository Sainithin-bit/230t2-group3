 PANAMA CITY  (Reuters) - Panama asked the International Maritime Organization on Monday for an audit of its 7,000 ships, the largest fleet in the world, to help it improve security and environmental controls. 


 "It is not enough that Panama has the most ships, it should also show a stance that esteems responsibility and resolve to better its shipping register," IMO secretary general Efthimios Mitropoulos told a news conference. Mitropoulos said once the audit is carried out the IMO would produce a confidential report outlining the problems of Panama-flagged ships and suggestions to resolve them. Carlos De la Lastra, an executive of the Panama Maritime Authority, said the audit would serve to improve controls. "We have improved our accident record, we were on the black list but we are now on the gray list and we are on top of this to avoid (accidents)," De la Lastra said. Last year, Panama was removed from the IMO's so-called "black list" of countries with deficit shipping practices. The IMO is the United Nations' agency responsible for improving maritime safety and attacking pollution from ships.
