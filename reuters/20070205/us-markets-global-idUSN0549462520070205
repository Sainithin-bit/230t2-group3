 NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. stocks ended mixed on Monday, with a decline in Microsoft Corp. weighing on technology shares, while bonds rose slightly and the dollar mostly firmed against major currencies. 


 Crude oil prices fell as heating fuel supplies remained adequate even though freezing cold gripped much of the country, analysts said. Gold ended higher. U.S. Treasury bond prices rose modestly as strength following weak January jobs data spilled over from last week. The dollar generally traded higher after a key measure of the U.S. services sector came in stronger than expected. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) report underscored expectations for steady interest rates in the months ahead. The ISM non-manufacturing index in January rose to its highest level since last May. It was above the Wall Street consensus forecast. In the stock market, the Nasdaq Composite Index fell with Microsoft shares after concern that its new Vista operating system may not be enough to sustain the recent rally in the company's share price. Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. rose 0.9 percent, or 44 cents, to $48.52 on the New York Stock Exchange, and helped the blue-chip Dow average eke out a slight gain. The world's biggest retailer estimated on Saturday that January sales rose a stronger-than-expected 2.2 percent at its U.S. stores open at least a year. "We were a little extended to the upside so taking a little bit of profit is not unexpected. The biggest reason in the strength, at least in the Dow, was Wal-Mart," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 8.25 points, or 0.07 percent, to end at 12,661.74, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index dipped 1.40 points, or 0.10 percent, to finish at 1,446.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 5.28 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 2,470.60. The drop in Microsoft followed an article in business weekly Barron's February 5 issue, which suggested Microsoft is more likely to fall than rise with the release of its Vista operating system, as expectations for Vista's success were already factored into its stock's price. Microsoft shares fell 1.9 percent, or 58 cents, to $29.61 on the Nasdaq, reversing all the gains of the last month. Monday's slide was Microsoft's largest one-day decline in almost six months. In overseas trading, stocks rose in Europe. The FTSEurofirst-300 Index gained 0.04 percent to 1,538.32, a six-year closing high. Japan's Nikkei fell 202.31 points, or 1.2 percent, to 17,344.80, its biggest one-day drop since January 10. BONDS RISE, DOLLAR EDGES UP VS EURO Bond dealers focused on a decline in the labor component of the ISM services index, which confirmed the slowing reported in Friday's employment data. Gains in Treasuries were relatively subdued, however, with the prospect of steady monetary policy from the Federal Reserve keeping yields stuck in a range. Benchmark 10-year notes climbed 4/32 in price to 98-19/32 and were offering a yield of 4.81 percent, down from 4.83 percent late on Friday, but still 40 basis points above a December trough. The two-year note's yield eased a basis point to 4.93 percent, with the price up just 1/32 at 99-29/32. The 30-year bond climbed 6/32 in price to 93-21/32 and yielded 4.91 percent. In late afternoon currency trading, the euro fell 0.3 percent against the greenback to $1.2932, and sterling slipped 0.4 percent to $1.9596. However, the dollar was down 0.7 percent at 120.29 yen. The yen strengthened on investor concerns that Group of Seven finance ministers will take a tougher line on recent weakness in the Japanese currency. CRUDE OIL DOWN, GOLD UP After a late burst of profit-taking on the New York Mercantile Exchange, March crude CLH7 fell 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, to settle at $58.74 a barrel. In a see-saw session, prices surged to $59.95, the highest since $60.97 on January 3, and fell as low as $58.50. U.S. gold futures ended higher on bargain hunting, after they falling almost 2 percent lower in the previous session. COMEX most-active gold for April delivery GCJ7 rose $4.60 to settle at $656.10 an ounce.
