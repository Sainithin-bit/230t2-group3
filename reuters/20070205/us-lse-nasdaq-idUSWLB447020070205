 LONDON  (Reuters) - The London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ) reiterated its opposition to a hostile bid from Nasdaq Stock Market Inc ( NDAQ.O ) on Monday, noting that valuations of trading exchanges had risen since its U.S. rival launched its bid. 


 The London Stock Exchange (LSE) said it had sent a letter to shareholders which "draws specific attention to the fact that the December 2006 trading P/E (price/earnings) multiples for the major listed exchanges have risen by, on average, 10.5 per cent. since Nasdaq announced its offer on November 20." Nasdaq owns almost a third of the LSE and is offering 1,243 pence a share in cash for the rest, valuing the LSE at around 2.7 billion pounds ($5.3 billion). "The board continues to recommend strongly that exchange shareholders reject Nasdaq's wholly inadequate offer and take no action in respect of their shareholdings," LSE chairman Chris Gibson-Smith said in a statement. A spokesman for Nasdaq said the London exchange had used the "same bankrupt valuation arguments" in its defense, adding that "1,243 pence a share in cash is the only option for shareholders at the end of the timetable." Nasdaq renounced the option of raising its offer for the LSE last month, leaving its fate with shareholders. It has until February 10 under U.K. takeover rules either to let it lapse or go unconditional. The top U.S. electronic stock exchange needs 50 percent to begin taking control, meaning that just over 20 percent of LSE shareholders must join Nasdaq in agreeing to the bid. By 1052 GMT shares in the London Stock Exchange were up 0.8 percent at 1,320p. (Additional reporting by Louise Heavens)
