 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pace of growth in the U.S. service sector increased to its strongest in eight months in January on steady demand and lower costs, according to a report released on Monday. 


 The Institute for Supply Management's services index rose to 59.0 in January from 56.7 in December and was above the median forecast of 57.0 among analysts polled Reuters. The January reading is the highest since 59.2 in May 2006. A number above 50 indicates growth in the sector. "The service sector continues to show healthy growth with some moderation in price pressures which suggests that the economy is still doing OK outside of housing and that the Fed will probably hold interest rates steady until inflation moderates further," said Gary Thayer, chief economist at A.G. Edwards and Son in St. Louis, Missouri. Last week, the Federal Reserve left key U.S. interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent, the same level it has held since June 2006. It said the economy would expand "at a moderate pace over coming quarters," and inflation pressures will likely ease over time. U.S. Treasuries prices held earlier gains after release of the unexpectedly strong headline ISM number. Some analysts and traders said the report's details, however, suggested slowing growth in the U.S. service sector. Still, the service sector, which accounts for roughly 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, has remained resilient despite drags from construction and retail sectors, "I think we've had some pretty good business activity over the last several months," said Anthony Nieves, chairman of ISM's non-manufacturing business survey committee at a teleconference after the release of the report. The survey's new orders component was 55.4 in January, little changed from December's 55.6, while the prices-paid index slipped to 55.2 in January from 59.7 in December. Most of the price drop reflected a decline in energy costs, Nieves said. U.S. oil futures CLc1 fell as much as 18 percent in January until rebounding recently on heavier energy usage as a result of frigid winter weather. While the headline figure was above forecast, the survey's details suggested patchy spots in the service industries, such as a drop in backlog orders and slower hirings, analysts said. The jobs component fell to 51.7 from 53.2 in December for its lowest since 51.6 in January 2006. On Friday, the government reported service companies added 104,000 jobs last month, less than the upwardly revised 209,000 hirings in December. (Additional reporting by  Ellen Freilich )
