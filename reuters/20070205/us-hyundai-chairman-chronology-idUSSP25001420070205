 (Reuters) - The head of Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) was sentenced to three years in jail for embezzling funds from the world's No. 6 auto maker, dealing another blow to a company battling a rising won and restive labor unions. 


 Here is a timeline showing some major scandals relating to Hyundai and other large South Korean firms. - 1978: Hyundai's current Chairman Chung Mong-koo and his late father and Hyundai founder Chung Ju-yung are cleared after an investigation into corrupt property deals. Chung Mong-koo is arrested and jailed for 75 days over construction regulations infringements, but freed on a 5 million won ($5,000) fine. - October 13, 1997: Kim Hyun-chul, the son of President Kim Young-sam, is jailed for three years and fined 1.44 billion won for taking kickbacks worth 3.22 billion won and evading taxes on 3.39 billion won he took as gifts. - December 26, 1997: Hanbo Group founder Chung Tae-soo gets a 15-year jail term for bribing politicians and bankers to keep money rolling into Hanbo Steel, South Korea's second-largest steelmaker, which collapsed in January 1997. One of his sons, Chung Bo-keun, gets a three-year suspended sentence. - August 4, 2003: Chung Mong-hun, Chung Mong-koo's younger brother and then chairman of Hyundai Asan, jumps to his death while facing trial over an alleged $500 million secret "cash for summit" payment to Pyongyang before June 2000's landmark North/South summit. He was also accused of doctoring company books and embezzling 15 billion won. - June 13, 2003: Chey Tae-won, Chairman of South Korea's biggest oil refiner, SK Corp. ( 003600.KS ), gets a three-year jail term for a $1.2 billion accounting scandal and illegal stock dealings at subsidiary SK Global. SK Group Chairman Son Kil-seung is found guilty of accounting fraud and was sentenced to a suspended three-year jail term. - June 18, 2004: Hyundai Motor Group vice chairman Kim Dong-jin and Korean Air ( 003490.KS ) Chief Executive Cho Yang-ho are given suspended two-year and one-year jail terms respectively, for raising a slush fund to support politicians in the 2002 presidential race. Both keep their jobs. - October 4, 2005: Samsung Everland Co.'s former chief executive, Her Tae-hak, and CEO Park Ro-bin, are given suspended jail terms for conspiring in a 1996 deal to help the children of the group's chairman buy a majority stake in an affiliate at below-market prices. - February 7, 2006: Samsung Chairman Lee Kun-hee apologises for 'wrongful' corporate governance practices and alleged shady contributions to political candidates. Samsung says it will donate 800 billion won -- the largest single charitable contribution in South Korean history -- to atone. - November 20, 2006: Daewoo founder Kim Woo-choong ends his appeal, after his 10-year jail sentence for embezzlement and accounting fraud is reduced to 8- years. Once admired as a hero, Kim fled South Korea in 1999 when Daewoo collapsed with debts of more than $75 billion, and was arrested on his return in 2005. - February 5, 2006: Chung Mong-koo, the head of Hyundai Motor Group, is found guilty of breach of trust and embezzling company funds and sentenced to three years in jail, a move which sweeps aside expectations of a suspended sentence.
