 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Shopping mall owner Mills Corp. said on Monday its board would weigh a $1.56 billion takeover offer from Simon Property Group Inc. and Farallon Capital Management, but its existing deal to be bought by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. remained in place. 


 Mills said its board has not yet reached any decision about the Simon/Farallon proposal and there could be no assurances that the offer would lead to a binding agreement. Last month, Canada-based Brookfield agreed to buy Mills for $21 a share. The new offer from Simon/Farallon is valued at $24 per share.
