 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sears Holdings Corp. ( SHLD.O ) said on Monday it would take a fourth-quarter charge after its subsidiary, Sears Roebuck and Co., was ordered to pay a group of bondholders roughly $73.5 million for redeeming certain bonds after sale of its credit card business. 


 The retailer said the charge will reduce earnings by approximately $44 million after taxes, or 29 cents per share. It said the charge was not included in its previously issued forecast, and the charge could increase if interest or other amounts are awarded to the plaintiffs. In 2004, a group of big bond holders, including J.P. Morgan Securities ( JPM.N ) and subsidiaries of American International Group Inc. ( AIG.N ), sued Sears Roebuck & Co. for buying back its debt before maturity in a move that left investors facing losses of tens of millions of dollars. A state court jury in Dallas on February 2 found Sears' redemption of the bonds constituted a breach of contract, but Sears said it  believes it was fully entitled to redeem the bonds and it will appeal the decision.
