 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and the founders of Australia's Multiplex MXG.AX have approached the $3 billion construction firm about a possible takeover as it struggles with the troubled Wembley stadium project in London. 


 Shares in Multiplex Ltd. rose as much as 8 percent to A$4.91 after the approach by Canada-based Brookfield ( BAMa.TO ) and the Roberts family, which has 25.6 percent of Multiplex. The approach could lead to an offer for the whole company, Multiplex said. No value for any bid was given, but analysts suggested around A$5 a share might be the most offered for Multiplex, which has a market capitalization of A$4.04 billion ($3 billion). Shares in Multiplex, which is being advised by UBS ( UBSN.VX ) and Allens Arthur Robinson, ended up 5.5 percent at A$4.80. "You're probably talking a 10 percent premium to this (A$4 billion) valuation only," said Brent Mitchell, analyst at Shaw Stockbroking. "If the family ends up involved I can't see them wanting to pay over the odds for something they control already," he said. Multiplex's 750 million pound ($1.5 billion) redevelopment of the iconic Wembley stadium in northwest London has been dogged by disputes, problems and soaring costs and is way behind schedule. At its annual results in August, Multiplex said the year's loss on the Wembley project was A$364 million before tax. The company said on January 25 it had received a potential bid. Brookfield manages assets of about $50 billion and owns half of Brookfield Properties Corp. ( BPO.TO ), which has a real estate portfolio that includes the World Financial Center in New York and is one of Manhattan's biggest office landlords. The proposal is an all-cash offer, said Brookfield, which is being advised by Citigroup ( C.N ). Multiplex's stock is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 17.6, compared with 10.5 for rival GPT Group ( GPT.AX ). "For a bid to eventuate at the current share price, an acquirer would need to be able to reach a valuation of A$5.45 (a share) post cost synergies, transaction costs and profit margin ... requiring some extremely aggressive assumptions and/or valuation parameters for the components of Multiplex," said a report from Deutsche Bank. Any agreement would encompass Multiplex's property development, construction, property funds management and facilities management businesses. It must involve the Roberts family. "If nothing emerges out of this deal there's still a chance someone else will move in, with the family obviously willing to look at these things," said Mitchell of Shaw Stockbroking. "Clearly the Roberts family prefer, after the episodes of the last three years, to be under less of a microscope," he said. Multiplex founder John Roberts died in June after establishing the company in 1962. Chief Executive Andrew Roberts, his brother Tim Roberts and sister Denby Macgregor have taken a leave of absence from their executive roles. Multiplex stock rose as high as A$5.01 on January 25, when a bid approach was first revealed. ($1=A$1.29) ($1=.5085 Pound)
