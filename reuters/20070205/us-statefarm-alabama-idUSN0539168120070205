 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., citing losses from storms, said it will not renew coverage for about 2,600 policyholders mainly in Alabama's beach resorts, the Associated Press reported on Monday. 


 The announcement came after State Farm agreed to pay about $80 million to more than 600 Mississippi policyholders who sued over damage from Hurricane Katrina and at least $50 million more to resolve thousands of other disputed claims by policyholders who didn't sue, the newswire said.
