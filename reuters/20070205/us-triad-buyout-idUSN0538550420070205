 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Triad Hospitals Inc. ( TRI.N ) was expected to announce as early as Monday morning that it was selling itself to private-equity buyers for about $4.4 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 


 Citing people familiar with the matter, the Journal said the hospital chain's likely buyers were CCMP Capital Advisors LLC and the private investment arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) The sources said Rival Blackstone Group was also interested and might still bid for Triad at the last minute, the Journal reported. Officials at Triad, CCMP, Goldman and Blackstone were not immediately available for comment. Private equity firms have had hospital companies on their radar screens since the $21 billion leveraged buyout of No. 1 hospital chain HCA Inc. last November. Triad, based in Plano, Texas, has endured an increasingly acrimonious activist campaign by hedge fund TPG-Axon Capital Management LP, which threatened to run a proxy campaign to elect new directors at Triad.
