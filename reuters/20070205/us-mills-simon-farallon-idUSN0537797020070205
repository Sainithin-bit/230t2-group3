 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Simon Property Group Inc. ( SPG.N ) and hedge fund Farallon Capital Management made a $1.56 billion offer for mall owner Mills Corp. MLS.N, which last month agreed to be bought by Brookfield Asset Management Inc. ( BAMa.TO ), the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. 


 Simon, the largest U.S. shopping center owner, and Farallon are expected to put up equal amounts of equity to help fund their $24 per-share bid, the Journal said. Canada-based Brookfield offered $21 per share or $1.35 billion. As Mills's largest shareholder, Farallon has aggressively pushed for a higher offer for Mills, the paper said. Mills, based in Chevy Chase, Maryland, has lost about half its stock market value during the past year and had been considering its options amid a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its accounting methods. Citing a person close to Simon, the Journal said the latest offer is a cash tender offer, which would allow Mills shareholders to get their cash in a matter of weeks. The offer by Brookfield, which owns half of New York's World Financial Center owner Brookfield Properties Corp. ( BPO.TO ), is expected to close in the second half of 2007. Simon and Farallon would also assume the more than $6 billion Mills has in debt, the Journal said. Officials from Mills, Simon and Farallon could not immediately be reached for comment.
