 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Bush administration on Monday proposed cutting subsidies and fees collected by institutions that make college loans, sending sector leader Sallie Mae's SLM.N stock price reeling. 


 The lender's shares were down 8.7 percent on the New York Stock Exchange at $42.40 by midday. "The cuts proposed today by the president to the private-sector student lending program, which currently serves 80 percent of all student borrowers, would have far-reaching consequences for students and taxpayers," Sallie Mae, formally known as SLM Corp., said in a statement. "These harmful cuts would result in substantially fewer lenders participating in the program, reduced competition and move us closer to a government-run student loan monopoly in the Direct Lending program, supported by an enormous federal government bureaucracy," the company said. Nelnet Inc. ( NNI.N ), another major student loan group, saw its shares fall 7.9 percent by midday to $25.52.
