 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Humana Inc. ( HUM.N ) said on Monday that quarterly net profit more than doubled on strong Medicare membership growth, which prompted the health insurer to raise its 2007 earnings forecast. 


 Net income for the fourth quarter ended December 31 rose to $155.0 million, or 92 cents per share, from $61.8 million, or 37 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 54 percent to $5.66 billion from $3.66 billion a year ago, with total premium and administrative services fees up 53 percent from a year ago. For 2007 Humana expects to earn $4.00 to $4.20 per share, up from its prior forecast of $3.90 to $4.10 per share.
