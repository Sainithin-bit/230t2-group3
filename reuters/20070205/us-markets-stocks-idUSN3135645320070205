 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. tech stocks fell on Monday as investors worried that Microsoft Corp.'s new Vista operating system may not be enough to sustain the recent rally in the company's share price. 


 Blue-chip stocks inched up after unexpectedly strong sales figures from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ), and a flurry of merger and acquisition news, including State Street Corp's ( STT.N ) $4.5 billion bid for Investors Financial Services Corp. IFIN.O. Microsoft's nearly 2 percent drop made it the biggest negative influence on the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. But small declines in the broader market followed the S&P's advance last week, when it recorded its strongest weekly gain since August, as economic data suggested the Federal Reserve will keep U.S. interest rates steady for now. "We were a little extended to the upside so taking a little bit of profit is not unexpected. The biggest reason for the strength, at least in the Dow, was Wal-Mart," said Michael James, senior trader at regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 8.25 points, or 0.07 percent, to end at 12,661.74, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  edged down 1.40 points, or 0.10 percent, to finish at 1,446.99. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 5.28 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 2,470.60. Microsoft capped the advances by the three major indexes as its shares fell 1.9 percent, or 58 cents, to $29.61 on the Nasdaq, reversing all the gains of the last month. Monday's slide was Microsoft's largest one-day decline in almost six months. The drop in Microsoft followed an article in business weekly Barron's February 5 issue, which suggested Microsoft is more likely to fall than rise with the release of its Vista operating system, as expectations for Vista's success were already factored into its stock's price.

Meanwhile, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ( WMT.N ) rose 0.9 percent, or 44 cents, to $48.52 on the New York Stock Exchange, after reaching a three-month high at $48.90 earlier in the session. The world's biggest retailer estimated on Saturday that January sales rose a stronger-than-expected 2.2 percent at its U.S. stores open at least a year. <ID:nN03336910>. Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) was also one of the biggest gainers on the Dow, rising 0.7 percent after news that United Parcel Service had ordered 27 of its freighter aircraft. <ID:nN05400813> Its stock was up 67 cents at $90.72 on the  NYSE. Investors Financial Services Corp. IFIN.O stock jumped 27.4 percent, or $12.85, to $59.80 on the Nasdaq. after the company agreed to be acquired by State Street Corp. ( STT.N ) for about $4.5 billion. For details see <ID:nN05403400>. Investors Financial Services Corp.'s stock was the Nasdaq's biggest percentage gainer. In other deal news, Vornado Realty Trust ( VNO.N ) on Sunday sweetened its $23.2 billion bid for Equity Office Properties Trust EOP.N, the top U.S. office landlord, by offering to pay the cash portion up front. <ID:nN04200105>. Equity Office and Vornado shares were little changed. Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.41 billion shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 1.97 billion shares traded, below last year's daily average of 2.02 billion. Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of about 9 to 7 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.
