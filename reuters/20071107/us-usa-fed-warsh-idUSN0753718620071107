 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Board Governor Kevin Warsh said on Wednesday the U.S. central bank's monetary policy stance would shift if data came in that changed the Fed's economic forecast, or risks around the forecast. 

 "Should incoming data materially change our forecast, or risks to our forecast, for growth and inflation, so too would our view on the appropriate stance of monetary policy," he told the New York Association for Business Economics. Warsh noted the U.S. economy grew at a solid clip in the third quarter but said some indicators have suggested the expansion's pace is already slowing. "The prospect that such perceived softness may prove real and enduring is understood," he said. He also said stresses were still apparent in financial markets, even though strains had eased since credit-related concerns brought some markets to a near halt in August. The credit strains that burst into view in August were "still playing out in real time," he said, and that it was too soon to draw conclusions about how the financial system could be made stronger. He said the "period of retrenchment" for some large financial institutions "lasted days and weeks; for others, it may yet continued for many months." But he later added that some market segments, such as corporate mortgage and leveraged loan markets, were improving. Nevertheless, Warsh made clear not all of his concerns were about the potential for slower growth amid tighter credit conditions and a slumping housing market. "There are also important reasons to be concerned about the outlook for inflation," he said, citing the rise in prices for oil and other commodities and the potential for a drop in the value of the dollar to push U.S. import prices higher. "These changes most likely will put upward pressure on overall inflation in the short run," Warsh said of the rise in oil and other commodity prices. However, in a reference that also nodded to the dollar's weakness, he also said: "If these same forces cause inflation expectations to become less reliably anchored, then inflation could increase in the longer run as well." Inflation expectations for now looked contained, he later said. "My own guess is that inflation expectations will be contained and it looks like a reasonably benign picture, but it is something that we can't expect to happen without prudent monetary policy actions." The U.S. central bank has cut benchmark interest rates by three-quarters of a percentage point over the past two months. In announcing its last rate cut on October 31, it said risks to growth and the risk of inflation were about evenly balanced, implying a reluctance to lower borrowing costs further. Warsh said the U.S. central bank's policy actions have been directed at the real economy, not financial markets, and that this focus has kept moral hazard at bay. "I think these moral hazard arguments are important ones to raise and we're certainly cognizant of not wanting to reward bad behavior and, as a result, I think our focus is on the real economy," he said. "I feel that we haven't created moral hazard because of our focus on the real economy." (Additional reporting by  Tim Ahmann  in Washington, Editing by  James Dalgleish)
