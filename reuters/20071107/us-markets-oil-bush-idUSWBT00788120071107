 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Wednesday oil prices are too high, as U.S. crude closed in on the landmark $100 level. 

 "Oil prices are too high," said spokeswoman Dana Perino. Oil sped above $98 a barrel for the first time on Wednesday, driven by a slumping dollar and worries over a winter fuel supply crunch. (Writing by  John Ruwitch )
