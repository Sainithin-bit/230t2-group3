 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Nasdaq Stock Market Inc ( NDAQ.O ) has agreed to buy the Philadelphia Stock Exchange for about $650 million, moving it into the fast-growing U.S. options market, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. 

 Nasdaq's acquisition will give the second-largest U.S. stock market after the New York Stock Exchange about 15 percent of the options market, even as its traditional stock-trading business, which earns lower margins, gets squeezed by fierce competition. Nasdaq, which plans to launch its own options trading market in December, edged out bigger rival NYSE Euronext NYX.N and other bidders in a weeks-long race to buy PHLX in what is likely to be an all-cash transaction, the sources said. The deal is yet to be finalized, they said. NYSE Euronext -- which owns NYSE Arca, an options platform with about 13 percent of the market -- was a close bidder for PHLX, according to one person familiar with the matter. Both exchanges compete fiercely for trading share and listings and are eyeing derivatives trading, which includes options and futures contracts, to drive future U.S. growth. U.S. options trading has seen explosive growth in recent years. More than 2 billion options contracts were traded as of October 30, a 38.4 percent increase over the same period last year, according to the Options Industry Council. "It's attractive because options trading is growing much faster than stock trading," said Morningstar analyst Patrick O'Shaughnessy. He said getting into options is a way for stock exchanges to diversify their revenue sources, while "leveraging much of the same infrastructure they already have in place." The Chicago Board Options Exchange and the International Securities Exchange ISE.N, which reported a 33 percent quarterly profit on Tuesday, together hold about two-thirds of the U.S. options market. Nasdaq will buy PHLX, the nation's oldest securities exchange, with cash raised from the recent sale of its 30 percent stake in the London Stock Exchange ( LSE.L ), one person familiar with the matter said. Nasdaq and PHLX have previously talked about a deal, according to press reports. The Philadelphia exchange trades stocks, options and currencies, but its recent growth has been driven by its options business. PHLX is partly owned by a consortium of Wall Street firms -- Merrill Lynch MER.N, Citadel Derivatives Group, Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ), Credit Suisse First Boston and UBS ( UBSN.VX ). In September, the exchange and its strategic investors agreed to pay up to $80 million to PHLX shareholders in relation to a 2006 lawsuit regarding the sale of the exchange. The lawsuit had alleged that the PHLX board struck a deal with the Wall Street firms that would result in 90 percent of the exchange's equity being transferred from shareholders to the investors and board members. O'Shaughnessy said it was difficult to judge how good a deal this is for Nasdaq until terms are disclosed. "A lot depends on the agreements that are currently in place between Philly and some of the large broker-dealers to continue sending order flow," he said. "If that order flow is continued to be sent to Philly then it's probably a solid deal for Nasdaq. If it's not, then it's going to be a challenge for Nasdaq to maintain Philly's current market share." The tremendous growth in the options market has been partly driven by institutional traders who have adopted options trading in their strategies to manage risk. Sources earlier told Reuters that Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and Susquehanna International Group also expressed interest in buying PHLX. Sandy Frucher, chief executive of the privately owned PHLX, and Nasdaq spokeswoman Silvia Davi had no comment.
