 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) said on Wednesday its quarterly profit rose, helped by strong demand from telecommunications companies upgrading their systems to cope with growing Internet traffic. 

 But Cisco shares fell about 4 percent in after-hours trade after closing down around 4 percent at $32.75 in the regular session. Cisco, which makes routers, switches and other equipment, said its fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose to $2.2 billion, or 35 cents per share, from $1.6 billion, or 26 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Earnings excluding items rose to 40 cents per share in the quarter from 31 cents a year earlier. Revenue, helped by its expansion into new products as well as emerging markets, rose 16.7 percent to $9.6 billion. In August, the company forecast quarterly revenue of $9.45 billion to $9.55 billion. Analysts on average had forecast revenue of $9.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. The shares had risen around 20 percent since the start of the year on expectations that growing Internet traffic, fueled by the popularity of Web-based video and music services, will keep driving sales of Cisco equipment. Cisco is the world's top maker of routers and other network equipment, and has been expanding into video conferencing and new Web-based software through acquisitions of small start-ups. It also owns cable set-top box maker Scientific Atlanta. It has also been expanding its overseas business, investing aggressively in fast-growing markets like China and India.
