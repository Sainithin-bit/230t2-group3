 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Third-quarter profit at Yellow Pages Income Fund YLO_u.TO notched 2 percent higher, Canada's largest publisher of phone directories said on Wednesday, as it increased its annual cash distributions by nearly 4 percent. 

 Buoyed by recent acquisitions and product improvements, the company said net earnings rose to C$122 million, or 23 Canadian cents a unit, in the three months ended September 30. A year earlier, it earned C$119.5 million, or 23 Canadian cents, on a smaller share count in the quarter. Based on its performance to date and expectations for 2008, the fund increased it cash distributions to unit holders by 3.7 percent to C$1.13 annually from $1.09. In the third quarter, distributable cash increased by 14.4 percent to C$182.9 million, and 9.7 percent on a per unit basis to 34 Canadian cents. Revenue adjusted to exclude the impact of purchase accounting increased 12.9 percent to C$417.6 million from C$369.9 million. Adjusted earnings from operations before depreciation and amortization grew 15 percent to C$227.6 million. Since going public in mid-2003, the Montreal-based company has shown a big appetite for acquisitions, but recently said expansion is not a current priority. Once a unit within BCE ( BCE.TO ), Yellow Pages has said it wants to focus on integrating and growing the businesses it has acquired in Canada before expanding in the United States.
