 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N said on Wednesday it expects fiscal 2008 operating income to rise in the "low-teens" percentage range, excluding items. 

 The company, which is waiting to close a deal to buy Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N, made the forecast during a conference call to discuss its quarterly earnings. It said the forecast was unchanged from the one it provided last quarter. (Reporting by  Paul Thomasch  and  Kenneth Li )
