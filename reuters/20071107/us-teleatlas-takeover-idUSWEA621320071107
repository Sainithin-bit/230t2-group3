 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch navigation device maker TomTom NV ( TOM2.AS ) raised its offer for Tele Atlas NV TA.AS, the digital map maker, by a hefty 41 percent to outbid Garmin Ltd ( GRMN.O ), and also bought a 28 percent stake in Tele Atlas on Wednesday. 

 The move underscored investor expectations of a costly bidding war in the fast-growing navigation market, driving shares of Garmin down 8 percent, while sending Tele Atlas stock up 19 percent to above TomTom's price. TomTom, the second largest maker of navigation devices, sweetened its bid to 30 euros per share, topping the 24.50-euro offer from larger U.S. rival Garmin last week. The TomTom offer values Tele Atlas at about 2.9 billion euros ($4.2 billion). Analysts expect Garmin to bid again, but said TomTom's purchase of the Tele Atlas stake at 30 euros each could cause its rival headaches. TomTom will be able to keep the stake, even if there is a higher competing bid. "We are less certain now that Garmin's superior financial resources will necessarily lead to a victory," CIBC WorldMarkets analyst Yair Reiner wrote in a note, adding that TomTom could potentially bid up to 40 euros a share for Tele Atlas. "A protracted, costly battle could ultimately end in a stalemate. Also, the decision of TA's insiders to sell their shares to TomTom suggests Garmin's buyout attempt is seen as less than friendly," he said. European market leader TomTom kicked off consolidation in the industry in July by offering to buy Tele Atlas for 1.8 billion euros, seeking to reduce its dependence on selling hardware and put it at the heart of the fast-growing industry by controlling one of just two global digital map makers. Last month, the other global map maker, Navteq Corp NVT.N agreed to an $8.1 billion takeover by cell-phone maker Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE )( NOK.N ). Rabo Securities analyst Frits de Vries agreed that Garmin could raise its bid but added it would pay a steep price with TomTom's bid already worth about 41 times Tele Atlas's 2007 adjusted core earnings. By comparison, Nokia's offer -- seen as a full price at the time -- valued Navteq at 8.6 times 2008 sales and 24.5 times 2008 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to Reuters Estimates. STEEP PRICE Tele Atlas shares rose above TomTom's new offer price to trade up 19 percent at 32.06 euros, signaling that investors believe Garmin may put forward an even higher offer. Garmin shares fell $7.78 to $92.78, and TomTom shares fell 2.7 percent to 55.01 euros. "Garmin could go higher. However, if it did so, it would very likely do a 10 percent capital increase. TomTom also would need a capital increase if it wanted to bid a higher price," Sal. Oppenheim analyst Nicolas von Stackelberg said. Garmin declined comment. Tele Atlas said it would review TomTom's revised offer. A spokesman for TomTom said it would not be forced to sell its stake in Tele Atlas in case of a higher competing bid. "They're ours," the spokesman said. ING analyst Marcel Achterberg said TomTom had created a strong position with a lot of leverage, but cautioned that Garmin also appeared determined to buy Tele Atlas. "They can pay more than TomTom can. The only thing that TomTom can do is to make it as difficult and expensive as possible," Achterberg said. TomTom Chief Executive Harold Goddijn downplayed the effect on his company if it loses the battle for Tele Atlas. "Strictly speaking it's not necessary (to buy Tele Atlas). We're a great company ... everything we do is not dependent on the map vendor," Goddijn told Reuters. "I agree that to move forward in this business, you need to do more than just make hardware, but we have been doing that for two years now ... by acquiring Tele Atlas we could spread our wings into areas where we're currently not playing." Goldman Sachs, ABN AMRO and Rabobank are providing committed financing for the Tele Atlas takeover, TomTom said.
