 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Inventories of unsold goods at U.S. wholesalers rose a larger-than-expected 0.8 percent in September, while sales jumped 1.3 percent, led by a rise in autos and petroleum, government data on Wednesday showed. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters projected wholesale inventories -- unsold stocks held by U.S. businesses or companies for resale to retailers -- would rise 0.2 percent. August was revised upward to 0.7 percent from an original reading of 0.1 percent, the Commerce Department said. Underscoring continuing problems in the housing industry, sales of lumber dropped 2 percent, while inventories fell 0.9 percent. Unsold stocks of furniture fell 0.5 percent. However sales of furniture rose 1.2 percent in September. The inventory-to-sales ratio, a gauge of how long it would take to deplete existing stocks at the current sales pace, fell to a record low 1.10 months' worth in September from 1.11 months in August. Auto sales in September rose 4.1 percent, while inventories rose 1 percent. The auto inventories-to-sales ratio fell to 1.33 months from 1.37 months in August. Petroleum sales rose 7.7 percent in September, while inventories dropped 1.5 percent, the report showed.
