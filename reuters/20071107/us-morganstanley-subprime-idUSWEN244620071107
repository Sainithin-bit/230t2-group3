 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) on Wednesday said it expects fourth-quarter earnings to be reduced by about $2.5 billion from a write-down of its U.S. subprime exposure. 

 The Wall Street investment bank said revenue has been reduced by $3.7 billion for the two months ended October 31 because of the write-down. It said the amount may change this month, when it completes its fiscal year. Morgan Stanley joins a growing list of financial companies, including Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) and Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N, to report large write-downs related to exposure to subprime, or lower quality, debt. Those three companies have in the last four weeks announced about $24 billion of write-downs. Shares of Morgan Stanley nevertheless rose after the company disclosed the loss following the U.S. market close. Some observers had expected a larger write-down. Fox-Pitt Kelton's David Trone on Tuesday said Morgan Stanley might face a $6 billion debt write-down. Morgan Stanley said it had reduced its net exposure to U.S. subprime debt -- defined as the potential loss if all of the debt's value was wiped out -- to $6 billion as of October 31 from $10.4 billion as of August 31. Analysts on average expected Morgan Stanley to report a fourth-quarter profit of $1.83 per share on revenue of $8.83 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Morgan Stanley shares closed down $3.32, or 6.1 percent, to $51.19 in Wednesday trading. They rose as high as $53.50 after-hours, before falling back to $51.95. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
