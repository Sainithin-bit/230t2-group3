 SEATTLE  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) said on Tuesday it dismissed Chief Information Officer Stuart Scott, who ran the company's own information technology department, for violating unspecified company policies. 

 Scott, who reported to Chief Operating Officer Kevin Turner and oversaw IT for Microsoft's 80,000 employees, joined the company more than two years ago from General Electric Co.  ( GE.N ) "We can confirm that Stuart Scott was terminated after an investigation for violation of company policies," said a Microsoft spokesman in a written statement. Microsoft did not specify Scott's actions. General Manager Shahla Aly and Corporate Vice President Alain Crozier will assume Scott's responsibilities until a permanent replacement can be found, Microsoft said.
