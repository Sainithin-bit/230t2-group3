 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Sara Lee Corp SLE.N posted a lower quarterly profit on Wednesday as the food maker was hit by rising costs for wheat and other ingredients. 

 But higher spending on marketing and new products, as well as price increases, helped lift sales, even before the boost from the weaker dollar on overseas sales was factored in. The company, which makes Sara Lee bread, Hillshire Farm lunch meat and Kiwi shoe polish, said profit was $200 million, or 28 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter that ended September 29, compared with $333 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. First quarter results include 18 cents a share from a contingency payment related to tobacco operations the company sold in fiscal year 1999, which the company had previously announced. Results in the year-earlier quarter include a tobacco payment of 16 cents a share, as well as a 21 cents a share tax benefit and 2 cents a share gain on the disposition of discontinued operations, among other items. Sales rose 8.3 percent to $3.13 billion. Excluding the impact of the weaker dollar, acquisitions and divestitures, sales rose 4.5 percent. Units shipped rose 1 percent. Sara Lee has been raising prices to offset soaring costs, while also spending more on marketing and new products to boost sales. The company is also about a year past a major overhaul that saw several businesses sold or spun off. For all of fiscal 2008, Sara Lee said it now expects earnings of $1.00 to $1.06 a share, including the tobacco payment. In August, the company forecast 95 cents to $1.01 a share. The change is due to higher-than-expected foreign currency rates, the company said. Sara Lee shares closed on Tuesday at $16.31 on the New York Stock Exchange.
