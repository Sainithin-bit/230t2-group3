 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will move up the release of minutes from its October 30-31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting to November 20 from November 21. 

 A Fed spokesman said the 2 p.m. EST release was brought forward a day because the originally scheduled date of November 21 is the day before the Thanksgiving holiday. Many Americans leave work early on the day before Thanksgiving to travel to visit their relatives. (Reporting by  David Lawder , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
