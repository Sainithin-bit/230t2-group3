 HUNTSVILLE, Alabama  (Reuters) - The decline of the dollar's value need not dent the Federal Reserve's inflation fighting credentials, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday. 

 "It's certainly not to be dismissed," Lockhart told reporters after speaking to the Huntsville Rotary Club, referring to risks that the Fed's inflation-taming credibility might be under pressure as the U.S. currency loses value. Some economists argue that inflation is a domestic matter and that policy-makers have sufficient tools to manage price pressures, even though  those pressures are influenced by import prices, he said. "Yes I'm concerned, but orderly dollar depreciation I believe is a manageable development," he said. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
