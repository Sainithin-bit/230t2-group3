 HUNTSVILLE, Alabama  (Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart said on Wednesday that he expects slowing growth at the end of 2007 and a return to near-trend expansion as housing markets recover late next year. 

 But Lockhart said the situation is highly uncertain and despite recent signs of resilience in the economy, there is evidence of a business spending retrenchment in his region. "Some anecdotal information contradicts the picture suggested by recent data," he said in a speech to the Huntsville Rotary Club. "Recent feedback from our Reserve Bank board members and other contacts on the ground is somewhat more negative than the numbers suggest," he said. Attitudes toward business investment have grown more cautious, Lockhart said. "I attribute negative sentiment about future capital expenditures more to growing pessimism about economic growth rather than to restrictive credit conditions for businesses," he added. The U.S. central bank has lowered interest rates by a cumulative three-quarter percentage point since the housing downturn threw financial markets into turmoil in August. At the Fed's most recent policy-setting meeting at the end of October, officials said they saw the downside risks to growth roughly in balance with upside risks of inflation, an assertion that many took to suggest that further interest rate reductions are unlikely. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is expected to expand on the Fed's outlook for the economy in testimony before Congress on Thursday. Lockhart said he backed the Fed's decision to cut interest rates by a quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent in October, in part as insurance against downside risks to the broader economy in an uncertain climate. "Much of this uncertainty relates to the potential depth, length and impact of the housing downturn and potential flow-back to Main Street from the turbulence we have seen on Wall Street," he said. So far, however, Lockhart said evidence of spillover from the housing downturn to the broader economy is limited. Personal spending has held up well, and employment has been strong, he said. Net exports have been robust, bolstered by the depreciation of the dollar, he added. Lockhart told reporters after the event that his forecast for growth in the fourth quarter is around 2 percent, perhaps higher. He also said market participants expecting an additional rate reduction at the Fed's meeting in December may have a different take on the economic outlook than he does. "When I observe ... market enthusiasm for a rate cut in December as reflected in futures prices, for example, my interpretation of that is that (market participants) ... may be seeing a development in the market that I don't see at this stage," he said. While readings of core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices, should moderate, recent rises in energy and commodity costs create inflationary risks, Lockhart said. In the meantime, financial markets are likely to stabilize after disruptions from mortgage delinquencies, he said. "Our modern market economy has a keen ability to self-correct as opportunistic capital moves into depressed markets," he added. "This transition is already happening in subprime markets," he said. Financial markets may endure more weeks or months of volatility but will return to normal with better risk management and more available information, Lockhart said. "I would not be one to say that the markets have settled out and that we're out of the woods," he told reporters after his speech. "It will take some time."
