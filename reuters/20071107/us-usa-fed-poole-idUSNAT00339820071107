 MILWAUKEE  (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve President William Poole on Wednesday said further interest rate cuts might be needed if problems in the housing market spread further, but said the Fed needs to be wary not to overshoot and risk stoking inflation. 

 Poole said the ongoing decline in the housing market would likely have a "modest" impact on U.S. economic growth, but the risk of a bigger impact could not be discounted. "It could be that the downdraft from the housing industry will spread to other sectors, which might require that recent rate cuts not be reversed, or even that additional cuts would be in order," Poole said in a speech at Marquette University. "The loss of wealth associated with the decline in housing prices, as well as the fact that mortgage payments will absorb a larger portion of disposable income for some consumers, might cause consumption -- the largest component of GDP -- to grow at a significantly slower rate," he said. Poole, a voting member of the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2007, made it clear the Fed is still in crisis-management mode following the credit crunch that hit financial markets in recent months. Events of recent weeks "show clear progress" in getting financial markets back to normal functioning, although it will take "several years" to resolve the problems with outstanding subprime mortgages and securities backed by such mortgages, Poole said. INFLATION RISKS "It is impossible to determine in advance what the schedule should be for the return to normal monetary policy-making," he said. Still, Poole said, the Fed must be wary not to overshoot. The FOMC has cut the federal funds rate twice in the past two months, taking the benchmark lending rate to 4.5 percent from 5.25 percent. Financial markets currently see about a 70 percent chance that the FOMC will cut rates by a further one-quarter point on December 11, its final meeting of 2007. In the past few weeks rising crude oil prices and a falling U.S. dollar have created fears about rising inflation, months after the central bank's favored inflation measure moved back into the informal "comfort zone" of 1 percent to 2 percent held by some Fed policy-makers. "The Fed needs to be careful to do what is necessary, but not more. Excessive rate reductions would run the risk of increasing inflation in the future," Poole said. "That, in turn, could stoke volatility as the market came to fear future interest rate increases to deal with rising inflation, Poole said. For now, market participants should be confident that the fed funds rate will be steady or lower at the next FOMC meeting, he said. "Barring unusual circumstances, the FOMC would not consider a rate increase after just cutting it fed funds rate target," Poole said. (Reporting by Ros Krasny; Editing by Leslie Adler)
