 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Adult entertainment publisher Playboy Enterprises Inc PLA.N said on Wednesday quarterly profit more than doubled, helped by sales of consumer products and royalties from a licensing deal with the Palms Casino Resort. 

 Playboy also raised its view of profit growth for its licensing business, forecasting a rise in income, excluding items, of 25 percent to 30 percent. Third-quarter net income rose to $2.6 million, or 8 cents a share, from $1.1 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue was essentially flat at $82.8 million, compared with $82.3 million in third quarter 2006. Analysts on average had forecast earnings per share of 6 cents on revenue of $86.1 million, according to Reuters Estimates. By division, the company's entertainment group posted a 23 percent rise in profit to $7.2 million, despite a drop in U.S. television revenue. The publishing group, including its flagship Playboy magazine, posted a wider loss of $1.4 million with lower newsstand and subscription sales. Playboy said it expects fourth-quarter advertising revenue at the magazine to fall 3 percent from a year ago, but anticipates combined print and online ad sales to rise during the period.
