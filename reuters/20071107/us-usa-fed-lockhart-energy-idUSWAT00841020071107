 HUNTSVILLE, Ala  (Reuters) - Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank President Dennis Lockhart on Wednesday said that so far the impact of rising energy prices has been absorbed by the economy, but he said Fed policy-makers can't help but be concerned rising prices will affect headline inflation. 

 "So far it's interesting that the price rises, which have been dramatic in the last several months, have largely been absorbed. But we can't help but be concerned that these rising prices will affect, as I said in my earlier remarks, headline inflation," Lockhart said in answering questions after speaking to a business group here. "Clearly, as measured by headline inflation, these rising prices have the potential of at least creating inflationary pressures," he said. When asked about the declining dollar, the Fed bank president declined to comment on the direction of the currency but noted that studies show there is not always an automatic pass-through to inflation and consumption. "The conventional wisdom is that a continuing depreciating dollar should have some negative effect on inflation rates but some of our research suggests that it's a more complicated picture than that. The pass-through is not necessarily automatic," Lockhart said. (Reporting By Joanne Morrison; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
