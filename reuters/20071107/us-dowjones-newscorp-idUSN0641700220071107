 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N said on Wednesday it is considering nominating Natalie Bancroft, a member of the family involved in selling Dow Jones & Co Inc DJ.N to News for $5.6 billion, to its board. 

 The appointment would require News Corp's board approval, a spokesman said. Natalie is the daughter of Hugh Bancroft III. She has lived in Geneva, Switzerland, and has studied opera. In a letter posted on the Wall Street Journal Web site on Tuesday, Natalie said she has chosen to be an opera singer. Family members missed a deadline to nominate their own candidate for the News Corp board, according to letters posted on the Journal's Web site.
