 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J.C. Penney ( JCP.N ) agreed on Thursday not to sell products designed by Martha Stewart in categories deemed exclusive to Macy's Inc ( M.N ) before a court date in April. 
 The agreement came as a New York judge adjourned a trial over whether Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia ( MSO.N ) breached its contract with Macy's when it entered into a deal with J.C. Penney. The trial was adjourned until April 8 because of scheduling conflicts. Justice Jeffrey Oing of New York state Supreme Court also ordered the companies into mediation in an effort to resolve the dispute. (Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by  Eddie Evans )
