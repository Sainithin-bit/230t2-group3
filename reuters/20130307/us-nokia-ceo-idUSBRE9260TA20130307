 HELSINKI  (Reuters) - Nokia's ( NOK1V.HE ) Chief Executive Stephen Elop took a 45 percent cut in compensation last year, according to a U.S. regulatory filing, as the company continued losing market share to Samsung ( 005930.KS ) and Apple ( AAPL.O ) in smartphones. 
 Elop, hired in 2010 from Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) to turn the Finnish mobile phone maker around, earned 4.33 million euros in compensation in 2012, down from 7.94 million euros a year earlier. His base salary rose by 59,500 euros to 1.08 million euros while stock and option awards fell slightly. He earned no bonus, according to the 20-F filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. ($1 = 0.7692 euros) (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by Alison Birrane)
