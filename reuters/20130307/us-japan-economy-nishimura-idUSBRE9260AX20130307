 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan would suffer 2.3 trillion yen ($24.6 billion) of unrealized losses if long-term rates rise by one percentage point, Deputy Governor Kiyohiko Nishimura said in parliament on Thursday. 
 Japanese government yields have hit multi-year lows recently on monetary easing expectations, but there are some concerns of yields reversing course if the government continues issuing debt and neglects fiscal discipline. The BOJ is a major holder of government debt, which it buys to support its super easy monetary policy. ($1 = 93.5200 Japanese yen) (Reporting by Kaori Kaneko; Editing by Shinichi Saoshiro)
