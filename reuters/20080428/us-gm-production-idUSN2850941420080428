 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) on Monday said it would cut planned truck production at four North American plants in the coming quarter because of weaker demand for its full-size pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles. 

 GM said it would cut one shift of planned production at three Michigan plants and one in Oshawa, Ontario between July and September. On a combined basis, the move will cut 88,000 units of full-size pickup truck production and 50,000 units of SUV production from GM's planned output, the automaker said. GM said it would negotiate layoffs prompted by the reduced production schedule with the United Auto Workers and Canadian Auto Workers unions.
