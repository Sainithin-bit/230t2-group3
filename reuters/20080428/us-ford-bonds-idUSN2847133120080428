 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bonds of Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) rose after Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp said on Monday it intends to make a cash tender offer for up to 20 million shares of the automaker. 

 Ford's 7.45 percent bonds due in 2031 rose to 76 cents on the dollar to yield more than 10 percent, versus 73 cents on the dollar last Thursday, the last significant trade, according to MarketAxess. (Reporting by  Walden Siew ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
