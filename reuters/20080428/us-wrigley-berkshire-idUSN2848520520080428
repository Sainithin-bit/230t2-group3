 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wm Wrigley Jr Co WWY.N said on Monday that billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) will own a minority stake worth more than 10 percent of the gum company, once it becomes a subsidiary of privately held Mars Inc. 

 During a press conference, Wrigley executives declined to say whether Buffett's involvement in financing Mars' takeover of Wrigley included a premise that Buffett would hold the stake for a particular time or sell it. However the executives pointed out that Buffett is usually a long-term investor. Chairman William Wrigley also said the company has not discussed an eventual initial public offering.
