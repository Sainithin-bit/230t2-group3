 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - RadioShack Corp ( RSH.N ), the consumer electronics retailer, posted a drop in first-quarter profit on Monday as sales fell and an increase in promotions hurt gross margin, sending its shares down 12 percent. 

 Earnings fell to $38.8 million, or 30 cents a share, from $42.5 million, or 31 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest result matched analysts' expectations, according to Reuters Estimates. Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said in a research note that gross profit declines accelerated even as sales at stores open at least a year fell less than Goldman expected. He also said free cash flow fell, while operating margin dropped for the first time in six quarters. RadioShack has closed unprofitable stores and cut staff since Julian Day, a turnaround veteran, became chief executive in 2006. But sales have weakened for several quarters, raising concern in a slowing environment for consumer spending. "While RadioShack extracts cost savings ..., we are concerned by lack of a clearly defined strategy to reinvigorate top-line growth," Standard & Poor's Equity analyst Michael Souers said in a research note. Sales declined 4.4 percent to $949 million, but still topped the analysts' average expectation of $940.8 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year, or comparable-store sales, fell 4 percent in the quarter. Sales declines for Sprint wireless services offset gains for navigation systems, video gaming, digital cameras and media storage. The company, which competes with Best Buy Co ( BBY.N ) and other chains, said sales and earnings trends improved during February and March after a "very challenging" January. "The absence of a sales pullback in March was impressive given the broad backdrop," Goldman's Fassler said. "Still, we expect sales trends to take a back seat to profit performance." The company's lower gross margin rate reflected strong sales in lower-margin products, price pressure on navigation units and an increase in promotional activity. RadioShack shares were off $2.09 to $15.41 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading. The shares have fallen about 44 percent in the past year.
