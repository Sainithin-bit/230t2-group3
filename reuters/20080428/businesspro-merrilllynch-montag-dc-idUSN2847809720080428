 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N said it 
hired Thomas Montag, former co-head of global securities 
trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), as Chief Executive 
John Thain looks to new talent to turn around the largest 
brokerage in the world. 

  Merrill Lynch has been courting Montag for months. Montag, 
51, retired from Goldman Sachs in December after working at the 
firm for 22 years.  Merrill Lynch posted a $2 billion first-quarter loss 
earlier this month amid losses in subprime mortgages, 
collateralized debt obligations, and other risky instruments. 
It has recorded more than $30 billion of write-downs since the 
third quarter.  Thain has brought aboard other senior executives since 
taking the reins at Merrill late last year, including Nelson 
Chai, NYSE Euronext's NYX.N chief financial officer, who was 
hired in December. In January, Merrill Lynch named Noel Donohoe 
co-chief risk officer. Donohoe was a former chief risk officer 
at Goldman Sachs.  Thain himself was a 24-year veteran of Goldman Sachs, and 
headed NYSE Euronext before moving to Merrill Lynch.  (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Gerald E. McCormick
