 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The chief executive of UAL Corp, parent of United Airlines, said on Monday the carrier continues to weigh its options now that Continental Airlines Inc has pulled out of merger discussions. 

 "With Continental's announcement yesterday, the dynamics in the U.S. airline industry continue to evolve," Tilton said in a message to employees. "Each airline has options and will make its own decisions. We continue to evaluate our options and will do what is right for United," Tilton said. Tilton did not address Reuters and other reports that United is in advanced discussions with US Airways on a merger, now that prospects of a deal with Continental have fizzled.
