 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A federal judge in California has 
cleared the way for Barbie doll maker Mattel Inc MAT.N to go 
forward with its lawsuit against ex-employee and Bratz dolls 
inventor Carter Bryant. 

  Mattel, the world's largest toy maker, had claimed it owns 
MGA Entertainment's Bratz dolls because Bryant conceived the 
big-headed, pouty-lipped toys while he worked as a Barbie 
designer.  In a ruling issued on Friday, U.S. District Judge Stephen 
Larson said "the undisputed facts establish that Bryant 
breached his fiduciary duty to communicate his inventions to 
Mattel when, rather than doing so, he secretly entered into a 
contract with Mattel's competitor, while still employed by 
Mattel."  Sales of Barbie dolls have waned in recent years amid 
fierce competition from Bratz dolls, which burst onto the 
market in 2001. Mattel said this month the Bratz litigation was 
a factor in its $46.6 million first-quarter loss.  "The facts are on our side and we are confident we will 
prevail at trial," MGA Chief Executive Isaac Larian said in a 
statement. " MGA ... built Bratz -- and no one else."  (Reporting by  Justin Grant , with additional reporting by
