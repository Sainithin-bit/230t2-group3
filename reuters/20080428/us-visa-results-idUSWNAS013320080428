 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Visa Inc ( V.N ), the world's largest credit card network, said on Monday that quarterly earnings rose, helped by declining tax expense, but the company's shares fell in after-market trading. 

 The San Francisco-based company said net income for its fiscal second quarter ended March 31 was $314 million, or 39 cents per class A share, compared with pro forma results of $246 million in the same quarter last year. Visa went public in March and these results are its first as a public company. Operating income fell during the quarter, to $349 million from a pro forma $394 million in the same quarter in 2007, hurt by higher advertising and marketing expenses and more money being set aside for litigation. Operating revenue rose to $1.45 billion from $1.19 billion. In after-market trading, Visa traded at $72.67, down nearly 4 percent from Monday's close of $75.63.
