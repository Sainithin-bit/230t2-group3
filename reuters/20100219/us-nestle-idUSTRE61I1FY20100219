 VEVEY, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Nestle ( NESN.VX ), the world's biggest food group, surpassed expectations with 4.1 percent organic growth for 2009, weathering the economic woes better than its competitors. 

 Analysts had expected the Swiss company, whose brands include Nescafe coffee, Gerber baby food and Perrier sparkling water, to post 3.9 percent full-year organic growth. Nestle's full-year sales for the full year were 108 billion Swiss francs ($99.91 billion), also exceeding the average forecast of 105.9 billion francs in a Reuters analyst poll. "With organic growth of 4.1 percent achieved in last year's challenging environment, we were able to grow substantially faster than our industry," Chief Executive Officer Paul Bulcke said in a statement. More details are expected to follow at a press conference at 0900 GMT.
