 TOKYO  (Reuters) - A Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) executive said on Tuesday he was "surprised" at the strength of the U.S. market in July, but that the automaker would have to gauge demand in August and September before making any revisions to its sales forecast. 

 "When you look at the indicators for consumer sentiment (in the United States), they're actually weak," Senior Managing Director Takahiko Ijichi told reporters. "The government's incentives are helping, but will this really lead to a recovery in real demand? That's hard to say." Toyota kept its North American vehicle sales forecast for this financial year at 1.86 million vehicles. (Reporting by  Chang-Ran Kim )
