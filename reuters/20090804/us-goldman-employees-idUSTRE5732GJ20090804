 Blankfein, who first asked employees to avoid large purchases late last year, has stepped up his campaign in recent weeks, a source told the paper. "This is a sensitive time for us, and wants to make sure that we're not being seen living high on the hog," the paper quoted an anonymous Goldman executive as saying. Goldman has faced a torrent of unwanted publicity recently including an unflattering story in Rolling Stone magazine, which accused the bank of having a key role in various market bubbles stretching back to the 1920s.
