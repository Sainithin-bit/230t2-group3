 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat, told Reuters that the Senate may vote as early as Wednesday to approve a $2 billion extension of the popular cash-for-clunkers consumer rebate program to spur automobile sales. 

 Stabenow said she was "pretty optimistic" that the chamber would approve the additional funding for the program in a bill identical to that passed last week by the U.S. House of Representatives. The Senate is scheduled to recess on Friday for a month- long vacation. The Senate vote will occur "maybe tomorrow," Stabenow said in a brief interview. Under the initial $1 billion program, older vehicles qualify for the clunkers program if they get 18 miles or less to the gallon and are less than 25 years old. For cars, the new vehicle has to have a combined fuel economy of at least 22 miles per gallon. Details on the program are available at www.cars.gov.
