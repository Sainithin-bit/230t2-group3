 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ), the world's biggest automaker, reported its third straight quarterly loss but lifted its bearish forecast to call for a smaller loss this year as deep cost reductions help make up for some of the slump in global vehicle sales. 

 Analysts said the company's increased sales forecast was conservative and left room for a further rise later. Following are initial reactions from analysts and investors: COMMENTARY: KAZUTAKA OSHIMA, CEO, RAKUTEN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "It was not dismal, but was not as good as the market had expected. "Even though Toyota lowered its loss expectations, they don't seem to be positive enough, compared with what the market had expected after seeing figures from parts makers." MICHAEL SOHN, AUTO ANALYST, WOORI INVESTMENT & SECURITIES, SEOUL "Hyundai is unlikely to continue to outperform Toyota from now on as the won is rising while the yen is seen falling on hopes for a global economic recovery. That will force Hyundai to reduce marketing costs while Toyota can increase such expenses." "The global recovery should help Toyota better compete with Hyundai as more customers are expected to look for pricier cars. And Hyundai's assurance program in the U.S. is bound to attract fewer customers since fewer people will be worried about losing jobs." "Improvements in global car sales may slow down as global government incentives to boost demand fade and because many consumers already purchased their cars thanks to those incentives." DAPHNE ROTH, HEAD OF ASIA EQUITY RESEARCH, ABN AMRO PRIVATE BANK, SINGAPORE "What we have seen is the car sector have improved because of better inventory management, so you can see companies like Honda and Nissan have reported good results that beat expectations. "Recently we have also seen the sales figures from the U.S. where auto sales reached 11.3 million (units) so we are back to pre-Lehman volume. I think a lot of this due to the government incentives like 'cash for clunkers', so it seems the worst could be over," PETER ELSTON, STRATEGIST, ABERDEEN ASSET MANAGEMENT ASIA, SINGAPORE Aberdeen holds Toyota in its regional and Japan funds. "This cash-for-clunkers thing is having an impact though arguably it is temporary. This isn't sustainable. "If you want to be in the car industry, than you want to own Toyota. Our view on Toyota is that it is the best car company in the world, or at least one of the best. It's been ahead in the push to build hybrid cars. Elston said that despite the troubles faced by the auto makers, the industry is still growing and the next 10 to 20 years will see the introduction of new players with new designs and cars powered with new sources of energy. "Our strategy to buy the steady eddies and avoid the losers." TATSUO YOSHIDA, ANALYST, UBS SECURITIES, TOKYO "My first impression of the first-quarter results is that they are better than expected. Sales in Asia exceeded my prediction while sales in other markets were mainly in line with expectations." "I see good chance of another upward revision to the company's full-year earnings forecasts. Given the size of a operating loss in the first quarter, the company is far from incurring the forecast operating loss of 750 billion yen in the full year." KAZUYUKI TERAO, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER AT RCM JAPAN, TOKYO "The first-quarter results were slightly better than expected. But the company's forecast had been conservative and there had been expectations following the good results by Honda and Nissan, so there is no surprise. "The company's latest forecast leaves room for later upward revisions. Sales and production are likely to increase from the second quarter on thanks to government incentive measures. "I think the first quarter was the bottom for Toyota and it is likely to return to profitability on quarterly basis around the third quarter." MARKET ACTION: -- Toyota shares closed down 1.5 percent at 4,030 yen before the results were announced. -- They have gained 37 percent in the year to date, against a 17 percent rise in the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225 .
