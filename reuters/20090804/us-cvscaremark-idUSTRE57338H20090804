 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - CVS Caremark Corp posted a bigger-than-expected jump in quarterly profit and raised its 2009 forecast on Tuesday as consumers filled more prescriptions at its drugstores and through its pharmacy benefits unit. 

 CVS sales also got a lift from Easter moving into the second quarter, higher cigarette prices and consumers buying products to fight the H1N1 flu. It also sold more generic drugs and private label goods, which boosted profit. The company did not give specific guidance for fiscal 2010, but Chief Executive Tom Ryan said he would be disappointed if earnings per share did not rise at least 13 to 15 percent. He also said last fall's acquisition of Longs Drug Stores should not cut into 2009 earnings as much as CVS had expected. CVS declined to say whether it was looking at other deals, particularly Aetna Inc's PBM business. Shares were down 1.56 percent at $33.47 after rising as high as $35.50. Shares of rivals Walgreen Co and Rite Aid Corp were down 2.93 percent and 4.12 percent. "What we're seeing is basically the strength of the combined PBM retail model really working here, and it's unique to CVS," said Sarah Henry, retail analyst at MFC Global Investment Management. CVS shares had already risen 18 percent this year, outpacing a 11 percent rise in the S&P 500. "I'm still in the 'buy' camp on the stock," said Henry, who has a $42 price target on CVS over the next year. Her firm owns about 230,000 CVS shares in its Sovereign Investors Fund. PROFIT, REVENUE TOP STREET VIEWS CVS has benefited from its "Maintenance Choice" program, which allows customers to pick up 90-day prescriptions in its stores at the same lower price they would pay if getting the drugs through the mail. CVS added 20 clients to Maintenance Choice during the quarter, bringing the total to 270. With more than 3,000 PBM clients overall, there is still room for growth, but Chief Financial Officer Dave Rickard said CVS does not have a specific target of how many clients it could add to the plan. Second-quarter earnings rose 15 percent to $886.5 million, or 60 cents per share. Excluding one-time items, earnings from continuing operations rose to 65 cents per share, ahead of analysts' average forecast of 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. CVS said net revenue increased 17.6 percent to $24.9 billion, topping analysts' forecast of $24.4 billion. Pharmacy services revenue jumped 22.1 percent to $13 billion. Revenue in the retail pharmacy segment, which includes nearly 7,000 drugstores, climbed 17.2 percent to $13.8 billion. Those figures combined are higher than the total net revenue since both segments record sales when pharmacy services customers fill prescriptions in CVS stores. Sales at stores open at least a year rose a sharper-than-expected 6.1 percent, after increasing 3.3 percent in the first quarter and 3.1 percent in the second quarter of 2008. CVS said same-store sales should rise 6 percent to 8 percent this quarter and 4 percent to 6 percent in 2009. Such growth would outpace the results rivals posted for July. On Tuesday, Walgreen said its July same-store sales rose 2 percent as sales of fans and other seasonal products were a bit slow. Last week, Rite Aid said its July same-store sales fell 0.6 percent. CVS expects to report 2009 adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $2.59 to $2.64 per share, up from a previous forecast of $2.55 to $2.63. Analysts on average had been expecting $2.52. Rickard attributed the higher outlook to strong results so far and optimism for the rest of the year. Revenue should rise 19 percent to 21 percent in the current quarter and 12 percent to 14 percent this year, he said. One profit driver is CVS's focus on higher-margin private label goods. CVS is adding about 900 products ranging from cold remedies to stationery under its own labels this year. Private label products accounted for 15.4 percent of general merchandise sales in the quarter and that level should rise as the year progresses. "I'd be very disappointed if we didn't get it" to 16 percent, Rickard said. (Reporting by Jessica Wohl; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, John Wallace and  Robert MacMillan )
