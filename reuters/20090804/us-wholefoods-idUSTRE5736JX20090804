 SEATTLE (Reuters) -Whole Foods Market Inc WFMI.O on Tuesday posted third quarter earnings that beat Wall Street's expectations, as sales rose, and the seller of organic and gourmet food products raised its full-year earnings forecast. 

 Its shares shot up more than 10 percent in extended trade, after closing at $24.82 on the Nasdaq. Austin, Texas-based Whole Foods said net income rose to $42.8 million, or 25 cents per share, for the fiscal third-quarter ended July 5, from $33.9 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, expected 20 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose to $1.88 billion from $1.84 billion. Whole Foods raised its full-year per-share earnings forecast to 80 cents to 82 cents, including some asset impairment charges. It had previously expected to earn 65 cents a share to 70 cents a share on that basis. The company, which specializes in organic, natural and gourmet products, has cut jobs and pared spending as it works to be more competitive on prices amid a weak economy.
