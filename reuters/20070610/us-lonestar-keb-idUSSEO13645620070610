 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. investment firm Lone Star LS.UL has stopped talks with Singapore's DBS Group Holdings Ltd. ( DBSM.SI ) to sell Korea Exchange Bank (KEB), Yonhap news quoted Lone Star's chairman as saying on Sunday. 

 John Grayken didn't give the reason for the end of the talks, but told the news agency in an interview that the Dallas-based fund would keep looking for a buyer for KEB 004940.KS, despite a legal battle over the 2003 purchase of the bank. South Korean prosecutors said in December that the $1.2 billion acquisition was illegal because of flaws in the sale process. Grayken said in translated Korean that DBS had approached Lone Star after talks for a $7.3 billion sale of KEB to top South Korean lender Kookmin Bank 060000.KS were terminated in November. Several other investors had asked for negotiations to buy KEB, South Korea's fifth-largest bank, but little progress has been made, the chairman added, declining to identify them. DBS had worked to form a consortium with South Korean bank Nonghyup to buy KEB, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters in March. Grayken said KEB could be sold within this year if conditions are met, and the potential buyer should be qualified to obtain South Korean regulatory approval. The fund may put part of its KEB shares up for sale if it failed to sell its whole 64.62 percent stake in the lender, the chairman said. It can sell up to a 70.87 percent stake in KEB, which has a market value of 6.6 trillion won ($7.1 billion), by exercising options with other investors. His remarks contrasted with analysts expectation that the fund would not be able to sell KEB until all legal proceedings were settled, and instead would focus on receiving dividends from KEB. Lone Star in February secured a $445 million dividend payout from KEB, the first time the bank had paid a dividend in a decade. It is auctioning off two other South Korean assets - leasing firm STARLease and Kukdong Engineering & Construction, with ABN AMRO AAH.AS advising on the deals. Shares of KEB have risen 12.8 percent in the year to date, underperforming a 20.4 percent gain in the wider market  .KS11 , amid uncertainty over Lone Star's stake sale. Separately, the U.S. firm plans to raise $5 billion at the end of 2007 via a new fund, which will be its seventh, the chairman said. ($1=930.7 won)
