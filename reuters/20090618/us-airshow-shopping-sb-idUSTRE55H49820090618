 (Reuters) - Alongside planemakers and airlines signing multi-billion-dollar aircraft deals, the Paris Air Show buzzes with aerospace and defense firms selling everything from rivets to fighter-plane ejector seats. 

 Here are five of the more unusual things for sale: AN MTV DECOY FLARE - $40 An MTV flare has nothing to do with music television. Magnesium/Teflon/Viton flares mimic the infrared heat signature of jet engines and helicopters. French firm Lacroix Defense & Security sells MTV flares for helicopters and transport planes such as the C-130. NITROGEN SUITCASE - $6,500 Not something you would find in the average DIY enthusiast's shed, but a must-have for armies and airports. Unlike oxygen, nitrogen gas does not expand when it heats up, and that is why it is used to pump up aircraft tires and evacuation chutes. Wheeling a traditional nitrogen pump to a plane takes time, but British firm Hale Hamilton has squeezed a nitrogen pump into a 21 kilogram suitcase. ROBO-BALL - $100,000 The Swedish-built "GroundBot" is a 25-kilogram, knee-high ball with built-in cameras. Unlike other remote-control surveillance robots it does not get stuck in mud, sand or snow and it even swims. You can see the device in action on the company's website:  www.rotundus.se . F-35 EJECTOR SEAT - $200,000 This is one safety feature that has to work when you need it. British firm Martin-Baker's first ejector seat, tested live in 1946, took a full nine seconds between the pilot pulling the handle and the parachute deploying. Its newest Mk.16 seat for the Lockheed Martin Corp-built F-35 Joint Strike Fighter works in less than 2 seconds, exposing the pilot to G-forces of up to 30G. HARRY POTTER'S FLYING EYE - $1 million Belgian-based Flying-Cam's helicopter weighs just 25 kilograms and looks like a big dragonfly. Its gyro-stabilized camera and quiet electric engine make it a favorite of film makers and the flying eye has provided aerial perspectives in several Harry Potter films and other movies such as The Kite Runner and Hancock. Now the company wants to sell the eye to industrial clients to inspect things such as oil refineries.
