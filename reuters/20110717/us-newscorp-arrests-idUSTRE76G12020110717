 (Reuters) - British police arrested Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International, on Sunday, media reported. 

 She was the tenth person to be arrested by British police in connection with the News of the World phone hacking scandal since detectives reopened their investigation earlier this year. London's Metropolitan Police have launched probes into allegations of the hacking of phone voicemail messages by journalists at the now-closed newspaper, part of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp empire, and claims reporters bribed police for information. Here are details of the arrests: * A flame-haired 43-year-old, Brooks had become the focus of widespread anger over a phone-hacking scandal at the company she headed. She had a remarkable rise to power in the male-dominated world of UK tabloid journalism, becoming editor of the News of the World in 2000 and the Sun's first female editor in 2003. In 2009, she was promoted to become chief executive of News International, News Corp's British arm, reporting to Murdoch's son James. She resigned on July 15. * Neil Wallis, 60, deputy editor of News of the World when Andy Coulson was editor, was arrested on July 14 on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications. Wallis, who was previously a deputy editor of the Sun and editor of the People, became executive editor of News of the World in 2007. * Andy Coulson, 43, editor of News of the World from 2003 to 2007, then Prime Minister David Cameron's communications chief until his recent resignation, was arrested on July 8 on suspicion of corruption and attempting to intercept communications. * Clive Goodman, 53, former News of the World royal editor, was arrested at his home on July 8 because of allegations he bribed police for stories. Goodman had previously been jailed for four months in 2007 for writing stories that used information gleaned from phone hacking by private detective Glen Mulcaire. * An unidentified 63-year-old man, described as a private detective in the media, was arrested in Surrey on July 8 on suspicion of corruption. * Laura Elston, a 34-year-old reporter for the British Press Association news agency, was arrested on June 27 on suspicion of unlawfully intercepting voicemail messages. She was the first person not to have worked for News of the World to be arrested. * A 39-year-old woman, who the BBC and national newspapers said they believed to be Terenia Taras, was arrested at her home in Yorkshire on June 24 on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications. Media said Taras was a freelance journalist who contributed to the News of the World until 2006 and the ex-girlfriend of Greg Miskiw, a former assistant editor at the paper. * James Weatherup, 55, a senior News of the World reporter, was arrested on April 14 on suspicion of conspiracy to unlawfully intercept communications and unlawful interception of mobile phones. Weatherup was news editor of the News of the World between 2004 and 2006, when Coulson was editor. * Neville Thurlbeck, 50, the News of the World's chief reporter and Ian Edmondson, 42, a former senior editor at the paper, were arrested on April 5 on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications and unlawful interception of voicemail messages.
