 BANGKOK  (Reuters) - Thailand's economy grew at its fastest rate in 15 years in the first quarter of 2010, surprising analysts, and a state agency forecast growth of up to 4.5 percent this year, but recent riots raise questions about the outlook. Powered by a surge in exports, Southeast Asia's second-biggest economy expanded 3.8 percent in the first quarter of this year from the previous quarter, more than double the 1.8 rise expected by most economists. On an annual basis, the economy grew 12 percent, its strongest pace in 15 years. 

 But the data for coming quarters will reflect the toll of weeks of political violence that began in April with a deadly gun battle in Bangkok's old quarter and descended into urban warfare, riots and widespread arson attacks in May. Nine weeks of anti-government protests that ended with a military crackdown last Wednesday have pared Thailand's growth this year by 1.5 percentage point, said Amphon Kitti-amphon, chief of the National Economic and Social Development Board. The unrest could inflict some economic damage in the April-June quarter but the economy would register positive growth on a quarterly basis, Amphon added. That could change in the third quarter if the political violence persisted, he said. But economists expected a contraction in the second quarter. "Outstanding first-quarter growth was much anticipated but I think what we have to keep an eye on is the second-quarter growth which will seriously take a hit from political violence in Bangkok," said Pimonwan Mahujchariyawong, an economist at Kasikorn Research Center in Bangkok. Usara Wilaipich, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said: "The pace of recovery in the second half of this year will depend on the political outlook, which remains highly uncertain." Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was also wary. "The data reflected strong fundamentals of the Thai economy on exports, tourism, domestic consumption, production capacity as well as private investment," he told reporters. "But the data we have to keep a watch on is the second-quarter data in May and June which will see the impact of protest more clearly." RATES ON HOLD? Despite the unrest, Thailand's state planning agency did not revise down its full-year economic forecast of 3.5 to 4.5 percent as some expected, in part because the first quarter was surprisingly strong, economists said. That is broadly in line with the central bank and finance ministry. Economists polled by Reuters last week forecast 4.3 percent for 2010. Economists said the disruption to the economy could also persuade the central bank to leave interest rates on hold at a record low 1.25 percent at its next review on June 2. But, with the protests over, most expect rates to start rising, perhaps from July or August. Thai bond yields jumped in early trading after an enforced two-day break, as the market began to price in a rate rise, traders said. In early deals, benchmark five-year bond yields rose eight basis points to 3.20 percent. The baht firmed but Thai stocks .SETI were off 1.6 percent. Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told Reuters on Friday he would be surprised if the economy managed to grow at all in the April-June quarter. He estimated the unrest had already cut 0.3-0.5 point off growth this year. He had expected growth of 4.5-5.0 percent. The Bank of Thailand (BOT) on April 29 raised its 2010 economic growth forecast to 4.3-5.8 percent from 3.3-5.3 percent seen in January. But it said the projection would have been 0.9 percentage point higher but for the political turmoil and it was based on the worst-case scenario.
