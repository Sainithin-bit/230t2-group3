 BEIJING  (Reuters) - The global economy has been strengthening faster than expected, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Monday during talks with China in Beijing. 

 Earlier in the day, Geithner also said the United States and China needed to work together to reduce trade barriers and develop a more balanced global economy. Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton are leading a delegation of nearly 200 U.S. officials in the talks, which will range from trade to how to contain Iran's nuclear ambitions and North Korea's alleged sinking of a South Korean warship in March.
