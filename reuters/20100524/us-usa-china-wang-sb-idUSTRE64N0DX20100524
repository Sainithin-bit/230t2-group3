 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese Vice Premier Wang Qishan said the goal of U.S.-China talks that got under way in Beijing on Monday is to promote strong, sustainable global growth. 

 Wang, who spoke at the Great Hall of the People at the start of the two-day Strategic and Economic Dialogue (S&ED), added that the two countries' economic ties have enjoyed dynamic growth and were a major cornerstone of the overall relationship. "With increasingly close links, our two economies have become inseparable. This has been particularly true since the outbreak of the international financial crisis, when our two countries have been acting together to tide over the difficulties," Wang said. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, leading the U.S. delegation, earlier said the talks would cover many of the commercial and foreign policy issues that have sometimes created rifts between the world's biggest and third biggest economies. But initial comments from both sides were upbeat. "Both China and the United States are faced with many challenges and deep-seated problems," Wang said. "I'm confident that through the current round we will expand common ground, narrow differences and work together to push forward the firm and steady growth of U.S.-China relations."
