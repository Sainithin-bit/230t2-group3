 BANGKOK  (Reuters) - The Thai economy grew much more strongly than expected in the first quarter of 2010 and the state planning agency maintained its forecast of 3.5 to 4.5 percent GDP growth this year despite political unrest. 

 The state agency that compiles the data still expects quarter-on-quarter growth in April-June because of strong exports but several economists forecast a contraction, one saying it could be at least 4 percent because of the violence. Another said her forecast for 2010 growth was a below-consensus 2.8 percent but forecasts for the full year cover a wide range. Another economist expected 6 percent. The prime minister said the first-quarter data showed economic fundamentals were good but said May and June data needed to be watched to get an idea of the impact of the unrest. ************************************************************* KEY POINTS - The state planning agency expects 2010 GDP growth of 3.5-4.5 percent, unchanged from February. - Q1 GDP up 3.8 percent q/q and 12 percent y/y, much higher than forecast - Annual rate highest in 15 years - Reuters poll: Q1 GDP seen +1.8 pct q/q and +8.9 pct y/y - For a graphic here - - - - - COMMENTS DAVID COHEN, ECONOMIST, ACTION ECONOMICS, SINGAPORE "It was stronger than expected in line with bullish reports in the region, paced by strong manufacturing that rose 22.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter that was also supported by the bounce in exports in line with the pattern in the region. "Of course, in Thailand, everybody is waiting to see how things are going to change because of the political turmoil, which would likely cause a GDP contraction of about 2.5 percent quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter. "Nevertheless, because of the strong first quarter, the economy is pointing to 6 percent growth for the whole of 2010 even if we see flat GDP in the second half. "I suspect the Bank of Thailand will remain on hold for the time being, waiting to see how the political turmoil plays out." - - - - PIMONWAN MAHUJCHARIYAWONG, ECONOMIST, KASIKORN RESEARCH CENTER "Outstanding first quarter growth was much anticipated but I think what we have to keep an eye on is the second-quarter growth which will seriously take a hit from political violence in Bangkok, especially after May 19." "While we expect the GDP 2010 in a range of 2.6-4.5 percent, we expect a quarter-on-quarter contraction in the second quarter of at least 4 percent because of this. Year-on-year growth will also slow." "In the near term, the central bank will probably continue to use loose monetary policy for a while. We still expect them to raise the rate in the second half." - - - - USARA WILAIPICH, ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK "Going forward, Thailand's economic recovery should remain on track. Nevertheless, we expect economic growth to decelerate sharply in the second quarter of 2010 due to the adverse impact of the political chaos in recent weeks, which has damaged the country's tourism, household consumption and business sentiment. "Meanwhile, the pace of recovery in the second half of 2010 will depend on the political outlook, which remains highly uncertain. Hence, the fragile growth prospect in the near term will keep the BOT cautious on its monetary policy decision. Overall, we maintain our below-consensus GDP growth forecast of 2.8 percent for 2010." - - - - - SOMPRAWIN MANPRASERT, ECONOMIST, TISCO SECURITIES "Economic growth in the second quarter should be slower than the first due to the situation. But we are going to revise up our GDP projection to above 4 percent from 3.9 percent previously expected as first-quarter GDP was much higher more than we expected. Overall, 2010 GDP should be helped by exports, domestic consumption and private investment." "However, the recent unrest will have a significant impact on tourism and the sector might not recover quickly due to security jitters." "We think the central bank will delay its rate hike decision to July, because it may need to take time to assess the political impact on the economy. We still expected rates to rise by 75-100 basis points this year." - - - - MARKETS - The baht was at 32.36/42 per dollar, little changed after the data but a bir firmer than last week. - The Thai stock exchange reopened at 0300 GMT after a two-day interruption caused by political events. It was down 1.6 percent at 0353 GMT. - Five-year bond yields rose eight basis points in opening deals to near two-week highs of 3.20 percent as traders began to think about monetary policy tightening. - - - - BACKGROUND - Thailand's $264 billion economy -- Southeast Asia's second largest -- emerged from a brief recession in the second quarter of 2009, when it grew 2.1 percent from the previous quarter as manufacturing rebounded. The recession was the first since the 1998 Asian economic crisis. - Despite the strong performance in the first quarter, growth in the second quarter is expected to be hard hit by violent protests since April. Kasikorn Research expected a sharp quarterly contraction in the second quarter. - Finance Minister Korn Chatikavanij told Reuters on Friday he would be "very surprised" if the economy managed to grow at all in the April-June quarter. He estimated the unrest had already cut 0.3-0.5 percentage point off growth this year. He had expected growth of 4.5-5.0 percent. - The Bank of Thailand (BOT) on April 29 raised its 2010 economic growth forecast to 4.3-5.8 percent from 3.3-5.3 percent seen in January. But it said the projection would have been 0.9 percentage point higher without the political turmoil and it was based on a worst case scenario. - The BOT has left its key policy rate at a record low of 1.25 percent sice April 2009 to help revive the economy. Economists expect it may leave it there for some months following the unrest. - The government plans to spend 1.43 trillion baht ($43 billion) over three years from last September to spur the economy.
