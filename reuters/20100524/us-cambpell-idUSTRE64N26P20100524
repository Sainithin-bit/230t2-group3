 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ) posted higher sales in its key U.S. soup market, helped by increased promotional spending. 

 The world's largest soup maker also said profit dipped to $168 million, or 49 cents a share, in the third quarter ended May 2 from $174 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 54 cents a share. Sales rose 6.9 percent to $1.80 billion, in line with the analysts' average estimate. Sales in the key U.S. soup segment rose 2 percent. Campbell's has come under pressure for falling U.S. soup sales as shoppers sought out other "simple meals" like frozen foods. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
