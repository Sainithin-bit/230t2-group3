 (Reuters) - Sweeping financial regulatory reforms moving through Congress took a step closer to becoming law when the Senate passed a bill on Thursday. 

 The Senate bill must be melded with a measure that cleared the House of Representatives in December. Following is a look at provisions in both bills that affect the Federal Reserve: CONSUMER PROTECTION The Senate bill sets up a consumer protection bureau within the Fed and funded by the Fed. The new agency would have power to write consumer protection rules, but the Fed would have a role overseeing the agency. The House bill proposes a new, fully independent U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Agency to regulate mortgages, credit cards and other products. SYSTEMIC RISK REGULATION The Senate measure sets up an inter-agency Financial Stability Oversight Council chaired by the Treasury Secretary to watch for dangers that could roil the wider financial system, giving the Fed some powers to take action. The House creates a similar council, but gives the Fed a much larger role in executing policy by setting limits for large, interconnected firms that could threaten economic stability. The Senate bill formally gives the Fed responsibility for monitoring and defusing risks to U.S. financial stability. The House bill allows the Fed to limit credit exposures at financial firms, block acquisitions, restrict pay and shut down undercapitalized firms. SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FIRMS The Senate bill puts the Fed in charge of supervising all financial firms with assets greater than $50 billion that could rock the financial system if they collapsed. The House bill lets a systemic risk council impose stricter standards for systemically important financial firms. AUDITS The House bill allows reviews of Fed monetary policy decisions by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional investigative agency. The Senate bill calls for a one-time audit of the Fed's emergency lending during the 2007-2009 crisis, but does not touch monetary policy. The Fed successfully fought off a Senate provision that would have exposed it to repeated audits of its emergency lending. GOVERNANCE The Senate bill makes the president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank a presidential appointee subject to Senate confirmation, instead of a pick of the New York Fed's board of directors, as is currently the case. It also establishes a Fed Vice Chairman for supervision. Further, it puts the Fed's Washington-based Board of Governors in charge of appointing all of the directors of the 12 regional Fed banks around the country, and stipulates that bankers supervised by the Fed can't serve on these boards. Currently, regional Fed boards are composed of a combination of bankers, people picked by bankers, and people chosen by the Fed Board in Washington. The House bill makes no similar changes. EMERGENCY POWERS The Senate bill eliminates the Fed's ability to lend to firms that do not already have access to its emergency lending facilities. During the financial crisis, the Fed provided funds to some non-bank Wall Street firms, citing a rarely used emergency provision of law. Usually, it lends only to banks. The House bill puts a specific $4 trillion cap on Fed emergency lending and imposes controls by other agencies. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by Andrew Hay)
