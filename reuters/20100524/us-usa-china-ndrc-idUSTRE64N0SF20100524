 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Europe's debt crisis will affect demand for Chinese goods, the state planning commission said on Monday, as the United States and China held talks in Beijing. 

 Zhang Xiaoqiang, vice chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, told a news conference that China had discussed the euro's exchange rate during talks with the United States, but neither side talked about the yuan. (Reporting by Chris Buckley; Writing by Lee Chyen Yee)
