 (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L cabin crew began a new strike on Monday after weekend talks to resolve the long-running dispute broke down in acrimony. 

 Here is a timeline of events in the battle between BA and the Unite union, which represents BA staff: October 5, 2009 - BA announces plan to cut 1,700 staff in Britain and implement a two-year freeze in basic pay for cabin crew. October 7 - Unite says BA must abandon plans to cut jobs and resume talks or face possible strike action by cabin crew in the run-up to Christmas. October 30 - Unite launches a legal challenge against BA's plan to change working patterns for 14,000 cabin crew, which fails. December 14 - BA cabin crew call a 12-day strike planned over Christmas, hours after the airline revealed a 3.7 billion pound hole in its pension fund. December 15 - BA takes legal action to halt the 12-day strike by cabin crew and two days later wins a court ruling stopping the Christmas strike action. January 20, 2010 - Unite says it will re-ballot staff but BA cabin crew say they will not strike over the Easter holiday period because of the public backlash over the planned Christmas strike. January 25 - Unite opens a new strike ballot after two weeks of talks with BA fail to secure a deal. February 19 - Unite loses a High Court bid to overturn changes to cabin crews' working arrangements. February 22 - More than 80 percent of the 9,000 BA cabin crew balloted by Unite back industrial action. March 4 - BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh says 6,000 staff have volunteered to step in and keep the airline operating in the event of a strike. March 12 - Unite says its members will strike for three days from March 20 and for four days from March 27, while BA remove a formal offer made to staff the day before and conditional on Unite not naming any strike dates. March 15 - Prime Minister Gordon Brown says a strike by BA cabin crew is "unjustified and deplorable" and should be called off. March 19 - Unite announces that talks with management have collapsed and the strike is to go ahead from midnight. March 22 - BA says full year earnings expectations were unchanged as contingency plans for dealing with the three-day strike had been successful, limiting costs to 21 million pounds. March 23 - BA says is open to holding further talks with the Unite union to avert a second wave of strikes. March 30 - Cabin crew end their second four-day strike at midnight. April 7 - British Airways and union officials have resumed talks aimed at averting further strikes. April 8 - BA and Spain's Iberia IBLA.MC sign an $8 billion merger to create the world's third-largest airline. May 7 - Cabin crew reject the airline's latest offer in a ballot, Unite says. May 10 - Unite announces a new wave of strikes. The first action will begin on May 18 and run until May 22. There will be further strikes on May 24-28, May 30-June 3 and June 5-9. May 17 - BA wins an injunction against the strikes as the union failed to tell a small number of its 11,000 members there were 11 spoilt ballot papers in an overwhelming vote to authorize the strikes. May 20 - Unite wins an appeal against the High Court ruling that had blocked a new wave of walkouts. May 24 - BA cabin crew begin a fresh five-day strike after talks to try to resolve the dispute broke down in acrimony. Unite says further five-day stoppages will take place from May 30 and June 5, should there be no peace deal.
