 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto ( RIO.AX )( RIO.L ) is reviewing all capital spending plans in light of the Australian government's proposed resource super profits tax, Chief Executive Tom Albanese said on Monday. 

 Albanese said he had asked Australian managers to review all proposals under a worst-case scenario with the 40 percent tax on mining projects that the Labor government has proposed. "This is affecting our Australian businesses and investment decisions as we speak," Albanese told reporters. (Reporting by  James Regan ; Editing by  Balazs Koranyi )
