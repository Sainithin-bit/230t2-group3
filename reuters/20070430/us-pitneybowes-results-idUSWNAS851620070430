 (Reuters) - Pitney Bowes Inc. ( PBI.N ), the largest maker of mail-handling machines, reported a lower quarterly profit due to slower growth in revenue on delays in orders for mailing equipment in the United States and weaker sales in Europe. 

 The Stamford, Connecticut-based provider of postage meters, high-speed mail systems and document management services posted first-quarter net income of $144.8 million, or 65 cents, compared with $153.5 million, or 67 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations rose to 66 cents a share from 60 cents a share in the year-ago quarter, while revenue rose 4 percent to $1.41 billion. Analysts, on average, expected the company to post a profit of 67 cents per share on revenue of $1.44 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by Dilipp S. Nag in Bangalore)
