 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open little changed on Monday, with investors looking for stronger-than-expected profits to propel stocks to their best month in more than three years. 

 Stocks will also receive direction from a slew of data on personal income and consumption, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT) and the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago will report on Midwest business conditions at 9:45 a.m. (1345 GMT). "Investors are worried about how far the indexes have come and the fact that the general economic news is not that positive," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey. "But they continue to like the individual stock stories - earnings continue to beat expectations and there is merger activity," Meckler said. A busy earnings schedule was set to continue this week with U.S. phone company Verizon Communications Inc. and Kellogg Corp., the world's largest breakfast cereal maker, among companies reporting results before the bell on Monday. S&P 500 futures were down 0.4 point but slightly above fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures were down 7 points, and Nasdaq 100 futures declined 3.5 points. The Dow and S&P are on pace for their best monthly percentage gains in more than three years, while the Nasdaq was on track for its strongest showing in nearly two years. First-quarter earnings for S&P 500 companies are now projected to rise 7.4 percent, up from a growth rate of 5.3 percent the previous week, Reuters Estimates said in its weekly compilation of S&P 500 forecasts from Wall Street strategists and industry analysts. Strong profits were behind the rally in the Dow last week, which pushed it past the 13,000 mark for the first time. In deal news, Yahoo Inc. is to buy the rest of Right Media Inc. for about $680 million to boost Yahoo's advertising in social network sites. The Financial Times reported that senior executives at Citigroup fear the world's biggest financial services company could become the target of activist hedge funds that would press for it to be broken up. The Dow Jones industrial average rose on Friday, with robust earnings pushing the blue-chip index to its third straight record close even as data showed the economy grew in the first quarter at its slowest pace in four years.
