 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Doral Financial Corp. ( DRL.N ) is talking to a private equity fund about investing in the Puerto Rican lender but any such deal would substantially dilute existing shareholders, Doral said on Monday. 

 Doral said in a regulatory filing that if the contemplated transaction is consummated, its capital and liquidity needs will be satisfied but existing shareholders will face "very significant dilution." The news was the latest blow to investors in Doral's stock, which has collapsed over the past two years amid charges that former senior management engaged in fraud. Doral also said it had agreed to pay $129 million to settle securities lawsuits filed after its 2005 announcement that it would need to restate financial statements from 2000 to 2004. Doral shares were down 29 cents, or 16.9 percent, at $1.43 in morning trading, bringing their losses so far this year to about 50 percent. Doral, which has a market value of about $185 million, did not divulge the identity of the private equity fund. The transaction would involve the creation of a new bank holding company in which various private equity equity and other "sophisticated financial investors" would take stakes. Doral last month said it would post losses for 2006 and warned of a cash crunch if it were not able to refinance $625 million in debt that matures in July. Later in March, it announced a deal to sell 11 branches in New York City for an undisclosed amount. Doral, one of several Puerto Rico lenders that overhauled top management and decided to restate results to fix how they accounted for mortgage-related transactions, said in Monday's filing that a failure to refinance the debt maturing in July would impair its ability to operate as a going concern. Doral will take a $95 million charge against its full-year 2006 results as a result of the proposed settlement, of which about $34 million will be paid by its insurers, the company said.
