 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slipped late in the session on Monday, as investors sought to secure profits from some of April's biggest gainers, as the best month for stocks in three years drew to a close. 

 Both the S&P and Nasdaq Composite were up almost 5 percent in April. The Dow is up more than 6 percent for the month, having extended gains after topping the 13,000 mark for the first time last Wednesday. Among some of the heaviest decliners late on Monday were blue chips Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ) and Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ). Exxon shares, down 0.7 percent, added 5.8 percent for the month. Intel stock, which slipped 1.2 percent late on Monday, added 12.9 percent for the month. "It's the last day of the month and the market's up 5 percent for the month so profit-taking is normal," said Tim Smalls, head of U.S. stock trading at brokerage firm Execution LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. "The rally we've had in last week or so was on weaker and weaker breadth." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was down 4.39 points, or 0.03 percent, at 13,116.55. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 4.80 points, or 0.32 percent, at 1,489.27. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 19.57 points, or 0.77 percent, at 2,537.64. Earlier, the Dow industrials rose to  a record intraday high of 13,162.06. Investors were also cheered by stronger-than-expected profits from companies such as consumer electronics retailer RadioShack Corp. ( RSH.N ), conglomerate Loews Corp. LTR.N and Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. WWY.N, the world's largest chewing-gum maker. RadioShack stock was up 6.2 percent to $29.45, Loew's stock gained 1.7 percent to $47.46, and Wrigley shares added 6.6 percent to $58.69.
