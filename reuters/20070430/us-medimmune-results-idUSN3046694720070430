 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MedImmune Inc. MEDI.O, which earlier this month agreed to be bought by AstraZeneca Plc. ( AZN.L ) for more than $15 billion, reported on Monday that first-quarter profit more than tripled on increased sales of its respiratory drug Synagis. 

 The Gaithersburg, Maryland-based biotechnology company said net profit jumped to $160 million, or 66 cents per share, from$47 million, or 18 cents per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected 56 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. They had been estimating 51 cents earlier this month, before the company said earnings would be higher than expected. Total revenue rose 15 percent to $575 million, with the lion's share coming from Synagis sales. Worldwide sales of Synagis rose 9 percent to $507 million for MedImmune, which also sells the nasal spray influenza vaccine FluMist. The company, which collects royalties on sales of vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV), said HPV-related revenue of $26 million in the quarter was some $14 million higher than it said it expected when it issued preliminary results on April 9.
