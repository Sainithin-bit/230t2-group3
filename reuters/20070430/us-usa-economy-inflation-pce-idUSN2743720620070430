 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. incomes rose a greater-than-expected 0.7 percent in March, but core consumer prices were surprisingly unchanged, a Commerce Department report showed on Monday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters had expected personal income to rise 0.5 percent. February's income gain was revised up to 0.7 percent. Analysts were expecting core consumer prices, which exclude volatile energy and food costs, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, to rise 0.1 percent in March after a 0.3 percent rise in February. Overall consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, matching February's rise. March consumer spending rose a smaller-than-expected 0.3 percent. Analysts were expecting a 0.5 percent rise. Core prices eased to a 2.1 percent increase from the same month a year ago. Overall prices rose 2.4 percent from a year ago, the largest rise since August, when the 12-month gain was 3.2 percent. The March saving rate moderated to negative 0.8 percent from minus 1.2 percent in February, the strongest rate since a negative 0.4 percent in March 2006.
