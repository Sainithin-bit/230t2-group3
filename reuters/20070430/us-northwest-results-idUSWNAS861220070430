 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Bankrupt Northwest Airlines Corp. NWACQ.PK on Monday posted a narrower quarterly loss, largely on expenses related to its restructuring. 

 The No. 5 U.S. airline, which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since September 2005, said its loss amounted to $292 million, or $3.34 per share, compared with a loss of $1.1 billion, or $12.65 per share, a year earlier. Excluding reorganization items, Northwest posted a profit of $100 million, reversing a year-ago loss of $129 million. Northwest, which aims to exit bankruptcy in June, reported quarterly operating revenue of $2.87 billion, a 0.6 percent decrease from the previous year. The company said fuel was its top expense in the quarter. The airline paid $704 million for fuel, down 5.4 percent from the year-ago period. The carrier, like many traditional rivals, has been suffering from low-cost competition and soaring fuel costs. Airlines like Northwest have fought back by cutting costs and charging higher fares. Northwest is cutting costs by $2.5 billion a year and has already met its labor cost savings goal of $1.4 billion. Northwest received court approval for its reorganization plan in March and is awaiting approval from its creditors. A creditors vote is due in May. In the first quarter, airlines were battered by severe winter weather. And some carriers are warning that their domestic revenue could take a hit because of increased capacity and softening travel demand. "While we are optimistic as we look forward, we are seeing some softening in domestic revenue and we remain concerned about the impact of fuel price increases," said Northwest Chief Financial Officer Neal Cohen. Also on Monday, Northwest said it lowered the estimated amount of unsecured claims to be paid to creditors to a range of $8.2 billion to $8.8 billion. The carrier, which aims to exit bankruptcy in June, previously estimated a range of $8.75 billion to $9.5 billion.
