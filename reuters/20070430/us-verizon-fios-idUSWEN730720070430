 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ) said on Monday that dilution from the deployment of its new video and Internet service using an advanced fiber-optic network would likely improve in the second quarter. 

 The company said earlier that the new service, called FiOS, diluted earnings by 11 cents per share in the first quarter.
