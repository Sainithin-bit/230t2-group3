 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Loews Corp. said on Monday that first-quarter profit rose 42 percent, topping Wall Street estimates, helped by better-than-expected results from its insurance, tobacco and oil drilling units. 

 Net income at the New York-based conglomerate, which is run by the billionaire Tisch family, rose to $768.3 million from $541 million a year earlier. Profit attributable to Loews shareholders rose to $650.7 million, or $1.20 per share, from $473.4 million, or 85 cents. Excluding investment gains and losses, profit was $1.07 per share, topping analysts' average forecast of 95 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 10 percent to $4.66 billion. The company spent $314 million to buy back stock. Loews shares rose 68 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $47.32, their highest-ever close. "Its balance sheet continues to strengthen, business lines are performing in line to above our expectations, and management's commitment to share buybacks in lieu of potentially overpaying for a diversifying acquisition adds further comfort," said Gregg Tenser, a managing director at NWQ Investment Management Co. in Los Angeles. Loews' businesses include financial, tobacco, energy, hotel and watch-making companies. Chicago-based CNA Financial Corp., the No. 7 U.S. commercial insurer and Loews' largest unit, said profit rose 29 percent to $296 million, or $1.09 per share. Excluding investments, operating profit totaled $307 million, or $1.13 per share, topping the average $1.05 forecast. CNA used 95.1 percent of property and casualty premium income for claims, down from 96.9 percent. Results benefited from "underwriting discipline and expense reduction efforts," Loews Chief Executive James Tisch said on a conference call. Loews owns 89 percent of CNA. Last Wednesday, CNA set a 10 cents per share quarterly dividend, its first dividend in more than 30 years. TOBACCO, DRILLING Profit at the Lorillard Inc. tobacco unit rose 26 percent to $188.7 million. Profit attributable to shareholders of Carolina Group, a tracking stock for Lorillard, rose to $1.08 per share from 86 cents. Analysts expected 98 cents. Net sales rose 7 percent to $913 million. A December cigarette price increase and lower marketing costs offset higher litigation costs and a 0.9 percent decline in unit sales volume. Lorillard Chief Executive Martin Orlowsky said on the call that U.S. market share rose to 9.95 percent from 9.62 percent a year earlier. Lorillard brands include Newport, Kent and True. Houston-based Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. last Thursday reported a quarterly profit of $224.2 million, or $1.64 per share, topping the average $1.47 forecast. Loews has a 51 percent stake. Profit rose 15 percent to $80.2 million at Boardwalk Pipeline Partners LP, in which Loews owns a 75 percent stake, while Loews Hotels posted a $10.9 million profit. Loews also owns watchmaker Bulova Corp. Loews is run by James Tisch and Co-Chairmen Andrew Tisch and Jonathan Tisch. Andrew and James Tisch's late father, Laurence Tisch, and Jonathan Tisch's late father, Preston Robert Tisch, were also Loews chairmen. CNA shares rose 34 cents to close at $46.67, Carolina rose 13 cents to $76.53, Diamond fell $2.34 to $85.60 and Boardwalk was down 29 cents to end the day at $36.59.
