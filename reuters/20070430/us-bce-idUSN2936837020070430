 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ) ( BCE.N ), Canada's top telecommunications company, said on Sunday it expects to complete a review in the third quarter of strategic alternatives that include potential privatization. 

 Montreal-based BCE, which owns Bell Canada -- the country's largest telephone company -- has a market capitalization of about C$30 billion (US$27 billion). BCE previously said it was in talks with U.S. private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and three big Canadian pension funds that could lead to taking the company private in Canada's biggest buyout. BCE said it would consider other alternatives as well. BCE said it would open an electronic data room this week that will be available to any qualified bidder. Potential bidders would also be required to sign standard confidentiality and standstill agreements. BCE previously said it signed nondisclosure and standstill agreements with the pension funds and KKR, but the pacts were not exclusive. KKR's role in the talks faces some hurdles. By law, foreigners cannot own more than 46.7 percent of a Canadian telecom company. "Our goal from the beginning has been to foster a competitive process by seeking to ensure that no one party is able to assemble a disproportionate share of available Canadian equity," said Donna Soble Kaufman, chairperson of BCE's strategic oversight committee. BCE's biggest shareholder, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, previously has said it may mount a rival bid for the company. Any bidders considering a privatization of BCE must prove they have financing available for a transaction of this size and complexity, BCE said.
