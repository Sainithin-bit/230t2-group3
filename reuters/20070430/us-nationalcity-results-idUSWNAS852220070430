 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - National City Corp. NCC.N, a large U.S. Midwest regional bank, on Monday said first-quarter profit fell 30 percent, hurt by pressure in its mortgage operations and rising credit losses. 

 Net income for the Cleveland-based company fell to $319.2 million, or 50 cents per share, from $458.8 million, or 74 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average forecast a profit of 60 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Our retail, corporate and asset management businesses all had a solid quarter," Chief Executive David Daberko said in a statement. "Our mortgage business continues to operate in a difficult environment, but we have less exposure to the mortgage sector than in prior years. Overall, we expect each successive quarter from here to show improved earnings." Results included additional charges related to mortgages the bank kept after it sold its First Franklin Financial Corp. subprime lending unit last year to Merrill Lynch & Co. MER.N. Mortgage banking generated just $2 million of profit, compared with $173 million for retail banking, about $218 million for commercial banking and $26 million for asset management. The bank set aside $107 million for credit losses, quadruple the year-earlier $27 million, hurt by an expected loss of insurance coverage for some loans in dispute. Net charge-offs rose about 21 percent to $147 million, including $53 million for less-than-prime mortgage loans. National City recently spent more than $2 billion for Fidelity Bankshares Inc. and Harbor Florida Bancshares Inc. to add its first branches in fast-growing Florida, the fourth-most populous U.S. state. National City shares closed Friday at $37.70 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have risen 3 percent this year, compared with a 1 percent decline in the Philadelphia KBW Bank Index .BKX.
