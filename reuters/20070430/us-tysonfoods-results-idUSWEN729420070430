 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tyson Foods Inc. ( TSN.N ), the largest U.S. meat producer, reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Monday as last year's cost-cutting program paid off, sending its shares to an eight-year high. 

 The company also raised its fiscal-year outlook. In March, the company had forecast that quarterly results would be good, but Monday's numbers still surprised analysts. "Obviously it is a lot of good news. Everybody was expecting corn prices to negatively impact their results," said Ann Gilpin, an analyst at Morningstar. "If you look at the second quarter you can definitely see that there have been a lot of price increases across all segments." Corn prices jumped to a 10-year high in February of more than $4 per bushel and remain high due to demand from producers of the corn-based biofuel ethanol. Tyson is the largest U.S. buyer of corn, which it feeds to its chickens, and higher corn prices mean higher production costs. Tyson and other chicken producers have been able to raise chicken meat prices to offset much of the higher costs. Tyson reported earnings of $68 million, or 19 cents per share, for the second quarter that ended on March 31, compared with a year-earlier loss of $127 million, or 37 cents per share. Wall Street analysts on average expected a profit of 11 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "We expected a positive surprise and we got it," Prudential Financial equity analyst John McMillin said in a research note. He said the surprise came mostly from the chicken segment, where rebounding prices have basically offset higher feed costs. Revenue increased to $6.5 billion from $6.25 billion. "It was our strongest performance since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005," Chief Executive Richard Bond said in a statement. "Our beef segment is back in the black, and our pork business is well within our target margin objectives." In a conference call with analysts, Bond attributed the improvement in its beef and pork units mainly to improved operating efficiencies. In 2006, Tyson undertook a $200 million cost-cutting program that included job cuts and plant closures, and the Springdale, Arkansas-based company has said it would exceed that amount. Tyson raised its fiscal-year outlook to a range of 65 cents to 90 cents per share from its previous forecast of 50 cents to 80 cents. Analysts were expecting 71 cents. The U.S. beef industry has suffered from lingering export restrictions due to the U.S. mad cow case in December 2003 and more recently by tight cattle supplies. Exports markets have slowly reopened after the mad-cow bans, but restrictions by overseas buyers have prevented sales from returning to pre-mad cow levels. South Korea, once the third-largest overseas buyer of U.S. beef, is slowly reopening. Tyson said it expects to start shipping beef there in a few weeks. Tyson's beef unit posted an operating profit $24 million, compared with a year-earlier loss of $188 million, due to higher beef prices and increased sales volume. Earnings in the pork unit, the second-largest in the United States, improved to $35 million from $9 million, helped by higher pricing and robust exports. Tyson, like others in the industry, in late 2006 reacted to low chicken prices and an abundance of meat by cutting chicken production. Those cuts helped push chicken prices higher in 2007 to largely offset the higher feed costs. Operating profit in chicken reached $61 million in the quarter, up from $9 million a year earlier. Tyson buys cattle and hogs to supply its beef and pork processing operations, but raises the chickens it processes into meat. Tyson shares were up 18 cents, or nearly 1 percent, at $21.38 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier shares peaked at $22.46, the highest level since July 1999.
