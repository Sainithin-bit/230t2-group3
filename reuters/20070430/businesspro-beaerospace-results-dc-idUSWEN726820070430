 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - B/E Aerospace Inc. ( BEAV.O ) said on 
Monday its first-quarter profit rose sharply, helped by higher 
sales of its airplane interior products on the back of an 
extended boom in demand for air travel. 

  The world's largest maker of plane seats, which also fits 
out commercial and business jets with oxygen masks, food carts 
and other gear, reported quarterly profit of $32.1 million, or 
40 cents per share, compared with $13.8 million, or 18 cents 
per share, in the year-ago quarter.
