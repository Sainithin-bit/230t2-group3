 (Reuters) - Portland General Electric Co. ( POR.N ) reported a quarterly profit, driven by improved margins from higher retail energy deliveries and the availability of the Boardman power plant. 

 The electric utility, which also reaffirmed its 2007 earnings forecast, posted a first-quarter profit of $55 million, or 88 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $6 million, or 9 cents a share, a year earlier. Operating revenue rose 14 percent to $436 million. Three analysts, on average, expected earnings of 78 cents a share, before exceptional items, while one analyst forecast revenue of $420 million, for the first quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. The Oregon-based company stood by its full-year earnings outlook of $1.90 to $2.00 a share. Portland General said the outlook includes about 30 cents per share due to a $20.4 million pre-tax deferral related to the Boardman outage, as well as the associated interest and impact from Oregon Senate Bill 408 that defines the rate treatment of income taxes. For 2007, analysts on average expect earnings of $1.96 a share, before exceptional items. The company sees capital expenditure of $439 million for the year, compared with $371 million in 2006.
