 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Kellogg Co. ( K.N ) reported a 17 percent increase in quarterly earnings on Monday due to a lower tax rate, a weaker U.S. dollar that helped boost international results, and strong U.S. snack sales. 

 The world's largest breakfast cereal maker also raised its full-year profit forecast slightly, and its shares hit an all-time high on the New York Stock Exchange. The maker of Frosted Flakes cereal and Keebler cookies said first-quarter net income was $321 million, or 80 cents per share, compared with $274 million, or 68 cents, a year earlier. Earnings in the latest quarter included a $40 million tax benefit. Excluding the tax benefit, earnings were 70 cents a share, beating analysts' average estimate of 68 cents, according to Reuters Estimates, Like many U.S. food makers, Kellogg has been struggling with higher prices for commodities like corn and wheat. The company raised prices on its flagship cereal line last year in a bid to offset some of those additional costs. First-quarter revenue rose 9 percent to $2.96 billion, topping analysts' average forecast of $2.85 billion. Internal sales, which exclude currency fluctuations and other factors, rose 7 percent. "Most of the beat on sales was in North America, with cereal above our estimate for flat sales and North American snacks results also above expectations," Pablo Zuanic, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., said in a research note. Kellogg, based in Battle Creek, Michigan, has benefited in recent years from a steady stream of higher-priced products such as new varieties of Special K and All Bran cereals. At the same time, it has sharply increased spending on advertising. The company is trying to expand consumption of its cereal brands to other parts of the day with a variety of Kashi frozen entrees and weight-management products like the new Special K water with protein. Special K water so far is meeting or exceeding company expectations, but it will take more time to see if it attracts consumers, David Mackay, Kellogg's chief executive, said in an interview. "Whether consumers fully understand it, we won't know for another three months or so," Mackay said. First-quarter sales rose 7 percent in North America, led by an 11 percent internal sales increase in the retail snacks business. North American internal sales of cereal were up 4 percent. The bulk of the increase in cereal sales came from price increases and a shift in sales to higher-priced products. Volume -- or the amount of cereal products sold -- was about flat, the company said. "If we can grow the category through price/mix, we're fine," Mackay said. "I'm sure the volume will follow over time." International sales rose 12 percent, but only 5 percent when currency fluctuations were excluded. Kellogg said it now expects earnings for the year of $2.70 to $2.74 a share, up from a previous forecast $2.68 to $2.73. The forecast includes the tax benefit in the first quarter. The company said in January it expected increased fuel, energy, commodity and benefit costs to cut earnings by 18 cents to 22 cents a share this year. Kellogg shares were up 47 cents at $53.55 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $54 earlier in the session. Through Friday, the stock traded at 17.7 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with a multiple of 17.5 for rival General Mills Inc. ( GIS.N ). (Additional reporting by  Nichola Groom )
