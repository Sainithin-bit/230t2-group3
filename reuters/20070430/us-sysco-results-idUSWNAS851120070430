 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Food distributor Sysco Corp. ( SYY.N ) said on Monday quarterly profit rose, helped by tighter cost controls. 

 The company, which supplies food and other products to restaurants, cafeterias and other food sellers, reported third-quarter net income of $217.2 million, or 35 cents a share, compared with $188.5 million, or 30 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the company to earn 36 cents a share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales for the quarter were up 5.3 percent at $8.57 billion, slightly missing analysts' estimate of $8.8 billion. Food cost inflation, measured by the change in Sysco's cost of goods, was 2.9 percent. During the quarter, Sysco continued to conduct business reviews of thousands of its food distribution contracts to find ways to increase sales. Sales to the 12,000 customers who participated in the review were solid, the company said. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales fell to 14.62 percent while gross profit margins increased to a little over 19 percent. (Additional reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore)
