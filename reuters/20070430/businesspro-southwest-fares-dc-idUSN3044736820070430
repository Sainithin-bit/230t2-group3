 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ) said on 
Monday it raised fares up to $2 each way on some of its 
flights, a move that was matched by competitors. 

  The fare hike marks the second increase by Southwest this 
year, and shows that airlines still have some ability to raise 
fares on domestic routes, despite recent concerns about surplus 
capacity.  U.S. airlines are trying to extend last year's series of 
revenue-boosting fare increases. Fare hikes fail if they are 
not broadly matched.  Southwest is raising fares by $1 on flights under 250 miles 
as well as flights out of its home base in Dallas. Flights 
between 250 miles and 750 miles are being increased by $2 each 
way, spokeswoman Beth Harbin said.  The increase affects about 25 percent of Southwest's 
flights.  Other airlines, including No. 1 U.S. airline American 
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp. AMR.N, matched the increase in 
overlap markets.  "Network carriers have tried to raise prices system-wide 
four times this year with limited success, in large measure due 
to the lack of participation by Southwest," said Farecompare 
fare analyst Neil Bainton, in a research report.  "With Southwest leading this increase, it is very likely it 
will stick," he said.
