 BERLIN  (Reuters) - German retail sales fell by 0.7 percent on the month in March, bucking expectations for a rise, preliminary Federal Statistics Office data showed on Monday. 

 The month-on-month fall, expressed in real and seasonally adjusted terms, compared with the mid-range forecast in a Reuters poll of 24 analysts last week for retail sales to rise by 0.8 percent on the month ECONDE. Compared with the same month a year earlier, sales rose by 0.5 percent in real terms, the Office said. "The figures are disappointing. The VAT-tax hike impact has perhaps been discounted a little too early," said DekaBank economist Sebastian Wanke. The government raised value added tax (VAT) by three percentage points to 19 percent from January 1 to help shore up Germany's stretched public finances. The impact of the VAT hike had hitherto not been as great as many economists had expected. Sales of foodstuffs, drinks and tobacco rose by 0.3 percent on the year in real terms in March, while non-food turnover rose by 0.7 percent compared with March 2006. The data exclude sales of vehicles and turnover at gas stations and are based on figures from six German states accounting for some 66 percent of total sales. In nominal terms, sales fell by 0.6 percent compared with February and rose by 1.3 percent from March 2006, the Office said. There were 27 shopping days in March, the same month a year earlier. Other recent news related to the German retail has sector has been more positive. Last week, the GfK market research group's forward-looking sentiment indicator showed consumer sentiment is set to improve more than expected in May, helped by falling unemployment, the prospect of stronger wage gains and optimism about the economy. "Even if there are indications of an improvement in consumption, it appears to be set to come into effect later in the year," Wanke said. The Office typically revises its monthly German retail sales data about two weeks after the release of the preliminary figures, on average about a fifth of a percentage point higher.
