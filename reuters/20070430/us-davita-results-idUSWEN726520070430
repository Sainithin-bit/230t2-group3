 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DaVita Inc. ( DVA.N ), the biggest provider of dialysis in the United States, said on Monday its first-quarter profit rose 33.2 percent, helped by an increase in the number of treatments at its facilities.

Wall Street analysts had on average forecast 72 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Looking ahead, the company said it expects operating income in 2007 to be between $740 million and $780 million, compared with its earlier forecast of $700 million to $760 million.
