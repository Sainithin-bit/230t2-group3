 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Consumer electronics retailer RadioShack Corp. ( RSH.N ) said on Monday that first-quarter profit increased sharply, helped by improved gross margin, a reduction in expenses and an increase in interest income. 

 Net income rose to $42.5 million, or 31 cents a share, from $8.4 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier.
