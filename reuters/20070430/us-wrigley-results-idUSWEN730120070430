 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wm. Wrigley Jr. Co. WWY.N posted higher quarterly profit on Monday, helped by new product launches and overseas sales increases that were boosted by the weak U.S. dollar. 

 The world's largest chewing gum maker said profit was $142.70 million, or 52 cents a share, in the first quarter, compared with $111.88 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 50 cents a share. Analysts on average had forecast 47 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.
