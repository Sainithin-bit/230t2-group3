 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. incomes rose a greater-than-expected 0.7 percent in March, but core consumer prices were surprisingly unchanged, a Commerce Department report showed on Monday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters had expected personal income to rise 0.5 percent. February's income gain was revised up to 0.7 percent. Bonds rallied on news of muted price pressures that raised the possibility the Federal Reserve may be better positioned to lower benchmark interest rates to spur a sluggish economy. "Inflation was off a little bit. We don't think that gives the Fed any freedom now but it could slightly bring closer the time when they can make a move," said Adam Brown, co-head of U.S. Treasury trading at Barclays Capital in New York. Analysts were expecting core consumer prices, which exclude volatile energy and food costs, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures index, to rise 0.1 percent in March after a 0.3 percent rise in February. Overall consumer prices rose 0.4 percent, matching February's rise. March consumer spending rose a smaller-than-expected 0.3 percent. Analysts were expecting a 0.5 percent rise. At the same time, the increase in consumer spending was eaten up by rising prices. Measured in real terms, spending fell 0.2 percent in March, the first drop since August. Core prices eased to a 2.1 percent increase from the same month a year ago. Overall prices rose 2.4 percent from a year ago, the largest rise since August, when the 12-month gain was 3.2 percent. The March saving rate moderated to negative 0.8 percent from minus 1.2 percent in February, the strongest rate since a negative 0.4 percent in March 2006. The income, spending and price data was incorporated in a report on first quarter GDP issued on Friday.
