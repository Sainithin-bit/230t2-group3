 LONDON  (Reuters) - Current proposals tabled by France to involve the private sector in sharing the burden of a second bailout for Greece are unlikely to trigger the payout of default insurance, ISDA's general counsel David Geen told Reuters on Monday. 

 "As I understand it the French plan is effectively a voluntary rollover. and generally speaking a voluntary rollover wouldn't trigger CDS," said the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's Geen. France has put forward a plan whereby bondholders would reinvest at least 70 percent of the proceeds from bonds maturing between now and the end of 2014 into new 30-year Greek debt. Derivatives industry body ISDA has the final say on whether a credit event has occurred, which would cause the payout of credit default swaps -- a popular financial tool used to both hedge risk and speculate on changes in the likelihood of default. Standard and Poor's said on Monday that current proposals may still result in credit ratings being cut to default levels, raising questions over whether current ISDA definitions of a CDS trigger provide sufficient insurance against default. But, Geen said that there had not been calls from ISDA members to tighten the current definitions of a credit event to incorporate scenarios along the lines of the current French proposal for Greek debt.
