 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo Stock Exchange has proposed a tender offer for Osaka Securities Exchange Co 8697.OS as the two bourses proceed in merger talks, Japan's Asahi newspaper reported on Tuesday. 

 The Tokyo exchange's plan includes buying all OSE shares to make it a wholly owned subsidiary, the paper said. The Jasdaq-listed OSE is set to reject the plan, however, the report also said. Japan's biggest and second largest stock exchanges have been in talks on possible business integration amid a flurry of mergers and alliances among global exchanges.
