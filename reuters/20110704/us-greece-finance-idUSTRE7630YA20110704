 ATHENS  (Reuters) - The Greek government's next steps will seek to halt the economic downturn and help the economy return to growth, the country's finance minister said on Monday. 

 "The initiatives that must be undertaken in the coming days and weeks have as an only goal to resurrect the economy, halt recession and return (the economy) to growth for the benefit of all citizens and mainly the unemployed and weak income groups," Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said in a statement. His comments came after a report in the Eleftherotypia newspaper said that a barrage of new measures were in store based on an updated memorandum agreed with the country's international lenders on Saturday. The ministry did not have any immediate comment on a statement by rating agency Standards & Poor's that Greece would likely be in default if it follows a debt rollover plan pushed by French banks.
