 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greek banks would not be wrecked by a "selective default" on a proposed debt rollover if it was lifted quickly, Greek bankers told Reuters on Monday. 

 But if ratings agencies left Greek in default territory for some time, an arrangement would need to be made with the European Central Bank to ensure that funding does not dry up, the bankers said, with one adding that such talks had already started. Rating agency Standard & Poor's warned on Monday that rollover proposals being touted for Greek debt would amount to a "selective default," a move that tempers hopes for a resolution to the protracted and damaging crisis. Greek banks depend on the ECB for liquidity as they have long been shut out of wholesale funding markets remains on sovereign debt default fears. If their collateral, mainly government bonds, becomes unacceptable as a result of a default downgrade, the central bank may have to turn off the liquidity taps. "If the 'selective default' period is short, covering just the settlement period for the bond exchange to take place, then there would be no funding issue for Greek banks," a senior Greek banker, who declined to be named, told Reuters. "If the 'selective' default period turns out longer than this, then some other comfort might have to be provided to the ECB on collaterals." Latest data show ECB funding to Greek banks rose 12.3 percent month-on-month in May, hitting 97.5 billion euros ( $141.6 billion) or about 19.5 percent of their assets. Greek bank stocks were unfazed by the S&P statement, gaining 1.4 percent before easing back, with the market focusing instead on the euro zone's weekend decision to approve a 12 billion euros loan tranche to the government. S&P cut Greece's sovereign rating to CCC last month, from B, on a view that any restructuring of the country's massive debt load would count as an effective default. LEAVING THE DOOR OPEN Leaving the door open to the possibility of Greece emerging from "selected default" relatively quickly, S&P said it would assign a new rating "a short time" after the debt roll-over plan was actually implemented, reflecting Athens' new credit readiness. It did not say how long that could take in the case of Greece but in another report last month S&P said the period of time a rating on a sovereign remains at 'SD' has in the past varied between one day and six months, with countries emerging with a new, higher rating between CCC+ and B -- still junk but not in default. Last month, Fitch said if it placed Greece on a "restricted default" because of the debt rollover plan the credit rating agency was likely to issue a new, higher rating within 14 days once the deal was done. Another senior banker, who declined to be named, said there were ongoing talks to put in place some type of facility to ensure that funding to Greek banks does not dry up as long as the 'selective default' rating was in place. "There are talks on a parallel mechanism for as long as this lasts. It is a prerequisite that there be seamless funding of Greek and other banks via the ECB," the banker said. "Either 'selective default' will have to be circumvented or it will have to be very brief, momentary," the banker said. "We cannot predetermine what the solution will be, but it will be comprehensive. Today's S&P comment is one more episode by the ratings agencies."
