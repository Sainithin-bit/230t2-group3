 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - World stocks climbed to 10-month highs and oil topped $74 per barrel on Friday, after a strong rise in U.S. home sales and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke delivered an upbeat economic outlook. 

 U.S. stocks ended the week at new highs for 2009, while European shares marked their highest close since early November. Safer havens such as the U.S. dollar, the yen and U.S. Treasuries fell as the news encouraged investors to move funds into riskier, higher-yielding assets. An industry survey showed sales of previously owned U.S. homes rose for a fourth straight month in July to notch their fastest sales pace in nearly two years -- the strongest sign yet that housing is pulling out of a three-year slump. The rally intensified after Bernanke told a Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, that "prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good. He cautioned that growth is likely to be slow and unemployment will remain high, leading investors to conclude that interest rates will remain low for a prolonged period. "The home sales data got the market rolling, but Bernanke really persuaded investors to (keep up) the rally," said John Augustine, chief investment strategist at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. "His comment was optimistic, but also prudent about the quantitative easing ending sometime. But the market took it all as good news." The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  finished up 155.91 points, or 1.67 percent, at 9,505.96, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 18.76 points, or 1.86 percent, to 1,026.13. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  rose 31.68 points, or 1.59 percent, to 2,020.90. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq hit 10-month intraday highs, while the Dow industrials rose to their highest level in nine months. The S&P is now up 51.7 percent from a 12-year closing low set on March 9. Shares of U.S. home builders were bolstered by the positive housing data. The Dow Jones home construction index .DJUSHB rose 3.4 percent, with D.R. Horton ( DHI.N ) jumping 3.4 percent to $12.66 and luxury builder Toll Brothers ( TOL.N ) gaining 3.7 percent to $22.70. The European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  gained 2.3 percent, supported by a greater-than-expected improvement in a euro zone manufacturing and services survey, as well as the U.S. housing data. The European index is up nearly 50 percent since reaching a lifetime low in early March. The MSCI world equity index jumped 1.64 to its highest level since early October. The MSCI stock index for emerging markets .MSCIEF climbed 1.11 percent. The positive market sentiment also lifted U.S. crude oil prices to their highest levels in 2009. Front-month October crude ended up 98 cents at $73.98 a barrel, the highest since mid-October. Prices reached an intraday high of $74.72 earlier in the session. DOLLAR, TREASURIES SLIDE Safer-heaven assets declined, on the other hand. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond sold off more than two points in price for a yield of 4.3776 percent, up from 4.25 percent late Thursday. The benchmark 10-year note was 39/32 lower to yield 3.5724 percent from 3.44 percent. The euro rose 0.6 percent against the U.S. dollar to $1.4325, after hitting a session peak of $1.4375, the highest level since August 7, according to Reuters data. Against the Japanese yen, the European currency was up 0.7 percent at 135.19 yen. "We've hit a bottom in the housing market. I think you're going to see further dollar and yen declines on that outlook," said Fabian Eliasson, vice president of currency sales at Mizuho Corporate Bank in New York. "As conditions improve both here and in Europe ... there's less need for safer-haven currencies as the yen and dollar have been in the past year."
