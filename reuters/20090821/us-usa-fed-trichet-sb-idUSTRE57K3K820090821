 JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming  (Reuters) - European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet on Friday expressed uneasiness at what he saw as premature talk of a return to normal from a financial crisis. 

 "I am a little a bit uneasy when I see that because we have some green shoots here and there, we are already saying, 'well, after all, we are close to back to normal'," he said, commenting on a paper at a Federal Reserve conference. "We know that we have an enormous amount of work to do and we should be as active as possible," he said. Trichet was commenting on a paper that proposed creating an insurance system for banks to give them access to funds in a credit crunch. The European Central Bank head said he worried that discussion of a "contingent capital" scheme would not replace thinking about broader reforms to the financial system, including better regulation. Trichet also said it had been "almost miraculous" that central banks could flood markets with so much money independently of governments to cope with the crisis. "We could manage to get through this in a miraculous way, but it would be good to reflect a little on the political economy of the decisions, because I'm not sure we could get that twice," he said.
