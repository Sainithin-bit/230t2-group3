 JACKSON HOLE, Wyoming  (Reuters) - Central bankers said on Friday the worst global recession in 70 years was nearing a close but warned it would be a long, slow climb back to normal growth. 

 At an annual U.S. Federal Reserve retreat set against the backdrop of the Grand Teton mountains, the officials said the coming recovery would have its peaks and valleys, and it was too soon to withdraw trillions of dollars in government and central bank support. "After contracting sharply over the past year, economic activity appears to be leveling out, both in the United States and abroad, and the prospects for a return to growth in the near term appear good," Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said. But both Bernanke and European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet pointed out that there was still considerable work to be done to restore the global economy to self-sustaining growth. Trichet said he was "a bit uneasy" about talk of a return to normal and policy-makers "should be as active as possible." The conference, held at a no-frills rustic lodge in a U.S. national park in the western state of Wyoming, is a big draw for the world's leading monetary policy-makers and economists. The event includes a mix of speeches and academic papers. This year's event sounded more upbeat than a year ago, when Bernanke and his counterparts were still struggling to get ahead of a rapidly deteriorating financial picture. Just weeks after the 2008 gathering, Lehman Brothers collapsed and the United States had to rescue American International Group Inc, touching off a tumultuous period that saw steep declines in economic growth in both rich and developing countries. AVERTING DISASTER A large chunk of Bernanke's speech was devoted to reliving those months, looking at how officials around the world responded and what lessons they learned about how to regulate and monitor financial markets going forward. He credited an aggressive, coordinated policy response for averting "the imminent collapse of the global financial system, an outcome that seemed all too possible." After his speech, Bernanke took a stroll through the picturesque grounds with Trichet and Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, with television cameras following them -- though from far enough away that their conversation could not be heard. In the past couple of weeks, economic reports have shown some major economies, including Germany, France and Japan, generated positive economic growth in the second quarter, and polls show that most economists think the current quarter will mark the end of the U.S. recession. Yet Germany's Axel Weber, a member of the ECB's Governing Council, cautioned against getting "too optimistic" about prospects for Europe's biggest economy. "It is too early to draw the conclusion that everything is behind us," he told CNBC Television. (Writing by  Emily Kaiser ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
