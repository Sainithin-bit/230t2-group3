 KARACHI  (Reuters) - Shaukat Tarin, Pakistan's top economic official, is known as a hard-headed straight-talker who loves a challenge. 

 Which is good because the veteran banker might just be up against his career's biggest -- steering Pakistan out of its most dire economic straits in years. A balance of payments crisis has left the central bank with foreign reserves of $3.53 billion, less than September's import bill of $3.81 billion, and there is concern that without help, the country could default on a bond maturing early next year. Analysts say it's almost inevitable the government will, however reluctantly, have to agree to an IMF programme. Tarin was appointed the prime minister's top adviser on economic affairs last month, shortly after he turned 55. IMF negotiators are likely to find him a tough nut. Tarin joined Citibank as a trainee in 1975, after graduating with a master's degree in business from Punjab University, Pakistan's oldest, where he majored in finance. He rose to take charge of several banks and also served as chairman of the Karachi Stock Exchange before joining the government as de facto finance minister. He can't be appointed a cabinet minister as he is not a member of parliament. Although Tarin has shunned politics throughout his career, Muneer Kamal, a colleague at Citibank, said he wasn't surprised to see his old friend join the government. "Most people would run away from the sheer weight of responsibility but Shaukat's not that type," said Kamal. "If he feels it's a challenging job and he can do something positive, he won't be shy." A stocky man with a mustache, Tarin once told the New York Times he was most proud of building up the business at Citibank, where he also worked in the Gulf and Thailand. "Citibank was where I learned all about banking and my experiences there laid the foundations for my career," he told the newspaper in an interview. At the request of the government, he took over as chairman and president of Pakistan's largest bank, Habib Bank, in 1997, turning it around from a $230 million loss in 1996 to a profit of $30 million in 1998. He had similar success at Union Bank, which he took over in 2000, making it one of Pakistan's top banks in five years and preparing for its sale to Standard Chartered Bank. Old colleagues speak of a no-nonsense style and attention to detail. "He's a very aggressive person and he means what he says ... he's very blunt," said one banker who worked under Tarin at Saudi Pak Commercial Bank. "He has a deep understanding of finance and with numbers he's excellent. It's almost as if he has a photographic memory," said the banker, who declined to be identified. Despite the gruff manner, colleagues say Tarin has always been fiercely loyal to staff, and they to him, and has always been able to attract top talent to work with him. Another old friend and colleague said Tarin's political masters would be wise to leave him alone to get on with the job. "He has the ability and the capability to deliver provided he's given a free hand. Otherwise he'll simply get frustrated and resign one day ... He does not ever succumb to pressure." Tarin was born in the eastern city of Multan, where his father, Jamshed Ahmed Tarin, was an army doctor. The elder Tarin has no fears for his son in the tough negotiations he faces. "He's honest and an honest man is always a little braver. If you have some credibility then you can negotiate with anybody," he said. An occasional golfer, Tarin is married with three children.
