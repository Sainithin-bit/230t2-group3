 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - China is planning to announce measures to boost internal demand -- which could help offset a global slowdown -- soon, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Sunday. 

 Asked if new stimulus measures by China were expected in the coming weeks, Lagarde told reporters: "Yes, yes, of course." China's central bank governor, Zhou Xiaochuan, said on Saturday that the Asian export powerhouse, one of the few remaining engines of global growth, wanted to maintain its economic expansion, which he forecast at 8-9 percent in 2009. The officials were speaking at a meeting of the G20 group of leading developed and emerging economies in Brazil. (Reporting by Anna Willard, writing by William Schomberg)
