 (Reuters) - The G20 group of advanced and big emerging economies agreed on Sunday on the need for coordinated action to fight the financial crisis but left decisions on how to proceed to a leaders' summit next weekend. 

 Below are the main points as agreed in a communique issued by finance ministers and central bank officials at the group's annual meeting in Sao Paulo: *G20 countries are ready to "urgently take forward" the proposals to support global growth and restore stability in financial markets that emerge from a meeting of G20 government leaders next weekend. *G20 agrees to "take all necessary actions" to ease volatility in credit markets and to restore proper functioning of money markets in emerging nations and developed countries. *Measures to stabilize financial markets and boost global growth should also minimize the "negative social impact" of the crisis. *G20 says all sectors of the financial industry, "as appropriate," should be regulated or subjected to oversight, including ratings agencies. *G20 countries are determined to "take all necessary steps" to promote growth without creating inflation, citing fiscal spending and lower interest rates as important tools. *Countries with weak currencies and suffering inflation pressures may need careful monitoring by monetary authorities in order to take appropriate action. *Lower commodity prices and a slowdown in global growth have eased inflationary pressures. *The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank "must be comprehensively reformed" to reflect greater weight of emerging nations. *G20 is ready to increase funding to help the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral agencies, if needed, to assist countries affected by the global financial crisis. *The IMF should take a leading role in helping to write new policy to avoid future crises and the fund's surveillance and policy advice capacity should be strengthened. *The Financial Stability Forum, an influential advisory body made up of rich nations, must be expanded to include emerging market countries.
