 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - The U.S. administration of President George W. Bush is keeping President-elect Barack Obama's economic team "up to speed" on what will be discussed at next weekend's G20 financial summit in Washington, a U.S. Treasury official said on Sunday. 

 David McCormick, U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for International Affairs, also said that Obama has not yet decided whether he will attend the November 15 summit, which was called to address the global financial crisis. "The administration has been in touch with President-elect Obama's team ... and there is an openness to making sure that he is very much up to speed on what will be discussed and may or may not participate depending on the interest of the president-elect," McCormick told reporters after a G20 finance officials meeting in Brazil. "So it's certainly something that we want to make sure we have a nice handoff with and that the reform agenda can keep moving forward," he added. (Reporting by Anna Willard, Writing by Todd Benson)
