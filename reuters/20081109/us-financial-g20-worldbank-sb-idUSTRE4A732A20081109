 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - China told top finance officials on Saturday it was in a position to give a strong boost to its economy, like other countries, to help fight the global credit crisis, the head of the World Bank said. 

 "There is a sense of a need for supportive fiscal expansion," World Bank President Robert Zoellick told reporters, referring to discussions among officials from the G20 group of advanced and developing economies. "China is in a very good position to have a strong fiscal expansion. This is something the Chinese authorities talked about."
