 LONDON  (Reuters) - The British Airways BAY.L cabin crew trade union, Unite, won an appeal on Thursday against a London High Court ruling this week that had blocked a new wave of walkouts by the airline's staff. 

 BA on Monday won a court injunction to stop a threatened five-day strike by cabin crew members, the first of four such planned disruptions. Unite immediately challenged the ruling. A London Court of Appeal ruled 2-1 in favor of overturning the injunction order. (Reporting by  Stefano Ambrogi ; Editing by  Mohammed Abbas )
