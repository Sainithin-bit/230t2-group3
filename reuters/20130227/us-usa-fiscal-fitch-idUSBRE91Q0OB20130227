 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Wednesday said implementation of automatic U.S. government spending cuts due March 1, along with a government shutdown, would not prompt a negative rating action. 
 Implementation of the spending cuts, known as the "sequester," and a government shutdown, would however "further erode confidence that timely agreement will be reached on additional deficit reduction measures necessary to secure the 'AAA' rating," Fitch said in a statement. Fitch said the suspension of the debt limit to May 19 has reduced pressure on the U.S. 'AAA' rating, and said it does not expect a repeat of the U.S. debt ceiling crisis of August 2011. Failure to raise the debt ceiling in a timely fashion however would prompt a review and likely downgrade of the U.S. sovereign rating, Fitch said.
