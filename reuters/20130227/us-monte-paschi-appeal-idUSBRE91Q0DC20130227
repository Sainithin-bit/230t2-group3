 ROME  (Reuters) - Italian consumer watchdog group Codacons said on Wednesday it had appealed a court ruling in which the government was given the green light to lend 3.9 billion euros ($5.10 billion) to troubled lender Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMPS.MI ). 
 Codacons is seeking to block the bailout, saying it wants Monte dei Paschi nationalised. A hearing will be held on March 8 by the administrative appeals court in Rome, the consumer watchdog said in a statement. ($1 = 0.7649 euros) (Reporting by Giuseppe Fonte. Writing by Steve Scherer.)
