 PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Manufacturer United Technologies 
Corp ( UTX.N ) said on Sunday it made an unsolicited bid to 
acquire Diebold Inc after trying to hold merger talks with the 
maker of automatic teller machines for more than two years. 

  The $40-per-share cash offer marks a 66 percent premium to 
Diebold's closing stock price of $24.12 on Friday on the New 
York Stock Exchange.  United Technologies said Diebold told it earlier this month 
that a merger of the two companies was not in the best interest 
of Diebold shareholders. Diebold could not be immediately 
reached for comment on Sunday.  (Reporting by  Jessica Hall ; Editing by  Braden Reddall )  (For more M&A news and our DealZone blog, go to
