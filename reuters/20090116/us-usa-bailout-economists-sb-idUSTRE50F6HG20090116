 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Up to $500 billion more may be needed to fix broken banks, but prying that much money out of the bailout-fatigued U.S. Congress poses a major political challenge, economists said on Friday. 

 Against the objections of many lawmakers, the Senate voted on Thursday to let the Treasury Department's Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, commit another $350 billion to shoring up distressed financial institutions. That was on top of $350 billion that had already been allocated under the TARP, plus billions more from the Federal Reserve, to a massive financial sector rescue effort being financed primarily by taxpayers. The "$700 billion in the TARP is not going to foot the bill unless the economy picks up unexpectedly," said Peter Hooper, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. "Given the size of the losses globally, the notion of another $500 billion being needed sounds plausible," Hooper told Reuters on the sidelines of a banking briefing. But getting that kind of money out of Congress may be tough, considering that Thursday's Senate vote was 52-42, with several Democrats siding against President-elect Barack Obama, who personally pressured senators to back the TARP funding. North Dakota Sen. Byron Dorgan, who voted against releasing the next $350 billion for the TARP, said on the Senate floor on Friday he would not support more bailout spending without a sweeping overhaul of federal financial oversight. He urged going back to "revisit all that was done in the last dozen years or so" in the area of deregulating banks. Alison Reaser, chief economist at Bank of America's Global Wealth & Investment Management unit, said a "TARP II" program may be needed. But she added, "I think that candidly there is zero congressional support for that taking place." Another economist said that throwing taxpayer money at the crisis was not adequate. "The more we send money to prevent failures, the more we'll have future failures," said Allan Meltzer, professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University and a former adviser to President Ronald Reagan. He said the government should wean financial firms off government funds by requiring them to pursue matching private funds for any federal aid they receive. "I think we are making mistake after mistake," he said. (Reporting by John Poirier,  Karey Wutkowski  and Kevin Drawbaugh, editing by Matthew Lewis)
