 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Most of the 100 largest U.S. companies, including big banks that recently received federal bailouts, have foreign subsidiaries that may help the corporate parent avoid paying U.S. taxes, according to a report released by congressional auditors on Friday. 

 The Government Accountability Office found that 83 of the 100 largest publicly traded U.S. companies, based on 2007 revenue, have subsidiaries in jurisdictions that help reduce a company's tax burden. But the GAO also said it made no attempt to determine if companies with subsidiaries in offshore havens used them to cut their taxes. Some companies may have established the foreign subsidiaries for legitimate business reasons, it said. Two Democratic senators said they would introduce legislation to stop U.S. companies from using offshore havens that deprive the Treasury Department of an estimated $100 billion annually in lost tax revenues. "This report shows that some of our country's largest companies and federal contractors, many of which are household names, continue to use offshore tax havens to avoid paying their fair share of taxes to the U.S.," said Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota. He released the GAO report along with Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan. The GAO report said Citigroup Inc has set up 427 units that could serve as tax havens, Morgan Stanley has 273, and Bank of America has 115. Morgan Stanley and Bank of America were not immediately available for comment. "Citi has more than 4,000 subsidiaries throughout the world which enables us to serve hundreds of millions of individuals and institutions in more than 100 countries," a Citigroup spokesman said in an e-mail. All three banks have received taxpayer bailouts from the Treasury Department's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). Earlier on Friday, Bank of America received a fresh $20 billion capital injection, as well as a federal backstop against $118 billion of bad assets it holds, to help it absorb its purchase of brokerage Merrill Lynch. The GAO report also said 63 of the 100 largest publicly traded U.S. companies that get federal contracts maintain subsidiaries in tax haven jurisdictions. The figures may be understated because federal securities law requires companies to disclose only "significant" subsidiaries, the GAO said. Levin said hundreds more companies operate tax havens under strict secrecy laws in places such as Switzerland, Hong Kong, Panama and Mauritius. "We need to put an end to the use of offshore secrecy jurisdictions as tax havens," he said in a statement. Tax havens are typically jurisdictions that have low or no taxes, provide high levels of client confidentiality, and do not exchange information with foreign tax authorities.
