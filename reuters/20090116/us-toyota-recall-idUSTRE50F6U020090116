 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp will recall about 214,500 Lexus luxury cars sold in the United States due to the potential that corrosion in a pipe that delivers fuel to the engine could lead to leaks over time. 

 Toyota said the recall was launched in coordination with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration after Lexus determined that some ethanol fuels could cause corrosion of fuel pipes. The pipes will be replaced by Lexus dealers. The problem came to light after an investigation found that some engine warning alerts were triggered by the pipe corrosion and that it could eventually cause leaks over time. There have been no leaks reported, a Toyota spokesman said. Owners of the Lexus vehicles covered by the recall will be notified by mail starting in late January. The recall covers certain GS300/350, IS250/350 and LS460/460L cars built in the 2006 to 2008 model years. (Reporting by  David Bailey , editing by Matthew Lewis)
