 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury has been in discussions with Ford Motor Co. regarding its financing needs and the $700 billion federal rescue fund since December, a U.S. government official said on Friday. 

 The official, speaking on a background conference call after the U.S. Treasury announced a $1.5 billion loan to Chrysler Financial, said he could not characterize whether Ford intended to seek U.S. financial aid. The loan to Chrysler, aimed at helping automaker Chrysler LLC extend new auto loans despite frozen credit markets, also was structured to protect taxpayers in the event of a potential bankruptcy for the firms, controlled by private equity firm Cerberus, by separating the newly created car loans used as collateral into a special purpose entity created for the loan.
