 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said on Friday it has no plans to sell its unit in Brazil as speculation swirled that it might be looking to unload part of its operations in Latin America's largest country. 

 The U.S. bank also said that its plans to split into two separate units will not affect its operations in Brazil, a key growth market where it has a retail banking and an investment banking business. "According to the realignment announced today, Brazil was confirmed as a strategic market for the company and for the future of Citi," the bank said in a short statement. "We have no intention of selling our business in the country. In addition, the Brazilian unit's organizational structure will not be impacted and will remain under the leadership of Gustavo Marin," it added, referring to the bank's chief executive in Brazil. The statement followed intense speculation in local financial markets that Citigroup was in talks about a potential joint venture with Brazilian banking giant Bradesco, which so far has watched the recent wave of consolidation in Brazil's banking sector from the sidelines. According to International Financing Review, a Thomson Reuters service, Citigroup is looking to sell up to a 50 percent stake of its Brazilian unit to Bradesco, similar to what state-run Banco do Brasil did a week ago when it bought a stake in privately held Banco Votorantim.
