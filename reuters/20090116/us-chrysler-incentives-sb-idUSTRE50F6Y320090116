 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC offered interest free loans on Friday on 11 of its slow-selling models as the automaker moved quickly to free up credit for buyers after its finance arm received $1.5 billion from the U.S. Treasury. 

 Chrysler's Vice Chairman Jim Press said the automaker was also making "good progress" on the $3 billion in additional loans it requested from the government. Press said Chrysler was also talking to a group of debtholders on the sweeping concessions it needs under the terms of the $4 billion in emergency lending it has already received from the government. Chrysler, seen as the weakest of the Detroit automakers, expects the new zero percent financing offer to lift U.S. sales by 20 percent from recent depressed levels. The automaker said it would roll out additional sales incentives in the next few days. "Our dealers told us after December that not having Chrysler Financial in the game cost between 20-24 pct of their business," said Steve Landry, Chrysler's North American sales chief. Chrysler, which saw U.S. sales plummet 30 percent in 2008, has blamed lack of credit for its poor sales performance. The automaker's finance arm, constrained by lack of funding, had to pull out of the vehicle lease business, further hurting new vehicle sales. "This is terribly important," said Alan Helfman, a Chrysler dealer in Houston. "Every little bit helps and we just need something to push it." Helfman, like other dealers, said customers with lower credit scores had been shut out of vehicle purchases in recent months or forced to resort to other higher-cost lending programs. "If you have a great credit score, you can get done. It's the ones that have some issues are a little more challenging," he said. Chrysler Financial, like other auto finance companies, makes consumer loans and then bundles and sells those loans as asset-backed securities to investors. But that market has contracted sharply following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, cutting off a major supply of funds for auto retail financing. The U.S. Treasury said on Friday it will lend Chrysler's finance arm $1.5 billion to help it make new car loans as part of a broader aid program to revive the sputtering domestic auto industry. Press expected all of the new capital would go toward assisting car buyers and could be depleted by end March. Chrysler said the zero-percent loan offer would be for a period of up to five years. Vehicles covered by the program are the Town & Country minivan, 300 and 300C sedans, the Jeep Grand Cherokee, Commander and Wrangler SUVs, the Grand Caravan minivan, the Dodge Charger, Magnum, Challenger and Ram pickup trucks.
