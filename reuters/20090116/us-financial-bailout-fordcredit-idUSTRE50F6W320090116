 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) on Friday confirmed its credit unit has been in talks with the Treasury Department on ways to help restore liquidity to markets to help spur new financing. 

 "We have been maintaining ongoing dialogue with the government on ideas to help unfreeze the credit markets," the automaker said in a statement. Ford stressed that it is not seeking a bailout for its automotive operations at this time. The company has said it may seek a federal line of credit if its finances worsen more than expected this year. Ford Credit already has taken advantage of the Federal Reserve's Commercial Paper Funding Facility and has sought FDIC approval of its application to establish an industrial loan corporation.
