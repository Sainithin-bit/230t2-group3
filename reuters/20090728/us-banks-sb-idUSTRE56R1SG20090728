 FRANKFURT/MADRID  (Reuters) - Two of Europe's biggest banks, Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) and Spain's BBVA ( BBVA.MC ), braced for the economic slump by increasing bad loan provisions in the second quarter. 

 Shares in Deutsche, Germany's largest bank, were down 8.7 percent at 1106 GMT as its cautious outlook overshadowed a sharp rise in profit driven by strong investment banking earnings. Deutsche's second-quarter pretax profit more than doubled from a year ago to 1.3 billion euros ($1.86 billion), but fell short of a 1.47 billion euro average forecast from analysts. BBVA, Europe's sixth-biggest bank, said it raised bad loan provisions, knocking its first half net profit down 10 percent from a year earlier to 2.8 billion euros. That figure still beat an average forecast of 2.5 billion. Bad loans as a percentage of BBVA's total rose to 3.2 percent at the end of June from 2.8 percent at the end of March. But there was a powerful showing from retail banking, the main driver for earnings, with net interest income climbing 23.5 percent in the first half. The results follow bumper investment bank earnings from U.S. rivals Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), JP Morgan ( JPM.N ) and others, but European banks are showing strains on bad debts similar to their U.S. counterparts. Switzerland's Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) last week posted better-than-expected profit on the back of market share gains in investment banking. Other European banks are also expected to show strong investment banking earnings as well as rising bad debts when they report over the coming weeks. Shares in BBVA, Spain's second-biggest retail bank, rose 4.2 percent after the bank said its core capital was 7.1 percent at end-June, close to its full-year target. "The strong capital generation in the first half shows that BBVA has no need to hike capital, which had concerned the market," Caja Madrid Bolsa's Javier Berna said. Investment banking accounted for 828 million euros of Deutsche's pretax profit of 1.32 billion euros, underpinned by a rise in revenue from trading debt-related products and a reduction of loss-making toxic assets on its books. Profits from the investment division were dampened by a move to reduce risky trading positions and assets, it said. Deutsche's earnings show that "provisions are something which need to be looked at again," JP Morgan analyst Kian Abouhossein said. BAD DEBTS RISING Deutsche, Europe's eighth-biggest bank by market value, said its provisions for credit losses rose to 1 billion euros last quarter, a near seven-fold rise from a year earlier and almost double the provisions made during the first quarter. The increase "reflects the generally weaker credit environment" and includes some 508 million euros in provisions related to assets which are being reclassified under International Accounting Standard 39, the bank said. Deutsche Chief Executive Josef Ackermann said the Frankfurt-based bank was well prepared for an uncertain environment, but said employment levels and real estate remained a worry for broader economic health. Pressure on loan portfolios is likely to continue increasing substantially as private and corporate insolvencies mount and default rates rise, Deutsche Bank said. The bank raised optimism it could be through the worst as it said the number of new bad loans fell by 19 percent in the second quarter, the lowest level in the last four quarters, repeating a trend seen at other Spanish retail banks. The threat of rising bad debts this year and into 2010 could put a strain on balance sheets and prompt banks including BBVA and Deutsche Bank to raise capital, analysts reckon. Deutsche boosted its tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of balance sheet strength, to 11 percent from 10.2 percent at the end of March.
