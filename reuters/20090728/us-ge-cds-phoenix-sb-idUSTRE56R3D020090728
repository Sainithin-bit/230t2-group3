 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The costs to insure General Electric Capital Corp's bonds against the risk of default slipped on Tuesday after a GE executive said a forced breakup of GE Capital was increasingly unlikely to result from U.S. financial regulatory reform. 

 General Electric Capital Corp's credit default swaps narrowed to about 325 basis points on Tuesday from about 340 basis points late on Monday, according to Phoenix Partners Group data. (Reporting by  John Parry  and  Dena Aubin ; Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
