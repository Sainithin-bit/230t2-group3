 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T plans to appoint to its board three executives from Citigroup ( C.N ), which last month won control of the Japanese brokerage in a $7.7 billion deal, the Nikkei business daily said. 

 Citigroup secured 61 percent of Nikko's voting stock in a tender bid, its biggest-ever Asian acquisition. The Nikkei said in its evening edition that Nikko had decided to make the appointments, which include Citibank Japan Chief Executive Douglas Peterson, in a bid to regain market trust after an accounting scandal. Citigroup launched its buyout bid after the accounting scandal which hurt business at core retail unit Nikko Cordial Securities and Nikko Citigroup Ltd., the companies' eight-year-old investment banking joint venture. Management at Nikko endorsed the takeover, which is the biggest-ever foreign buyout of a Japanese company. Nikko Cordial declined to comment on the report.
