 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Monday with sentiment boosted by yet another record high for U.S. blue chips, but worries about China's latest policy tightening were expected to cap regional markets. 

 China's central bank raised interest rates as well as banks' reserve requirements and announced on Friday that the yuan would be allowed to trade more freely, letting it rise or fall by 0.5 percent each day against the dollar, from a 0.3 percent margin. The steps come just days ahead of a key meeting with the United States to discuss trade tensions and are likely to be interpreted as both an olive branch to Washington and as a signal that China is serious about keeping its red-hot economy in check. All eyes are on how China's stock market will react to the latest moves. It opens at 0130 GMT. At 0028 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average had advanced 0.57 percent as electronics components maker TDK Corp. climbed 2.71 percent, Canon edged up 0.28 percent and industrial robot maker Fanuc added 1.22 percent. "I expect we'll see a gain at the start of trade," said Takahiko Murai, general manager of equities at Nozomi Securities, but added that further upside will be limited. "Corporations have been giving conservative earnings forecasts for the current year, that's one reason why gains will be capped." In Australia, the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.68 percent thanks to strength in the major miners following a rally in copper prices. BHP Billiton was up 1.01 percent and Rio Tinto added 0.76 percent. Also in favor, Commonwealth Bank gained 1.23 percent. But APN News and Media slid 3.85 percent on speculation that its second-largest shareholder, fund manager Perpetual, would vote against a planned takeover by Independent News and Media Plc. See After opening lower, South Korea's key KOSPI reversed direction to be 0.11 percent higher as gains in regional markets helped alleviate concerns about China, the country's top export market. Top automaker Hyundai Motor climbed 3.59 percent, steel maker POSCO added 1.10 percent but market heavyweight Samsung Electronics slipped 0.18 percent. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan gained 0.48 percent to be within reach of a record high set last Thursday. U.S. stocks rose last Friday, pushing the blue-chip Dow to a record close as more takeover activity and consumer sentiment data improved the outlook for equities.
