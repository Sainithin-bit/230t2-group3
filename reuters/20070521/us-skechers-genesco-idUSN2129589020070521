 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A buyout firm is in talks to acquire Skechers USA Inc. ( SKX.N ) and Genesco Inc. ( GCO.N ), Women's Wear Daily reported on Monday, saying the plan is to combine the two footwear retailers once the deals are done. 

 Skechers shares were up nearly 9 percent in morning trade, while shares of Genesco, which have gained 38 percent on buyout chatter since its last earnings report in March, were up almost 2 percent. The trade paper said financial sources indicated that the buyout firm is possibly Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL, which is taking over Alliance Boots Plc AB.L together with the pharmacy chain's deputy chairman. That deal is Europe's largest leveraged buyout and the first private equity takeover of a FTSE 100 company. Genesco, which operates the Lids and Journeys chains, last month rejected an unsolicited $1.2 billion takeover offer from rival Foot Locker Inc. ( FL.N ), which at the time said it was considering other options, including a proxy fight. Women's Wear Daily said there had been rumblings in the marketplace that an acquisition of Skechers might be contingent on the buyout firm acquiring Genesco. KKR, Genesco and Skechers did not immediately return calls seeking comment. Skechers, which currently trades at 15.8 times full-year earnings estimates according to Reuters data, were up $2.67 at $33.81 on the New York Stock Exchange, while Genesco shares were up 88 cents at $50.75.
