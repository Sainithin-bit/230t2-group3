 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The stock of DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE may continue the rise that began last year, freed from the burden of Chrysler, Barron's reported in its May 21 edition. 

 The shares of the new Daimler, whichis likely to trade under that name soon, change hands at around $86 but could hit $100 or more in a year, the magazine said. DaimlerChrysler DCX.N said last week it would sell an 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler Group to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, unwinding the 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler that did not work out as planned.
