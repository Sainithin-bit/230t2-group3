 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Utility Consolidated Edison Inc. ( ED.N ) is planning a program to upgrade its electricity system that would cost $7.78 billion between 2008 and 2011 and require steep rate increases, a spokesman said on Monday. 

 ConEd has said electricity use has increased more than 20 percent over the past 10 years, requiring more capital investment to maintain a reliable infrastructure. The huge spending program could lead to rate increases of as much as 20 percent for some customers, spokesman Chris Olert said. "We need it for infrastructure investments," Olert said. As part of the proposals, the company plans to install a superconducting cable in Manhattan, Olert said. The company filed an electricity rate increase proposal with New York State regulators earlier this month that would add nearly $2 billion in revenues over three years. The proposal would increase revenue by $1.2 billion, effective April 1, 2008, representing an 11.6 percent average rise in customer bills. Rates would rise an additional 3.2 percent in 2009 and 3.7 percent in 2010, the company has said.
