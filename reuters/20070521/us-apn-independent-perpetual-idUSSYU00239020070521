 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Perpetual ( PPT.AX ) said on Monday it plans to vote against a planned acquisition of Australia's APN News and Media ( APN.AX ) by Independent News and Media Plc INWS.I(INM). 

 The comment follows media speculation that Perpetual would vote against the deal. INM, led by tycoon Tony O'Reilly, nudged up its takeover offer for APN to value the firm at A$3 billion ($2.5 billion) last month after key shareholders, including Perpetual, criticized an earlier offer. ($1=A$1.21)
