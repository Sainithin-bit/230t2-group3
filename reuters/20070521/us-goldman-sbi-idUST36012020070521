 TOKYO  (Reuters) - U.S.-based investment bank Goldman Sachs Group G.S and venture capital firm SBI Holdings ( 8473.T ) have agreed to form a joint venture to provide growth capital to mid-sized companies in Japan and overseas. 

 SBI said Goldman would buy a 40 percent stake in its subsidiary SBI Capital for an undisclosed sum, and the venture would aim to manage 100 billion yen ($825 million) in assets within three years. SBI spokeswoman Miho Uratani said the joint venture will target mid-sized firms for their growth potential, and among foreign firms it will particularly target those in China, Hong Kong, India and Vietnam. "Our goal is to provide the most advanced financial solutions to a broad range of regional and mid-sized companies," SBI said in a statement. The venture will seek to couple Goldman's money and financial expertise with SBI's network of corporate contacts in Japan. SBI also said the venture will aim to nurture businesses and improve clients' corporate values by actively conducting buy-out investments regardless of their industry or investment types. It expects to book a special profit of 4.9 billion yen for the year ending next March. In January, U.S. investment bank Merrill Lynch MER.N agreed to provide up $4 billion in financing for real estate projects backed by SBI to increase its exposure to Japan's resurgent property market. Shares of SBI finished Monday up 3.8 percent to 37,150 yen, while the benchmark Nikkei average  .N225  added 0.90 percent.
