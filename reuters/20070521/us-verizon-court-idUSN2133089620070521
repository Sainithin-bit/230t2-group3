 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The Supreme Court gave a legal victory to Verizon ( VZ.N ) and other regional Bell companies on Monday, ruling that an antitrust lawsuit against them cannot proceed without specific allegations to back it up. 

 By a 7-2 vote, the justices reversed an appeals court ruling that had allowed the class-action antitrust lawsuit to go forward on a general allegation that Verizon predecessor Bell Atlantic Co. and other Bell companies had conspired to not compete in each other's territory. The justices concluded that those allegations must have "further factual enhancement" in order for a case to proceed. "It makes sense to say ... that an allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy will not suffice," Justice David Souter wrote for the court majority. At issue is a class-action lawsuit against Bell Atlantic, which contends that lack of competition for local telephone service and "parallel conduct" of the regional Bells were evidence of an antitrust conspiracy. More than a decade after the court-ordered breakup of AT&T into seven regional Bells, Congress passed a landmark legislation in 1996 designed to foster competition among carriers. It required regional Bells such as Verizon to make their networks available to rivals in exchange for gaining access to the lucrative long-distance voice and data markets. The case was dismissed by a district court judge, who said the plaintiffs could not sue based only on a "bare-bones" allegation of conspiracy. But that decision was reversed by a federal appeals court in New York, which ruled that the case should not be dismissed unless the charges were implausible. Had it not been overturned, the decision of the New York appeals court "would have significantly increased the exposure of the bells, as well as many other companies, to the burden of defending against antitrust lawsuits, which often involve extensive discovery and award treble damages," Stifel Nicolaus said in a research note. The U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division has sided with the telephone companies, arguing that "parallel action and inaction" alone was not enough to provide a basis for an antitrust lawsuit. The Supreme Court's majority opinion agreed, ruling that an allegation of parallel conduct and a bare assertion of conspiracy is not enough. There must be enough facts to suggest an agreement was made, Souter said. Verizon issued a statement praising the decision. "The Supreme Court's decision embraces an important principle about protecting the freedom of firms to make unilateral decisions on what markets to enter or not enter," the company's deputy general counsel, John Thorne, said in a statement. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissented.
