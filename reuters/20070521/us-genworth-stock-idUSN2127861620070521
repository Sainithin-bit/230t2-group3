 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Genworth Financial Inc.'s ( GNW.N ) shares could climb more than 24 percent over the next 18 to 24 months as the company allocates more capital to higher-return businesses, Barron's said in its May 21 edition. 

 The magazine cited Tim Kang of the $1.8 billion Olstein All-Cap Value Fund as saying he expects the stock to rise to $45 in the next 18 to 24 months. It's shares closed at $36.36 on Friday. The company is also expected to keep buying back stock, the magazine said. Genworth said on Friday it bought back about 16.5 million of its common shares from Merrill Lynch MER.N for an initial price of $600 million, using an accelerated stock repurchase agreement.
