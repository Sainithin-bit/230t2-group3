 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators are reviewing the safety of GlaxoSmithKline's Plc's diabetes drug Avandia but have not confirmed the significance of risks reported in a study released on Monday, a Food and Drug Administration official said. 

 A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine said Avandia increased cardiac-related deaths and heart attacks. FDA official Dr. Robert Meyer said other data contradicted those findings. "FDA has not confirmed the clinical significance of the reported increased risk," Meyer told reporters.
