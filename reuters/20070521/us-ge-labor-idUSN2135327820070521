 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co. ( GE.N ) confirmed on Monday it had begun contracts talks with unions representing about 20,000 of its U.S. workers. 

 GE said it held talks with representatives of the International Union of Electronic Workers/Communications Workers of America. The conglomerate expects to begin negotiations with the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America on Tuesday. Negotiations will also be held with local unions. "Our goal is to negotiate fair contracts that will continue to provide employees with attractive wages and benefits while keeping GE's diverse businesses competitive," said Bill Casey, chief negotiator for Fairfield, Connecticut-based GE. GE's existing four-year contracts, covering large numbers of workers in Kentucky, Massachusetts, New York, Kansas and Pennsylvania, expire on June 17.
