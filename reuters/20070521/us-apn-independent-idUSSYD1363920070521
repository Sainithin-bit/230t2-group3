 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's APN News and Media ( APN.AX ) said on Monday it wants fund manager Perpetual ( PPT.AX ) to clarify its position on a planned takeover of APN by a group led by Independent News and Media Plc INWS.I (INM). 

 The comment follows an unsourced report in the Australian Financial Review newspaper on Saturday that Perpetual, APN's second-largest shareholder, was planning to vote against the deal at a shareholder meeting on May 25, derailing the APN bid. Perpetual owns 14.8 percent of APN, the newspaper said. Shares in APN fell 4 percent to traded at A$5.74 at 0005 GMT. "APN has received no advice from Perpetual in relation to its voting intentions," APN said in a statement. Dublin-based INM, led by tycoon Tony O'Reilly, and private equity partners Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Providence Equity Partners (PEP) last month upped their offer for APN to value the firm at A$3 billion ($2.5 billion) after key shareholders, including Perpetual, criticized an earlier offer. The new A$6.20 per share offer, Independent's fourth since October, cannot be raised again under Australian takeover laws because it has been declared final. The deal is the latest in a string of Australian takeover offers to encounter stiff shareholder resistance, including failed high profile bids for Flight Centre Ltd. ( FLT.AX ) and Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ). ($1=A$1.21)
