 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Computer products distributor Ingram Micro Inc.( IM.N ) said on Monday that it had received a "Wells Notice" from U.S. regulators about a previously disclosed informal inquiry involving security software maker McAfee Inc. MFE.N 

 Ingram Micro said the notice says staff at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission would recommend an administrative proceeding contending Ingram Micro failed to maintain adequate records of certain transactions with McAfee. The notice also says the SEC believes these transactions were the cause of McAfee's securities-laws violations stemming from the filing of reports and maintenance of books and records.
