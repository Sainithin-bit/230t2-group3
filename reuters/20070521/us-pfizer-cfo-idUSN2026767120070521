 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. ( PFE.N ) said on Sunday that Chief Financial Officer Alan Levin had resigned and its global president of research would retire, marking the latest shake-up inside the world's largest drug maker. 

 Pfizer, which ousted Chief Executive Hank McKinnell last July after a disappointing pipeline of new medicines sent its share price to multi-year lows, said Levin had resigned to pursue career opportunities outside of Pfizer. John LaMattina, president of global research and development, will also leave his post and retire by the end of this year after 30 years with the company. Pfizer said a search had begun to replace both men, and each had agreed to remain during this period to ensure a smooth transition. Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler noted in the release that during LaMattina's tenure, the company had built up its oncology pipeline of drugs while increasing investment in biologics and vaccines. Pfizer is hoping new treatments, including Sutent for cancer, Chantix for smoking cessation and Lyrica for neuropathic pain, will help fuel profit growth longer term as other product setbacks and stiff competition for existing medicines pressure the bottom line. At the same time, Kindler is pushing through a massive restructuring at Pfizer that includes several plant closures and job cuts along with a business realignment to spark a rebound. But until new treatments hit the shelves, those cost cuts are designed to fuel earnings growth. Last month, it said profits would rise as much as 4 percent this year, but sales would be roughly flat through 2008 due to patent expirations for its treatments of depression, allergies and high blood pressure. Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said the moves appeared to be part of that restructuring. "That's a painful process for any organization and there's clearly going to be fallout," Ryan said. LaMattina is well-regarded, Ryan added, noting his lengthy Pfizer career and she said it's not surprising that he would be moving toward retirement. At the same time, Ryan said, "the company has had more than its fair share of disappointments in research and development over the last five years." The biggest setback to date came last December, when the New York-based drug maker halted clinical trials of its highest profile medicine in development, a cholesterol drug known as Torcetrapib, on safety concerns. Pfizer, and its investors, were relying on the drug to replace its best selling drug, Lipitor, which is slated to lose patent protection as early as 2010. Levin has played a less prominent role with Wall Street under McKinnell and now Kindler, Ryan added. He joined Pfizer in 1987 and was appointed CFO in February 2005, replacing David Shedlarz, who was promoted to Vice Chairman of Pfizer.
