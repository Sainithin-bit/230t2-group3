 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ), the No. 2 home improvement chain, on Monday reported a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit and pared its full-year earnings forecast as the slower U.S. housing market pressured sales. 

 Earnings came to $739 million, or 48 cents a share, for the first quarter that ended May 4, down 12 percent from $841 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected Lowe's -- which ranks behind sector leader Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) -- to earn 49 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. "While Lowe's still has more room to grow than Home Depot, it is increasingly competing for the same customer in a decelerating retail environment," said Jon Fisher, a portfolio manager for Fifth Third Asset Management. Lowe's total sales rose 2 percent to $12.2 billion, helped by 15 store openings, but still fell shy of the $12.5 billion analysts had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail measure, fell 6.3 percent, worse than Lowe's forecast of a 2 percent to 4 percent decline. In a statement, Lowe's said the difficult U.S. housing market, tough comparisons to sales during hurricane rebuilding efforts and falling lumber prices pressured results. It also said cold and wet weather in April contributed to lower-than-anticipated sales. The company said consumers were taking on fewer high-ticket projects such as kitchen remodels, and said the weakest markets were California, Florida and the U.S. Northeast. But the Mooresville, North Carolina-based retailer said easier comparisons for the second half gave it confidence that sales would improve. Lowe's, which cut its profit forecast multiple times last year as construction weakened, gave an outlook that "still looks somewhat optimistic," Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said in a research note on Monday. Last week, Home Depot posted a 30-percent decline in first-quarter profit as store sales fell 4.3 percent. Lowe's forecast full-year profit of $1.99 to $2.03 a share, down from its forecast made in February of $2.02 to $2.09 a share. Full-year sales are now expected to rise about 7 percent, down from a 10 percent increase previously forecast. For the second quarter, the company expects earnings of 62 to 64 cents a share. Lowe's said it expected same-store sales to fall 1 percent to 3 percent in the second quarter, and fall 1 percent to 2 percent for the whole year. In February, Lowe's had forecast that same-store sales for the year would be flat to 2 percent higher. Analysts currently expect profit of 60 cents a share for the second quarter and $2.01 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Lowe's shares fell 90 cents, or 2.75 percent, to $31.77 in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.
