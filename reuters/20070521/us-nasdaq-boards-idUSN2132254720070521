 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nasdaq Stock Market Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) said on Monday that it is launching a service that aims to match up companies and prospective board members. 

 The online service, called Board Recruiting, is the first online service of its kind. Some companies have been struggling to find candidates to fill board seats as greater time demands on directors reduce their ability to serve on multiple boards, the exchange said. Board Recruiting is the latest in a series of added services the exchange has been offering to companies, including its press release distribution service Prime Newswire and insurance for directors and officers. "We are focused on providing incremental value to our issuer companies," said Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld at an investor conference on Monday. "That fits into the broad context of let's make sure that we can do more and more things for the people that are natural points of contact in our issuer companies." The BoardRecruiting.com Web site allows prospective directors to enter their profiles in a database, which companies seeking board members will be able to start searching next month. The board recruitment process is now often conducted through word of mouth, David Smith, president of the society of corporate secretaries and governance professionals, said in a statement issued by Nasdaq.
