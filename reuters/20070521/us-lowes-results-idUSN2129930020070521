 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Lowe's Cos. ( LOW.N ), the No. 2 home improvement chain, on Monday reported a lower-than-expected first-quarter profit and pared its full-year earnings forecast as the slower U.S. housing market pressures sales. 

 The company's shares were down nearly 4 percent in afternoon trading. Earnings came to $739 million, or 48 cents a share, for the first quarter that ended May 4, down 12 percent from $841 million, or 53 cents, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected Lowe's -- which ranks behind sector leader Home Depot Inc. ( HD.N ) -- to earn 49 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. There were fewer shares outstanding in the latest quarter. "While Lowe's still has more room to grow than Home Depot, it is increasingly competing for the same customer in a decelerating retail environment," said Jon Fisher, a portfolio manager for Fifth Third Asset Management. Lowe's total sales rose 2 percent to $12.2 billion, helped by 15 store openings, but still fell shy of the $12.5 billion analysts had expected. Sales at stores open at least a year, an important retail measure, fell 6.3 percent, worse than Lowe's forecast of a 2 percent to 4 percent decline. The average purchase fell 3.6 percent to $68.22 as consumers took on fewer big projects such as kitchen remodels. Lowe's cited weakness in markets hard-hit by the U.S. housing slowdown such as California and the U.S. Northeast, and added that cold and wet weather in April contributed to lower-than-anticipated sales, Lowe's also said tough comparisons with sales related to rebuilding after the hurricane, as well as falling lumber prices pressured results. While commercial sales were strong in the first quarter, Lowe's said it lost unit market share in appliances as sellers ran promotions to spur purchases. "We're still seeing some sluggishness in some of the larger ticket, special-order, decor categories," Lowe's Chairman Robert Niblock told Reuters. "With that, we've decided to be a little bit more cautious on our outlook." Rival Home Depot posted a 30 percent decline in first-quarter profit last week as store sales fell 4.3 percent. Lowe's, which cut its profit forecast multiple times last year as home sales and construction weakened, gave an outlook that "still looks somewhat optimistic," Sanford Bernstein analyst Colin McGranahan said in a research note on Monday. The Mooresville, North Carolina, retailer forecast full-year profit of $1.99 to $2.03 a share, down from its forecast made in February of $2.02 to $2.09 a share. Full-year sales are now expected to rise about 7 percent, down from a 10 percent increase previously forecast. For the second quarter, the company expects earnings of 62 to 64 cents a share. Lowe's said it expected same-store sales to decrease 1 percent to 3 percent in the second quarter, and fall 1 percent to 2 percent for the whole year. In February, Lowe's had forecast that same-store sales for the year would be flat to 2 percent higher. Analysts currently expect profit of 60 cents a share for the second quarter and $2.01 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Lowe's shares were off $1.28 at $31.39 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, while Home Depot was up 2 cents at $38.90. Lowe's stock is up just slightly so far this year, while Home Depot is down 3 percent.
