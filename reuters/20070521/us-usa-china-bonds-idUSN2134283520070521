 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Signs of a long-anticipated shift in China's demand for foreign assets are mounting, and that could weigh on U.S. Treasuries over time. 

 China has $1.2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and holds $420.2 billion of U.S. Treasuries, making it the second biggest foreign holder after Japan. The country's purchase of a $3 billion stake in U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group is one confirmation that China is branching out into riskier assets in search of higher returns, and that its purchases of safer government bonds may diminish, analysts say. "Chinese authorities are keen on putting further foreign exchange reserves growth into other financial assets apart from government bonds," which could put modest upward pressure on Treasury yields, said Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, Scotland. Bond yields and prices move inversely. Strategists think it highly unlikely that China will slash its existing holdings of Treasuries because that would deal a sharp blow to prices and the value of China's own hefty holdings. Over the six months to March, China steadily raised its holdings of Treasuries by $28 billion, and strategists expect the country to continue buying U.S. government bonds, though at a slower pace. "While in the Blackstone story the amounts involved are very small, it is a very good example of this trend beginning and (it) will add considerable momentum over the next couple of years," Milligan said. Treasury prices may not react much over the short term, but should a gradual diversification by China out of U.S. Treasuries with fresh foreign exchange reserves become a trend, it could shift long maturities yields higher. Much of China's buying is thought to have been concentrated in the longer maturities. "For years and years they have been doing something fairly simplistic, fairly secure," by investing in Treasury bonds, said T.J. Marta, fixed-income strategist with Royal Bank of Canada Capital Markets in New York. "Three billion dollars versus $1.2 trillion (in foreign exchange reserves) is a drop in the bucket, but it is a first step and shows a willingness to buy market expertise," Marta said. Steady foreign purchases of longer-dated Treasuries could ebb as China seeks to recycle some of its hefty trade surplus into riskier assets, he said. "I think this is a structural, multiyear story," Marta added. Those betting on a long-term U.S. government bond market sell-off are counting on diversification by several global central banks as a key catalyst. Last week's slide of mid- to long-dated Treasury prices, sending the 10-year note's yield to three-month highs, confirms that the very long-term "trend of declining long-term U.S. interest rates is coming to an end and is being replaced by a sustainable, cyclical trend of rising rates," John Kosar, president of Asbury Research in Chicago, wrote in a research note. "A potential driver of this new trend of rising U.S. rates could be the exodus of foreign central bank funds out of U.S. Treasuries, as prices decline," which would hurt long maturities prices most and steepen the yield curve, Kosar wrote. China's announcement last week that it had raised interest rates and widened the trading band for the yuan, allowing swifter appreciation of the currency, is also likely to reduce some of the appeal of dollar-denominated Treasuries, analysts said. If global bond investors think the dollar has further to fall against Asian currencies, they may be more cautious about buying Treasuries. "Widening of the yuan (band) versus the dollar is having a dramatic negative impact on bonds ... leading to less dollar bonds being bought," Andrew Brenner, senior vice president and co-head of the structured product group at brokerage MAN Financial in New York, said in an e-mail. "Whether it is the lack of buying, selling, or the perception that buying will dry up is irrelevant. It is pressuring bonds," Brenner wrote.
