 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo said on Monday that proposed regulation in the subprime mortgage industry would help crooks while hurting legitimate lenders and the housing market. 

 "It's better for the crooks," Mozilo told Reuters before speaking at a Mortgage Bankers Association conference in Manhattan. "It's only the good people who have to comply. Regulation, in my opinion, has caused part of the problem. When they attacked the pay option and interest-only loans, that really put a dent in a lot of the product, which is perfectly good product." Mozilo, leader of the largest U.S. mortgage lender, set the tone for a conference whose membership is smarting from the excesses of the subprime sector. Some of the largest subprime lenders have gone out of business amid falling property values and a rising wave of delinquencies and foreclosures. Kieren Quinn, chairman-elect of the MBA, acknowledged in the conference's opening remarks that subprime woes had given the entire mortgage industry a black eye. Quinn also drew comparisons to Major League Baseball's steroids scandal. He said the industry needed to continue to scrub the industry, "or we'll get ugly, ugly regulation." "The market already has corrected many of its mistakes," Quinn said. Mozilo said current guidelines proposed by regulators would exacerbate problems in the housing market. "The reason why people can't sell their houses is there are no buyers around," Mozilo said. "And there are no buyers around because they can't get the financing."
