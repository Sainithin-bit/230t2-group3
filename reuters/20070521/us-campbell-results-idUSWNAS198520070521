 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co. ( CPB.N ) on Monday posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by price increases, sales of new products like lower-sodium soups and strength in its V8 vegetable juice business. 

 The company also raised its fiscal-year 2007 earnings forecast, and its stock rose about 2 percent in premarket electronic trading. Campbell, which also makes Godiva chocolate and Pepperidge Farm baked goods, said profit increased to $217 million, or 55 cents a share, in the third quarter ended April 29 from $166 million, or 40 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Campbell said earnings were 45 cents a share. Analysts on average forecast 41 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8 percent to $1.87 billion, exceeding the analysts' average estimate of $1.79 billion. The weaker U.S. dollar, which lifts the value of international sales, accounted for 2 percentage points of the increase. Campbell has used a combination of price increases and productivity improvements to help offset higher commodity costs. At the same time, it has been developing more new products, like the lower-sodium soups, to help boost sales by tapping into trends toward healthier eating. Campbell shares rose to $40.25 on Monday in premarket electronic trading from Friday's close of $39.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock traded at about 18.7 times next year's estimated earnings at Friday's close, toward the middle of the range of multiples in the Standard & Poor's Packaged Foods index .15GSPFOOD.
