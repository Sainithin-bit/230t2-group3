 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Another study has found that diabetes drugs intended to help patients live longer, healthier lives may in fact increase the chances they will die -- this time of heart attacks and other causes. 

 The news, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, set off a clamor by consumer groups, heart experts and Congress -- some of whom question the safety of all drugs in this class after a number of studies that have shown liver, heart and bone side effects. Avandia, made by GlaxoSmithKline, is a member of a drug class called thiazolidinediones or glitazones. They affect a gene called PPAR-gamma and help the body use insulin more effectively. But they also have broader effects, said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Nissen and colleagues said they had found that Avandia raises the risk of heart death by 64 percent and the risk of heart attack by 43 percent. "These drugs, these PPAR drugs, they turn on and off a large number of genes," Nissen said in a telephone interview. "Perhaps as many as 100 genes are affected. Unfortunately, we don't know what most of these genes do." Glaxo has strongly defended the safety of Avandia and says it has adequately tested the drug's safety. But other heart experts, including Dr. Curt Furberg of Wake Forest University in North Carolina, who has been outspoken about drug safety, questioned why any doctor would now prescribe a drug in the same class. Rezulin, the first drug in the glitazone class, was pulled from the market in March 2000 after 63 people who took it died from acute liver failure and nearly 40 others had to have liver transplants. Pfizer Inc., which acquired Rezulin in its purchase of Warner-Lambert Co., has had to fight thousands of lawsuits alleging that Warner-Lambert failed to inform the public of the drug's health risks. Consumer groups and some heart experts urged an immediate U.S. Food and Drug Administration review of Avandia, known generically as rosiglitazone. They noted Vioxx, Merck and Co. Inc.'s arthritis drug, was pulled from the market in 2004 after it was shown to raise the risk of heart attacks. NOT EVEN THAT EFFECTIVE Members of Congress, already scrutinizing FDA oversight of drug safety, immediately scheduled hearings. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the health research group at Public Citizen, said Avandia "isn't even that effective. The blood sugar-lowering effect (of Avandia) is actually less than for many of the other diabetes drugs." Older drugs include sulfonylurea drugs and meglitinide drugs, both of which stimulate the release of insulin; biguanides such as metformin, shut off the liver's excess glucose production. In February, Glaxo issued a warning that Avandia raises the risk of bone fracture in patients. And several studies have linked Avandia and another drug in the same class, Actos, made by Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., with heart failure. Nissen said it was unclear why glitazones might affect heart health but that the problems with them were no mystery to drugmakers. "Something like 50 Investigational New Drug (IND) applications been filed (with the FDA) for other PPAR drugs over the past six years and none of the others have made it to market," Nissen said. "They have all had some type of toxicity." But each drug must be looked at separately, Nissen stressed, and this should be done using prospective clinical trials.
