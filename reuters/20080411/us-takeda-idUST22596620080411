 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Shares in top Japanese drug maker Takeda Pharmaceutical Co ( 4502.T ) fell 2 percent on Friday, a day after it said it would spend $8.8 billion to buy U.S. biotech firm Millennium Pharmaceuticals MLNM.O, and analysts gave mixed reactions to the acquisition. 

 Takeda has been under pressure for years to spend big and buy an overseas firm with a solid drug pipeline to offset an earnings decline before a key patent expires. But for some drug industry watchers, the Millennium purchase price was too high at $25 a share, a 53 percent premium to the biotech firm's closing share price on Wednesday. They note that the addition of Millennium's top drug, blood cancer treatment Velcade, to Takeda's portfolio would not be enough to stave off a big drop in revenue when the Japanese firm loses U.S. patent protection on its main earnings driver, the diabetes drug Actos. Merrill Lynch cut its rating to "sell" from "buy". "Millennium's contribution to earnings in the short to medium term will not be not be very large, making it difficult to overlook the premium the company is paying," said Merrill analyst Masatake Miyoshi in a copy of a report obtained by Reuters. Millennium believes Velcade, which garnered global sales of $800 million last year, will achieve blockbuster status of well over $1 billion in its current uses. But it is jointly marketed in the United States with Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), which also markets the drug in other countries. Millennium expects to book $320-$345 million in Velcade sales in 2008, up from $265 million last year. By contrast, Actos earns over $3 billion in annual sales. Questions over how Takeda will book goodwill costs will hang over the stock, Credit Suisse analyst Fumiyoshi Sakai said. "Some time will be needed to verify Millennium's enterprise value, and the murky outlook for Takeda's earnings ahead raises concerns about trends for the share price," he wrote in a report. Sakai has a "market weight" rating on the stock. On the other hand, UBS analyst Hirohisa Shimamura, who has a "buy" rating on the stock, preferred to emphasize the long-term strategic benefits of the move and other recent steps Takeda has taken to boost its cancer business. These include its purchase of Amgen's ( AMGN.O ) Japanese unit, and an agreement to become Amgen's worldwide partner for its experimental cancer drug motesanib diphosphate. It also recently agreed to help develop and market Cell Genesys' CEGE.O prostate cancer therapy, which is in late-stage clinical development. "We believe that these steps are strategically significant and that the company is...doing what it should to survive as a global firm," he wrote. Takeda's shares, the second-most traded stock on Tokyo's main board on Friday, ended down 2 percent at 5,300 yen, underperforming a 0.7 percent rise in the pharmaceutical subindex .IPHAM.T.
