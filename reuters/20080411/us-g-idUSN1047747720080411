 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Finance chiefs from rich nations offered a gloomier assessment of the global economy on Friday as persistent market turmoil curbs lending and spending, and vowed swift action to tighten banking oversight and improve cross-border cooperation. 

 With fresh signs of economic distress in the United States, where consumer confidence hit its lowest level since 1982, Group of Seven leaders said risks to the economic outlook were tilted to the downside. They pointed to the weak U.S. housing market, stressed financial markets and rising inflation. The finance leaders also expressed concern about sharp fluctuations in foreign-exchange markets since the group last met in Tokyo in February. The U.S. dollar has fallen sharply against the Japanese yen and the euro in recent weeks. "We remain positive about the long-term resilience of our economies, but near-term global economic prospects have weakened," the finance leaders said in a communique following a meeting here. "The turmoil in global financial markets remains challenging and more protracted than we had anticipated." The G7 stopped short of declaring that the U.S. economy was heading for a recession and bristled at sharp reductions in growth forecasts from the International Monetary Fund. A special study commissioned by the G7 nations offered a detailed assessment of the banking and regulatory failures that contributed to the market turmoil that has raged for eight months. The report offered dozens of recommendations on how to shore up oversight and operations to prevent a recurrence. The G7 -- the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- said it strongly endorsed the report from the Financial Stability Forum, which comprises central bankers and global regulators, when it concludes a meeting that began in mid-afternoon. The FSF report calls for tougher capital requirements for banks to ensure that they can withstand periods of financial market stress, and urges closer international cooperation between central banks and regulators. BLEAKER U.S. OUTLOOK Financial market turmoil, which began with defaulting U.S. subprime mortgage loans but quickly mushroomed into an international crisis, has forced central banks to flood markets with cash, and the U.S. Federal Reserve and others have lowered interest rates to try to keep economies afloat. Banks have already written down some $200 billion in assets tied to souring mortgages and other loans, but analysts say they may be little more than half way through writedowns that could eventually total $1 trillion. G7 members, notably the United States and Canada, want to push bankers to match the vigor that global central banks have shown in battling the liquidity squeeze by urging these private-sector players to quickly put losses behind them and raise new capital. A select group of bankers has been invited to a dinner on Friday night at the U.S. Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson clearly stated his position on Thursday that he wants banks to be ready to play their role as a market stabilizer. "If you think you're going to need capital, don't be looking for the government to help you," Paulson said. "If you think you need capital, go raise it." The eight-month-old crisis has reverberated through the global economy as securities cobbled together on Wall Street from bits and pieces of mortgage loans have plummeted in value, casting a pall over global economic prospects. While the credit crisis was the primary focus of Friday's meeting, G7 leaders also acknowledged concern about volatile foreign exchange markets. Europe in particular has complained about the soaring euro, which makes the region's exports less competitive. "Since our last meeting, there have been at times sharp fluctuations in major currencies, and we are concerned about their possible implications for economic and financial stability," the communique stated. "We continue to monitor exchange markets closely, and cooperate as appropriate." The G7 said it welcomed China's decision to increase its foreign exchange rate flexibility, and encouraged Beijing to allow for even faster appreciation of the yuan.
