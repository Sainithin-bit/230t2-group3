 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wall Street largely backed a G7 report that skewered rating companies for their "severe underestimation" of risky bonds that helped spark a worldwide credit crisis, but any immediate change or market impact will be limited, investors and analysts said. 

 The Financial Stability Forum report, released on Friday, devoted large sections to rating agencies and transparency issues, citing conflicts of interest and faulty ratings methods. The FSF represents regulators and finance ministers from the Group of Seven nations, comprising the United States, Japan, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Italy. "Historically I can't remember when the G7 comes up with anything significant that moves markets," said Andrew Brenner, co-head of the structured product group at MF Global in New York. "It's politics and picture-taking and very little else." Recommendations include a separate rating scale or different symbols for structured debt versus corporate bonds, and other changes to reduce conflicts of interest. Most Wall Street analysts supported the broad goals of the report but said the paper was short on details. Brenner said consistent ratings made more sense than new rating scales. "The rating companies need to have similar ratings for all products" for consistency, Brenner said. The bursting of the U.S. housing bubble began to ripple through Wall Street last summer, roiling global markets. Since then, Moody's Corp, McGraw-Hill Cos Inc.'s Standard & Poor's and Fimalac's Fitch Ratings have cut hundreds of billions of dollars worth of subprime mortgage-related securities, including top "AAA-rated" debt that have plummeted to junk bond status. "One of the important triggers of the current turmoil was the precipitous decline in confidence in ratings of structured credit products," the report said. "Poor credit assessments ... contributed both to the build-up to and the unfolding of recent events," the report said. Rating companies "assigned high ratings to complex structured subprime debt based on inadequate historical data and in some cases flawed models." Rating companies praised the report, and said they are eager to work with the FSF on improving ratings going forward. "We support the FSF's efforts to bring greater transparency, stability and confidence to the capital markets," S&P's President Deven Sharma said in a statement. "Many of the policy and process initiatives we recently introduced are consistent with the FSF's recommendations." Sharma, in an interview with Reuters on Thursday, rejected an FSF recommendation for a different rating scale. Sharma agreed with better differentiation for ratings for structured products versus corporate bonds. S&P is looking at using "separate identifiers" and not a completely new rating system, Sharma said. "At this point we are supporting one consistent global scale," Sharma said. Sharma was appointed president of S&P last year after Kathleen Corbet stepped down in the wake of criticism of the three main rating companies over their role in the global credit crisis. "Fitch expects to work with the other rating agencies, world regulators and other market participants to respond to the FSF recommendations in a timely and comprehensive manner," Fitch said in a statement before the report was released. Moody's Investors Service Chairman Ray McDaniel didn't immediately return messages left with a spokesman after the report was released. The report also faulted an "issuer-pays" model for structured bonds specifically, in which conflicts of interest may be "more acute," the report said. As the structured bonds are designed to take advantage of different investor risk preferences, they are usually constructed to achieve a particular rating, the report said. To the extent rating firms discuss with issuers on how to structure the bonds, "the potential for conflicts of interest becomes greater," the report said. Other critics characterized the report and rating companies' actions to date as inadequate. "Did they go deep enough? No," said Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham Fisher & Co in New York and a longtime critic of current rating methods. "This is more intended as a feel-good exercise than a functional fix." "The problem is that their financial analysis is deeply flawed and changing the name does not fix the flaw," Rosner said. "They want to call a bond a triple-A structured finance asset instead of triple-A. That's not a major change and these are all voluntary." Finance ministers from the seven industrial nations met on Friday ahead of semiannual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank over the weekend. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
