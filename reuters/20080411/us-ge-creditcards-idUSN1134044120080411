 BOSTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co is on track to sell its U.S. private label credit card (PLCC) business and its Japan consumer lending business, GE's Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherni said on Friday. 

 "We're really going to lighten up on our U.S. exposure," Sherni said on a conference call with analysts. "We're on track for selling our U.S. PLCC business and we're on track for selling Japan." (Reporting by  Scott Malone  in Boston and Nick Zieminski in New York)
