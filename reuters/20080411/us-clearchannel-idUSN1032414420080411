 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The banks being sued in the dispute over the $20 billion Clear Channel Communications leveraged buyout, put forward arguments on Thursday outlining why the case against them in New York should be dropped. 

 They argue they had not yet agreed a number of financing issues with the private equity firms trying to buy Clear Channel ( CCU.N ) when they were sued, which "exemplifies the reason why New York courts will not specifically enforce a contract to lend money," according to a copy of the filing. Private equity firms Thomas H. Lee and Bain Capital filed complaints in New York and Texas against Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), Credit Suisse Group ( CSGN.VX ), Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ( RBS.L ), Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) and Wachovia Corp WB.N to force them to fund a $20 billion buyout of Clear Channel. Clear Channel joined them in the Texas suit, but was not a plaintiff named in the New York case. The banks asked a New York state court to dismiss the case against them a week ago and earlier this week called for Bexar County, Texas, to throw out the case, too. The buyout firms claim the banks balked at providing financing when the debt markets deteriorated and asked for a change in the terms of the buyout that prevented it from being completed. The banks were to have earned more than $400 million in fees. The private equity firms are seeking "specific performance" of a commitment letter that details the plans to fund the deal. Specific performance is when one party asks a judge to order another party to stick to a contract. The banks have argued New York courts hold that, except in cases involving real property, a party may not secure specific performance of a contract to lend money. They also argue the letter calls for them to lend money pursuant to documents that are to be negotiated later. They argue the two sides were in talks when the buyers sued. In a statement, a spokesman for the banks said on Thursday that they continued to believe the lawsuits were without merit and believe they should be dismissed. "We were actively negotiating the many important open items in the credit agreements when the sponsors launched this litigation, constraining further discussions, the spokesman said in an email. "The Banks stand by their obligations under the Commitment Letter and now look forward to the opportunity to be heard in court." (Reporting by  Megan Davies ; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
