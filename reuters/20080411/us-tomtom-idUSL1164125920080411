 BRUSSELS/AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - TomTom ( TOM2.AS ) offered EU competition regulators no new remedies to resolve "serious doubts" over its planned 2.9 billion euro ($4.6 billion) purchase of digital map maker Tele Atlas TA.AS by a Thursday deadline. 

 But Dutch TomTom, the world's biggest maker of car navigation devices, said it remained committed to remedies it announced in December to license Tele Atlas data to competitors and wanted the deal to succeed. Tele Atlas shares had fallen as much as 21 percent in early trade, which market players blamed on rumors that TomTom would pull out of the deal or have trouble financing it. By 10:52 a.m. EDT, Tele Atlas stock was down 11 percent at 22.75 euros, well below TomTom's offer price of 30 euros per share. Shares of Amsterdam-based TomTom fell 2 percent to 20.99 euros. The European Commission has expressed concerns that TomTom may sell rival makers of car navigation devices inferior versions of Tele Atlas maps once it owns the company. TomTom argues it must offer a high-quality product or face losing customers, which it can ill afford. The European Union's executive Commission vetted the remedies TomTom had offered publicly, asking customers and competitors for their opinion. The Commission decided the remedies came up short and issued a statement of objections, listing problems that must be fixed. The Commission is continuing to talk to customers and competitors of TomTom and Tele Atlas about the impact of the remedies. "We continue to have constructive dialogue with the European Commission," a TomTom spokesman said. Under the Commission's complex rules on timing, TomTom had until Thursday this week to offer additional remedies for the deal. Doing so would have triggered a publicly announced 15-day extension of the May 21 deadline for the Commission to decide whether to approve the deal. The Commission could, however, still choose to allow the submission of new remedies under what the rules call "exceptional circumstances". Tele Atlas is one of only two makers of digital maps with a global reach. In Helsinki, Nokia ( NOK1V.HE ) said it was confident its $8.1 billion offer for the other digital map maker, Navteq NVT.N of the United States, would be approved by the European Commission. "We are very confident it will happen. There is very constructive dialogue going on with the regulator," Niklas Savander, the head of Nokia's Internet services business, told a news conference.
