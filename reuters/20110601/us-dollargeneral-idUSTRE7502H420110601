 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dollar General Corp ( DG.N ) missed Wall Street's expectations for its first-quarter profits after taking markdowns to clear slow-selling apparel out of its stores, sending its shares down more than 7 percent. 

 Gross margins were lower than expected due to the need to cut prices on clothes, said ThinkEquity analyst Mark Mandel. "They've been working on trying to improve that space for quite some time and have not found the right formula," he said. "Clearing out the wrong product is a step in the right direction. The question is will they be able to find the right thing to put in its place." For Dollar general, which prices most of its merchandise below $10, the weak economy is a double-edged sword. As lower-income shoppers seek more affordable food and other basic goods, a soft economy drives customers into its stores and those of competitors such as Family Dollar Stores Inc ( FDO.N ) and 99 Cents Only Stores NDN.N. But to retain those customers, the company must keep prices low, which is difficult when, as now, costs are rising. The rise in gas prices has caused Dollar General's customers to buy an increasing proportion of lower-margin necessities as they cut back on discretionary purchases, Chief Executive Officer Rick Dreiling said during a conference call with analysts. "A customer will come up to you and say, 'You moved the price of olives 5 cents.' They are very price-sensitive," he said. Consumables was the fastest growing segment in the first quarter, with sales up 13 percent, the company said on Wednesday. Apparel sales rose only 3 percent. MORE BASICS The company said it earned $157 million, or 45 cents per share, in the fiscal first quarter, ended April 29, compared with $136 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding litigation settlements and the repurchase of senior notes, the company earned 48 cents per share, missing Wall Street's average estimate of 50 cents. The company stood by its outlook for the year, saying fiscal 2011 earnings, including an extra week, would be $2.20 to $2.30 per share. Analysts, who generally excluded the 53rd week, expect $2.26 per share. First-quarter sales rose 10.9 percent to $3.45 billion. Sales at stores open at least a year, or same-store sales, increased 5.4 percent. Some of the largest stock-picking hedge funds have jumped into the sector as a string of reports suggested low-priced retailers were ripe for takeover deals. Dollar General said its margins will continue to be pressured into the second quarter, probably by higher costs to transport its inventory, RBC Capital Markets analyst Scot Ciccarelli wrote in a note to clients. To shore up the performance of its apparel offerings, the company plans to expand its children's clothes and shift its adult apparel to more basic styles, such as fleeces for men and plain tops for women, the analyst wrote. Dollar General is majority-owned by private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co LP KKR.UL, which brought the company back to the public market in November 2009. The Goodlettsville, Tennessee-based company has stores in 35 U.S. states. It plans to enter Connecticut, Nevada and New Hampshire this year and break into California in 2012. Dollar General shares were down 7.6 percent at $32.41 in midday trading. (Additional reporting by  Jessica Wohl  in Chicago; Editing by Maureen Bavdek, Dave Zimmerman and John Wallace)
