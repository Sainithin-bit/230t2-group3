 SINGAPORE, Jun  (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday the stability of the euro was paramount but her government will only decide how to handle the Greek situation after a team of inspectors make their report. 

 "We only decide after the evaluation of the troika report what to do next," Merkel told reporters in Singapore, referring to a group of inspectors from the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank. "The stability of the eurozone is the most important," she added. Merkel is on a two-day official visit to the Southeast Asian city-state following a trip to India.
