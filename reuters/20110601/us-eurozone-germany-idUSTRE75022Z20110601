 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Germany cannot pay out its share of the next tranche of aid to Greece if the International Monetary Fund decides not to disburse its part, a coalition ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday. 

 "The contribution of the IMF is and remains a factual and legal precondition for Germany paying its part of the aid," Otto Fricke, a budget expert with junior coalition partner the Free Democrats (FDP) told Reuters. "On top of that, Germany's share in the bailout is fixed." Germany's contribution to the Greek rescue package is up to 22.4 billion euro of the total 110 billion euros.
