 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Factory activity growth slowed in May to its lowest level since September 2009, suggesting a loss of momentum in the economy in the second quarter, according to the Institute for Supply Management. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 53.5 in May from 60.4 the month before. The reading missed economists' expectations for 57.7. * A reading below 50 indicates contraction in the manufacturing sector, while a number above 50 means expansion. * New orders fell to 51.0 from 61.7 in April, the lowest since June 2009. The index for prices paid fell to 76.5 from 85.5, below expectations of 82.0. COMMENTS: ROBERT LUTTS, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CABOT MONEY MANAGEMENT, SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS: "It's in line with a trend that we have been seeing recently which is a little bit weaker-than-expected, coming in soft all around. However, it's not tremendously worrisome as it may be related to short term issues like the weather. It's still expanding and we are still seeing some indications that the recovery is on track." KEITH HEMBRE, CHIEF ECONOMIST AT FIRST AMERICAN FUNDS IN MINNEAPOLIS "ISM is a big miss. To see this type of drop on a monthly basis is very unusual. Expectations were for a pretty sizable decline and it surpassed that pretty meaningfully. In our model ISM is highly correlated with treasury yields and the equity markets as well. "There's clearly a debate going on within the market as to how much the slowdown that we're seeing is temporary, related to the situation in Japan and the supply chain disruptions and how much of it is more fundamental slowing. "The data flow has been universally negative for the last weeks. Sentiment has weakened, but it is appropriate to keep in mind that a (reading above 50) is still consistent with moderate growth in manufacturing and is by no means suggesting the economy has rolled over and has started to shrink. But what you're seeing is a pretty significant deceleration of the pace of growth in manufacturing." VASSILI SEREBRIAKOV, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO, NEW YORK: "ISM data is disappointing, but not very surprising given the soft trend in the regional manufacturing surveys. This number highlights that the momentum in manufacturing is slowing quite sharply, something that we're also observing elsewhere around the world, with the generally softer-than-expected manufacturing PMI data from the European region and China today. So it's not just a U.S. phenomenon. It seems to be part of a wider global trend." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "It's a continuation of the trend suggesting that at least on the economic front things are slowing. This reaffirms that. "There was some talk...saying there might be this global economic slowdown that could hit this summer and that the purchasing managers, which is expected to taper off, could accelerate (that) somewhat, and you're given a greater sense of that with today's report. "It's also worth noting the (stock) rally leading up to the highs at the beginning of May was lead by defensively oriented groups, and so there was some foreshadowing things were going to slow down." DAVID DIETZE, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, POINT VIEW FINANCIAL SERVICES, SUMMIT, NEW JERSEY: "ISM is down, now the only thing to keep in mind is that anything over 50 is still expansion, but it does seem like the momentum is waning. From the investors' point of view and economists' point of view, manufacturing was the bright spot in terms of this domestic recovery because the consumer was being weighed down by high joblessness, by sinking home prices and for the most part are not really participating in the stock market." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON, DC: "It's a bit worrisome on the back of the consumer numbers yesterday and the ADP report this morning. One has to wonder whether the U.S. recovery is starting to stumble. It draws a big bull's-eye on Friday's payrolls report. We'll need to see job creation of 175,000-180,000. Anything short of that will be viewed as negative. Bonds are rallying, so the market perceives the Fed will remain on hold." BRET BARKER, PORTFOLIO MANAGER AT TCW, LOS ANGELES: "ISM came in very weak. It is hard to find a silver lining in this report, with all pertinent forward-looking sub-indices weaker -- new orders, backlog of orders and production are confirmation we have hit a lull in manufacturing." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACRO STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It's a slowdown, not a recession. We've had some pretty good numbers earlier this year but clearly the manufacturing side of the economy is cooling off. We've got supply chain problems from Japan and we're seeing a slowdown not just here in the U.S., but in other parts of the world also. Higher energy prices could be dampening demand for goods. That could linger a little longer than the supply chain problems."
