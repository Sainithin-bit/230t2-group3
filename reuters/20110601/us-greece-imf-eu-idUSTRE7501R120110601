 ATHENS  (Reuters) - EU and IMF inspectors aim to wrap up a much-awaited review of Greece's fiscal progress on Thursday or Friday, a source with direct knowledge of the inspection visit told Reuters. 

 The source said whether Athens gets the fifth, 12 billion euro tranche of aid under a 110 billion euro EU/IMF bailout will depend on a meeting of senior EU finance officials underway in Vienna and on a meeting of euro zone finance ministers. Asked when the review would be concluded, the source said: "Tomorrow if we are lucky, but it could also be Friday." (Reporting by  Ingrid Melander ; Editing by  David Stamp )
