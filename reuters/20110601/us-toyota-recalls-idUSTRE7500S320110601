 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said on Wednesday it will recall 105,784 early model Prius cars in Japan and overseas to fix a fault with the model's steering and gearbox. 

 The recall will affect all its first generation Prius cars, which it launched in 1997. At home the notice covers 47,784 vehicles, with a further 52,000 in the United States. Toyota sold the remainder in the UK and Germany, a company spokeswoman said. Last month Toyota extended its Prius line up with the launch of the Prius Alpha including a two-row, five-seater version and a three-row, seven-seater version. Toyota wants to sell at least 1 million hybrid vehicles globally a year by mid-decade. Toyota also recalled 33,636 iQ small cars, 21,636 of which it sold in Japan between 2008 and 2009. Toyota declined to say how much the recall will cost. (Reporting by Tim Kelly; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
