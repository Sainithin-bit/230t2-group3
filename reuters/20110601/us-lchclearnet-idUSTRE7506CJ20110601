 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext's NYX.N bid for European clearinghouse LCH.Clearnet would give Markit a majority stake and control of the lucrative over-the-counter swaps business, a source familiar with the plan said on Wednesday. 

 NYSE Euronext would have the option to increase its stake in LCH.Clearnet to up to 40 percent from 9 percent now, and it would get control of European share trading, said the source, who was not able to speak on the record. Markit, a privately held data provider owned by banks and others, partnered with the New York Stock Exchange parent to bid for London-based LCH.Clearnet in the last few weeks. The plan is preliminary, the source said. But the early details suggest Markit stakeholders are maneuvering to take advantage of financial crisis-inspired derivatives market reforms, while NYSE Euronext is moving to ease regulatory and political concerns over its $10 billion merger plan with Germany's Deutsche Boerse AG ( DB1Gn.DE ). The combined Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext would clear shares through Clearnet SA in Paris, and derivatives through Deutsche Boerse's Eurex unit in Frankfurt, the source said. Markit would focus on OTC clearing through LCH in London -- spreading business around the three financial centers. Markit and NYSE Euronext declined to comment. Earlier on Wednesday, NYSE Euronext Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer confirmed last week's press reports of the bid, telling analysts at a Deutsche Boerse investor day that Markit is leading the effort. "If our proposal, which is led by Markit ... if that worked to be successful, we would simply be a larger minority owner," Niederauer said. The Markit-NYSE Euronext bid for London-based LCH.Clearnet was worth nearly 500 million euros ($716 million), a separate source said last week. LCH.Clearnet confirmed it has received offers from exchanges about a tie-up, but said talks are at an early stage. A spokeswoman had no further comment. Last week, the second source said Nasdaq OMX Group ( NDAQ.O ) made an offer for LCH.Clearnet. London Stock Exchange Group Plc ( LSE.L ) -- which itself wants to seal a takeover of Canada's TMX Group Inc ( X.TO ) -- said it is not among those in talks. Clearinghouses stand between parties to a trade, guaranteeing their obligations in the case of a default. There are potentially big profits to be made in the $600 trillion OTC derivatives market: Europe and the United States want to run as much of the private securities as possible through such clearinghouses to stabilize the market, following the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Clearing in share trading is far less profitable. But by clearing in both Frankfurt and Paris, Deutsche Boerse-NYSE Euronext, which would be the world's largest exchange operator, could alleviate concerns at the European Commission about "vertical silos" that give exchanges control of trading, clearing and settlement of trades. NYSE Euronext and Deutsche Boerse shareholders are set to vote on the merger plan next month.
