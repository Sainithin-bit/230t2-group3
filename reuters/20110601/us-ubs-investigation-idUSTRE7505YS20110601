 PARIS  (Reuters) - The Paris prosecutor opened a preliminary investigation into the commercial practices of Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) at the end of February, the prosecutor's office said on Wednesday. The investigation was launched after bank regulator the ACP received an anonymous letter describing the methods UBS used to help customers avoid taxes. 

 UBS said it would not comment on running investigations. It also said it had strict standards for complying with laws in all jurisdictions and that UBS France had not launched or participated in any kind of system for helping clients dodge taxes. The SNDJ, a body that investigates customs issues, has been charged with the inquiry, the prosecutor's office said. The U.S. government agreed in August 2009 to drop tax-evasion charges against UBS after Switzerland promised it would transfer the details of around 4,450 clients that UBS had helped to dodge taxes. The transfer lifted the veil on Switzerland's cherished tradition of banking secrecy.
