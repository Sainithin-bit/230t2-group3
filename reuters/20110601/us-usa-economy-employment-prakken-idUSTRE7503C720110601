 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Friday's U.S. jobs report for last month could disappoint on the heels of a report that showed private payroll growth slowed sharply in May, Macroeconomic Advisers LLC Chairman Joel Prakken said on Wednesday 

 "I'm really expecting Friday's number to disappoint to the downside," said Prakken on a conference call with journalists. Earlier on Wednesday, the ADP Employer Services report showed private employers added a scant 38,000 jobs last month, coming in far below expectations and falling to the lowest level in eight months. The report is jointly developed with Prakken's Macroeconomic Advisers LLC. Friday's more comprehensive nonfarm payrolls report is forecast to show a rise in overall nonfarm payrolls of 180,000 in May, slowing down from a gain of 244,000 the month before. Private payrolls are expected to come in at 205,000.
