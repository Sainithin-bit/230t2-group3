 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The government expects to recover more money than anticipated from the auto industry bailout but taxpayers are still looking at billions in losses. 

 A White House report released on Wednesday said the Treasury has so far recouped about half of the $80 billion in grants and loans extended to General Motors Co ( GM.N ), Chrysler Group, related retail financing arms, and suppliers in 2009. While the Obama administration long ago conceded Treasury would probably write off part of the bailout, loss estimates have fallen from more than 60 percent initially to less than 20 percent today, according to the National Economic Council report.
