 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Senior UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) banker Jim Glerum and several other investment bankers have left the firm, a UBS spokesperson said on Wednesday. 

 It was not clear exactly how many bankers have left UBS in the latest departure, or which firm they will join. Glerum, co-head of the Chicago office and Midwest Region for UBS, was also in charge of the diversified industrial sector within the bank's global industrials group.
