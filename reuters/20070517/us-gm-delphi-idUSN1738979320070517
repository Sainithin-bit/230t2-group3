 DETROIT  (Reuters) - A deal between Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) and the United Auto Workers union to help the auto parts supplier exit bankruptcy is "not imminent," GM's chief executive said on Thursday. 

 "I don't think a resolution is imminent in the very short term," Rick Wagoner told reporters. Delphi has been in discussions with the UAW and its former parent GM on wages and benefits and wants to file a reorganization plan by the end of July. Wagoner's comments came a day after the Detroit News reported that the UAW countered Delphi's contract offer. The newspaper said the union submitted a proposal on Monday that included some possible concessions, and that potential investors, other stakeholders and Delphi met on Tuesday to discuss it. Delphi declined comment. A $3.4 billion equity investment deal with a group led by Cerberus Capital Management and Appaloosa Management LP to support Delphi's exit from bankruptcy remains contingent on the supplier reaching agreements with GM and its unions. "Conversations continue," Wagoner said. "My sense is that they are moving along."
