 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors may be close to charging a number of current and former employees of several Wall Street firms in an alleged kickback scheme involving stock loans, BusinessWeek reported on its Web site on Thursday. 

 The scheme may have cost financial firms and short sellers millions of dollars in higher and unnecessary fees, the magazine said. Three people have taken pleas in exchange for cooperating with federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, New York, who have been conducting the nearly 18-month-long probe, the magazine said, citing unnamed sources. Current and former employees at the stock loan desks of Bear Stearns BSC.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) are being investigated, the magazine said. Current and former employees of Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ), Janney Montgomery Scott, Merrill Lynch MER.N and Nomura Securities are also being investigated, the magazine said. The companies and the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York could not be reached immediately.
