 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - J.C. Penney Co. ( JCP.N ) reported a higher quarterly profit on Thursday, helped by sales of higher margin private-label brands, and the department store operator raised its full-year earnings forecast. 

 Shares rose 5 percent to $79.50 in early New York Stock Exchange trading. J.C. Penney's earnings increased to $238 million, or $1.04 a share, for its fiscal first quarter, ended May 5, from $210 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.03 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Penney, which is working to boost sales by offering more fashionable merchandise such as its Ambrielle brand of intimate apparel, kicked off a new branding campaign called "Every Day Matters" earlier this year in hopes of luring new customers and getting current shoppers to spend more money. Over the next few years, Penney expects results to benefit from 250 new stores, including its first store in New York's Midtown Manhattan, and the roll-out of exclusive brands such as American Living, a line of clothing and home goods by Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.( RL.N ) "It looks like the company is doing very well on managing expenses and driving sales through new products," said Arun Daniel, senior consumer analyst at ING Investments. The results come a day after Federated Department Stores Inc. FD.N reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit, citing disappointing sales at new Macy's stores. Daniel said Penney is continuing to take market share from competitors, including Federated and Sears. U.S. retailer's results are being watched closely after the group reported the weakest April sales on record, blaming bad weather and an earlier Easter holiday. But with the government saying on Monday that the average price for gasoline hit a record of $3.10 a gallon, investors are watching to see if May results can rebound. Penney said its first-quarter sales rose 3.1 percent to $4.35 billion. That was below analyst expectations of $4.47 billion. Comparable store sales, a measure of sales at stores open at least a year, rose 2.2 percent. The company said gross margin improved by 70 basis points to 41.5 percent of sales, helped by strong sales of its private apparel brands. For the second-quarter, J.C. Penney said it expects earnings per share of approximately 77 cents, including 3 cents per share for costs for the early redemption of debt. Analysts, on average, are expecting second-quarter earnings of 79 cents per share. For the full-year, the retailer said it expects earnings from continuing operations "in the area" of $5.49 per share, up 5 cents per share from its previous forecast. Analysts, on average, are expecting full-year earnings of $5.52 per share.
