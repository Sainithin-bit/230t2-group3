 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - IBM ( IBM.N ) said on Thursday that earnings per share may jump 80 percent in the next three years, fueled by stock buybacks, increased profitability, spending on new initiatives and acquisitions. 

 International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest technology-services company, said earnings per share could surge to $11 per share in 2010 from earnings of $9.49 billion, or $6.11 per share, in 2006. The company expects share buybacks to add about $1.10 and wider profit margins to contribute about $1 to per-share earnings in the next three years, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge told investors and analysts at a briefing at the company's T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. IBM of Armonk, New York, also said savings on retirement spending would add about 90 cents per share to earnings-per-share growth through 2010. Revenue growth could add 75 cents per share, Loughridge said, and another $1.20 per share could come from growth initiatives and acquisitions. IBM told analysts and investors it expects to improve profitability in the next three years by boosting software's proportion of total pretax profit to nearly half by 2010, up from about 40 percent last year. IBM, led by Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano, has been shifting to more-profitable businesses such as software from lower-margin segments such as computer hardware. The company sold its personal computer business to Lenovo Group Ltd. ( 0992.HK ) in 2005 and its hard disk-drive unit to Hitachi Ltd. ( 6501.T ) in 2002. IBM expects "emerging country" revenue to double by 2010, Palmisano said at the investor briefing. Palmisano also said efforts to improve profitability in IBM's services business, which accounts for about half of revenue, should boost profit margins in that business by 2 percentage points by 2010. IBM expects so-called virtualization, a fast-growing newer technology that lets large computers run several operating systems simultaneously, to produce an additional $1 billion in gross profit in the next three years. IBM shares closed down 56 cents at $105.31 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The stock is up 29 percent this year as the company has boosted profit, mainly driven by its higher-margin software businesses.
