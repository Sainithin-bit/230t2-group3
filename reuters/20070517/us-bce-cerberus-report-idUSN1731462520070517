 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Analysts and traders welcomed the prospect on Thursday of U.S. private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP joining the bidding battle expected for BCE Inc. ( BCE.TO ), Canada's largest telecommunications group. 

 "The more the merrier," said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities Ltd. "If it turns out there are three bidders or more that should augur well for the price." The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing sources it said were familiar with the situation, wrote on Thursday that Cerberus had enlisted the help of investment bankers UBS AG and Genuity Capital Markets to advise them on making a play for BCE, owner of Bell Canada. "Cerberus is all over it," the paper quoted one source as saying. "They believe they are there." Cerberus, named after the dog from Greek mythology that guarded the gates of Hell, declined to comment on the report. BCE officials could not be immediately reached for reaction. A takeover of BCE could easily top C$31 billion ($28.4 billion), making it one of the biggest take-private buyouts in North America. Another group, led by Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, U.S. takeover specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., and other Canadian pension funds is already exploring the possibility of taking BCE private. BCE was to have set up a data room this month via a secure Web site so that prospective bidders can scrutinize the books. "It just goes to show people clearly see a lot of value in the asset and there is certainly no shortage of capital ready to be deployed on the side of private equity," said Neil Andrew, associate portfolio manager at Leeward Hedge Funds. On April 17, BCE acknowledged it was in nonexclusive talks with the KKR and Canada Pension Plan group. It also said it was conducting a strategic review. Like KKR, to have any chance at capturing a share of BCE, U.S.-based Cerberus would have to find Canadian backers to contribute enough capital to satisfy the 46.7 foreign ownership limit on Canadian telecom firms. "Whoever has the more cordial relationship with the board and/or management will have a leg up," said Ian Nakamoto, director of research at MacDougall, MacDougall & MacTier. BCE shares rose 79 Canadian cents or 2 percent to C$37.88 on the Toronto Stock Exchange and 87 cents to $34.46 on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The shares were about 6 percent below their 52-week high of C$40.31 reached in Toronto on April 20, when Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan said it was talking to a number of pension funds and equity investors, including Providence Equity Partners, about mounting a possible bid for BCE.
