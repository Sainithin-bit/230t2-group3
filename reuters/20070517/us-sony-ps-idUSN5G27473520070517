 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - This is the year that video game makers will deliver the must-have titles needed to drive sales of Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T ) new PlayStation 3, the executive in charge of the Japanese electronic conglomerate's U.S. console business said on Thursday. 

 Sony devotees have been reluctant to spend the $600-plus needed to buy the high-end PS3 -- due to its high price and the lack of games offered exclusively for the new system -- and sales have lagged Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii and Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360. "The content message will be addressed very nicely this year," said Jack Tretton, president and chief executive officer of Sony Computer Entertainment America. For this fiscal year ending March 31, users can expect more than 15 exclusive titles, said Tretton, who added that it also took time for developers to turn out blockbuster games for the PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 -- which dominated their respective console cycles. The PS3 exclusives include "Warhawk," dragon-combat title "Lair," and Sony's newly released baseball game "MLB: The Show." Sony suffered part shortages and delays ahead of the PS3 launch and production costs associated with the new console drove the company into the red. The machine's high cost is largely a result of Sony's decision to put its expensive new Blu-ray DVD technology in the PS3, a move it hopes will drive adoption of the company's high-definition player. The PS3's price, which compares with the $400 high-end Xbox 360 and the $250 Wii, has proved to be an obstacle, Tretton said. "There's no question that that's a challenge. Hopefully content helps to deliver the proof points and the justification behind the cost of the machine," said Tretton, who could not say when the PS3's price would come down.
