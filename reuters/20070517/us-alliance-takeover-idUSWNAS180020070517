 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Blackstone Group BG.UL said on Thursday it would purchase Alliance Data Systems Corp. ( ADS.N ) for $6.76 billion, making it the second business services company buyout this week by a private equity firm. 

 Blackstone will pay $81.75 per share in cash, a premium of about 30 percent over Alliance Data's closing share price of $62.96 on Wednesday. Alliance Data shares have quadrupled in price in the last four years. Its stock fell from $67 per share at the start of this year to $57 per share by mid-March, when it began to rise again. Including debt, the deal is worth $7.8 billion. "The reason why the company has decided to go private is probably because, frankly, they got a great offer," said CIBC analyst John Wharton, whose rates the stock a "buy." Dallas-based Alliance Data is a business services company providing transaction, credit and marketing services, an industry that has attracted heavy interest from private equity buyers lately. Payment processor First Data Corp. FDC.N agreed to be bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL last month for $26 billion. The deal prompted several analysts to speculate that other companies in the space would soon fall to private equity firms. (To read more, click on <ID:nN03283237>). The shares of other companies in the industry rose on Thursday, pushed higher by the ADS deal, Wharton said. Global Payments Inc. ( GPN.N ) shares rose $1.60, or 4.2 percent, to $39.65, while the stock of Total System Services Inc. ( TSS.N ) was up $1.29, or 4.2 percent, at $32.40. GTCR Golder Rauner LLC said on Monday it will sell TransFirst, a payment-services company, to fellow buyout firm Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe for $683 million. Buyout firms are attracted to the sector because the businesses produce large amounts of cash flow. Private equity firms usually borrow two-thirds of the money to make their purchases and they need the cash to keep up interest payments. Blackstone is paying around 11 times ADS's 2008 estimated cash flow, Wharton said, a multiple in-line with peers, but slightly below what KKR paid for First Data. First Data has stronger cash flows and ADS is exposed to credit risk because of its credit card portfolio, Wharton added. Buyout firms typically purchase controlling stakes in companies, cut costs, restructure the businesses and sell them two to four years later. Frothy debt markets and huge sums of capital from investors have allowed private equity firms to purchase a record amount of companies in the last two years. A string of leveraged buyouts (LBOs) year to date has pushed private equity into the spotlight, with U.S. LBOs now making up 30 percent of mergers and acquisitions, up from 15 percent in the same period last year, according to Dealogic. A special committee made up of independent directors on the Alliance Data board of directors approved the agreement. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year. The company expected that substantially all of Alliance Data's outstanding series A and series B senior notes would either be tendered for or repaid in connection with the deal. Alliance Data's shares closed 24.62 percent higher at $78.46 on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal allows Alliance Data shareholders to "maximize the value of their investment," Alliance Data Chairman and CEO Mike Parks said in a statement. Blackstone is offering about 13 times estimated 2007 earnings per share of $6.16, based on Reuters Estimates. Alliance Data provides marketing, loyalty and transaction services, managing over 120 million consumer relationships, according to the company. Dallas-based Alliance Data employs over 9,000 people at more than 60 locations worldwide. Alliance Data's brands include AIR MILES and Epsilon.
