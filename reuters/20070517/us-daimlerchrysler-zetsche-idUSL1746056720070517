 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - The rump of DaimlerChrysler DCXGn.DE will do its best to stay independent once the sale of U.S. arm Chrysler goes through, Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche was quoted by the Wall Street Journal as saying. 

 The paper reported on Thursday that Zetsche had said in an interview that the company, to be known in future as Daimler AG if shareholders approve, probably will not be involved in big deals for other carmakers. DaimlerChrysler announced on Monday it would sell an 80.1 percent stake in Chrysler Group to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL, unwinding the 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler that never worked out as planned. Zetsche said the company might seek deals to expand its truck business, especially in the U.S. or India, the paper reported.
