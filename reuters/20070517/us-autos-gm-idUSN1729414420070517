 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on Thursday that GM's former financial arm, GMAC, and Chrysler Financial could find areas to work together as both begin to operate under the same owner. 

 It was the first time Wagoner has spoken publicly since Monday's announcement of a $7.4 billion deal by Germany's Daimler DCXGn.DE to sell Chrysler to private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management CBS.UL. Cerberus also bought a 51 percent stake in GMAC in a deal that closed late last year. When asked if a merger between GMAC and Chrysler Financial were possible, Wagoner said there was scope for future cooperation between the two auto finance companies. But he added that no such conversations had taken place yet and that GM would have a say in how such collaboration would play out through its remaining stake in GMAC. "I think it's possible you could see opportunities for Cerberus-owned Chrysler Financial and Cerberus-owned GMAC to seek out opportunities to work together," he said. When asked by reporters, Wagoner added that there were "potential synergies" between GMAC and Chrysler Financial and "a lot of different ways to think about it." He said: "As of yet, nothing has been specifically presented to us, and we haven't developed any ideas, but I'm sure that will be happening over time." Cerberus, which is buying an 80 percent stake in Chrysler Group from DaimlerChrysler AG, will also take control of the automaker's finance arm Chrysler Financial when that deal closes in the third quarter. On a combined basis, Cerberus would have the largest share of the auto loan market, ahead of Ford Motor Credit ( F.N ). Asked specifically about a direct merger between GMAC and Chrysler Financial, Wagoner said: "It's too early to speculate on what's the right way to cooperate ... There are a lot of issues." GM earlier this month posted a 90 percent drop in first- quarter earnings, hurt by mortgage-related losses at GMAC's housing finance unit, ResCap. Charges at that unit forced GMAC to lose $305 million in the quarter, and analysts expressed concern that ResCap would remain a drag on GM's earnings through the rest of the year. "To be honest, GMAC ... has been pretty busy getting the residential mortgage business back on track and trying to keep the rest of the business going," Wagoner said. "But there are opportunities there, we just haven't gotten into the details yet."
