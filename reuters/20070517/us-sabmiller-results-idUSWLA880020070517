 LONDON  (Reuters) - SABMiller ( SAB.L ), the world's second-largest brewer, reported a 10 percent rise in annual earnings on Thursday, at the top end of forecasts, but warned over rising commodity prices, especially aluminium beer cans. 

 The maker of Miller Lite, Peroni and Castle ( SABJ.J ) beers said it was hit by high aluminium prices in the big United States beer can market. Its rivals gained from caps on aluminium price contracts, which U.S. unit Miller had not used. This cost Miller around $100 million due to higher aluminium prices compared to its rivals, a cost it mitigated by a round of cost-cutting. However, these contract price caps started to expire in December 2006, and Chief Executive Graham Mackay says this disadvantage will lessen with time. "We don't see the situation in relation to aluminium prices getting any worse, in fact we expect to start to see the situation ameliorate," Mackay said in a conference call. Miller, which makes 10 percent of group profits, has struggled for growth since it was purchased in 2002 due largely to stiff competition from Budweiser-brewer Anheuser-Busch ( BUD.N ), which controls around half the U.S. beer market. SABMiller now expects prices of commodities such as energy, grains, and glass as well as aluminium will add $150-200 million to costs in the current year, which it hopes again to mitigate by cost-cutting measures and prices rises to consumers. "We see commodity cost pressures continuing, but not at the level we have seen," said Finance Director Malcolm Wyman. The London-based group, which ranks behind Belgium-based InBev INTB.BR in world brewing, posted adjusted earnings per share of 120.0 U.S. cents for the year to March 31 towards the top of analysts' forecast range of 110.0 to 124.8 cents. The group also said the loss of its Amstel brewing license in South Africa in March which will cost it around $80 million in profits in the current year. SABMiller's shares dipped 0.8 percent to 11.77 pounds by 1030 GMT. They have risen from a low of 10.39 pounds in mid-March when it lost the Amstel license, but have underperformed the DJ Stoxx European food and beverage index .SX3P by 14 percent over the last year. House broker Cazenove described the results as a good set of figures, led by Latin America and Europe with only Miller disappointing, and raised its year to March 2008 earnings forecast by 4 percent to 132 cents from 127 cents previously. The brewer said growth was strong in most of the world, but it suffered a 17 percent profit fall at Miller due to the higher commodity costs, a decline in Miller Lite volumes and price cutting in the economy beer segment led by Anheuser-Busch. It added it planned to cut costs by $100 million by 2010 at Miller and reinvigorate the business as drinkers have moved to wines and spirits, and also to imported and craft beers. SABMiller makes over a third of its earnings in rand from beer and soft drinks, and the South African currency has fallen against the dollar by 13 percent over the last year, cutting its South African profit growth to 4 percent in dollar terms. Its year dividend rose 14 percent to 50 cents a share. SABMiller shares trade at 16.4 times March 2008 forecast earnings, reflecting the risks from its emerging market exposure compared to rivals InBev on 20.1 and Heineken's ( HEIN.AS ) 20.5, according to Reuters Estimates, while Scottish and Newcastle SCTN.L on 16.9 times is buoyed by takeover talk.
