 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boston Scientific Corp. ( BSX.N ) is in 
talks to settle 1,350 product liability suits it inherited when 
it bought Guidant Corp last year, the Wall Street Journal said 
on its Web site on Thursday, citing unnamed sources. 

  The suits allege that Guidant sold several models of 
implantable defibrillators after learning of defects in the 
devices that caused them to fail, the paper reported.  Boston Scientific raised the money it set aside for 
potential damages in the case to $732 million from $485 million 
at the end of 2006, the paper said, citing a regulatory filing.  A Boston Scientific representative could not immediately be 
reached for comment.
