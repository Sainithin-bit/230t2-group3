 (Reuters) - Marvell Technology Group Ltd. ( MRVL.O ) reported preliminary net revenue for the first quarter below Wall Street expectations. 

 The company, which makes microchips for hard-disk drives, reported net revenue of $635.1 million for the first quarter of 2008. Analysts were expecting $645.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Marvell said it will delay filing its first quarter 2008 results due to an ongoing review of its historical stock option practices and related accounting matters.
