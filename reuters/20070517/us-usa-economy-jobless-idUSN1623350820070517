 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly fell last week, dragging the less-volatile moving average of claims to its lowest level in more than a year in a sign of labor market strength, government data showed on Thursday 

 Initial filings for state unemployment insurance aid fell for the fifth straight week to the lowest level since mid-January, dropping 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 293,000 in the week ended May 12 from a revised 298,000 for the previous week, the Labor Department said. U.S. government bond prices slipped after the weekly claims report hinted at a tighter labor market and suggested the economy might not be slowing as quickly as had been thought. The dollar rose. "What this data does is boost the forecast for the next payrolls figure," said Tim Mazanec, senior currency strategist for Investors Bank & Trust in Boston. "The last few have shown fewer than 100,000 new jobs and this should get us back above that," Mazanec said. The U.S. economy added a modest 88,000 jobs in April, the slimmest gain in more than two years, the Labor Department reported in its monthly data released on May 4. However, some economists said more data is needed to confirm a pickup in the jobs market "Overall, I think the big picture is that we're seeing weakness in employment," said Camilla Sutton, currency strategist for Scotia Capital in Toronto. "This doesn't change that, and we have to see more data points before we see any change in the market's thinking." A department analyst said there were no special factors behind the drop in new claims. Analysts on Wall Street had expected claims, which provide a rough guide to the pace of layoffs, to rise to 310,000 from the 297,000 initially reported for the May 5 week. A four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes weekly volatility to provide a better sense of underlying job-market trends, fell for the third consecutive week, dropping to 305,500 from 317,500 in the prior week and to its lowest since April, 2006. The total number of unemployed still on the benefit rolls after drawing an initial week of aid fell to 2.47 million in the week ended May 5, the latest period for which figures are available. Economists had forecast so-called continued claims at 2.53 million.
