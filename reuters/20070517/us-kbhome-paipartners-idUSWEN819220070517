 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ) said on Thursday it had entered into an exclusivity period based on an offer by PAI Partners to buy its stake in its French unit Kaufman & Broad KBH.PA for 55 euros per share, or more than $800 million. 

 KB Home, the No. 5 U.S. home builder, said PAI's all-cash offer to buy its entire 49 percent stake in the French unit is binding and the transaction could close in the third quarter of 2007.
