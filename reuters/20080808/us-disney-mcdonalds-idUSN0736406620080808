 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - The Disneyland Resort in California will close three "quick service" restaurants that serve McDonald's Corp ( MCD.N ) fast food as part of a "planned refurbishment," a Disneyland spokeswoman said on Thursday. 

 The three walk-up kiosks will close on September 2 and will reopen at an undisclosed date "with other theming and branding," Disneyland spokeswoman Lisa Haines said. "We are considering a number of different concept options," Haines said. The Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ), which ended a long-time movie promotions partnership with McDonald's after the 2006 release of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," will continue to operate three McDonald's-branded eateries at its Walt Disney World resort in Florida, Haines said. In recent years, Disney has launched a healthy snack foods line for children and has broadened the meal menus at its parks to include healthy choices such as sliced fruits instead of french fries or potato chips, and waters in place of sodas. While McDonald's and other fast food chains have taken steps to make their food healthier, the Center for Science and the Public Interest reported this week that 90 percent of their kids' meals have too many calories and too much fat and salt.
