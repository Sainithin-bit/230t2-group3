 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. home funding company, said on Friday it may opt to grow its mortgage portfolio. 

 "Our actions are going to be opportunistic and I think that modest growth is possible, but I think we are going to make those decisions on a day-to-day basis," Peter Niculescu, executive vice president at Fannie Mae, said on an investor conference call. Niculescu, who runs the company's investment portfolio, said market conditions are challenging and any growth will have to be "prudent" and "access to the agency debt market is key." "But we are not making any projections here," he said. Fannie Mae earlier on Friday posted its fourth straight quarterly loss as home loan defaults increased and said it would slash its dividend more than 85 percent and take other steps to shore up its capital position.
