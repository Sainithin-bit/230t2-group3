 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The dollar extended gains and traded below 1.50 per euro on Friday for the first time since February, supported by a sell-off in oil prices and a rally in U.S. stocks. 

 In afternoon trading in New York, the euro was 2.1 percent lower at $1.4999, according to Reuters data. The dollar's rally has been supported by a sell-off in crude oil prices, which tumbled from a peak of over $147 a barrel last month to below $115 on Friday in New York.
