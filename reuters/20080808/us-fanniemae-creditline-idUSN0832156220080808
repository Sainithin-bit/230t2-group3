 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae said it does not have plans to tap the Treasury credit line that opened up for it in the housing bill signed into law last week by President Bush. 

 "None of the plans that we've advanced contemplate access to any Treasury line, we've not asked them and they have not offered," Daniel Mudd, chief executive officer of the largest U.S. home funding company, said on a conference call on Friday. Earlier, the company reported a greater-than-expected loss in the second quarter, its fourth straight quarterly loss. (Reporting by  Lynn Adler , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
