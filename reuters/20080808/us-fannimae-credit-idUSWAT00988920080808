 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae will continue to see high credit losses in 2009 but such losses should be lower than this year, the company chief financial officer said on Friday. 

 "We expect credit related expenses to remain elevated in 2009 but to come in lower than 2008," chief financial officer Stephen Swad told an investor conference call. (Reporting by Patrick Rucker, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
