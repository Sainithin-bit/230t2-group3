 Corrects percentage change to 18 percent in first paragraph 

 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) posted an 18 percent drop in first-quarter profit on Wednesday and lowered its full-year outlook, citing a charge tied to recent U.S. healthcare reform. The world's biggest defense contractor said net earnings fell to $547 million, or $1.45 a share, from $666 million, or $1.68 a share, a year earlier. The results include a charge of about 25 cents a share resulting from the new health reform law's elimination of tax deductions that have been available to companies for retiree prescription drug expenses. Revenue rose about 3 percent to $10.64 billion, compared with $10.62 billion expected by analysts, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)
