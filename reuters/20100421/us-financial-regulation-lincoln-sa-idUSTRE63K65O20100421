 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A bill passed on Wednesday by the Senate Agriculture Committee to regulate the $450 trillion derivatives market could be used as a bargaining chip to gain consensus on financial reforms, because it goes further than any other proposed crackdown. 

 The move by Chairman Blanche Lincoln to effectively bar banks from the lucrative but risky derivatives market plays to popular sentiment to blame Wall Street for the economic downturn. But it also provides an extreme against which Senate leaders could seek a bipartisan compromise. The bombshell measure could go the same route as the initial "Volcker Rule" banning banks from proprietary trading, and Lincoln's compromise on regulating foreign exchange swaps. Lincoln said she has been "given assurances" from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid that her bill will be "merged" with the Senate Banking Committee bill before the package goes to the Senate floor -- and she hoped the bank swaps ban would remain intact. "I think it is the most powerful of the reforms," Lincoln told reporters. "There's no reasons why taxpayers ... should be bearing the risk of insuring that risky business." While the provision plays well politically, critics point out the restrictions could hurt companies that use derivatives to hedge their risks, and could have the unintended effect of sending U.S. jobs offshore. * The bill would force banks to spin off swaps desks if they want to keep access to federal deposit insurance or to the Federal Reserve discount window. * The Senate Banking Committee compromised on the Volcker proposal by requiring a study first by the new Financial Stability Oversight Council. That would leave the door open to regulators watering down the rule later. * Similarly, the Agriculture Committee compromised on its initial proposal to regulate foreign exchange swaps -- the bill now gives the Treasury secretary the power to recommend to the committee whether swaps should be subject to the same rules. * New York Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand filed amendments to the bill that would have dropped the requirement for banks to spin off swaps desks -- including an option that would have thrown the decision to regulators for study. * Gillibrand did not raise the amendment during the "mark-up" hearing on Wednesday, or bring it forward for debate, leaving the measure as an option for further debate as the full Senate turns its attention to derivatives. * Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd, who is leading the reform negotiations, said on Wednesday he liked Gillibrand's ideas. * Officials from Treasury, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the administration have not explicitly addressed the measure, leading to speculation they do not support it. * Gary Gensler, CFTC chairman, said on Wednesday that there "appears that there will be more discussion" on the issue, while top Treasury official Michael Barr said the measure may need work to ensure trade is not pushed to offshore markets. * To be sure, politics ahead of the November midterm elections favor a crack-down. In a note to clients, Credit Suisse cautioned "a stringent outcome is likely given the current political climate and the trend toward tougher, less flexible regulation." * The plan raises complex economic issues not readily understood by voters, who more readily grasp it as an attack on the excesses of big banks. * "The questions this raises are how this would affect banks who are swap dealers getting overnight credit, whether this would affect primary dealers who are also broker dealers doing repos with the Fed, and if this would affect banks that are swap dealers participating in other federal guarantee programs, such as small business guarantees," said Ernest Patrikis, a partner at law firm White & Case in New York, and former first vice president at the New York Fed. * The White House is actively wooing moderate Republicans to support reform. At least one Republican vote is needed to prevent procedural roadblocks to the larger reform bill. * Republican Charles Grassley voted for Lincoln's bill but he said that didn't guarantee he would support the larger financial reform bill on the Senate floor. * Lincoln told reporters the White House did not urge her to include the ban in her bill. "That is so absurd. I have not even heard from the White House. I never even heard from the Secretary of the Treasury, quite frankly," she said. * The full Senate is expected to begin debate on the reform bill next week.
