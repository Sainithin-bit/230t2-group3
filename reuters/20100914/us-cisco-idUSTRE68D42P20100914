 SAN JOSE, California  (Reuters) - Cisco Systems Inc ( CSCO.O ) plans to pay a dividend for the first time, responding to demands it share some of its cash hoard while broadening its appeal to more conservative investors. 

 Chief Executive John Chambers, who has long promised to eventually dole out dividends, said the time was right to start paying one of about 1 to 2 percent in fiscal 2011, which ends in July. "We felt strongly it was the right thing to do," said Chambers, addressing a financial analysts' meeting at the company's headquarters in San Jose, California on Tuesday. He said more investors had been seeking a dividend lately. "We could feel that. We understood." Cisco had been -- along with fellow heavyweights Apple Inc ( AAPL.O ) and Google Inc ( GOOG.O ) -- one of the few remaining cash-rich tech companies to resist dividend payments. It ended the last quarter with about $40 billion in cash and investments, though over $30 billion of that is held overseas. Till now, it had said the company would prioritize share repurchases and investing in acquisitions and product development. "It's a shareholder-friendly move and it opens up to the type of investor that would own Cisco beyond just growth investors," said Alkesh Shah, an analyst with Evercore Partners. "Income investors and income funds that need a stock to have a dividend would like having a growth stock and a technology stock, in a company that's very well run." Chambers said the company would continue buying back shares while investing in growth, and reiterated the company's long-term target of 12 percent to 17 percent annual revenue growth. IS GROWTH A QUESTION? Analysts said his comments showed confidence in Cisco's ability to keep growing while paying dividends, and was a welcome move amid low interest rates. "I think with interest rates so low, 1 to 2 percent would be attractive," said Morgan Stanley analyst Ehud Gelblum. "Until now, Cisco has said, 'We'll do whatever our shareholders want us to do, and right now they're saying that we can invest for growth,' but now, it looks like they're saying that paying a dividend does not starve the company for growth." The shares briefly rose over 3 percent on the announcement, but closed 0.9 percent higher at $21.45. They have fallen over 10 percent in the year to date amid worries about a weak recovery in technology spending. "This is a great way for the company to set a floor on the stock," said Joel Achramowicz, an analyst at Blaylock Robert Van. Chambers also took the opportunity to step up pressure on Washington to help U.S. companies return overseas revenues to the country, saying the dividend amount will depend on lower taxes on fund repatriation. Chambers said he was expecting Washington to implement policies that make it easier for the company to return cash to the United States, and that without such moves it would only be able to pay yields at the lower end of the 1 to 2 percent range. Such policies would help U.S. businesses hire more workers domestically, he further argued. Cisco plans to increase its U.S. headcount by 10 percent this year, and could do so again in coming years if it can bring cash home at a lower tax rate, he said. "We want to grow in this country. We want you to create the environment where we can," he said in a plea to Washington. Cisco has, in the past, threatened to use more of its cash to invest abroad if Washington does not make it easier to repatriate funds. It has already bought Norwegian videoconferencing company Tandberg this year in a deal worth over $3 billion. MORE ACQUISITIONS, AND MORE BUMPS Acquisitions have been a crucial part of Cisco's growth since Chambers took the CEO role in 1995. Since he took the CEO role in January 1995, Cisco has grown from a company with $1.2 billion in annual revenues to about $40 billion. Chambers said the company would continue pursuing acquisitions as it expands from its traditional business of selling routers and switching to areas like consumer markets and data center equipment. Its strategy has been to buy companies in what it calls "market adjacencies," or products or services closely linked to its existing business. Chambers said Cisco was now looking at several acquisition targets, but did not comment on specifics. He also expects a "couple bumps" over the next year and that his cautious comments a month ago, which had spooked investors and sent the company's shares prices falling, were accurate. In August, Chambers warned investors about "unusual uncertainty" in the economy, and gave a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast for the company, raising fears of a "double dip" in technology spending. At 61, Chambers is one of the most influential chief executives in Silicon Valley, and one whom investors have come to regard as an oracle on the economy. He was one of the first technology CEOs in 2007 to flag the impact of troubles in the U.S. financial sector, warning of a dramatic decline in orders even as others said they were not affected. Some analysts said worries about the economy and the uncertainty over the exact size of the dividend had weighed on the shares. BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long reiterated a "market perform" rating on Cisco shares. "Without the ability to repatriate cash, Cisco would be forced to slow the pace of its share buyback, shift its acquisition focus primarily to foreign companies, and, or, take on additional debt," he said.
