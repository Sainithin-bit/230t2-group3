 TIANJIN, China  (Reuters) - China will introduce stricter rules to reduce industrial pollution, a senior economic planning official said on Tuesday. 

 Zhang Xiaoqiang, a vice-chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, also told a meeting of the World Economic Forum in this northern port city that China was willing to import more from the United States. Political tempers are fraying in Washington over the large U.S. bilateral trade deficit with China. Lawmakers will grill U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner on the issue this week, with some pressing for punitive action against Beijing unless it lets the yuan rise more swiftly.
