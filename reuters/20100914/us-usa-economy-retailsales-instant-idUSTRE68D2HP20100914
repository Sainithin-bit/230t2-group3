 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sales at U.S. retailers increased more than expected in August, notching their largest gain in five months on strong receipts at gasoline stations and clothing outlets, according to a government report that further assuaged fears of a double-dip recession. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Commerce Department said total retail sales rose 0.4 percent following a revised 0.3 percent rise in July. * It was the second straight month of gains in retail sales, which are a measure of consumer health. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales rising 0.3 percent last month. * Compared to August last year, sales were 3.6 percent higher. * Motor vehicle and parts purchases fell 0.7 percent after increasing 1.0 percent in July. * Excluding autos, sales increased by a bigger-than-expected 0.6 percent in August, also the largest increase since March, after a 0.1 percent gain the prior month. * Markets had expected sales excluding autos to increase 0.3 percent in August. * Core retail sales, which exclude autos, gasoline and building materials, rose 0.5 percent after dipping 0.1 percent in July. COMMENTS: CHRIS RUPKEY, CHIEF FINANCIAL ECONOMIST, BANK OF TOKYO/MITSUBISHI UFJ, NEW YORK: "People might have been thinking that retail sales would beat the consensus forecast by a greater degree. The report doesn't seem to be anything that tips the balance in terms of trying to forecast the outlook for the economy. It's kind of a middle-of-the-road number. "Bonds are following stocks." LAWRENCE GLAZER, MANAGING PARTNER, MAYFLOWER ADVISORS, BOSTON: "Expectations were that the economy and consumer were really running out of gas, so to see this type of data, given that expectations were beginning to come down, is significant. "The market is looking at this report ahead of other data we will have this week to get a glimpse of what the impact will be on rates. "Given the downdraft in (Treasury) yields that we saw most of the summer, any sort of reversal in (economic) news could contribute to a reversal higher in rates." SUVRAT PRAKASH, US INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BNP PARIBAS, NEW YORK: "Right now the risk is higher yields and this retail sales report is probably allowing Treasuries to give up some of their gains from overnight." GARY THAYER, CHIEF MACROSTRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO ADVISORS, ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI: "It's still a soft report though slightly better than expected. It still shows the economy is growing very slowly. The report doesn't resolve the question as to whether the Fed is going to ease further or not. That's what the credit markets are wrestling with right now until we get to the FOMC meeting next week." JAMES DAILEY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, TEAM ASSET STRATEGY FUND, HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA: "I think the number is OK. Sentiment had gotten so negative that a more mediocre number like this isn't terrible. People were thinking that things would really be awful, but this is encouraging so long as nothing further bad happens in Europe. Europe is a dominant theme today, and you also have Best Buy, which is interesting because they beat on the bottom line but missed on the top. I think that's endemic of what's going on in the economy: profits are OK but revenue remains a concern." OMER ESINER, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, COMMONWEALTH FOREIGN EXCHANGE, INC, WASHINGTON: "The number looks very good across the board. It suggests American consumers remain resilient despite the backdrop of high unemployment and declining home values. On the margin, this data reduces some concerns about a double-dip recession and more Fed easing. Its largest positive impact may be felt on dollar/yen." PIERRE ELLIS, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The report was better than expected not only because ex-auto figures are better than expected, but also because categories like clothing and general merchandise, the back-to-school group, seemed to do better than expected. "It could have been stronger in other big-ticket areas like electronics and furniture, but generally it's a fair number and lifts the most serious concerns about the consumer. Bond prices settled back ever so slightly on the report. "There is some decent progress in some aspects of discretionary spending." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock index futures turn positive after retail sales data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices pare gains, 30-year turns negative. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar pares losses versus yen.
