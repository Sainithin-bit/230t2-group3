 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Democrats have assured Republicans they would ensure the United States does not default on its debt and said Democrats would be willing to vote on an unconditional extension of the debt ceiling. 

 "I told Mr. (House of Representatives Speaker John) Boehner that our party stands ready to ensure that we do not default on our debt," said Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House of Representatives. He said he believed almost every Democratic member in the House would vote to approve a straight extension of the debt ceiling with spending cuts or other conditions.
