 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Would it help improve the chances of a breakthrough in the deadlocked debt talks to take them to Camp David, the leafy presidential retreat far removed from Washington's political hothouse? 

 The compound in the Catoctin Mountains of western Maryland offers a casual atmosphere -- where business attire is avoided and transportation on the grounds is via golf cart -- away from the stuffy confines of the White House. Camp David's serene atmosphere could reduce the bluster and finger-pointing that has characterized the talks so far between President Barack Obama and Republicans, held in Washington where political wins and losses are recorded constantly and breathlessly debated on cable television. "It's quiet. You can literally lock people in there," said presidential scholar Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. The White House round of discussions on Wednesday was the most combative yet, with Obama telling Republicans it was time to stop political posturing. "Enough is enough," he said. Presidents have used the heavily guarded installation for decades for high-stakes diplomacy, most notably when President Jimmy Carter sealed the Camp David accords there in 1978 with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. Camp David is so peaceful, in fact, that the head of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said it would be a shame to disrupt the its karma with bickering over debt and deficits. "The only thing I hope he doesn't ask us to do is go to Camp David," she said of Obama, laughing. "That goes beyond the pale ... I want that to be his preserve, a place where a president can go to renew, to study, to prepare for the next week." A source familiar with the matter said going to Camp David is an option, but White House officials said there were currently no plans to transfer the debt talks there. That may come as a relief to House Speaker John Boehner, the top U.S. Republican, and the head of the Senate Republican minority, Mitch McConnell. Why? The answer could be that lawmakers would prefer to stay in Washington where they can work on legislation with their battery of staff members, and check with each other on what proposals might work and what would not. "If you go to Camp David, allow more staff in and change up the format, maybe that would be a positive, but other than that I don't see what the positive would be," said a Republican congressional aide. Said another Republican congressional aide: "The fact is the talks are moving back to the Senate and away from the White House." (Additional reporting by  Andy Sullivan ; Editing by  Vicki Allen )
