 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer borrowing rose by a smaller-than expected $4.50 billion in December as both credit card and closed end consumer loan growth slowed sharply, a Federal Reserve report showed on Thursday. 

 Overall December consumer credit grew at an annual rate of 2.15 percent to a total of $2.519 trillion. The November increase was revised upward to $17.05 billion from an originally reported gain of $15.45 billion, while October's gain was revised upward to $5.57 billion from the previously reported gain of $2.02 billion. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a $7.3 billion rise in December consumer borrowing. (Reporting by  David Lawder ; Editing by  Neil Stempleman )
