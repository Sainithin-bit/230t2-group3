 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors are talking to 
high ranking officials at Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N after 
the collapse of two hedge funds last summer, and an indictment 
of the firm is possible, CNBC's reporter Charlie Gasparino said 
on Thursday. 

  Prosecutors recently spoke to former asset management head 
Rich Marin, Gasparino said. A spokesman for Bear Stearns was 
not immediately available for comment.  Bear's shares fell about 3 percent in pre-market trading to 
$79.60 after the report.  (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
