 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will on Thursday announce an upgrade to its walk-in medical clinic business with plans for several hundred new clinics, according to a report in the New York Times. 

 The first of the new clinics at Wal-Mart walk-in centers, will open in Little Rock, Arkansas, in April and run by nurse practitioners employed by a three-hospital group in central Arkansas. Wal-Mart will brand 200 of the new clinics with RediClinics, one of the Revolution Health companies of Steve Case, the AOL co-founder, said the report.
