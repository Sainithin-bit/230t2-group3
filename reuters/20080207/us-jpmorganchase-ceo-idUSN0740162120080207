 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Thursday he is no hurry to conduct an acquisition and is focusing on expanding the third- largest U.S. bank from within, including by adding subprime mortgages and other securities that many rivals shun. 

 Dimon, who ran Bank One Corp before selling it to JPMorgan for $56.9 billion in 2004, has largely been on the deal making sidelines since replacing William Harrison as JPMorgan's chief executive at the end of 2005. Rivals Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Wachovia Corp WB.N have since each conducted one or more large mergers. "There is no pressure whatsoever to do an acquisition," Dimon said at the Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum. "Having said that, if there's an opportunity to do something that really makes sense for the company, we would do it." Dimon said a purchase would have to make business sense, be executed well, and carry a "right and fair" price that likely doesn't dilute earnings per share. Analysts have said Dimon could acquire a large U.S. retail bank. They often mention Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ), the largest U.S. savings and loan, and SunTrust Banks Inc ( STI.N ), large U.S. southeast regional bank, as possible targets. Dimon has said he would like to expand in Florida, where both banks have major presences, and California, where Washington Mutual is prominent. John Reich, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, said on Thursday at the Reuters Regulation Summit he was unaware of any pending mergers involving Washington Mutual. JPMorgan has been hurt less by credit market turmoil than many of its peers, although its $2.97 billion fourth-quarter profit was down 34 percent from a year earlier. With stronger capital levels than several rivals, it also has not publicly sought infusions from outside investors, such as Citigroup, Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N and Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ), or conducted big securities offerings to boost capital. Through Wednesday, JPMorgan shares were up 10 percent since Dimon took over, versus declines of 45 percent at Citigroup, 8 percent at Bank of America, 35 percent at Wachovia, 22 percent at Merrill and 5 percent at Morgan Stanley. SUBPRIME IS "YESTERDAY'S NEWS" Dimon said JPMorgan is expanding its balance sheet with subprime and "jumbo" mortgages, the latter of which are too large to be bought by Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. "The subprime thing is almost yesterday's news," he said. "I don't think there is too much more pain you can have. I personally think that subprime is not a bad thing. It's something that went to excess." Less likely to recover is demand for complex debt such as collateralized debt obligations and a wide variety of mortgage- and asset-backed securities, where Dimon expects "materially reduced" issuance compared with earlier in the decade. "All these problems that have cropped up ... they're getting resolved," Dimon said. "Eventually, supply and demand will find a common ground. I don't know when that's going to be, maybe six months or nine months." Even if credit markets recover, Dimon expects some products to disappear, including CDOs of CDOs and structured investment vehicles. Tight credit could weigh on JPMorgan's investment bank, which could face "a tough time" in 2008, he said. JPMorgan was involved in a U.S. Treasury-backed plan to bail out investment funds exposed to hundreds of billions of dollars of SIVs. That plan was abandoned in December because of low investor demand and some banks bailed out their own SIVs. In afternoon trading, JPMorgan shares rose 96 cents to $44.68 on the New York Stock Exchange.
