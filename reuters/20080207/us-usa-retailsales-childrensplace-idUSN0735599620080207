 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc's ( PLCE.O ) former chief executive, Ezra Dabah, said on Thursday he was confident he could make a bid to buy the company for $24 a share. 

 Shares of the operator of the Children's Place and Disney Store clothing chains jumped 20 percent to $21.31 on the New York Stock Exchange. The $24 price would represent a 35 percent premium to Children's Place shares' $17.78 closing Wednesday price. Dabah said he had received interest from private equity firm Golden Gate Capital to be a participant in the deal. The company confirmed receipt of the letter but did not give any indication of its reaction to Dabah's offer. The company only reiterated that it has hired Lehman Brothers to help it review strategic alternatives to improve operations and enhance shareholder value. Dabah, who said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that he owns 17.2 percent of the children's clothing retailer's shares, had resigned as CEO last September after an internal probe found he did not comply with the company's securities-trading policies. The SEC filing comes the same day that Children's Place said its sales at stores open at least a year rose a better-than-expected 6 percent in January. Wall Street on average had been expecting a same-store sales gain of 2.5 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Same-store sales rose 9 percent at the Children's Place brand and 2 percent at the company's Disney Store chain. Children's Place also said it has been notified by Nasdaq that its stock was subject to delisting because of its failure to hold its fiscal 2006 annual meeting by February 3. Last September, the company said its board was evaluating strategic options -- including a potential reorganization or an outright sale. The company had to delay its meeting because it was late in filing its 2006 annual report. But the retailer filed the annual report on December 5. and said it will request an extension of the meeting deadline, since it expects to hold the meeting in the spring of 2008.
