 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Thursday that sales fell 2 percent in January at stores open at least a year as it focused on clearing out holiday merchandise to make room for spring clothing. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the San Francisco-based clothing retailer to post a same-stores sales decrease of 6.1 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap, which runs Banana Republic, Old Navy and its namesake Gap stores, said net sales for the four-week period ended February 2 fell to $932 million from $1.19 billion a year ago. Same-store sales, a key gauge of retail performance, fell 4 percent and 3 percent, respectively, at Gap and Old Navy stores in North America. They rose 5 percent at Banana Republic, the company's more upscale chain. The company said fourth-quarter sales fell to $4.67 billion from $4.92 billion a year ago. Looking ahead, Gap said it expects fourth-quarter earnings to range between 33 cents and 35 cents a share, including a 1 cent benefit from favorable tax rate adjustments. The company also raised its full-year earnings outlook to a range of $1.03 and $1.05 per share, from a prior forecast of 92 cents to 98 cents a share. Analysts, on average, had expected fourth-quarter earnings of 29 cents a share, and full-year earnings of $1.04 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Gap is in the midst of a turnaround to lure back shoppers who defected to other retailers over the last few years. Its Gap and Old Navy stores -- whose competition includes Target Corp ( TGT.N ), Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ) and Abercrombie & Fitch ( ANF.N ) -- have been hit the hardest.
