 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Teen apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co ( ANF.N ) said on Thursday its sales at stores open at least a year were flat in January. 

 Analysts' same-store sales estimates anticipated an average increase of 0.1 percent, according to Reuters Estimates, with estimates ranging from a decrease of 2 percent to a rise of 4 percent. The New Albany, Ohio-based company, which owns the Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister and RUEHL chains, said total sales for the four weeks ended February 2 were $219.7 million, down from $252.3 million in the year-earlier period. By division the company said same-store sales rose 2 percent at the flagship Abercrombie & Fitch chain, as men's clothing sales rose in the low-double digit range and women's clothes declined in the mid-single digit range. Same-store sales fell 1 percent at Abercrombie, the company's kids' chain, 2 percent at Hollister and 17 percent at RUEHL. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by Mark Porter/Derek Caney)
