 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) is planning for half its cars in the United States to be running on ethanol by 2012, the Associated Press reported. 

 The report quoted GM North America President Troy Clarke at the Chicago Auto Show as saying GM will have 11 ethanol-capable vehicles on the market this year and 15 in 2009. Earlier, start-up biofuel company Coskata Inc, part owned by GM, said it has formed a strategic alliance with ICM Inc to build a commercial plant to mass produce cellulose-based ethanol. The plant is due to open in late 2010. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando , editing by Will Waterman)
