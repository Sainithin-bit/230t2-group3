 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said in a letter released on Wednesday that the Fed is "closely monitoring" any potential economic and banking impacts that could result from problems with bond insurers. 

 As fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis spreads, lawmakers and regulators have grown concerned about the credit ratings of Ambac Financial Group Inc ABK.N, MBIA Inc ( MBI.N ), Financial Guaranty Insurance Co and other bond insurers. "Given the adverse effects that problems of financial guarantors can have on financial markets and the economy, we are closely monitoring developments," Bernanke said in the letter dated February 4 to Rep. Paul Kanjorski. The chairman of a House of Representatives subcommittee that oversees capital markets and the insurance industry, Kanjorski had sought input from numerous regulators as he considers possible reforms to bond insurer oversight. The Pennsylvania Democrat said the responses to his request have convinced him there is a need for reform and he will hold a committee hearing on February 14 to explore the issue. New York Insurance Superintendent Eric Dinallo told Kanjorski in a letter that regulators may need to restrict bond insurers' activities in risks that are too volatile or lacking transparency. He also suggested regulators may need to get independent analysis of insurers' risks, rather than solely relying on rating agencies' assessments. Dinallo has been working with banks to organize rescues for some of the bond insurers. He added that there would be drawbacks to organizing a guarantee fund for the insurers, a possibility some have discussed. But he said, "It may be helpful to create a short-term backstop that would share some structural features with a guarantee fund in order to help ease immediate pressures felt by bond insurers." MBIA's stock price jumped in after-hours trading on Wednesday after the company said it would raise $750 million in a new share issue and pump the money into its insurance unit. Fitch Ratings, a credit rating agency, said on Tuesday it may strip the main unit of MBIA of its top "triple-A" rating due to exposure to complex securities backed by assets including home mortgages. Slashing the ratings of bond insurers, which stand behind more than $2.4 trillion in assets, could lead to downgrades of commercial and investment banks, said Standard & Poor's, another credit rating agency, on Tuesday. Concern has also been raised about the potential impact on municipal bond markets of any downgrades of bond insurers. In his letter, Bernanke added: "In addition, we are closely monitoring the potential effect of downgrades of financial guarantors on bank holding companies, state member banks, and other institutions supervised by the Federal Reserve. In a memo also released by Kanjorski's office, a top official at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the largest Wall Street banks are "highly aware of and actively managing their exposures" to the bond insurance industry. Erik Sirri, head of the SEC's division of trading and markets, said in the memo that investment banks face credit, market and liquidity risk from links to bond insurers. Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan, a bank regulator, said in his letter to Kanjorski that banks have direct and indirect exposures to bond insurer risks. "We believe that direct exposures from counterparty risk and direct lending are relatively moderate ... we believe the indirect exposures are not ones that can be easily quantified," Dugan said, adding that his office is in regular discussions with the Fed, the SEC and foreign bank authorities.
