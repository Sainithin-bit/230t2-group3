 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - TJX Cos. Inc. ( TJX.N ) said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a full year rose 3 percent in January, just below the company's expectations. 

 Analysts, on average, had been expecting the off-price retailer to post a same-store sales increase of 3.7 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Framingham, Massachusetts-based TJX, which operates the T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains, said its total sales for the four weeks ended February 2 were $1.13 billion, up 7 percent from $1.06 billion a year ago. TJX, like other off-price retailers, buys excess merchandise in bulk from manufacturers below wholesale prices. (Reporting by  Martinne Geller ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
