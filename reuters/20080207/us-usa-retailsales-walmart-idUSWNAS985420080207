 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) on Thursday reported a lower-than-expected 0.5 percent rise in its January sales at U.S. stores open at least a year, citing unfavorable weather and gift card redemptions that were below expectations. 

 Analysts, on average, were expecting the company's same-store sales to rise 2 percent, according to Reuters Estimates. Last month, Wal-Mart said sales at its U.S. stores during the first two months of its fourth quarter had run about 2 percent ahead of a year ago, and it expected "to run at a similar rate for the January four-week sales period." The world's biggest retailer said net sales in the month ended February 1 rose almost 8 percent to $27.28 billion. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri ; Editing by  Derek Caney )
