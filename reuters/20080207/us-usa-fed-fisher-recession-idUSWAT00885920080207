 MEXICO CITY  (Reuters) - While the U.S. economy is at some risk of a slowdown, it will probably avoid a recession, and any downturn is unlikely to be severe, Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said on Thursday. 

 "I believe that we can avoid a recession," he told reporters after a speech to the Instituto Tecnologico Autonomo de Mexico. "I don't believe that a mainstream analysis presently, a responsible analysis, can lead to a conclusion that we're going to have a deep negative economic reversal of lasting proportions," he added.
