 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc is introducing a new media site focused on women's daily lives, the latest in a string of sites that include ones for gadget enthusiasts and food lovers, the company said on Sunday. 

 The Sunnyvale, California-based company said the new site, called "Shine", offers nine categories ranging from Fashion & Beauty to Parenting. It syndicates material from popular lifestyle publishers including Conde Nast and Hearst Corp. The site is aimed at roughly 40 million women between the ages of 25 and 54 and aims to make Yahoo more relevant to this demographic, which is highly appealing to brand advertisers. Yahoo's media strategy has been to create consolidated thematic sites designed to appeal to mass audiences. The company introduced Yahoo Tech in May 2006 and Yahoo Food in November 2006. According to market research firm Hitwise, Yahoo Tech ranks in the top five of U.S. technology media sites and Yahoo Food ranks in the top 10 of food lifestyle sites. Yahoo has hired an editorial team to publish original stories on a daily basis as well as to select user blog posts to feature prominently on the site. Shine also offers items from existing Yahoo sites covering food, astrology and health. Yahoo Shine is located at  shine.yahoo.com/. (Reporting by  Eric Auchard ; editing by Sue Thomas)
