 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers LEH.N filed suit against Japanese trading house Marubeni Corp ( 8002.T ) on Monday alleging a finance scam that cost the U.S. investment bank $352 million. 

 Lehman alleges that Marubeni staff were responsible for the swindle, which a source with direct knowledge of the matter said involved forged documents and an impostor at Marubeni's offices. The following is a partial list of some of the major financial markets trading frauds in recent years: April 1992 - Indian banks and brokers were accused of colluding to siphon off $1.3 billion from the inter-bank securities market to fuel a boom on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Top broker Harshad Mehta, the main person accused in the scandal, died in jail during the trial. February 1995 - One of Britain's oldest investment banks, Barings Plc, collapsed after a lone futures trader in Singapore, Nick Leeson, lost $1.4 billion in derivatives trading. Leeson was jailed in Singapore. Barings was subsequently sold to Dutch bank ING ( ING.AS ) for one pound. September 1995 - Japan's Daiwa Bank suffered a $1.1 billion loss from unauthorized bond trading by Toshihide Iguchi, one of its U.S. executives. He was imprisoned in 1996. June 1996 - Japanese trading house Sumitomo Corp suffered a $2.6 billion loss over 10 years from unauthorized copper trades, primarily by chief copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka. Sumitomo fired Hamanaka, once dubbed "Mr Five Percent" because his trading team was believed to control 5 percent of the world's copper trading. He was later jailed for eight years. January 2001 - The former chief financial officer of the now-defunct Griffin Trading Co, Scott Szach, was charged with diverting more than $5.56 million from a company bank account to a brokerage trading account to fund unauthorized trading in the 18 months before the firm's demise. September 2001 - Merrill Lynch MER.N fired two senior executives for their failure to supervise a currency dealer who diverted profits on foreign exchange deals to favored clients, leaving the bank facing a $10 million bill. February 2002 - Ireland's largest bank, Allied Irish, revealed a rogue U.S. trader, John Rusnak, had defrauded its U.S. subsidiary of up to $750 million. Rusnak was sentenced in January 2003 to seven and a half years in prison. He admitted devising a scheme that netted him $850,000 in salary and bonuses from 1997 to 2001. March/April 2006 - Hedge fund Amaranth Advisors LLC and former head trader Brian Hunter racked up $6.4 billion in losses from natural gas contracts before the fund folded in 2006. In July 2007 the Commodity Futures Trading Commission sued Amaranth and Hunter, alleging they tried to manipulate natural gas futures prices. January 2008 - French bank Societe Generale alleges that fraud by a single trader caused a 4.9 billion euro ($7.1 billion) loss. Jerome Kerviel, a junior trader, was jailed in connection with the case. He was later released on bail but still faces accusations that he caused SocGen billions of euros of losses. March 31, 2008 - Lehman files suit against Japanese trading house Marubeni seeking repayment of $352 million lost in an alleged investment fraud.
