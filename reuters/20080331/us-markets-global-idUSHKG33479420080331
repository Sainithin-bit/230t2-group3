 LONDON  (Reuters) - European shares were on track for their third straight quarterly loss on Monday beset by unrelenting worries about the financial sector while fiscal year-end demand from Japanese corporates helped prop up the ailing dollar. 

 Underscoring tight credit conditions, particularly into the end of the month and quarter, the European Central Bank announced it would inject extra overnight funds to money markets. In contrast, commodities such as copper were headed for their strongest quarterly performance in at least 18 months with demand seen largely remaining intact despite worries about global growth. Copper futures in London gained 0.9 percent. Investors dumped bank shares on renewed fears over asset writedowns and after Oppenheimer & Co analyst Meredith Whitney warned last Friday of more dividend cuts and forecast a further 25 percent drop in U.S. banking shares. Swiss bank UBS ( UBSN.VX ) dropped more than 3 percent. "This subprime crisis isn't over yet and we might see more writedowns from banks when they report their first quarter results, and that obviously is entangling stock markets," said Franz Wenzel, strategist at AXA Investment Managers in Paris. Suggesting heightened risk aversion, the iTraxx Crossover index, made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, widened about 18 points. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares fell nearly 2 percent, with Germany's DAX  .GDAXI  and Britain's FTSE  .FTSE  both also down nearly 2 percent. "Europe Equity Funds have now posted outflows in 29 of the past 30 weeks," said fund tracker EPFR Global. "Investors are also betting that European banks lag their U.S. counterparts in identifying, admitting to and dealing with the bad debt spawned by the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market." In Asia, shares posted their worst quarterly performance in over five years. Japan's Nikkei  .N225  slid 2.3 percent finishing the fiscal year with its worst quarterly performance since 2001. MSCI's measure of other Asian stock markets .MIAPJ0000PUS fell 1 percent. MSCI world equity index .MIWD00000PUS lost 0.8 percent. DOLLAR EDGES UP The dollar firmed against a basket of major currencies, drawing support from strong quarter-end demand, but it held near a record low against the euro as investors awaited more clues on the health of the U.S economy from data due later this week. Year-end activity from Japanese investors and corporates and life insurers gave the dollar a slight lift, traders said. "The focus on U.S. data will confirm whether the downtrend is accelerating or not and what the reaction of the Fed could be on the back of such data," said Michael Klawitter, currency strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort in Frankfurt. "Current levels present clear (dollar) selling opportunities and I'd be very surprised if we now see the dollar stabilizing or recovering from these levels." The dollar index .DXY nudged up 0.1 percent to 71.659. The euro was little changed at $1.5800 while the dollar gained 0.2 percent to 99.35 yen. Among other commodities, U.S. crude slipped 44 cents to $105.18 a barrel, dragged lower by the restart of a crude pipeline system in Iraq, while gold edged up towards $940 an ounce, held back by the fall in oil prices. Weakness in stocks helped underpin demand for safe-haven government bonds, pushing yields lower. The 10-year Bund yield shed 2.4 basis points to 3.920 percent, while the benchmark 10-year yield for U.S. Treasuries was steady at 3.473 percent.
