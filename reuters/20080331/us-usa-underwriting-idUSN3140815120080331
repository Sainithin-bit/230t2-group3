 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) was dethroned as the world's largest underwriter of stocks and bonds for the first time in more than six years, as the global credit crunch hit Wall Street hard. 

 JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) was the top underwriter in the first quarter, the first time in 25 quarters that Citigroup did not rank first, Thomson Financial said on Monday. It was a dismal quarter for the industry, as underwriting volume plummeted 45 percent. Reported fees fell 7 percent, Thomson data show. While Visa Inc's ( V.N ) U.S. record $19.7 billion initial public offering was a bright spot, many sectors showed steep declines, especially in fixed-income areas, where many investors have curtailed or stopped their buying. "There was a total contraction in credit," said Richard Peterson, director of capital markets at Thomson. "We don't know if there are more hidden time-bombs. The market is sensing there could be more." According to Thomson, underwriting volume fell to $1.27 trillion from $2.3 trillion a year earlier. JPMorgan arranged $129.4 billion of offerings, winning a 10.2 percent share. Citigroup followed with $94.7 billion of offerings and a 7.5 percent share. Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) was third, with $91.8 billion of offerings and a 7.2 percent share. Reported fees fell to $3.38 billion from $3.65 billion, Thomson said. Citigroup led in that area, with a 15.6 percent share, followed by Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) with 8.9 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) with 7.8 percent. JPMorgan was fourth. Bankers covet rankings in Thomson's underwriting "league tables" for marketing purposes and bragging rights. Thomson's parent, Thomson Corp TOC.TO, is expected in April to complete its acquisition of Reuters Group Plc RTR.L. JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment. Citigroup in a statement said it manages its business "for productivity and profitability rather than league table position." BROADER MARKET NEEDS TIME Banks have written off more than $160 billion for debt and credit losses in the last several months, with tens of billions of further write-downs expected. The U.S. Federal Reserve, meanwhile, has slashed interest rates and made it easier for lenders and investment banks to borrow in an attempt to bolster market liquidity. "All the things that have taken place, in terms of the Fed cutting rates and providing various forms of financing, are all part of the solution," said Jim Merli, global head of debt syndicate at Lehman Brothers Inc. "The only other thing we can do is give the market time." (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
