 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Furniture Brands International Inc FBN.N acknowledged on Monday that it got a letter from a major shareholder, Sun Capital Securities LLC, demanding its stockholder list, but said it was disappointed with the move. 

 "We are disappointed Sun Capital is considering pursuit of a costly and disruptive proxy contest," Furniture Brands said in a statement. "A proxy contest can only serve as a distraction to the company when attention and resources would be better used in creating value for stockholders by implementing our strategic plan."
