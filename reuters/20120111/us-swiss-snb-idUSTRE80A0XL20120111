 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Naming a new third member to the Swiss National Bank's board and appointing a new permanent chairman could take until April or May, Switzerland's finance minister said on Wednesday. 
 SNB Chairman Philipp Hildebrand resigned with immediate effect on Monday after a scandal over a currency trade made by his wife and his deputy Thomas Jordan was appointed as intermin chairman. "Maybe April or May," Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said at the government's weekly news conference. "I think it's right that you have all three and then you can make the choice as a whole," she also said. The SNB's bank council will make a recommendation to the government, which then makes the appointment.
