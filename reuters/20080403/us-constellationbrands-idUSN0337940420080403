 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc ( STZ.N ) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast fiscal-year earnings above Wall Street estimates on Thursday, sending the wine maker's shares up as much as 9 percent. 

 But much of the earnings surprise stemmed from a lower tax rate, and analysts said there were still questions about the company's fundamental business, which also includes beer and spirits. The owner of wine brands such as Robert Mondavi, Ravenswood and Vendange posted a net loss of $831.9 million, or $3.90 per share, in the fourth quarter that ended February 29, compared with a year-earlier net profit of $70.2 million, or 29 cents per share. But excluding items such as $888 million in acquisition-related costs and restructuring charges, Constellation earned 34 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 25 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Constellation said its effective tax rate in the quarter was 14.9 percent, while two analysts said they had been expecting a rate of 37 percent. Goldman Sachs analyst Judy Hong, who said the core results had missed her expectations, said the stock had rallied in part because of Constellation's positive outlook. "Our sense is that while market expectations tilt to the cautious side, we await further clarity on the underlying business fundamentals to adopt a more optimistic view," Hong wrote in a research note. Constellation, which also owns 99 Schnapps and Black Velvet Canadian Whisky, said interest expense rose 25 percent during the quarter, mostly due to recent acquisitions and $500 million in share buybacks. The company changed how it reports sales that come from two joint ventures -- Crown Imports, which brings Corona beer into the United States, and Matthew Clark, a UK-based beverage wholesaler. This change led quarterly net sales to fall 23 percent to $884.4 million. Partly offsetting that pain were the weak dollar, which boosted the value of overseas sales when converted to U.S. currency, and the recent acquisitions of Svedka Vodka and the wine business of Fortune Brands Inc FO.N. About 69 percent of Constellation's quarterly sales came from North America, about 20 percent from Europe and the remaining 11 percent from Australia and New Zealand. DECLINE IN WINE Excluding brands like Clos du Bois and Wild Horse, which Constellation bought from Fortune, branded wine sales fell 2 percent overall, as a 5 percent decline in North America offset increases of 4 percent in Europe and 8 percent in the Australia/New Zealand region. Earlier in the fiscal year, U.S. wine distributors reduced the amount of inventory they carried, which affected the timing of Constellation's sales and hurt growth in the fourth quarter. Constellation said sales of its wine from North American wholesalers to retailers, which could be a clearer gauge of performance, rose in the low single digits in the quarter. Excluding the Svedka acquisition, spirits sales increased 10 percent. For fiscal 2009, which will end next February, Constellation said it expected to earn $1.68 to $1.76 per share, excluding items, up from $1.44 in the previous year. Analysts on average had been expecting $1.67 per share, excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. The company's forecast assumes reported net sales increasing at a mid-single-digit percentage range, interest expense of $340 million to $350 million, and free cash flow of $310 million to $340 million. Constellation said it expected sales from wholesalers to retailers from the Crown joint venture to rise in the mid-single digits in 2009. Despite the higher outlook for the venture, analysts said they remained cautious on this year's performance, due in part to concerns over sales trends of Corona, the best-selling imported beer in the United States. Sales of Corona, made by Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo ( GMODELOC.MX ), have been soft lately in parts of California that have been hardest hit by the economic downturn dogging U.S. consumers. Modelo is half-owned by U.S. brewer Anheuser-Busch Cos Inc ( BUD.N ). Constellation shares were up 85 cents, or 4.5 percent, at $19.57 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trade after rising to $20.47 earlier in the session.
