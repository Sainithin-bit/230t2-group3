 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector contracted for a third straight month in March while the number of workers applying for jobless benefits soared last week to a 2-1/2-year high, reinforcing fears the economy has stalled. 

 Investors on Thursday took some solace in the fact that the Institute for Supply Management's gauge of the non-manufacturing economy showed the decline in services was not as severe as feared, helping U.S. stocks .SPX hold steady. But government data showing claims for unemployment benefits jumped to 407,000, the highest since September 2005. That raised the prospects that Friday's non-farm payrolls report could show deep job cuts as the economy struggles. "It will add to fears that we are in a recession -- it was one piece of data that still didn't suggest that as long as we were below the 400,000 handle," said Kim Rupert, managing director for global fixed income analysis at Action Economics LLC in San Francisco. "It will weigh on concerns that we will get a low payrolls number tomorrow." Economists polled by Reuters had expected initial jobless claims to increase to 370,000, compared with the upwardly revised 369,000 the prior week, Analysts fear a housing slump and credit crunch may have already tipped the U.S. economy into recession and are scrutinizing the labor market for evidence of slackening jobs that could chill consumer spending. Economists expect Friday's report to show the economy shed a total of 60,000 jobs in March and the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent from 4.8 percent the previous month. Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama seized on the jobless claims data as another sign of trouble for the beleaguered economy, which is likely to remain a hot topic throughout this year's campaign. Clinton said in a statement the U.S. economy was at risk of "a painful and deep recession" and "the government should stand ready to go further and temporarily purchase at-risk mortgages to help unfreeze the mortgage markets and keep millions of families in their homes." Obama said in a statement the economy was in recession and called for "immediate relief for homeowners, a second stimulus package that expands unemployment insurance and helps state and local governments, and investments in millions of new jobs." IN SERVICE The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index came in at 49.6, slightly up from 49.3 in February but below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. The result was above the record-low 44.6 hit in January. The March number was higher than the median forecast for 48.5 that economists predicted in a Reuters poll, which helped the dollar gain against the euro. Government bonds, which benefit from signs of economic weakness, were mixed after seeing a setback in the wake of the ISM release. The services index has now been below 50 for three consecutive months, the first time it has been mired in such a slump since January 2002, when the economy was still feeling the lingering effects of the last recession. The report raised worries about inflation, with its prices paid index rising to 70.8 in March from 67.9 in February. Adding a note of gloom, an index of chief executives' confidence in the U.S. economy plunged to a record low last month. Most CEOs expect a drop in U.S. employment levels over the next four to five months, according to the monthly survey by Chief Executive magazine.
