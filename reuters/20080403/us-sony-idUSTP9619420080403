 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Sony Corp ( 6758.T ) unveiled on Thursday a video camera as small as a juice box, saying it was the world's smallest and lightest high-definition camcorder. 

 The tiny camera, to go on sale in Japan this month, weighs just 300 grams (10.6 ounces) and measures 32 mm x 119 mm x 63 mm (1.3 inches x 4.7 inches x 2.5 inches) but comes with a big price tag of 130,000 yen ($1,271). It can store 55 minutes of full high-definition images with a resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels on an 8 gigabyte memory card, the firm said. Along with its Cyber-shot digital cameras, camcorders are Sony's top profit earner. The new camera is due to go on sale in Japan on April 20, with launches in other countries to follow.
