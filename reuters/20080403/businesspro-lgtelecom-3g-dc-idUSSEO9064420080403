 SEOUL  (Reuters) - LG Telecom Co Ltd 032640.KQ, South 
Korea's third-biggest mobile service operator, may offer its 
third-generation service on phones using Google's ( GOOG.O ) 
mobile software platform, LG's chief executive said on 
Thursday. 

  "We are using an open platform for our 3G service," CEO 
Jung Il-jae told reporters.  "Google and other companies have shown interest," Jung 
said, adding a formal negotiation has not started with Google.  South Korean handset maker LG Electronics Inc ( 066570.KS ) 
said in February it would start selling a model running on 
Google's Android mobile phone operating system in late 2008 or 
early 2009. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ) also hopes 
to have a Google phone in early 2009.  Jung said Android phones would be available first for 3G 
services based on GSM (global system for mobile communications) 
technology, although LG Telecom, which uses the rival CDMA 
(code division multiple access) standard, could eventually 
offer Android phones.  No.1 U.S. mobile service AT&T Inc ( T.N ) said on Wednesday 
it was interested in selling phones based on Android.  LG, which has 18 percent of South Korea's 44 million mobile 
users, has lagged behind bigger rivals SK Telecom Co 
( 017670.KS ) and KTF Co Ltd 032390.KS in providing more 
profitable 3G services, such as video calls and wireless 
Internet.  LG hopes to win users for its 3G services through 
easy-to-use and cheaper full Internet browsing service, which 
allows direct access to the Internet just like fixed-line 
platforms.  Kosdaq-listed LG Telecom rose 0.4 percent to 7,600 won by 
1:05 a.m. EDT, compared with the Kosdaq index's .KQ11 0.13 
percent gain.  (Reporting by Rhee So-eui, editing by Marie-France Han and
