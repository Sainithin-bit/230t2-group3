 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector contracted less than expected in March, according to a report released on Thursday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index came in at 49.6 in March, slightly up from 49.3 in February, but below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. Economists polled by Reuters had expected the non-manufacturing index to come in at 48.5 for March. The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants.
