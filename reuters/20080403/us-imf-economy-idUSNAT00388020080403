 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy has come to "a virtual standstill" and will remain weak in coming quarters due to deeper problems in housing and credit markets, the International Monetary Fund's chief economist said on Thursday, but avoided calling it a recession. 

 "Notwithstanding the strong response from U.S. policymakers, tighter financial conditions, higher energy prices, softer labor markets, and the weak housing market all conspire to weigh heavily on the (U.S.) economy in the near term," IMF chief economist Simon Johnson told reporters.
