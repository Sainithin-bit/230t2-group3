 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Mobile phone maker Motorola Inc MOT.N said on Thursday it will take a $104 million pre-tax charge in the first quarter related to severance charges for 2,600 employees. 

 The company said the charge included $113 million in severance costs, offset by $9 million in reversals of accruals from previous periods. Motorola has been trying to revive its business after losing market share to rivals such as Nokia Oyj ( NOK1V.HE ) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd ( 005930.KS ). It said all of its business segments will be affected by these severance plans. Motorola shares, which closed up 1.66 percent at $9.77, were at around $9.75 in after-hours trade. The company said late last month that it would split into two publicly traded entities in 2009, separating its money-losing handset division from the rest of the business, which makes television set-top boxes and network equipment.
