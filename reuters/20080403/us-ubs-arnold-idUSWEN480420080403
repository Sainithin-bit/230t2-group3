 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luqman Arnold, a former president of UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ), is pushing for a potential break-up of the troubled Swiss bank, the Wall Street Journal said in its online edition, citing a letter sent Thursday night by Arnold and his London investment firm to UBS's board. 

 Arnold is chairman of Olivant Advisers Ltd. in London. He had served as UBS' president before departing in 2001 after a dispute over strategy with current Chairman Marcel Ospel. The challenge follows UBS' announcement this week that it will raise 15 billion Swiss francs to bolster capital, after a $19 billion write-down tied largely to U.S. mortgages led to a roughly $12 billion quarterly loss. Ospel said he would quit as chairman and be replaced by in-house counsel Peter Kurer. According to the Journal, Arnold believes UBS should sell its asset-management arm to raise capital, and legally separate its investment bank, the source of many of UBS' troubles, and its private bank that caters to wealthy clients. A UBS spokesman told the Journal: "A letter of this nature has not come to our attention. If we receive such a letter we will, of course, respond to it."
