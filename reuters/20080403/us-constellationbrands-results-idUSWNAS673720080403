 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Constellation Brands Inc ( STZ.N ) reported a quarterly net loss on Thursday versus a year-ago profit, as a change in the way the alcoholic drinks company accounts for some business units led to a large sales decline. 

 The owner of Robert Mondavi, Ravenswood, Vendange and other wine brands said its net loss for the fourth quarter, ended February 29, was $831.9 million, or $3.90 per share, compared with a net profit of $70.2 million, or 29 cents per share, a year earlier.
