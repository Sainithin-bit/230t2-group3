 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. service sector contracted less than expected in March, according to a report released on Thursday. 

 Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on Thursday repeated remarks justifying the government's financial market rescue and acknowledging tough economic conditions, but did not mention economic recession or contraction in prepared testimony.  KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management's non-manufacturing index came in at 49.6 in March, slightly up from 49.3 in February, but below the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction. * Economists polled by Reuters had expected the non-manufacturing index to come in at 48.5 for March. * The services sector represents about 80 percent of U.S. economic activity, including businesses such as banks, airlines, hotels and restaurants.  COMMENTS:  THOMAS DI GALOMA, HEAD OF U.S. TREASURY TRADING, JEFFERIES,  NEW YORK: "This is kind of a better report than the market was looking for. It looks like there may be a little bit of a pause in the recession talk here. On Geithner, he's saying he felt that the Bear situation could have developed into more widespread risks so that that justified the bailout. I think the three guys essentially running the Fed now are Bernanke, Kohn and Geithner. There's been talk in the market that they might stop easing soon but I think they'll continue cutting by a quarter point at the next three meetings, and that rates will have to stay low in this country for some time."  PAUL ASHWORTH, U.S. ECONOMIST, CAPITAL ECONOMICS, LONDON: "The news on the non-manufacturing index is perhaps more comforting than the manufacturing index, even though at their March levels both point to weak growth rather than a recession. That's because this index is the one we would expect most accurately to reflect a housing-led slowdown centered on consumption. There are causes for concern, however. The employment index remained unchanged at a desperately low 46.9. At that level the index is consistent with outright declines in services payrolls to add to the job losses in construction and manufacturing."  SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST.  PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "The ISM services report was like the ISM manufacturing: still weak but not as bad as expected. That qualifies as good news nowadays. There has not been a lot of market reaction. Stocks have come back a bit. Treasuries (prices) are still up on the day." "The reaction in markets should be somewhat limited because tomorrow's jobs data will be a lot more important."  TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET  MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "I think the ISM was slightly better than expected and that probably helped the (stock) market. The pre-market was down because of the weekly jobs claims number, but that's always a volatile number and to us this market remains in a bottoming process. "In general we expect negative headlines on the economy, so the ISM number is surprising. But the negative sentiment is pretty thick in the market. "You're seeing the market react well to news financial companies are shoring things up and perhaps the worst is behind them. We're not ready to wave the white flag and say we're going to take off from here but it does seem like the path of least resistance is to the upside."  T.J. MARTA, FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW  YORK: "The data is consistent with a moderate recession. Fed easing that began in September should begin to support the market around June, around the same time that the tax rebates begin to provide support."  ANTHONY NIEVES, CHAIRMAN, ISM'S NON-MANUFACTURING BUSINESS  SURVEY COMMITTEE, BEVERLY HILLS, CALIFORNIA: "If you look back to the last quarter of 2007, manufacturing was actually spiraling downward and the non-manufacturing sector was holding pretty steady. Manufacturing bounced back a little bit in the first part of the year when non-manufacturing was slipping dramatically. It looks like non-manufacturing is starting to level off and manufacturing is also looking more 'sideways.' I see some stability here and where manufacturing and non-manufacturing are starting to look like they're stabilizing a little bit."  BORIS SCHLOSSBERG, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, DAILYFX.COM, NEW  YORK: "The ISM number was exactly what we were looking for and it's positive for the dollar. The employment component is probably of primary importance to people. With the better-than-expected ADP report and the ISM employment number, it looks like Friday's nonfarm payrolls won't be any worse than the market expects. If that's the case, the dollar should maintain its bid tone. Jobless claims today was the one monkey wrench in the works. "There's a strong chance we have seen an intermediate term top for the euro against the dollar. The currency market is moving toward the idea that the rest of the world is also slowing down. Clearly, the Europeans don't want to see the euro at $1.60 in that atmosphere."  MARKET REACTION: 
* BONDS: U.S. Treasuries debt prices pare gains. 
* CURRENCIES: The dollar gained. 
* STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes initially pared losses. 
* RATE FUTURES: Implied chances of a 50 basis point cut in the Fed funds rate later this month held steady at 24 percent.  EARLIER DATA FROM APRIL 3- 
* The number of U.S. workers applying for unemployment benefit soared by 38,000 last week, posting the highest reading since September 2005 and reinforcing fears that the U.S. economy has stalled, government data on Thursday showed.
