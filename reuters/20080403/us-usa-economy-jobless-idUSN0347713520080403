 (Reuters) - A U.S. jobs report on Thursday showing unemployment claims in late March at their highest level in 2-1/2 years reinforced market fears that the U.S. economy has stalled. 

 The report came amid widespread worries about the U.S. housing crisis and fears of recession. Analysts say a declining economy would favor a Democrat in the November presidential election against Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who has already locked up the Republican nomination. Here is what the candidates vying to succeed President George W. Bush said about the latest jobless claims: DEMOCRAT HILLARY CLINTON "Today's dismal jobless claims report is a reminder that we are in the midst of a growing economic crisis and Sen. McCain has yet to answer the call of economic leadership. "Sen. McCain has already admitted that he doesn't know much about economics, and he is proving that point on the campaign trail. "My opponent, Sen. Obama, has been very timid and unenthusiastic about doing anything with the economy that I have consistently said I thought needed to be done." DEMOCRAT BARACK OBAMA "Today's job news is the latest indicator of how badly America needs fundamental change from Bush-McCain policies that have been devastating for working families and catastrophic for our economy. "While George Bush and John McCain's answer to this recession has been to watch it happen while pushing for more tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans, more families are facing foreclosure, rising costs, and disappearing jobs." "Our economy is struggling because the American people are struggling, and simply bailing out investment banks on Wall Street will not help Main Street." REPUBLICAN JOHN MCCAIN'S CAMPAIGN SPOKESMAN BRIAN ROGERS "Rising unemployment claims add to the picture of an economy facing serious challenges. To support workers and small businesses across America, we need to advance pro-growth policies that in part lower taxes, streamline government and reduce health care costs. Our nation can clearly not afford the Democrats and their liberal economic agenda that will only stifle growth."
