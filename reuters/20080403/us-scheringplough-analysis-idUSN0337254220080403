 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A 50 percent plunge in shares of Schering-Plough Corp this year has lured value hunters who call the sell-off overdone over its flagship cholesterol medicines, Vytorin and Zetia, and see appeal in a new acquisition and the company's pipeline of new drugs. 

 Another silver lining in the stock drop: The company's cut-rate market value makes it takeover bait. Its shares climbed more than 11 percent on Thursday to $15.40 after Schering-Plough SGP.N late Wednesday unveiled a program to cut costs by about $1.5 billion a year. But that is a far cry from where it was just months ago, or even last week. Shares are still off 42 percent this year, driven down by a study that found Vytorin failed to reverse the progression of heart disease better than Zocor, an older drug available as a cheaper generic. Vytorin combines Zetia with Zocor. In fact, the situation became more dire for Schering on Sunday when an expert panel recommended doctors use Vytorin and Zetia only after trying other cholesterol medicines, further hurting shares of Schering and its partner on the drugs, Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) Some investors and analysts argue Schering shares have fallen too far, noting the company's line-up of new drugs that could reach the market and a strong patent position on existing medicines relative to other drugmakers. Those factors, combined with the low valuation, are reviving takeover talk for the New Jersey-based company. "Our view is the reaction to the Vytorin news has been dramatically overdone," said Chris Armbruster, an analyst with Al Frank Asset Management. "As value guys, we like to do the three-to-five-year outlook for these companies, and we think buying it now you'll be happy that you did a couple years out." Armbruster, who likes Schering Chief Executive Fred Hassan and applauds its recent deal for Dutch drugmaker Organon, said his firm would buy the stock until it reaches $18 a share and projects it will reach $29 in the next three to five years. Schering-Plough shares rose $1.54, or 11.1 percent, to $15.40 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange -- far off its 52-week high of $33.81 reached last May. Eldene Doyle, an analyst with Optique Capital Management, said the recent share drop is prompting her to examine Schering, which her fund owned early in Hassan's tenure. "I definitely think it's worth taking a look now," Doyle said. "We are value managers, and it's looking pretty good on most measures" such as price to earnings, and price to cash flow. Morgan Stanley analyst Jami Rubin called Schering-Plough stock "fundamentally undervalued," saying it "reflects the complete wipe-out of the Vytorin franchise." Rubin expects sales of Vytorin and Zetia, which combined for $5.2 billion in annual sales in 2007, to decline about 18 percent this year, including a 30 percent hit in the United States. She rates the stock "overweight" and sees the price heading to $20 over the next 12 to 18 months. Schering's stable of experimental medicines is also seen as favorable for the company's size, in comparison with other pharmaceutical companies. It includes a blood-clot preventer whose market potential could exceed $10 billion, according to Leerink Swann analysts. Natixis Bleichroeder analyst Jon LeCroy said that as of Wednesday, Schering-Plough traded at around a 41 percent discount to its pharmaceutical peers based on 2010 earnings. LeCroy believes the stock warrants a 23 percent premium to the pharmaceuticals group, based on its pipeline and relatively strong patent position. M&A TARGET Further fueling interest in Schering-Plough is that the severe stock drop could make it an acquisition target. Armbruster said Schering is a "digestible-sized company now," and mentions U.S. rivals Merck, Pfizer ( PFE.N ) and Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ), as well as European firms GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ) and Sanofi-Aventis ( SASY.PA ) as possible buyers. Schering has been frequent fodder for takeover rumors during the tenure of Hassan, who was at the helm of drugmaker Pharmacia when it was sold to Pfizer. Indeed, some analysts remained skeptical of whether the time is right to buy Schering-Plough shares. Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said the cost cuts fail to change the risk to Schering's profits from the cholesterol joint venture with Merck, which she said comprises 80 percent of Schering's total profits. The productivity plan also "reiterates that Schering-Plough is no longer a growth story, but a cost-cutting one," said Ryan, who rates the stock "hold." Hassan has defended Vytorin and Zetia, and contends the current challenges pale in comparison to those he faced when he took over in 2003, when the company was reeling from the patent expiration of its Claritin allergy pill and quality control problems at its plants. Under Hassan's tenure, Schering's stock gained some 80 percent through early December. But those gains are now gone. With the Vytorin-fueled collapse, the shares are down about 12 percent under Hassan. "The challenge we are addressing today is much more manageable than the one that we faced when I took on the leadership of Schering-Plough in 2003," Hassan said in a statement Wednesday night. "We powered through that challenge. We are determined to power through this one." (Additional reporting by Dan Burns; Editing by Maureen Bavdek,  Gary Hill )
