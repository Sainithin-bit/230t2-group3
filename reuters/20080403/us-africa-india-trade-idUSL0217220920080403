 (Reuters) - India will host its first India-Africa heads of state summit in New Delhi on April 8-9 as it tries to match China's ever-growing clout on the mineral-rich continent. 

 Below are some details of some Indian business interests in Africa. * INDIA-AFRICA PARTNERSHIP: -- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh called for a partnership between India and Africa when he visited Nigeria and South Africa last October. -- Singh's visit to Africa followed a similar tour by Chinese President Hu Jintao in 2006, signaling heightened competition between the Asian powers to secure access to resources and markets in the world's poorest continent. -- The Indian prime minister promised cooperation on many fronts including transferring technology to Africa. "The objective will not just be a quantitative increase in trade and investments, we will also aim at a qualitative enhancement of Africa's economic competitiveness and technological capabilities," Singh said. -- Nigeria is India's biggest trading partner in Africa, accounting for 11 percent of its oil imports. Bilateral trade is estimated at $7.9 billion, but Singh said many opportunities had yet to be explored. In September 2007, India's state-run Power Grid Corp. won a three-year contract to manage Nigeria's electricity grid. * INDIA/AFRICA PROJECT PARTNERSHIP: -- The Fourth India-Africa Project Partnership 2008 was organized last month by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in collaboration with the Export Import (EXIM) Bank of India and the government of India. -- The meeting discussed cross-border projects worth $10 billion in diverse sectors covering infotech, telecom, agribusiness, pharmaceuticals, healthcare, tourism, and others. -- The Exim Bank of India and Africa signed an agreement for a line of credit (LOC) of $30 million to be provided by the former to the latter to finance India's exports to Africa. The LOC will facilitate and boost India's exports to member states of Exim Bank of Africa. Exim Bank of India is a non-regional shareholder of Exim Bank of Africa. -- Over 450 business delegates from 33 African states, led by 35 ministers, attended the New Delhi event. -- The CII itself has Institutional Agreements with 32 counterpart organizations in 18 African countries to facilitate the exchange of information and promote business interests of Indian and African industry. * TRADE: -- During 2006-7 India's exports to Africa stood at $8.4 billion while imports recorded $11.4 billion. -- Exports to Africa are regionally diversified with East, Southern and West Africa accounting for $2.5-3 billion each. -- Although these figures encompass all sectors, agriculture, education and information technology have been identified as the main growth areas. * TECHNOLOGY: -- Ethiopia was selected as the first country to benefit from the pilot phase of the Pan-African E-network Project, a joint initiative between the Indian government and African Union (AU) to develop information communication technology (ICT) infrastructure across the continent. -- Last July, India launched a pilot project in Ethiopia connecting hospitals there with healthcare institutes in India. The tele-education programme will provide an opportunity for Ethiopian students to get higher education at low cost from top level Indian institutions. -- Under the initiative, India would donate $1 billion to connect 53 African countries through a satellite and fiber-optic networks to promote telemedicine and tele-education programmes.
