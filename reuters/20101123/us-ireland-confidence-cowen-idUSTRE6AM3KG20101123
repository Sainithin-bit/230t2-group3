 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish opposition party Sinn Fein submitted a motion of no confidence in damaged Prime Minister Brian Cowen on Tuesday, a day after he ruled out a snap election and refused to quit. 

 Pressure has grown on Cowen's government over its handling of the economic crisis and came to a head on Monday after junior coalition partners said they would only support the government until the 2011 budget was put into law early next year. "This Dail (parliament) should have been dissolved by the Taoiseach (prime minister) last night," Sinn Fein, a small, left-wing party with its roots in Irish nationalism, said in a statement. The motion needs 12 signatures to be debated. "Brian Cowen no longer commands a majority in the Dail. He should now put the issue to the test and allow a vote on the motion of no confidence which has been tabled by four Sinn Fein deputies," Sinn Fein added. The party has four MPs in the country's 166-seat lower house and is expected to gain a fifth in a by-election on Thursday, while the government has around half of the seats. It requires 12 signatures for a motion to be heard in the chamber and political analysts said it was unlikely the Sinn Fein motion would be debated by lawmakers. TALKING IN CORRIDORS Tom Kitt, backbench MP with Cowen's Fianna Fail party, who has called for Cowen to quit, said he would favor a change of leadership after the budget. He said no one had yet tried to court the 18 MPs required to table an internal motion of no confidence within the party. "People in Fianna Fail won't be dictated to by Sinn Fein in such an opportunistic way. We'll be determined to deal with these issues within our own party," Kitt told Reuters. "People are talking to each other in the corridors but there is no list circulating as of now. Everybody is totally focused on getting the budget through, including myself. That's an absolute requirement. Nobody wants to mess this up." Two Independent MPs, upon whom Cowen relies on to govern, signaled on Monday that they may withdraw their support from the administration because of its handling of the crisis. Cowen resisted calls on Monday for a snap election and said he would call an election early in the new year once a crucial rescue budget had been passed by parliament. Most commentators grudgingly support Cowen's decision, arguing that passing the budget so that Ireland can access international rescue funds was key.
