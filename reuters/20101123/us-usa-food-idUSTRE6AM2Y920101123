 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The weak U.S. economy is still shaping consumers' supermarket choices, helping bargain-priced food makers like Spam and Hormel chili, and hurting those like Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ), which has not discounted as deeply as some rivals. 

 Hormel Foods Corp ( HRL.N ) reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and forecast 2011 earnings above Wall Street estimates, helped by strong sales of its namesake chili, hash and pepperoni, Spam and Compleats microwave meals. "The weak consumer continues to gravitate toward Hormel's mainstream, value-added portfolio," said Janney Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Feeney. "Hormel was able to realize decent volume concomitant with hefty price increases ... to offset substantial cost inflation." Hormel said it expected to raise prices on some items by 3 percent to 4 percent to make up for higher expected costs for raw materials and grains. Meanwhile Campbell, which analysts say should be performing better because of high unemployment and cooler weather, posted a disappointing profit as discounts on rival brands outpaced its own promotions. According to government data released on Tuesday, the U.S. economy grew more than earlier estimated in the third quarter, but an October slump in sales of existing homes signaled the recovery is not complete. In Tuesday afternoon trading, Campbell shares were down 1.9 percent at $34.17, while Hormel rose 2.5 percent to $49.15. Sales of Campbell's condensed soups fell 1 percent, as an increase in soups used for cooking offset a drop in those meant to be eaten alone. Ready-to-serve soup sales fell 13 percent. The world's biggest soup maker, which competes with General Mills Inc's ( GIS.N ) Progresso line, warned earlier this month of weak results and cut its forecast. Campbell Chief Executive Douglas Conant acknowledged on a conference call that Progresso stepped up its promotions last month and saw a more than 40 percent increase in sales volume. "We're in a battle every day," Conant said. He also said consumers were changing how they shop. Soup has suffered from too much discounting and too little innovation, with consumers buying a lot of soup on sale and then stockpiling it, he said. "We've got to get out of the pantry, and we have to increase usage," said Conant, who will soon step down. "We're not going to do that through price promotion." Analysts were skeptical. Credit Suisse downgraded its rating on the shares to "underperform" from "neutral." The company, which has endured several weak soup seasons in a row, has discussed focusing more on the units that sell items like V8 juices and Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers. Campbell is likely to be invited to bid on Britain's biggest snack food company, United Biscuits, now that its private equity owners are opening up talks to new suitors, according to people familiar with the matter. HORMEL BENEFITS FROM PRODUCTS, DIVERSITY The results from Campbell and Hormel come one day after top meat producer Tyson Foods Inc ( TSN.N ) forecast 2011 sales above Wall Street estimates, helped by better export markets and higher prices for its prepared foods. Sales rose across Hormel's portfolio. The best were the Jennie-O Turkey Store unit, which benefited from higher turkey meat prices and lower feed costs, and the refrigerated foods segment, which sells deli meats and benefited from higher pork operating margins. "Consumers seem to be responding well to our value-added items, even ones that are not necessarily identified as being low-priced items," said Chief Executive Jeffrey Ettinger in an interview, citing strong sales of Hormel meat party trays. Hormel reported a profit of 90 cents per share for the fourth quarter ended on October 31, up from 77 cents a year earlier and above the analysts' average estimate of 79 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. [ID:nN23117814] Sales jumped 23 percent to $2.06 billion, topping analysts' estimates of $1.87 billion. The quarter included one more week than the year-earlier period and a larger-than-usual one-time hedging gain. Hormel expects 2011 earnings per share of $3.10 to $3.20. Analysts on average had forecast $3.05. Campbell's profit fell to 82 cents per share in the first quarter ended on October 31 from 87 cents a year earlier. Analysts were expecting 83 cents. Sales slipped 1.4 percent to $2.17 billion, missing analysts' expectations of $2.2 billion. It affirmed its newly lowered fiscal 2011 forecast. (Reporting by Martinne Geller.
