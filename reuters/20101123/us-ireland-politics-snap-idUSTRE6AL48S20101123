 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's coalition government is rapidly imploding and there is a risk a European/IMF bailout package would have to be postponed if a snap general election is called, re-igniting concerns about the stability of the euro zone. 

 Prime Minister Brian Cowen may not have a parliamentary majority to get the 2011 budget passed on December 7 after two independent MPs, upon whom he relies for votes in the lower chamber, withdrew their support. Cowen was holding an emergency meeting with cabinet ministers on Monday to discuss current uncertainty over the government's future, a source familiar with the talks told Reuters. Cowen's own junior coalition partners, the Greens, have called for a general election in late January but the odds on the administration lasting that long have narrowed considerably after the two main opposition parties rebuffed appeals for national consensus and called for an immediate poll. Here are some of the implications of the current political turmoil in Ireland: GOVERNMENT FALLS THIS WEEK; POLL WITHIN THREE WEEKS With his coalition unraveling and some members of his own party calling for his resignation, Cowen may stand down as prime minister as soon as this week and ask the president to dissolve parliament, triggering a general election. Even if he tries to hold firm he may also be forced out if opposition parties call a motion of no confidence in his government, forcing the hands of aggrieved backbench MPs and two independent MPs who have said they no longer support the administration. Elections could be held within three weeks of parliament being dissolved. However, a bailout deal with the EU/IMF would be likely to be delayed until a new administration was in place, unnerving investors and angering the EU and the European Central Bank, which want a swift solution to the Irish problem. MARKETS IMPACT External assistance for Ireland was meant to allay concerns about its financial position and prevent the threat of contagion to other euro zone countries destabilizing the currency bloc. Any delay in releasing the aid, which could be up to 90 billion euros, and a distracting election campaign will upset markets, putting pressure on the euro, fellow euro zone peripheral members Portugal and Spain, and Ireland's own borrowing costs. A delay in a resolution to their problems could also see Irish banks suffer further deposit outflows, increasing their dependence on ECB and Irish central bank funding. WOULD THE BAILOUT PACKAGE LOOK ANY DIFFERENT? The aid package from the IMF/EU would not be markedly different if the government changes. However, it would be delayed and any additional funding pressures on the banks because of that could affect the overall size of the package. The structure of the 2011 budget may also be slightly different. WHAT WOULD A NEW GOVERNMENT LOOK LIKE? A coalition of Fine Gael and Labour would probably form the next administration, with Fine Gael's leader Enda Kenny as prime minister and Michael Noonan as finance minister. A new government would keep to the same goal of trying to get the budget deficit under control by the end of 2014 but there would be disagreements over how to shrink the worst shortfall in Europe. Fine Gael supports Cowen's goal of 6 billion euros in adjustments for next year and an overall 15 billion euro program of adjustments in 2011-2014. Labour would prefer to see adjustments of 4.5 billion euros next year. While Fine Gael wants adjustments weighted toward spending cuts by a 3-to-1 ratio, Labour wants an even split of tax increases and spending cuts overall. WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO COWEN? Cowen is unlikely to lead the Fianna Fail party into the next general election. If he is forced to dissolve parliament this week then he may step down as leader. William Hill bookmakers have Foreign Minister Micheal Martin as the 4/5 favorite to replace Cowen as party leader.
