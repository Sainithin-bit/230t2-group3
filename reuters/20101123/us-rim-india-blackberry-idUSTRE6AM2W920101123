 MUMBAI  (Reuters) - BlackBerry maker Research in Motion is confident there will be no ban in India on its services, a senior RIM executive said on Tuesday. 

 "There is no ban on BlackBerry, we are confident that there will be no ban in the future," Robert Crow, a vice president at RIM, told reporters in New Delhi. India has threatened to shut off RIM's encrypted email and instant messaging services unless it gains access to them, in a campaign driven by fears that unmonitored communication puts the country's security at risk. "We are here for the long run," Crow said. (Reporting by  Devidutta Tripathy ; Editing by  Jui Chakravorty )
