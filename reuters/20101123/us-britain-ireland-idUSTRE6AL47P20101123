 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Britain has said it is willing to lend Ireland billions of pounds as part of European and IMF efforts to bail out the once thriving euro zone economy. 

 Below is a guide to how such assistance could be made: INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND HELP The exact contribution Britain would make to any IMF assistance depends on which type of loan facility the multilateral organization deploys, but the UK would be liable for something in the region of five percent of that help. EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILISATION MECHANISM Britain would contribute 13.6 percent of any offering made from this EU-wide fund which has a limit of 60 billion euros ($82.37 billion) for the financial period ending in 2013. That would translate into a maximum UK contribution of 8.16 billion euros. EUROPEAN FINANCIAL STABILITY FACILITY Britain would not take part in any tranche lent to Ireland from this euro zone crisis fund of 440 billion euros. BILATERAL AID British finance minister George Osborne says it is sensible to give bilateral aid to Ireland, on top of any multilateral assistance, because of the close ties between the British and Irish economies. However, bilateral aid is also a way for Britain to satisfy its European neighbors that it is playing a big enough part in the bail out without signing up to the euro zone initiatives that it wants to avoid. IMPACT ON UK PUBLIC FINANCES Britain will only take a public finance hit on its contributions to the IMF and EU bailouts if Ireland defaults on those loans. In that event, Britain would have to repay its chunk of any remaining loan -- i.e. 13.6 percent of any EU loan and about 5 percent of any IMF help. Otherwise, any involvement in multilateral assistance is regarded as a contingent liability and would not have an impact on government borrowing figures. Such liabilities are not recorded in the national accounts unless they are called upon. Bilateral assistance would also have no impact on headline UK borrowing figures as it would merely mean changing one asset -- cash -- into another asset -- loans. With a bilateral loan, the government's net cash requirement would rise, however, meaning more gilts would need to be issued. It would also increase public sector net debt, or the government's total stock of debt, much in the same way as the UK's own financial bailouts were classified as liabilities for overall debt purposes.
