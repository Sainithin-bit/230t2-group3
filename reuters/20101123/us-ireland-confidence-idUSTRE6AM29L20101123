 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Irish opposition party Sinn Fein said on Tuesday it had tabled a motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Brian Cowen. 

 "This Dail (parliament) should have been dissolved by the Taoiseach (Prime Minister) last night. Brian Cowen no longer commands a majority in the Dail. He should now put the issue to the test and allow a vote on the motion of no confidence which has been tabled by four Sinn Fein deputies," Sinn Fein said in a statement. Cowen resisted calls on Monday for a snap election and said he would call an election early in the new year once a crucial rescue budget had been passed by parliament.
