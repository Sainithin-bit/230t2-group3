 DUBLIN  (Reuters) - Ireland's government will have difficulty surviving long enough to pass next month's budget after two independent MPs on whom it depends threatened not to support it, the finance spokesman of the main opposition said on Monday. 

 Ireland's crucial 2011 budget now looks in doubt unless one of the main opposition parties backs the 6 billion euro package of cuts and tax rises. Michael Noonan said his Fine Gael party would discuss on Tuesday whether to support it or not. "We don't have a position at the minute. We are scattered all over the country in our own constituencies. We'll have a front bench meeting tomorrow and we'll address these issues," Noonan told Reuters in a telephone interview. "It seems to me that, as things progress, it's going to be difficult for the government to continue as far as budget day and maybe the best thing would be an immediate election." Earlier on Monday Fianna Fail's coalition partner, the Greens, said they would support the budget but then withdraw from the government, and demanded a January election. "This morning, nobody knew that the Greens were going to announce a pullout from government," Noonan said. "There was some speculation last week that the Dail (parliament) might not return in January but what happened this morning was unexpected, even by government ministers," he said.
