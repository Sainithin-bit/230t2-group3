 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy grew faster than previously estimated in the third quarter, government data showed on Tuesday, but still not enough to address stubbornly high unemployment. 

 KEY POINTS: * Gross domestic product growth was revised up to an annualized rate of 2.5 percent from 2.0 percent as exports, and consumer and government spending were stronger than initially thought, the Commerce Department said in its second estimate. * Economists had expected GDP growth, which measures total goods and services output within U.S. borders, to be revised up to a 2.4 percent pace. The economy expanded at a 1.7 percent rate in the second quarter. * There are signs activity picked up mildly as the fourth quarter started, but growth will likely remain below the 3.5 percent rate that economists say is needed to reduce a 9.6 percent unemployment rate. COMMENTS: HENRY SMITH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, HAVERFORD TRUST CO., PHILADELPHIA: "The deleveraging is still with us, but a lot of deleveraging has already taken place, so that headwind is much less going forward than it has been. Therefore we might be underestimating the impact on the consumer for 2011. Earlier this fall, we added some positions in the consumer discretionary area after a strong back-to-school season, which is often a harbinger for a good holiday season. "Monday morning, talking to a handful of colleagues who were at various shopping centers and malls, it was packed over this past weekend. "It feels like we're a long ways away from the fears of a double dip. In hindsight we went through a soft patch, and obviously, it didn't collapse. "If the Bush tax cuts do expire, that could take a bite out of the consumer." PAUL BALLEW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, NATIONWIDE, COLUMBUS, OHIO: "It's pretty consistent with the recovery we're feeling a little better about than we did in the spring, but certainly not a recovery that's sprinting forward at a rapid pace. "The consumer expenditure numbers gained the most notable increase, but that's largely been corroborated by other info we've seen the last few months, so not necessarily a big surprise. We thought we'd get an upward adjustment and we're seeing it. "On the flip side, we're still seeing some pretty big drags on economy, including residential investment, which is the ongoing challenge from housing." JOHN CANAVAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "While the numbers are a little better than expected, they wasn't so far out of line that it warranted a response. They weren't enough to divert attention from Korea and Europe." NIGEL GAULT, CHIEF U.S. ECONOMIST, IHS GLOBAL INSIGHT, LEXINGTON, MASSACHUSETTS: "It's better than expected. A little bit more momentum in sales. It wasn't inventories, which is good news. There was more business spending on software, that was one of the surprises, and consumer spending was better than expected. "I thought inventories were going to be revised up, but they weren't. You had positive surprises in spending to outweigh inventories. Hopefully we can carry that momentum into the fourth quarter. It's good news." BRIAN JONES, SENIOR ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK: "The headline number is in line with expectations, while the composition is generally more favorable than we had been expecting. "We still have a big inventory gap to work off, but it's not as large as the government assumed. Domestic demand is a little better than expected."
