 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. banking industry in the third quarter socked away its lowest level of loan-loss provisions since before the 2007-2009 credit crisis, boosting profits, but drawing a warning from a senior regulator. 

 Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Chairman Sheila Bair said banks should not cut reserves too quickly given the fragile economy. "Many institutions came into the recent crisis with inadequate reserve levels, and they need to exercise restraint in drawing them down now," she said. As the industry showed it was increasingly willing to do just the opposite, a new council of regulators designed to curb undue risk-taking by banks held its second meeting on Tuesday to focus on the complicated plumbing of the financial system. The FDIC's quarterly report card on the banking industry's performance showed both profit growth, which was partly due to reduced loan-loss provisions, and an increasing divergence between the nation's mega-banks and its smaller ones. The FDIC reported aggregate industry earnings rose to $14.5 billion in the third quarter versus $2 billion a year earlier. Profits would have been up sequentially from the second quarter, as well, if not for a massive charge-off recorded by the industry's largest player, Bank of America. The number of banks on the regulator's "problem list" hit its highest level since 1993, despite better loan performance, while loan-loss reserves fell for the first time since late 2006, mostly due to large banks' actions, the agency said. "Bair's comments are aimed primarily at mid-sized and smaller banks that have yet to show consistent credit quality improvement. This supports our broad thesis that the very large banks are improving much faster than the rest of the industry," said MF Global financial services analyst Jaret Seiberg. RISK COUNCIL GATHERS As head of the FDIC, Bair is a member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a new inter-agency panel of regulators created to keep an eye on precisely the sort of broad risk that might be posed by lower loan-loss reserves. The council held its second meeting on Tuesday, but it was not focused on banks. Rather, it voted to get the ball rolling on writing new standards for designating securities exchanges as "systemically important." The council was set up under sweeping banking and Wall Street reforms enacted in July. Almost four months since Democrats and President Barack Obama pushed through the reforms over the opposition of banks and Republicans, government regulators are consumed with the implementation of hundreds of new rules and regulations. Industry lobbyists are moving to soften the Dodd-Frank law at the implementation level, where Congress left reams of important details to be hammered out by federal authorities. The FSOC is empowered to tag certain organizations as "systemically important" to the stability of the economy. Firms thus labeled must answer to stricter oversight. The council last month began sketching out the criteria it will use for deciding which non-bank financial firms get named as "systemically important." It did the same on Tuesday for exchanges, clearinghouses and data repositories that are being set up for off-exchange derivatives trading. These institutions constitute the critical internal workings of the U.S. financial system. For them, the "systemically important" label also would bring access to the Federal Reserve's discount window during a liquidity crunch. The council, led by Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, has 10 voting members. It met behind closed doors on Tuesday, then held a brief open session later in the day.
