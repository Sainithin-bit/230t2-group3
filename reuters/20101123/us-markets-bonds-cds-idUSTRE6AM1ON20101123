 LONDON  (Reuters) - The cost of insuring Irish and Portuguese government debt against default rose on Tuesday as markets fretted over the impact of political uncertainty in Ireland on budget plans. 

 Ireland begins two nervous weeks of political maneuvering as the government dares the opposition to block an austerity budget on which a multi-billion euro EU/IMF bailout is riding. "This hasn't reassured investors, many of whom are doubtful that the coalition government can get the necessary measures through," said Markit analyst Gavan Nolan. Five-year credit default swaps (CDS) on Irish government debt rose 26 bps to 555 bps, according to data monitor Markit. This means it costs 555,000 euros to protect 10 million euros of exposure to Irish bonds. (Reporting by  William James )
