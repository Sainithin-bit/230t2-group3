 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Finance Minister Yoshihiko Noda said the government will strive to gain market trust in its public finances by passing the budget for the next fiscal year and outlining social security reforms as scheduled in the coming month. 

 "We will make sure our fiscal reform is on track and try to send a message to markets that we are sticking to fiscal discipline," Noda told reporters on Thursday. Ratings agency Standard & Poor's cut Japan's sovereign debt rating to AA minus from AA on Thursday, warning that Japan's government debt ratio would continue to rise more than it had previously expected. He added that he declined to comment directly on actions taken by private ratings agencies. (Reporting by Rie Ishiguro; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
