 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co ( CL.N ) posted slightly lower quarterly net income on Thursday as it spent more to promote new products and had lower sales and prices in North America. 

 Colgate, best known for its namesake toothpaste, earned $624 million, or $1.24 per share, in the fourth quarter, down from $631 million, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier. (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; editing by John Wallace)
