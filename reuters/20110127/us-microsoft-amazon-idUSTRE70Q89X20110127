 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's quarterly profit fell slightly as the world's largest software maker was hit by slower-than expected growth in computer sales. 

 And Amazon.com Inc posted a 36 percent rise in revenue -- just shy of analysts' targets -- on higher profit in its key holiday quarter. Commentary: Amazon: HAMED KHORSAND, ANALYST, BWS FINANCIAL "Looks like it was disappointing on the top line number. Operating margins improved slightly but not as much I was expecting. Seems like it was a competitive holiday season. "There were a lot of expectations the revenue number would be $13 billion and that just didn't happen. And going forward, it's going to be the revenue number and sustainable operating margins that what will dictate the share price." Microsoft: BRENDAN BARNICLE, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES "Outstanding numbers when you take a first look at it but when you delve into them, Windows missed expectations by $300 million. "The big surprise is huge strength in the Office business, $600 million above expectations. That is really being driven by the Office 10 release." COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC FINANCIAL "This company has got some momentum behind it. The core businesses have been setting records. They've got a nice, tight focus on their core marketplaces. They've got discipline in terms of cost controls and driving earnings. They're the best in the space in terms of returning cash to shareholders. "Basically, we've gotten over 300 million Windows 7 licenses sold. I mean, PCs are not disappearing. Put that into perspective with 7 million tablets sold last quarter from Apple. Clearly there are disruptions in the landscape, but some of the negative viewpoints are overblown." SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN "It seems like there is strength across the board. I think it's fair to say the Windows division numbers were light. The weakness in the consumer PC market has been widely known."
