 LONDON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Four large U.S. and European drugmakers unveiled cautious 2011 forecasts, as higher costs from U.S. healthcare reform will further hurt an industry grappling with patent expirations and pressure to curb prices. 

 The projections from Novartis ( NOVN.VX ), AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ), Eli Lilly ( LLY.N ) and Bristol-Myers Squibb ( BMY.N ) echoed disappointing outlooks earlier in the week from diversified healthcare companies Johnson & Johnson ( JNJ.N ) and Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ). Deutsche Bank analyst Barbara Ryan said drugmakers were being cautious with their 2011 forecasts because increasing costs of U.S. healthcare reform are not tax deductible, hitting the companies' bottom lines that much harder. Astra, which also announced a $4 billion share buyback, reckoned the impact of U.S. healthcare reform on sales would be close to $700 million in 2011. Its shares fell 1 percent. Eli Lilly said the impact would reduce 2011 revenue by $400 million to $500 million, while Bristol cited an overall hit of about $500 million in lost sales and fees. "The higher taxes are creating tougher sledding," Ryan said. Novartis shares dropped 2.4 percent on Thursday as the Swiss drugmaker missed forecasts with a 10 percent drop in fourth-quarter core earnings per share and said it expected 2011 sales to be lower. Shares of Lilly, which reported above-forecast fourth-quarter earnings, were up 1.3 percent in afternoon trading in New York. Bristol shares rose 1.5 percent even as its profit fell short of analysts' views. It affirmed a floor for its 2013 earnings. Analysts said the forecast, even though it represents a decline from 2011, was reassuring, given the expected onslaught from generics expected in 2013 to Bristol's top-selling Plavix blood-clot preventer. Amit Roy, an analyst at Nomura in London, said he sees pressure increasing as new medicines turn out to be little better than established or generic competitors. "We see less commercial potential for many of the drugs being launched now," Roy said. "They are not that differentiated from what is already out there." Figures from both Astra and Novartis were weak compared with 2010, when profits were boosted by windfall sales of H1N1 flu vaccines. "If you look at what we're facing in 2011, we have more headwinds than we did in 2010," Novartis Chief Executive Joe Jimenez said. "We don't have the benefit of H1N1 and we've got more cost containment coming from the U.S. as some of the healthcare reform costs kick in." Lilly's better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales and earnings were bolstered by favorable taxes and strong sales of its Cymbalta depression medicine. U.S. rival Bristol forecast roughly flat earnings this year, instead of the 3 percent growth Wall Street expected. Pfizer ( PFE.N ), Merck ( MRK.N ) and Roche ( ROG.VX ) are due to report quarterly results next week. PRICING PRESSURE Sales of Astra's Crestor cholesterol-lowering drug rose 24 percent in 2010 to $5.69 billion. But the blockbuster medicine could face tough competition late this year from cheaper generic forms of Pfizer's potent Lipitor. Astra Chief Financial Officer Simon Lowth said recent setbacks for several of the company's experimental drugs would likely put 2014 sales in the middle of its $28 billion-$34 billion forecast, rather than at the top end as it had previously hoped. Novartis said the initial demand for multiple sclerosis pill Gilenya was in line with its expectations, recording sales of $13 million since its launch in October. It also said its newest products, such as its generic version of Sanofi-Aventis' ( SASY.PA ) blood thinner Lovenox and cancer drug Tasigna, which Novartis hopes will replace the older blockbuster Glivec, performed well. Lilly faces the U.S. patent expiration of its top-selling Zyprexa schizophrenia medicine later this year, while its No. 2 product, anti-depressant Cymbalta, faces generics in mid-2013. Quarterly sales of Zyprexa fell 2 percent to $1.34 billion, while sales of Cymbalta rose 19 percent to $984 million. The profit picture for Bristol will deteriorate in May 2012 when it and partner Sanofi-Aventis lose U.S. marketing exclusivity on Plavix. Industry analysts are hopeful that Bristol's profits will rebound fairly quickly afterward, helped by highly promising experimental medicines now in late stages of testing.
