 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Standard and Poor's Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on Japan to AA-minus from AA, citing worries that Japan's government debt ratios would continue to rise. 

 Below are some quotes from Japanese policymakers and business executives on the rating cut: JAPAN PRIME MINISTER NAOTO KAN "This is the first I've heard of this. I just came from a plenary session in parliament and I'm not very familiar with the matter, so please ask me about it later." FINANCE MINISTER YOSHIHIKO NODA: "We are aiming to pass the budget and budget-related bills (through parliament) by the end of the current fiscal year. We will also map out a plan on social welfare and tax reform, including the sales tax, in June. "At these turning points it's important to send the message that we will stick to fiscal discipline to win market confidence." Asked about the yen's fall after the downgrade he declined to comment directly but said: "Currencies make various moves every day." ECONOMIC MINISTER KAORU YOSANO "It's regrettable that the world's leading ratings agency has made such a judgment, but S&P probably has its own basis for making such a judgment. "First, outstanding debt is increasing, and second, the Kan cabinet's stance to tackle fiscal restoration has not been fully understood ... "Prime Minister Kan is trying to restore public finances through an overhaul of the tax and social security systems, so I hope the world will understand the Japanese government's sincere efforts toward fiscal restoration through social security and tax reforms. "I believe confidence in Japan will not be shaken." CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY YUKIO EDANO "I want to refrain from commenting on ratings by private rating agencies. "We want to continue, strengthen our efforts to maintain fiscal discipline and pursue fiscal reform to maintain market confidence. "The prime minister has always been very conscious of maintaining confidence in Japanese government debt, and is always watching bond yield moves very closely. "He has a keen interest in the (market's) confidence in Japanese government bonds ... It is important for us to pursue the fiscal reforms that are outlined in our fiscal management strategy ... "If we explain thoroughly to other political parties the importance, to the economy and to society, of passing the budget and related bills as soon as possible, I think we can gain their understanding." NOMURA HOLDINGS CHAIRMAN JUNICHI UJIIE, at Davos "(The downgrade) was not a big surprise. But in that way it will make it easier for Yosano to push through laws on fiscal reform. "Foreign investors might short-sell but they don't hold very much -- only around five percent ... I don't expect turmoil in the bond market." TAKAHIRA OGAWA, HEAD OF S&P'S ASIAN SOVEREIGN RATINGS TEAM, in teleconference: "If social security and tax reform plans are compiled and show a good chance that fiscal reforms will take place in the mid- to long-term, then this could ease downward pressure on ratings or could add upward pressure. "But on the other hand, if fiscal reforms are put off for some reason or if government spending increases and fiscal debt does not fall or even rises, then there could be pressure for a downgrade. "There is also the macroeconomy. If macroeconomic conditions improve in the mid- to long-term and the economy can grow more than now, then the favorable conditions would be positive for the fiscal situation. "But on the other hand, if macroeconomic growth becomes lower than we expect, then there would be downward pressure." (Reporting by  Leika Kihara ; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
