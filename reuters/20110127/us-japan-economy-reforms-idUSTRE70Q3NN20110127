 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Standard & Poor's downgrade of Japan's debt could be a blessing in disguise for Prime Minister Naoto Kan as he tries to tackle tax reforms to curb huge public debt while dodging calls to quit or call a snap poll. 

 S&P cut its rating on Japan's long-term sovereign debt by one notch to AA minus on Thursday and economists warned the consequences could be felt worldwide if Japan failed to get its fiscal house in order. Kan, who took office last June as Japan's fifth premier since 2006, has made social security and tax reform, including a future rise in the 5 percent sales tax, his priorities this year and is urging opposition parties to join in talks on the topics. Earlier this month, he drafted ex-finance minister Kaoru Yosano, a fiscal hawk who had been among the ruling Democratic Party's (DPJ) harshest critics, to help push those efforts. But with Kan's voter support sagging at around 30 percent, opposition parties who control parliament's upper house have been disinclined to compromise -- though many agree a sales tax rise is both necessary and inevitable. "This makes it easier for Kan, in the sense that something must be done (about fiscal reform). It gives a tailwind to Yosano and makes his policies easier to justify," said Tomoaki Iwai, a professor at Nihon University in Tokyo. "In that sense, it is a plus." Nomura Holdings Chairman Junichi Ujiie, speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, echoed that view. "(The downgrade) was not a big surprise. But it will make it easier for Yosano to push through laws on fiscal reform," he said. Yosano said the downgrade should serve as a call to action. The government, he said, was serious about fiscal reform and the sales tax was lower than that of other countries. "(S&P) thinks we have a weapon we are not using," he said. "The downgrade is a demand for us to act quickly." FIRST, THE BUDGET Whether Kan seizes the moment, however, remains in doubt. Asked by reporters to comment on the downgrade, Kan said: "This is the first I've heard of this. I just came from a plenary session in parliament and I'm not very familiar with the matter, so please ask me about it later." Kan's first challenge is to persuade opposition parties to help enact budget-related bills needed to implement a record $1 trillion budget for the 2011/12 fiscal year from April 1. Opposition parties control parliament's upper house, where they can block bills, although the budget itself can be enacted after approval by the lower house, where the DPJ has a majority. Some pundits have said Kan might be forced to resign or even call a snap election if the budget-related bills get stuck. The biggest opposition group, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), is talking tough to try to force an early general election. The No. 2 opposition party, New Komeito, has criticized the budget, but left the door open to vote for related bills. "If they simply keep opposing everything, the public will get angry," Iwai said. "The opposition are also in a pinch. They can't compromise immediately because debate has just begun, but voters are tired of the confusion." The S&P downgrade could help persuade the opposition to join talks on tax and social welfare reform, although probably not until after nationwide local elections in April. "Public opinion might actually get more critical of the LDP for being obstructionist," said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano. "This might help get the opposition to the table." The ratings move could also give Kan ammunition against his critics inside the DPJ, who argue the party should keep campaign promises to give consumers more cash to boost growth and shun tax hikes until more effort has been made to cut waste. "This is, of course, just one piece of news from S&P and it won't resolve all of the policy differences in the DPJ, but Kan needs helpful news and this might be something in his favor," Nakano said.
