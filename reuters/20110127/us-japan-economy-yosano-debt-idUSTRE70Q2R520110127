 TOKYO  (Reuters) - A ratings downgrade of Japan by S&P on Thursday is a demand for the government to take action on sales tax, said Economics Minister Kaoru Yosano, an advocate of raising the tax to address fiscal woes. 

 Ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Japan's sovereign debt rating earlier on Thursday, cutting its rating to AA minus from AA. (Reporting by Yuko Yoshikawa; Editing by  Joseph Radford )
