 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders for U.S. manufactured goods fell unexpectedly by 2.5 percent in December on a huge drop in civilian aircraft orders, a government report showed on Thursday. 

 When volatile transportation orders were stripped out, durable goods orders rose 0.5 percent, the Commerce Department said, though this was a smaller rise than expected. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting durables orders excluding transportation to gain 0.8 percent. Civilian aircraft orders fell 99.5 percent. Capital goods orders excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending, rose 1.4 percent in the month, slightly less than the 1.5 percent rise expected by analysts.
