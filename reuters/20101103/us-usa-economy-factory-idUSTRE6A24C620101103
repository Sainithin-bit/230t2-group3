 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders received by U.S. factories rose more-than-expected in September to post their largest gain in eight months, according to a report on Wednesday that offered more evidence manufacturing continued to expand. 

 The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent after being flat in August. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rebounding 1.6 percent in September from a previously reported 0.5 percent fall in August. There have been fears that manufacturing, which is leading the economy's sluggish recovery from its longest recession since the 1930s, was slowing sharply, but these concerns continue to be allayed by both regional and national factory surveys. Data this week showed the Institute for Supply Management's index of national factory activity rose in October to its highest level since May. In September, orders excluding transportation rose 0.4 percent after a 1.3 percent increase in August, the Commerce Department said. But orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, seen as a measure of business confidence, slipped 0.2 percent after increasing 5.1 percent in August. Unfilled orders at U.S. factories increased 1.0 percent in September, the largest rise since March 2008, after a 0.2 percent gain in August. Shipments rose 0.4 percent in September after a small decline in August, while inventories for manufactured durable goods were up for the ninth successive month. That left the inventories-to-shipment ratio, a measure of how long it would take to deplete current stocks, unchanged at 1.27 months' worth. The department revised durable goods orders for September to show a 3.5 percent increase rather than the previously reported 3.3 percent gain. Excluding transportation, orders for durable goods fell a smaller 0.4 percent in September instead of 0.8 percent. (Reporting by  Lucia Mutikani ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
