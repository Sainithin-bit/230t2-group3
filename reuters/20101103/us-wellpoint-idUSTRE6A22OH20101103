 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc ( WLP.N ) posted slightly higher net income on Wednesday, helped by administrative cost controls, and raised its full-year forecast for profit and membership. 

 Net income rose to $739.1 million, or $1.84 per share, from $730.2 million, or $1.53 per share, a year earlier. The largest U.S. health insurer by membership projected net income of "at least" $6.60 per share for 2010, or at least $6.45 excluding items. It previously projected at least $6.30.
