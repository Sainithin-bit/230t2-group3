 LONDON  (Reuters) - Antonio Horta-Osorio likes to swim with sharks in his spare time. That could be a valuable asset as he takes the helm at Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ), partly owned by the government and facing the threat of a breakup. 

 One of Europe's most respected bankers, Horta-Osorio has been poached from Santander ( SAN.MC ), where he was head of its UK bank. He will take the helm in March in what is a coup for Lloyds, Europe's fourth biggest bank, which has been on the hunt for a new CEO for eight weeks. "It is an exciting appointment. He has a track record, he comes in to run the biggest UK retail bank and will give real momentum to it," said Chris Wheeler, banking analyst at Mediobanca in London. It is believed Santander were keen to keep him, and viewed him as a future group chief executive. But there may not be a vacancy at the top of the Spanish bank for several years, and Horta-Osorio is ready for the challenge now. The Portuguese, 46, has taken a cut in base salary to do so -- his base pay will be about 1 million pounds -- but he could earn over 8 million pounds in cash and long-term awards for next year if he hits all the performance targets. He was paid about 3.5 million pounds by Santander last year. Horta-Osorio told reporters that Lloyds was "probably the only bank in Europe" he would have left Santander for, and said part of the reason was a love of London. "I really like the UK, the culture, the diversity, the people ... we want to stay here for the foreseeable future," he told reporters on Wednesday. He is married with three children. His challenges include fully integrating HBOS, the lender bought by Lloyds in late 2008 that saddled it will billions of pounds of bad loans. He also needs to fight off the threat of a break-up by an independent banking commission looking at whether Britain's banks are too powerful. With about a quarter of current accounts and mortgages, Lloyds is at risk when the panel reports late next year. Lloyds faces political interference too, but Horta-Osorio has dealt smoothly with politicians, at times last year even charming hard-nosed lawmakers on Britain's Treasury Select Committee, a panel who regularly grilled bankers. "He came across as very confident and in full command of his brief, and aware of the wider social elements associated with banking," John McFall, who headed the TSC until earlier this year, told Reuters on Wednesday. SCUBA PASSION Horta-Osorio's shark swims are a result of a passion for scuba diving, including some cage dives off the coast of South Africa with great whites. He's also a keen and serious tennis player. After joining Abbey in 2004 and taking over as CEO in August 2006, he bulked up by swooping on Alliance & Leicester and the savings business of Bradford & Bingley at knock-down prices when they hit trouble during the financial crisis, and added a further 318 branches from Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ) this year. That set Santander's UK arm up to be listed separately next year, potentially in competition with the start of Britain's sale of its Lloyds stake. A graduate of management and business from Universidade Catolica Portuguesa and with an MBA from business school INSEAD Horta-Osorio started his career at CitiBank ( C.N ) in Portugal, where he became head of capital market for Portugal. He worked for Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) for two years in New York and London, focusing on corporate finance activities in Portugal. He joined Santander in 1993, and ran operations in Portugual and Brazil before arriving in Britain, just after squeezing in an advanced management program (AMP) at Harvard, an 8-week intensive course for senior managers. He is also a non-executive director to the Court of The Bank of England. (Editing by Louise Heavens)
