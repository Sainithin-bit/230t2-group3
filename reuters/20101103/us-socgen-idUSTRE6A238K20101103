 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) said it would not need a capital increase to meet tougher industry rules and posted forecast-beating quarterly profit, calming investor fears over its financial firepower. 

 Stung during the financial crisis by toxic asset losses and the Jerome Kerviel trading scandal, SocGen is now ahead of its 2010 profit guidance and the business environment should stay similar in the coming quarters, the bank's chief said. "(SocGen) is delivering the rebound it promised for 2010...We will be able to meet Basel III (capital requirements) without a capital increase," Chief Executive Frederic Oudea said on a conference call on Wednesday. The group's shares rose over 4 percent. The market turnaround since the crisis and a solid French economy have boosted SocGen results this year, although lingering fears it may need a cash call had led its shares to underperform. Oudea, who took the reins of the bank at the tail-end of the crisis in 2009, said he would steer SocGen to an estimated core capital ratio of 7.5 percent by January 2013 -- six years ahead of Basel's deadline for a new minimum of 7 percent. SocGen said its core Tier 1 ratio would then rise to 8.5 percent by the end of 2013. "The most important thing from our point of view is the added (capital) disclosure," MF Global analyst Shailesh Raikundlia said. "They've given quite a detailed breakdown on how it's going to evolve over the next two to three years." Banks from Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain have tapped investors for fresh equity in what is being dubbed a "solvency race" as consolidation heats up and tighter capital requirements loom. Switzerland and Britain are likely to impose requirements above the Basel minimum on their banks but so far French policymakers have struck a dovish tone, saying they need to balance the needs of the wider economy. "Fears of a capital increase are clearly, finally, fading away," CM-CIC analyst Pierre Chedeville wrote in a note. CONFIDENT OUTLOOK, RECOVERY "HESITANT" SocGen is confident it will meet its long-term financial targets despite a "hesitant" economic recovery, Oudea said, adding that the turnaround in the United States appeared more uncertain than in France and Germany. SocGen shares rose 4.2 percent to 43.88 euros by 1140 GMT, outpacing an 0.8 percent firmer European banking sector .SX7P. The bank reported a year-on-year doubling of third-quarter net profit to 896 million euros ($1.25 billion), higher than the 793 million average estimate in a Reuters poll of 14 analysts. Revenue met forecasts at 6.3 billion. SocGen benefited from a more benign risk environment than a year ago, leading to lower loan-loss provisions, particularly in French and international retail banking. Group provisions fell by almost 40 percent, to 918 million, in the quarter. The "cost of risk," or burden of provisions, should decline progressively in the coming quarters, Oudea told reporters. The Russian market, one that is key to SocGen's strategy over the next few years, posted an improved performance in retail banking for the third quarter. Retail helped offset the impact of capital markets' sluggishness on corporate and investment banking, where profit fell 9.7 percent, weighed down by its capital markets unit. A tough environment for investment banking in the quarter hurt rivals Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ), Japan's Nomura ( 8604.T ) and America's Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ). Larger French rival BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) is due to report earnings on Thursday. The two banks have been at loggerheads for a decade as BNP has swallowed several major acquisitions and fueled speculation SocGen cannot survive without a big merger. But SocGen is confident it will stay independent and hit long-term financial targets under Oudea. KERVIEL SHOCKWAVES Commenting on the French public's apparent sympathy for ex-trader Kerviel, who was fined 4.9 billion euros and sentenced to three years in jail for market bets that nearly sank SocGen, Oudea said many reactions had been in "bad faith." The record fine outraged many politicians and the public, undermining SocGen's bid to make a fresh start and giving Kerviel a springboard of support for an appeal. "I was surprised, often shocked, by everything that I heard (after the verdict)," Oudea told the conference call. Oudea has worked hard to restore morale among employees that took a hit when the Kerviel scandal broke in early 2008. On Wednesday the bank announced a new share distribution plan for 161,000 employees across 80 countries. SocGen shares are down around 14 percent year-to-date, worse than a 6 percent drop for the STOXX Europe 600 bank index. SocGen has a market value of around 31.8 billion euros.
