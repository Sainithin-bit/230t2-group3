 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - MGM Resorts International ( MGM.N ), which warned last month that business at its Las Vegas casino-hotels remained soft, reported a narrower loss for the third quarter, sending its shares up 5.5 percent. 

 "We continue to see the Las Vegas market stabilizing, Aria's operating performance is ramping up, and MGM Macau reported a record quarter," Chairman and Chief Executive Jim Murren said in a statement. Aria is the casino resort at the company's flagship $8.5 billion CityCenter on the Las Vegas Strip, a joint venture with Dubai World DBWLD.UL. The latest results included another writedown of CityCenter, a high-end complex known for its clean, modern lines rather than the neon and glitter of the Strip. CityCenter has struggled as recession-battered consumers and businesses have cut back on travel and gambling. MGM owns 10 Las Vegas Strip resorts as well as casino-resorts in Mississippi and Michigan and joint ventures in New Jersey and China's Macau. "I think the Street is still not really confident about a Vegas recovery," said ITG Investment Research analyst Matthew Jacob. "A company like MGM that relies on Vegas is still viewed as not positioned as well as say Las Vegas Sands ( LVS.N ), which has Singapore to point to, or even Wynn (Wynn Resorts ( WYNN.O )), which is positioned better in Asia." Wynn, which is less reliant on its Las Vegas operations, on Tuesday said it believes the Vegas market has reached a bottom. MGM said it is moving forward with acceptance of a bid for its 50 percent stake in the Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, after partner Boyd Gaming Corp ( BYD.N ) said it is not interested in acquiring the whole property. MGM valued the bid, which sources said came from buyout firm Leonard Green & Partners, at just over $250 million. MGM said in January that it planned to divest the stake after New Jersey regulators objected to the suitability of Pansy Ho, the company's partner in a separate venture in Macau. MGM's Macau joint venture filed last month for an anticipated initial public offering in Hong Kong. MGM's third-quarter net loss narrowed to $318 million, or 72 cents a share, from $750.4 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the loss was 21 cents a share. On that basis, analysts on average were expecting a loss of 23 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue, excluding reimbursed costs, fell 3 percent to $1.5 billion. "Things may be improving, but probably a little more slowly than investors had been expecting," Jacob said. Shares of MGM were up 62 cents at $11.77 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
