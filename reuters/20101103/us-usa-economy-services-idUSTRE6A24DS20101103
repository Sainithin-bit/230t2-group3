 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector grew more quickly than expected in October, according to an industry report released on Wednesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index rose to 54.3 from 53.2 in September. That was above the 53.5 median forecast of 69 economists polled by Reuters. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the non-manufacturing sector, which comprises mostly service sector firms and accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. (Reporting by  Steven C.
