 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. services sector grew more quickly than expected in October, according to a report released on Wednesday by the Institute for Supply Management. 

 New orders received by U.S. factories rose more-than-expected in September to post their largest gain in eight months, according to a report that offered more evidence manufacturing continued to expand. KEY POINTS: * The Institute for Supply Management said its non-manufacturing index rose to 54.3 from 53.2 in September. That was above the 53.5 median forecast of 69 economists polled by Reuters. * A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the non-manufacturing sector, which comprises mostly service sector firms and accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. * The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent after being flat in August. * Economists polled by Reuters had forecast factory orders rebounding 1.6 percent in September from a previously reported 0.5 percent fall in August. COMMENTS: SEAN INCREMONA, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "(ISM services) looks good, production rebounded, new orders are up and employment even came up a little bit from last month. So, in front of the Fed the data is looking a little bit more positive but there are still some uncertainties. "We did see (in factory orders) that aircraft seemed to be a special factor with a strong rebound there -- it is a very volatile component. Underlying it looks pretty stable. "I doubt that this is going to change the Fed's view much, but looking forward if things aren't getting worse, but they are staying the same or improving a bit that could play into what they may do down the road." GREG SALVAGGIO, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING, TEMPUS CONSULTING, WASHINGTON: "The data reinforces the fact that the U.S. economy is bottoming, if not gradually beginning to recover. The ADP earlier this morning showed some modest job gains. Factory orders and ISM non-manufacturing both showed slight gains, pretty much in line with what everyone is saying that the U.S. economy might be in this wide shape U right now and we're obviously at the bottom of the U in the recovery." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO: "Another good piece of the puzzle coming in today as was the morning (employment) news but we have to reflect that stocks have had a pretty nice gain in the past two months and I guess expectations for another couple of percent this month - we are already up 1 percent this month; we're with a couple of percent off the highs from April, and we have the news item (FOMC policy statement) this afternoon, so there's some hesitation to react to news given this backdrop." DAVID KEATOR, PARTNER IN THE KEATOR GROUP, A WEALTH MANAGEMENT FIRM IN LENOX, MASSACHUSETTS: "The ISM was the strongest indicator for me. I think people have kind of missed the fact that the economy is a lot stronger than pundits give it credit for. Last month's revisions are also positive, and that's an indicator that the economy is slowly getting stronger. I'm getting quite bullish right now. "People sort of missed the manufacturing ISM number the other day, along with MasterCard's ( MA.N ) results, both of which were phenomenally bullish indicators for the market. But today we're seeing some profit taking after the election. There's also caution ahead of the Fed, since I don't think they have necessarily telegraphed what they're going to do. They could be more moderate in their approach, and there's been a tremendous run-up in the market since the end of the August. No one is going in whole hog right now." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stocks remained little changed after the data. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices were steady at higher levels. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar extended gains versus euro.
