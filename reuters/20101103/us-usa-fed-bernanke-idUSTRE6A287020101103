 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, fresh from announcing new measures to support the U.S. economy, said the central bank's aggressive monetary policy will not spark unwanted inflation in the future. 

 Bernanke, in an opinion piece to be published on Thursday in the Washington Post, argued that the bigger risks facing the country right now are an unemployment rate that remains too high and inflation readings that are uncomfortably low. "Inflation that is too low can pose risks to the economy - especially when the economy is struggling. In the most extreme case, very low inflation can morph into deflation, which can contribute to long periods of economic stagnation," Bernanke wrote. "Even absent such risks, low and falling inflation indicate that the economy has considerable spare capacity, implying that there is scope for monetary policy to support further gains in employment without risking economic overheating."
