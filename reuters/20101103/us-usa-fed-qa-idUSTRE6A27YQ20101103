 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve pulled the trigger on another round of government bond purchases on Wednesday in an attempt to boost the struggling U.S. economy. 

 The move follows weeks of intense market anticipation -- but in case you missed it, or wonder what the fuss is about, here's a primer on the Fed's move. WHAT IS QE2? "QE2" is market jargon for the second big round of Fed long-term asset purchases -- also known as quantitative easing -- announced on Wednesday. In essence the Fed is printing money and buying government debt, hoping to drive down borrowing costs further after having already cut benchmark U.S. interest rates to near zero. The Fed said it will buy another $600 billion of Treasury bonds as part of this program between now and June next year. That's on top of the $250 billion to $300 billion that the Fed is going to reinvest from maturing debt from its first round of quantitative easing over that period. In round one, which wrapped up in March, the Fed bought $1.7 trillion of mortgage-related and Treasury debt. WHY DOES THE FED THINK IT NEEDED TO DO MORE? The Fed thinks the unemployment rate is too high and inflation is "somewhat low" relative to what it deems consistent with its dual mandate of price stability and full employment over the long run. There's also the worry that slowing inflation could ultimately slide into an economically troubling deflation, a sustained period of falling prices that could deter consumers from spending and businesses from investing. HOW LONG WILL THE PROGRAM LAST? The Fed says it will buy the $600 billion by the end of the second quarter of 2011 -- or about $75 billion a month. It said it will regularly review the pace and size of the program and adjust it as needed to achieve its economic goals. HOW WILL IT WORK? Fed officials disagree on how it will work and how effective it will be. Some officials say it will primarily work by lowering yields on U.S. Treasuries, pushing investors into more risky assets in a move that will lower rates more widely. Lower U.S. borrowing costs could stimulate home buying and building, business investment and, ultimately, hiring. The $1.7 trillion of purchases of securities lowered long-term borrowing costs by around half a percentage point, according to the Fed and other analysts. New York Fed President William Dudley estimated that $500 billion of purchases would likely have about the same impact as a 0.5 or 0.75 percentage point decline in benchmark overnight lending rates. But those estimates are highly uncertain, and there is even less evidence on how it feeds into the broader economy. Other officials say further asset purchases could work primarily by raising inflation expectations and bolstering confidence by signaling to markets the Fed's commitment not to let prices fall. Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher has argued that regulatory and fiscal uncertainty -- not interest rates -- is hindering business activity, putting the ball in the government's court. Some officials, including most vocally Minneapolis Fed President Narayana Kocherlakota, have argued that a sizable part of the unemployment problem is due to a skills mismatch, which monetary policy is not suited to address. WHAT ARE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROGRAM? Some Fed officials, including Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser, have voiced concern about the possibility the Fed's credibility could be damaged if it launches fresh action and is not successful in lowering the unemployment rate. He and others also worry about distorting markets and laying the groundwork for future inflation by complicating the Fed's eventual exit from its accommodative policies. There is also a concern that some investors might interpret the Fed's purchases as a monetization -- or inflating away -- of the national debt. Kansas City Fed President Thomas Hoenig, who has dissented against the Fed's easy policy at every meeting this year, did so again in November. Hoenig said on October 25 that more easing would be a "dangerous gamble" that could make financial markets "frothy" and bring about another crisis. Another concern is that purchases of long-term assets would expose the Fed to potential losses once the economy recovers and interest rates rise. WHAT ARE THE GLOBAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE PROGRAM? Expectations of fresh bond buying by the Fed have pushed investors overseas in search of higher returns in recent weeks, weakening the U.S. dollar. This flood of capital has driven up asset prices in emerging markets and strengthened other currencies. Resentment about the global spillover effects of U.S. monetary policy is likely to hang over next week's summit of the Group of 20 leading economies in Seoul. German Economy Minister Rainer Bruederle on October 23 took issue with what he called a U.S. policy that indirectly manipulated exchange rates. HOW DID THE MARKETS REACT? If one word is called for: Volatile. U.S. stocks fell after a brief pop higher in volatile trading. The U.S. dollar fell against the euro but rose against the yen. Medium-term U.S. Treasury debt prices rose after the Federal Reserve said it would buy assets to stimulate the economy and focus on Treasuries with an average duration of five to six years.
