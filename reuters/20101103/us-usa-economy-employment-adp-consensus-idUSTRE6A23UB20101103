 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The consensus estimate for overall U.S. non-farm payrolls to rise 60,000 in October, with the report to be released on Friday is "easily doable"," Macroeconomic Advisers LLC chairman Joel Prakken said on Wednesday. 

 U.S. private employers added  a higher-than-expected 43,000 jobs in October after a revised loss of 2,000 in September. Prakken was speaking to a teleconference of journalists after the ADP Employer Services report on private sector employment, which his firm jointly developed. He described Wednesday's ADP release as "modestly encouraging" with the service producing sector adding 77,000 jobs, particularly in small and medium-size businesses. "It's encouraging to see the services sector coming like this," said Prakken. However the goods producing sector lost 34,000 jobs with a decline of 12,000 payrolls in the manufacturing sector. Friday's report is expected to show overall nonfarm payrolls rose 60,000 in October, according to Reuters poll. (Reporting by Nick Olivari. Editing by W Simon)
