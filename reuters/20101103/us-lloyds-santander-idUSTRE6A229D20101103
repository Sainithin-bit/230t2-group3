 LONDON  (Reuters) - Antonio Horta-Osorio, the head of Santander's British unit, is set to leave the Spanish bank to become chief executive of British bank Lloyds, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. 

 Horta-Osorio is a highly respected banker who had been seen as a potential candidate to take the helm of the Spanish bank. Part-nationalized Lloyds is Europe's fourth biggest bank by market value, and has been searching for a replacement to take over from CEO Eric Daniels next year. Both Santander and Lloyds declined to comment. (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by  Douwe Miedema )
