 LONDON  (Reuters) - British Airways BAY.L carried 3.9 percent more passengers in October compared with a year earlier, helped by premium travel growth, and won a court ruling backing cabin crew contract changes, it said on Wednesday. 

 BA said it carried 2.95 million passengers last month, up on the 2.76 million in October 2009, but its load factor -- a measure of how well it fills its planes -- fell 1 percentage point to 79.8 percent. It said first and business-class travel -- the most profitable part of its passenger business -- rose 4.6 percent, while non-premium traffic was up 3.7 percent. Shares in BA, which have risen around 50 percent this year, were 0.04 percent lower at 272.9 pence by 1441 GMT, valuing the business at around 3.15 billion pounds ($5 billion). The FTSE All Share index  .FTAS  was up 0.09 percent. BA's first and business-class traffic has risen steadily in recent months as companies, which cut travel costs during the recession, increasingly book pricier seats. Earlier on Wednesday, a London court ruled that BA did not breach contracts when it reduced staffing levels on flights from Heathrow, Britain's biggest airport, last year. BA cabin crew took their case to the Court of Appeal after London's High Court refused to grant them an injunction to prevent BA making the cuts. However, the Court of Appeal backed the earlier ruling. "We are pleased with the judgment, confirming that the modest changes we made to onboard crew numbers on flights from Heathrow 12 months ago were reasonable, did not breach crew contracts, and can remain in place," BA said. BA, which is embroiled in a long-running dispute with the union representing its cabin crew, could face more industrial action over the coming weeks, with the Unite union due to ballot members over a fresh wave of strikes this week or next. Brendan Barber, the general secretary of Britain's Trades Union Congress, said he hoped BA and Unite were close to reaching an agreement, which would put an end to the dispute. "There are now new proposals that the union have indicated that they will be putting to their members in a new ballot," told the Foreign Press Association on Wednesday. "They are just completing some final details of the package that the company have now indicated they are prepared to make available," he said, adding he expected it would go to a ballot soon. "I am hopeful that that might now provide the basis for a settlement." ($1=.6233 Pound) (Additional reporting by  Adrian Croft  and  Keith Weir ; Editing by Sharon Lindores)
