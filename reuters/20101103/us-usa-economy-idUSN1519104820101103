 WASHINGTON/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. data on Wednesday showed a slow-paced economic recovery was beginning to gain some momentum, even as the Federal Reserve launched fresh action to spur growth and create jobs. 

 Private employers added more jobs than expected in October after laying off workers the previous month, while the dominant services sector expanded for a 10th straight month. A third report showed orders received by domestic factories increased in September by the largest margin in eight months. "We are slowly moving in the right direction. Even though we are seeing some private hiring pick up, we need businesses to push even harder on the  accelerator, we have a long ways to go," said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester Pennsylvania. Disappointment with progress toward lowering unemployment was a factor behind the Fed's decision on Wednesday to inject an additional $600 billion into the economy through government bond purchases by the  middle of next year. The U.S. central bank, which aims to push borrowing costs lower, had already bought about $1.7 trillion in U.S. government debt and mortgage-linked bonds after cutting overnight interest rates to near zero in December 2008. Voter disenchantment over the 9.6 percent unemployment rate saw the Republican Party seizing control of the House of Representatives in elections on Tuesday that were viewed as a referendum on President Barack Obama's economic policies. PRIVATE SECTOR ADDS MORE JOBS Last month, private employers added 43,000 jobs, more than twice as many as expected, according to payrolls processor ADP Employer Services. September's job losses were revised to 2,000 from the 39,000 originally reported. Separately, the Institute for Supply Management said its index of non-manufacturing activity rose to 54.3 last month from 53.2 in September. A figure above 50 signals expansion. The data had little impact on financial markets, which took their cue from details of the Fed's fresh monetary easing, which largely met expectations. U.S. stocks ended modestly higher, having rallied in recent weeks in anticipation of more monetary stimulus. Prices for 30-year government bonds tumbled as investors who had placed big bets on the long bond showed disappointment the central bank would concentrate purchases in shorter maturities. The U.S. dollar dropped against the euro, but gained versus the yen. IS STIMULUS BIG ENOUGH? "The market got what it wanted, but the question is  that enough?" said Bill O'Neill, partner at Logic Advisors in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. The recovery from the worst recession since the 1930s cooled in the summer, but data suggests a modest improvement could be in the cards in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0 percent annual pace in the third quarter, a touch faster than the 1.7 percent rate in the April-June period, but still below potential. Data this week showed an acceleration in manufacturing activity in October, allaying fears of a sharp slowdown in the sector, which has been leading the recovery. A separate report from the Commerce Department showed orders for manufactured goods increased 2.1 percent in September after being flat in August. "While the pick up in services industries is not as robust as the manufacturing sector, the combined picture certainly points to an improvement in the pace of overall economic activity in the fourth quarter," said Brian Bethune, chief U.S. financial economist at IHS Global Insight in Lexington Massachusetts. Signs of a slight tick up in economic activity were also evident in domestic auto sales, which in October recorded their fastest growth pace so far this year. Ben Poore, who heads U.S. sales for Nissan's luxury Infiniti brand, said the October sales reflected a waning of the deep uncertainty that had overshadowed the U.S. market. The bigger-than-expected gain in private hiring suggested a more comprehensive government report on employment due on Friday could show a slightly larger increase in jobs in October than the 60,000 predicted by economists polled by Reuters.
