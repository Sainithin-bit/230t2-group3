 (Reuters) - The four largest U.S. banks face potential losses of $26 billion over the next several years from their exposure to private-label mortgages and potential losses from delinquency, analysts at Goldman Sachs said. 

 Private-label mortgages are those offered by private institutions, as against those by government-backed agencies. The brokerage said $28 billion of market cap was lost between -- Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) -- as the market attempted to price in the potential impact of losses on private label securities. The brokerage cut its price target on Bank of America, PNC Financial ( PNC.N ), and Wells Fargo and said that it favors JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Citigroup in the group. Goldman raised its price target on U.S. Bancorp ( USB.N ), citing improved third-quarter earnings. On the plus side, it said large banks have improved their credit portfolio and built capital ahead of Basel III implementation.
