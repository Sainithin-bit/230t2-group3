 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Chrysler LLC could eliminate a few models within the month as part of the automaker's effort to revamp its operations after going private in May, a person familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. 

 The cuts could further complicate ratification of a new four-year labor contract with the United Auto Workers union, as Chrysler's 49,000 factory workers start voting on the deal this week. The contract has come under fire from union leaders and dissidents who say the tentative deal gives away too much. They complain that it fails to reclassify temporary workers as permanent hires and lacks commitment of future products to plants -- elements that were included in the UAW's deal with General Motors Corp ( GM.N ). The planned product cuts could explain why the UAW did not get product guarantees from Chrysler, as it did from GM. "Chrysler's product is so much in flux ... so it's very difficult to provide those guarantees and commitment plant by plant, as GM had done," IRN Inc analyst Erich Merkle said. A Chrysler spokeswoman declined to comment on the possible cuts. But Chrysler's new president and vice chairman, Jim Press, last week told reporters the automaker plans to weed out overlap in similar models, and that those efforts should be evident by next year. "We have models that overlap where we have two or three vehicles that serve the same market segment, and maybe the same customer, and actually compete with each other to some extent," he said. "You'll see changes as early as next year," Press added. Analysts have said some of the products that could be eliminated include the Jeep Commander, which competes with the Grand Cherokee; the Chrysler Sebring, which competes with the Dodge Avenger; the Chrysler Aspen, which competes with the Dodge Durango, and the Dodge Nitro, which competes with the Jeep Liberty. The Dodge Durango, whose sales have slipped 30 percent this year, could also be eliminated. "PENDULUM SWING" "It would be wrong to have the pendulum swing in the other direction, where there is no overlap," Merkle said. "Certainly there will be shared platforms and shared powertrains, but the vehicles can be made to look and feel completely different." Merkle said a perfect example would be the Chrysler 300 C and the Dodge Charger, which share platforms and powertrains "but look and feel very different." The UAW called a strike against Chrysler last Wednesday, but ended it six hours later after union leaders met that afternoon and decided to accept the terms of a contract proposal from the automaker from earlier that day. The terms of the deal are seen as crucial to the success of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management LP, which took an 80 percent stake in Chrysler in a $7.4 billion deal in May. Cerberus has said it will turn around Chrysler, which posted a $680 million loss in 2006. Under the contract, Chrysler retained the right to close or sell five of its U.S. facilities, including an assembly plant in Delaware that makes the Durango SUV and one in Detroit dedicated to the high-performance Viper. A side letter to the contract also spells out that any future Chrysler production in the United States is based on "market demand" and "favorable business cases." Job security is a hot-button issue for many UAW-represented Chrysler workers because the automaker under Cerberus has made it clear it will seek production partners overseas to reduce costs and target new markets outside the United States.
