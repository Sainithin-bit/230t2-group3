 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Housing starts likely sank further in September from a 12-year low set in August, as lenders have made it more difficult for borrowers to get loans and a record supply of unsold houses lingers. 

 Tighter lending practices are making it harder for potential buyers to purchase homes, despite falling house prices. Housing construction and prices have to fall further to help restore a better balance between supply and demand of homes on the market, analysts agree. Housing starts fell to a 1.285 million annual rate in September from 1.331 million the prior month, according to the median forecast found in a Reuters survey of 64 economists. Permits to build dropped to 1.298 million annual units from 1.322 million in August, a similar poll of 45 economists found. The data is scheduled for release at 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday. The following is a selection of comments from economists: LEHMAN: Forecast: 1.280 million starts, down 3.8 percent 1.290 million permits, down 2.4 percent "Permits fell by a cumulative 13 percent over the summer, which should translate to a sizable decline in September housing starts given the one- to two-month lag between permits and starts. The recent sharp decline in construction is largely in response to weak demand and the large overhang of homes for sale. In addition, cancellation rates have started to pick up, adding to builder gloom. "Builders are also concerned about future housing activity given liquidity problems in the mortgage market which have made financing more difficult. On balance, we expect housing starts to continue to fall through the middle of next year, but for the pace of decline to slow. We do not see a pick-up in construction until 2009, at the earliest." YOUNG KIM, STONE & MCCARTHY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES: FORECAST: 1.280 million starts, down 3.8 percent "Starts will need to come down further due to high inventories and slower sales. A good indication that starts will be lower in September is the fewer permits taken out in August. "At the end of August, the number of new-home inventory swelled to 529,000, well above their historical average of 349,000 with the months supply up to 8.2, which was the highest since January 1991. As such, builders need to continue being aggressive in cutting back on construction, and as they do, this will help inventory come down quicker. "Building permits tend to lead housing starts, and permits fell 4.8 percent in August to 1.322 million, which was the lowest level since June 1997. Year-on-year, housing starts were down about 19.0 percent in August with permits down roughly 24.0 percent." DEUTSCHE BANK: FORECAST: starts 1.270 million, -4.6 percent permits 1.290 million, - 2.4 percent "The housing data could prove to be the make-or-break data for the Fed. We are seeing little evidence suggesting that the end of the housing slump is near, and the upcoming data on home-builder confidence, housing starts and permits (reported this week) and new- and existing-home sales (reported next week) are likely to confirm this. "The NAHB sentiment index, reported on Tuesday, is presently tying a record low reading from January 1991 when the economy was in recession. The future sales subcomponent of this index has already broken through the lows of that period. We think the overall index will fall into new record low territory this week (18 vs. 20), as a result of tighter mortgage lending standards and an inventory glut of new homes for sale. "Due to these same factors, we are also looking for sharp declines in the September starts, -4.6 percent, and permits, -2.4 percent, in data reported on Wednesday."
