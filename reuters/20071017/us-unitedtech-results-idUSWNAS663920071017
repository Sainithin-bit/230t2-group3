 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer United Technologies Corp ( UTX.N ) posted a 20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, narrowly beating Wall Street expectations, but warned that it expects the U.S. economy to slow next year. 

 The maker of products ranging from airplane electronics to Otis elevators said its financial outlook remains "generally healthy," with the exception of its Carrier air conditioner unit, which has been hurt by the weak housing market. United Tech forecast profit growth of 10 percent to 14 percent in 2008, with revenue up by a mid-single-digit percentage, stripping out the effect of acquisitions and currency fluctuations. "How the U.S. economy reacts to the current slowdown in housing and the recent turmoil in financial markets is unclear," Greg Hayes, vice president of accounting and control, said on a conference call with investors. "While we don't expect a recession in 2008, we do expect the U.S. economy to slow further." United Tech shares were off $3.60, or 4.5 percent, to $76.05 in midday trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier they were as low as $75.58, down 5 percent in their worst one-day percentage drop in five years. The shares are up about 22 percent this year, outpacing the 12 percent gain in the Dow Jones industrial average, of which United Tech is a component. Matt Collins, capital goods analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, said the sell-off in the shares reflected "the less than enthusiastic commentary on the U.S. economy and the hint that in 2008 earnings might be restrained somewhat." BEATS FORECASTS United Tech reported third-quarter net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.21 per share, up from $996 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time tax-related benefits, it earned $1.17 a share, beating the average Wall Street forecast by 1 cent, according to Reuters Estimates. The Hartford, Connecticut-based company expects recent changes to international tax laws to offset the tax-related gain of 4 cents a share in the fourth quarter. Third-quarter revenue came to $13.86 billion, up 14 percent. About 9 percent of the increase was organic, with the remaining 5 percent reflecting the effect of acquisitions and the weak dollar. HOUSING SLUMP PINCHES CARRIER The world's largest maker of air conditioners and elevators has benefited from continued strong investment in commercial construction in the United States and abroad, even as the U.S. housing slump has pinched its Carrier unit. The housing market has been in sharp decline for two years as higher interest rates and softening demand have taken a toll on home sales. Investors are watching closely for evidence that contagion is spreading to other sectors of the economy. At the start of the year, "we really thought the housing market was going to recover at the end of '07 and give us some nice tail wind as we went into '08," said Hayes. "That's probably not going to happen, and quite frankly not going to happen even in '08." Carrier's third-quarter profit fell 2.3 percent, the only one of United Tech's six operating segments to record a decline in earnings. Residential air conditioner sales represent about 5 percent of United Tech's total revenue. "The thing that I think people are going to want to find out about is how exposed are they going to be to the weak domestic environment," said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, a Cleveland, Ohio-based company with $20 billion under management that holds United Tech shares. "Carrier is the focus there, even though they generate a lot of offset from China."
