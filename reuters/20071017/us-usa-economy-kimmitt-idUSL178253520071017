 BERLIN  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy's fundamentals are strong even though the housing market decline is slowing the expansion, Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Kimmitt said on Wednesday. 

 "Despite the strong fundamentals, the housing decline is still unfolding," Kimmitt told a press briefing in Berlin. "The U.S. economy has strong underlying fundamentals even as growth is slowing due to the housing market." The U.S. government is also trying to think about ways to protect solvent homeowners from losing their homes, while avoiding any kind of rescue of the financial sector, he said. "This is not any kind of bailout. But we have to be mindful of the fact that we have to encourage home ownership." Kimmitt declined to speak about the U.S. dollar but said China should speed up its transition to a currency that reflects the state of its economy, adding that currencies in general should be valued in open, competitive markets. "It's very important that the Chinese move more quickly to valuing their currency on the basis of economic fundamentals." On hedge funds, he said the United States wanted a system of voluntary best practices and not firm rules, adding that Germany agreed with the U.S. position. Countries should "keep investment barriers as low as possible," he said, adding that this should include sovereign wealth funds. State-run funds would be a topic of discussion at a meeting in Washington between Group of Seven (G7) members and countries with sovereign wealth funds. Kimmitt said the issue of keeping trade and investment barriers low was also key for a new transatlantic economic partnership launched several months ago at a European Union-U.S. summit held during Germany's recent EU presidency. During his current visit to Germany, Kimmitt said he had met Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck and would later meet Chancellor Angela Merkel. He said he would mention his concern about increasing calls for investment protectionism. Germany is already drawing up plans to shield so-called "strategic" German companies from cash-rich sovereign wealth funds, especially in China, Russia and the Middle East, in order to protect the country's national security. The plans, due to be presented by the end of the year, worry some economists who do not want Germany to take measures which could be viewed as protectionist. Kimmitt said any rules should be carefully thought out to avoid discouraging good investment -- including from state funds. "There are ways to ensure national security while keeping investment barriers low," he said.
