 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - American Airlines parent, AMR Corp AMR.N, said on Wednesday third-quarter profit rose as it raised fares and cut the number of seats it had in the air. 

 The results came in slightly stronger than expected and initially sent AMR's share price more than 3 percent higher. But the carrier warned that some costs were likely to rise in the fourth quarter and some of the gains were retraced. The positive earnings from the world's largest airline followed results from Delta Air Lines, which on Tuesday reported a stronger-than-expected profit on cost controls. AMR Chief Executive Gerard Arpey said in a statement that the earnings were solid despite soaring oil costs and volatile weather. "However, we must step up our continued focus on managing costs, work to improve our profit margins and continue our momentum throughout 2007 and beyond," Arpey said. Profit increased to $175 million, or 61 cents per share, from $15 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier, when the airline recorded a $99 million noncash charge. Year-ago earnings for major airlines were also weakened by a security scare in Britain. AMR said special items in the third quarter included a charge of $40 million, or 13 cents per share, related to salary and benefit expenses from prior quarters. With those items factored in, AMR earned 74 cents per share, which compared with the 73-cent Wall Street forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly operating revenue rose 1.7 percent to $5.65 billion. The airline industry has been recovering from a years-long slump, due largely to low-fare competition and increasingly high costs. Top carriers, however, have managed to cut capacity -- the number of seats for sale -- and raise fares. AMR cut the number of seats on flights it owns and operates by 2.8 percent in the quarter, compared with the third quarter of 2006. Meanwhile it flew fuller planes, selling 83.9 percent of its seats, which the company said was a record. AMR's third-quarter yield, which represents average fares paid, increased 2.3 percent from the year-ago period. The company ended the third quarter with $5.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, including a restricted balance of $447 million. "The results represented AMR's sixth consecutive profitable quarter, an earnings trend not seen since 1999-2000," Merrill Lynch analyst Michael Linenberg said in a research note. OUTLOOK A recent surge in the price of crude oil has cast a shadow over the airline industry as it struggles in its recovery. The price of jet fuel is directly affected by the price of crude oil. NYMEX crude futures CLc1 have traded at record highs above $88 a barrel this week, a sign that airlines may have an even bigger fuel bill in the fourth quarter. Carriers, however, have hedged their exposure to energy markets, often locking in prices below the market. As of Wednesday AMR was planning for an average price of $2.27 per gallon of jet fuel in the fourth quarter and $2.10 per gallon for all of 2007. AMR said it has 40 percent of its anticipated fourth-quarter fuel consumption capped at an average crude oil equivalent of $69 per barrel, which is the jet fuel equivalent of $2.01 per gallon. AMR said it expects to further cut capacity 2.2 percent in 2007 with a 2.4 percent reduction in domestic capacity and a 1.9 percent reduction in capacity on lucrative international routes, where American faces less competition. AMR shares, which fell almost 16 percent in the third quarter, were up 36 cents at $24.48 on the New York Stock Exchange.
