 PRAGUE  (Reuters) - Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sees no imminent danger in the weakening of the U.S. dollar, a Czech newspaper quoted him as telling a closed-door conference in Prague via a video link. 

 Greenspan reiterated his view expressed earlier this month that the odds of a U.S. recession due to the credit crisis were 50 percent at most, the daily Pravo said in an advance copy of a story set for publication on Thursday. The ex-Fed chairman said inflation was a far bigger concern for the United States than the dollar, which was trading at a tolerable level, the newspaper said. Greenspan said it was impossible to foresee an end to the U.S. economic troubles and that the outlook for the economy hinged on a recovery in the property market, he was quoted as telling the conference organized by the Czech Teleaxis agency.
