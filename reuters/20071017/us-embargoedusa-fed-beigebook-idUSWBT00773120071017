 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Economic activity grew in all of the Federal Reserve's districts but the pace of expansion has decelerated since August, and housing markets continued to weaken, the central bank said on Wednesday. 

 The economy grew at a slower rate in five Fed districts from late August through October 5, the Fed said in its Beige Book of anecdotal economic conditions. In the other seven districts, economic growth was steady. "Residential real estate markets continued to weaken, and most districts reported additional declines in home sales, prices and construction," the Fed said in the report.
