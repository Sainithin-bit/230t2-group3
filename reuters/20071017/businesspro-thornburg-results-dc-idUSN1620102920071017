 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Thornburg Mortgage Inc TMA.N posted 
a large loss and suspended its common stock dividend on Tuesday 
after the lender said it lost about $1.1 billion in the third 
quarter from the sale of jumbo mortgages. 

  The net loss of $1.084 billion, before preferred stock 
dividends, equaled $8.83 per share. That compared with a net 
profit of $75.3 million, or 64 cents per share, a year earlier.  Analysts on average expected a loss of $8.88 per share, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Santa Fe, New Mexico-based Thornburg also said it would not 
pay a common stock dividend for the third quarter, but said it 
would consider resuming the dividend in the fourth quarter, 
when it expects profitability and market conditions to improve.  Thornburg concentrates on adjustable-rate jumbo mortgages, 
which are larger than $417,000 and thus cannot be purchased by 
mortgage companies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N.  As credit markets tightened in July and August, investor 
demand evaporated for home loans they no longer considered 
safe, including Thornburg's high-quality loans.  While Thornburg was able to sell $22 billion of its loans, 
it could do so only at a significant loss. It cut back lending 
in August after investors resisted buying the short-term debt 
it used to fund lending.  Rising delinquencies and defaults have caused dozens of 
mortgage lenders to quit the industry this year. More than a 
dozen went bankrupt, including American Home Mortgage 
Investment Corp ( AHMIQ.PK ), which catered to borrowers with 
good credit.  Thornburg shares closed Tuesday down 42 cents at $11.40 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. They have fallen 55 percent this 
year.
