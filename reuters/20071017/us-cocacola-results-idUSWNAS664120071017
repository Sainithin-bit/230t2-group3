 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co ( KO.N ) said on Wednesday quarterly profit rose a better-than-expected 13 percent on strong international sales, a weak dollar, demand for Coke Zero and a lower tax rate. 

 The world's largest beverage maker, which produces Powerade sports drink and Dasani bottled water aside from its namesake soft drinks, also gave a positive outlook for the global economy and commodity costs, sending its shares up 3 percent. In contrast to rival PepsiCo Inc ( PEP.N ), which last week said 2008 raw material costs would be higher than this year, Coke said it expects costs for materials such as corn syrup and aluminum to be flat to down slightly. For its whole system, including bottlers, it sees costs being flat. "We are starting to see a moderation in commodity costs impacting beverage companies, both globally and in North America, and we believe the worst is behind us," Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said on a conference call. Pepsi, which makes Frito Lay snacks and Quaker oatmeal in addition to its signature drinks, said its outlook included grains and cooking oils and excluded oranges. Coke said net income rose to $1.65 billion, or 71 cents per share, for the third quarter that ended September 28, up from $1.46 billion, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 68 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Coke lowered its expected full-year tax rate to 22 percent from 22.5 percent, providing a 1 cent-per-share benefit in the quarter. The company forecast its tax rate for 2008 would be between 22 percent and 22.5 percent. Net operating revenue rose 19 percent to $7.69 billion, which included contributions of 8 percentage points from acquisitions of certain bottlers, 6 points from higher sales of beverage concentrate, and 4 points from the weak dollar, which boosts the value of sales in other currencies when converted to dollars for inclusion on the company's income statement. Worldwide case volume rose 6 percent, with increases of 4 percent for carbonated drinks and 14 percent for noncarbonated beverages. Volume rose 1 percent in North America, the first quarter of growth in that region in five quarters. Volume of carbonated drinks fell 2 percent as consumers opt for drinks they think are healthier, but popularity of the newly launched Coca-Cola Zero helped the company gain market share. "Double-digit revenue growth in emerging markets, stronger-than-expected results from Coke Zero in developed regions and continued profit-and-loss leverage reconfirms our thesis that Coke can grow earnings-per-share double-digits through 2010, ahead of its long-term guidance," said UBS beverage analyst Kaumil Gajrawala. STRENGTH ABROAD Volume grew more than 4 percent in Japan, but fell 2 percent in Europe, due in part to unfavorable weather in Western Europe. The company saw double-digit growth in key developing markets, including China, Turkey, Russia and India. Strength in these countries is also helping the Atlanta-based company in the face of U.S. economic woes. "We recognize that there is some uncertainty as it relates to the U.S. economy," Fayard said. "However, we remain committed to restoring growth in our home market. We also remain positive on the global macroeconomic outlook, especially in many of our emerging markets." Coke Zero has been the company's most notable product introduction in many years and analysts have said they see that success, as well as the recent acquisitions of Glaceau and Fuze, as evidence that Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell is turning around the company. Isdell was brought out of retirement in 2004 to lead Coke, whose shares have gained about 9 percent over the last three months, outperforming the Standard & Poor's Consumer Staples Index .GSPS, which gained 3 percent over the same period. Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello said Coke's stronger-than-expected volume growth and better-than-expected earnings bode well for continued stock gains. Coke shares were up 2.8 percent, or $1.60 at $59.36 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares hit an intraday high of $59.43, its highest level since February 2001.
