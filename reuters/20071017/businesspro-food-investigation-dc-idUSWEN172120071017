 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Food companies including Sara Lee Corp 
SLE.N, ConAgra Foods Inc ( CAG.N ), Perdue Farms Inc and others 
are being investigated for possible fraud and corruption in 
supplying the U.S. military in Iraq, the Wall Street Journal 
reported on Wednesday, citing sources. 

  The investigations by the Department of Justice and the 
Defense Department are examining whether the companies charged 
excessively high prices to the Army's primary food contractor 
in the war zone, a Kuwaiti firm called Public Warehousing Co, 
the paper said.  It said Public Warehousing, which receives more than $1 
billion a year to feed troops, denied wrongdoing.  It said Sara Lee acknowledged having received subpoenas 
from the Department of Defense and said it was "cooperating 
fully." A ConAgra representative said the company isn't a 
target of the investigation, but acknowledged receiving a 
subpoena, the paper reported.  The paper said a Perdue spokesman said the company hasn't 
received any subpoenas.
