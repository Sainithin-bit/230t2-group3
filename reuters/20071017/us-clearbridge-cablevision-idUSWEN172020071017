 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - ClearBridge Advisors, the largest institutional shareholder in Cablevision Systems Corp ( CVC.N ), plans to vote against the founding Dolan family's effort to take the cable television company private, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing sources. 

 The $10.6 billion bid to buy Cablevision is facing increasing opposition by shareholders, including Gamco Investors Inc. ( GBL.N ), managed by investor Mario Gabelli, and others. ClearBridge owns about 13.8 percent of Cablevision, according to regulatory filings, making it the largest institutional investor. The ClearBridge opposition could deliver a potentially "crippling blow" to the offer to take Cablevision private, the paper said.
