 REYKJAVIK  (Reuters) - Iceland's finance minister said on Sunday a dispute with Britain and the Netherlands over repaying debts would take at least a year to solve in court. 

 "My estimate is that the process will take a year, a year and a half at least," Finance Minister Steingrimur Sigfusson told a news conference. Icelanders rejected in a referendum a plan to repay $5 billion to Britain and the Netherlands after the countries reimbursed savers who lost deposits in "Icesave" accounts operated by an Icelandic bank that collapsed in 2008.
