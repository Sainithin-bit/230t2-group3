 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Regulators closed on Friday Ameribank Inc, which became the 12th bank failure this year as the struggling economy and falling home prices take their toll on financial institutions. 

 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp said the Northfork, West Virginia-based bank had $115 million in assets and $102 million in deposits as of June 30. The failure is expected to cost the U.S. bank deposit insurance fund about $42 million. Pioneer Community Bank Inc in Iaeger, West Virginia, and The Citizens Savings Bank in Martins Ferry, Ohio, entered into agreements to assume all the deposits and certain assets of Ameribank, which was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision. The OTS said Ameribank suffered from excessive growth in construction rehabilitation loans, which provided financing to fix distressed properties, mainly in low- to moderate-income housing markets. Customers can access their money over the weekend by check, teller machine or debit card, the FDIC said. The biggest bank failure by far this year was IndyMac, seized on July 11 with $32 billion in assets and $19 billion in deposits as of March. It was the third-largest insured bank insolvency in U.S. history. With more bank failures expected, investors are worried about the problems with the financial markets which recently have experienced government rescues. The FDIC oversees an industry-funded reserve used to insure up to $100,000 per account and $250,000 per individual retirement account at insured banks. The agency also has a running tally of problem banks that its examiners closely monitor. At the end of the second quarter, 117 institutions were on that list. The FDIC does not name the institutions on the list. (Reporting by  John Poirier ; editing by Carol Bishopric and  Bernard Orr )
