 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer said on Saturday that Congress hopes to pass this week the Bush administration's $700 billion financial markets rescue plan. 

 "The aim is to get this on the president's desk by Friday," Schumer, the chairman of Congress' Joint Economic Committee, said at a news conference. Schumer said Congress is working with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on "filling in the blanks" on the proposed legislation. "A number of options are being considered, including some kind of supervisory authority," he said. (Reporting by  Kristina Cooke , editing by Jackie Frank)
