 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Many option participants were relieved after U.S. securities regulatory staff proposed that option market makers be exempted from the temporary ban on short selling of financial stocks. 

 The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will consider an exemption for hedging activities by exchange and over-the-counter market makers in derivatives on the emergency short sale ban issued on Friday. SEC staff made the recommendation to the commission late on Friday after the agency imposed a ban on short sales of nearly 800 financial stocks. The order will end after October 2 and may be extended for 10 days. "This is very good news," said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at online brokerage thinkorswim Group. "It will mean that option market makers can hedge their positions." The emergency ban sent a chill throughout the options market because it would hurt market makers' ability to provide liquidity when investors need a safety valve to weather the financial crisis. The option industry criticized the new rules because they would effectively limit market makers' role in providing fair and orderly markets by depriving them of ways to hedge or protect positions. The ban could also raise the price of protection, distort bid/ask spreads and reduce volume, participants said. Equity options give the right to either buy (call) or sell a company's stock (put) at a preset price within a specified period. Short sellers borrow stock to sell, in hopes that the price will fall and allow them to buy back the stock more cheaply. The Options Clearing Corp, the world's largest equity derivatives clearing organization, and exchanges such as the Chicago Board Options Exchange slammed the emergency order. The rethinking of the SEC comes after a day of erratic options trading in many financial names, many of which were on the short selling ban list. "Without the ability to hedge positions by shorting shares, few market makers were willing to stick their necks out. The result was often wide spreads and illiquid market conditions," said Frederic Ruffy, options strategist at Web site WhatsTrading.com. The timing could not have been worse because it was the quarterly expiration and settlement of September options and futures contracts, an event known as quadruple witching. "Clearly, this was not a good environment for professionals and customers in the options market. While market makers were assuming more risk, customers saw big spreads between bids and offers," Ruffy said. "It appears that the SEC does listen to reason as the option exchanges, the OCC and many option trading firms pointed out the disaster that would occur if no hedging by option market markers was allowed in the underlying stocks," said Steve Claussen, chief investment strategist at OptionsHouse, a subsidiary of PEAK6 Investments, an options trading firm.
