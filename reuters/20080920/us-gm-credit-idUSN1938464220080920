 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Friday it plans to draw down the remaining $3.9 billion of its $4.5 billion secured revolving credit facility to maintain a high level of financial flexibility for its ongoing restructuring in the face of uncertain capital markets. 

 The company also said it completed a debt-to-equity swap, by issuing 28.3 million new shares of its common stock in exchange for $322 million principal amount of its 1.5 percent Series D Senior Convertible Debentures, maturing in June 2009. Proceeds from the draw could be used to retire $750 million of debt maturities coming due in October. The funds also would be available to pay Delphi Corporation more than $1.2 billion as part of its reorganization efforts, if a court approves revised agreements between the companies submitted September 12. A plan implemented in July to bolster GM's liquidity through internal operating actions, asset sales and the capital markets remains on track, the company said. GM said it "continues to look to opportunistically access the capital markets." (Reporting by  Gina Keating , editing by Richard Chang)
