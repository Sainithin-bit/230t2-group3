 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Renault SA ( RENA.PA ) is making plans to exonerate three executives accused of industrial espionage and fired, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. 

 One scenario being contemplated by the French automaker's board, Chief Operating Officer Patrick Pelata would offer his resignation, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the situation. It remains unclear whether Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn would accept Pelata's resignation, the paper said. Police in Liechtenstein and Switzerland have not found any secret bank accounts connected to the three managers, the paper said, citing people familiar with the matter. Renault's lawyer, Jean Reinhart, told the paper the automaker did not plan any official action until it hears back from Paris prosecutors about the alleged bank accounts, which have been a key part of the case against the three fired executives. Earlier on Wednesday, Reinhart told Reuters Renault executives do not know the identity of the person who sold the information that initially sparked the industrial espionage probe.
