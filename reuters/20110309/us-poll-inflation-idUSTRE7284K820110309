 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Economists raised their U.S. inflation forecasts amid surging oil prices but see no interest rate hikes until 2012 as the central bank awaits clear evidence of sustainable economic growth, according to a Reuters poll on Wednesday. 

 Rising energy and other commodity prices pose a threat to consumer spending -- a main driver of the U.S. economy -- but economists said it was still too early to tell how deep the impact would be. High energy prices are expected to temper economic growth, but are not yet serious enough to derail the recovery. Inflation is also still forecast to be relatively tame, especially compared to emerging market countries. Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald & Co in San Francisco, said the volatile nature of commodity prices means they shouldn't disrupt the recovery in the short term. "It's not the type of inflation that should really alter the course of the economy too much. Now, persistent high prices would be a negative, so that does stand out as a possibility," said Pado. Despite the higher inflation expectations, economists see the Federal Reserve keeping rates near zero until the first quarter of 2012. A Reuters poll of more than 60 economists expects the consumer price index to rise 2.2 percent in 2011, up from the 1.9 percent that was forecast in February. First quarter inflation is forecast at 1.9 percent, up from 1.6 percent, and the second quarter is seen at 2.4 percent compared to 2.1 percent. However, core CPI, which strips out volatile food and gasoline, is seen little changed. Economists are anticipating core inflation of 1.2 percent this year, edging up from 1.1 percent forecast in the last poll. FED ON HOLD The Fed is not expected to raise rates until the first quarter of 2012, a wider survey of over 90 economists found. In February, economists had anticipated the Fed would raise rates in the final quarter of this year. "Momentum in the job market is building from relatively low levels, which should keep the Fed on course both to complete QE2 (stimulus measures) as expected and not to raise rates until early 2012 at the soonest," said Diane Swonk, economist at Mesirow Financial. But surging oil prices are deepening a split inside the Fed and have blurred the likely direction of U.S. monetary policy. Growth in the economy is expected to continue apace. Recent data has shown the recovery is gaining momentum and analysts are hoping to see the private sector compensate for cutbacks at state and local governments. Economists forecast gross domestic product will rise 3.5 percent in the first quarter, in line with February's expectations, while the second quarter will see 3.4 percent growth, up from 3.2 percent. GDP growth for the year is forecast for 3.1 percent, down slightly from the previous call of 3.2 percent. "Improving economic conditions in February give us comfort that the expected reacceleration in the U.S. economy might be underway," said Swonk. "Upside risk from rising energy prices, as well as geo-strategic uncertainty in the Middle East, provide the major source of downside risk -- but not yet an immediate threat to the path of recovery."
