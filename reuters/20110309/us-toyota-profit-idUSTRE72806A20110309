 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) will forecast a minimum operating profit of 1 trillion yen ($12.1 billion) and a profit margin of 5 percent in two to three years as part of its business strategy to be unveiled on Wednesday, a source said. 

 The figures are not a strict financial target but an estimate of what the company should be capable of as it reduces costs and strengthens its operations, the source said, declining to be identified because the information is not public yet. That forecast is roughly in line with market expectations, with 15 analysts putting Toyota's operating profit for the year to March 31, 2013 at 1.14 trillion yen, according to poll by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
