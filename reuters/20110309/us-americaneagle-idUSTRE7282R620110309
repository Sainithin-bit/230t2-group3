 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Eagle Outfitters Inc ( AEO.N ) announced the retirement of its chief executive officer, paving the way for new leadership at an apparel retailer that has seen sales stumble, and shares rose. 

 The company also forecast profits in line with analysts' estimates. CEO James O'Donnell, 70, will continue to lead American Eagle until the company finds and installs a successor. "We view this as a positive development," Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said of O'Donnell stepping down. "The company needs new management direction to get new shareholders interested in the story." American Eagle has seen sales pressured amid stiff competition from peers Abercrombie & Fitch ( ANF.N ) and Zumiez Inc. ( ZUMZ.O ) Under O'Donnell, the company commenced a turnaround. It made its lingerie line, Aerie, profitable, for example, said Wedbush analyst Betty Chen. "This team has made a lot of progress," she said. "There's an opportunity to capitalize on that foundation, and accelerate it." Shares were up 6.4 percent at $15.74 at midday on the New York Stock Exchange. The company said it would earn profits in the range of 13 to 17 cents per share in its first quarter and $1.10 in 2011, compared with analysts' estimates of 16 cents per share for the quarter and $1.10 for the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at stores open at least a year, a closely watched measure of a retailer's health, fell 7 percent during the fourth quarter and the company said it expected that measure to be flat to down 3 percent in the first quarter. Investor relief that the outlook was in line with analysts' estimates despite the weak revenue is driving up the share price, Chen said. "They have initiatives to control expenses and reduce markdowns," she said. Adjusted earnings from continuing operations in the company's holiday fourth quarter were $87 million or 44 cents per share, up from $59.3 million or 28 cents per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 43 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales fell 4 percent to $916 million. Analysts on average had expected $919.2 million.
