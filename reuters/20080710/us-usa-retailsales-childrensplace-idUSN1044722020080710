 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Children's Place Retail Stores Inc said on Thursday its June sales at stores open at least a year rose 16 percent, handily beating Wall Street's expectations. 

 Five analysts expected, on average, a gain of 7.8 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. The children's clothing retailer said total sales rose 23 percent to $123 million for the five weeks ended July 5. The company said in a recorded call that sales were strongest in the week when it had its semi-annual sale. It said marketing for the back-to-school shopping season would include a print campaign and direct mailing efforts. Former Chief Executive Ezra Dabah, who owns 17 percent of the company's shares and is a member of its board of directors, has pushed for a sale of Children's Place and said he might be a buyer. In May, the Secaucus, New Jersey-based company sold its Disney store chain back to Walt Disney Co. It operated 903 Children's Place stores as of July 5.
