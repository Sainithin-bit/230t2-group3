 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told Congress on Thursday that financial market turbulence persists and that government officials are focused on helping the financial system regain stability. 

 "The financial turmoil is ongoing, and our efforts today are concentrated on helping the financial system return to more normal functioning," Bernanke said in comments prepared for delivery to the House of Representatives financial services committee. Bernanke's comments echoed a speech he gave on Tuesday recommending more robust oversight of large investment banks and primary dealers that trade securities directly with the Fed in light of the market disruptions that have battered the U.S. economy. "Cooperation between the Fed and the (Securities and Exchange Commission) is taking place within the existing statutory framework with the objective of addressing the near-term situation," Bernanke said. "In the longer term, however, legislation may be needed to provide a more robust framework for the prudential supervision of investment banks and other large securities dealers," he said. The regulator of such firms should have authority to set standards for capital, liquidity holdings, and risk management he said. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
