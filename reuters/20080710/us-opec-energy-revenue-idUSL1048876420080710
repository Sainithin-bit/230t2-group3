 LONDON  (Reuters) - OPEC's oil and gas export revenue rose by 12 percent to a record $730 billion in 2007 as oil's extended rally had the group pumping nearly flat out, an OPEC report showed on Thursday. 

 With no let up in the bull run -- crude prices are up close to 50 percent since the start of the year -- 2008 should be another revenue record-breaker for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). The world's biggest oil exporter Saudi Arabia earned $206 billion last year from petroleum exports -- a rise of 9.6 percent on 2006, OPEC said in its Annual Statistical Bulletin. Boom times continued in other OPEC countries as oil neared $100 a barrel towards the end of 2007. OPEC, expanded to 13 countries with the entry of Ecuador in late 2007, pumps more than a third of the world's oil and straddles about three quarters of the world's proven oil reserves. The OPEC report revised figures for previous years to include the South American country and said the group's resources increased in 2007. Reserves grew to 939 billion barrels from 927 billion in 2006, the report said, mainly reflecting an increase in Venezuela. Analysts have questioned the size of reserves in Middle Eastern OPEC countries, but leading exporter Saudi Arabia has strongly denied that its reserves have been exaggerated. A strain on the world's oil refineries has fed into the rise in oil prices and the OPEC report showed capacity in member countries was steady on last year at 9.34 million barrels per day. OPEC's natural gas reserves rose to 91 trillion cubic meters, up by 1.8 percent from 2006.
