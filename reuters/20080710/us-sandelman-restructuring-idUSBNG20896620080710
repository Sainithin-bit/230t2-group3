 (Reuters) - New York-based hedge fund Sandelman Partners, which manages about $4 billion of assets, told investors in its largest fund that they cannot have their money back soon, The Wall Street Journal said on Thursday. 

 Investors representing about 20 percent of the fund had asked to withdraw their money, the paper said. Investors in the $3.2 billion fund, Sandelman Partners Multi-Strategy Fund Ltd, were told last week by the firm's board that 22 percent of the fund would be placed in a side account to be controlled by the firm, the paper said. For the remaining 78 percent, investors will be given a choice of locking the money up for one year in a new Sandelman hedge fund, or having their money placed in a liquidation fund, where investments will be sold and the cash paid out over time. The hedge fund's restructuring was reported in Absolute Return magazine, the Journal said. Sandelman's big multi-strategy fund was down almost 5 percent this year through the end of June, while the firm's other fund was up 2.6 percent. The smaller Sandelman fund is also being closed and merged into the new fund, to be called Sandelman Partners Opportunity, the paper said. The hedge fund is run by veteran investor Jon Sandelman, who was previously a senior executive at Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), which he joined in 1998 after holding the top global equity derivatives job at Salomon Brothers. Sandelman Partners could not be immediately reached for comment. (Reporting by  Pratish Narayanan  in Bangalore, editing by Will Waterman)
