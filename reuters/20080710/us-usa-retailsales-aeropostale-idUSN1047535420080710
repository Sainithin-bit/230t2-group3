 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Teen clothing retailer Aeropostale Inc said on Thursday sales at stores open at least a year rose 12 percent in June, and it raised its second-quarter profit forecast, citing successful promotions. 

 Analysts, on average, had expected a same-store sales increase of 6.9 percent, according to Thomson Reuters Estimates. Total sales rose 22 percent to $136 million for the five weeks ended June 5. The retailer has been a high-flyer in recent quarters even as the broader apparel market, even for teens, has faced slumping sales amid rising fuel and food costs and a weak economy. Aeropostale, which has more than 800 stores in the United States and Canada, sells casual clothing at prices lower than many specialty retail competitors like Abercrombie & Fitch Co. The retailer said it now expects second-quarter profit of 25 cents to 26 cents a share, up from a May forecast of 22 cents to 24 cents. Analysts' average forecast is 24 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; editing by John Wallace)
