 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wachovia Corp's WB.N new chief executive, Robert Steel, is a Wall Street and federal government veteran experienced in fixing financial problems, but his hiring failed to assure investors the fourth-largest U.S. bank can quickly resolve its own troubles. 

 Wachovia shares tumbled to their lowest level since 1991 after the bank said it might lose as much as $2.8 billion in the second quarter and declined to offer specifics on whether it needs more capital or might again cut its dividend. "There is no quick fix out there, you all know that," Wachovia Chairman Lanty Smith said on a conference call. In morning trading the shares were down $1.36, or 9.5 percent, at $12.93 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen by about 75 percent from their 52-week high of $53.10 set last September 19. Steel, 56, joined Charlotte, North Carolina-based Wachovia from the U.S. Treasury Department, where he was under secretary for domestic finance and a key figure in the Bush administration response to the nation's mortgage and credit crisis. The North Carolina native previously worked for 28 years at Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ), retiring as vice chairman in February 2004. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson was chief executive at the time. At Wachovia, Steel succeeds Ken Thompson, who was ousted on June 2 after several financial and legal setbacks, including a disastrous $24.2 billion purchase of Golden West Financial Corp in 2006. Wachovia may have to write off much of the $14 billion of goodwill it took on when it bought the California mortgage lender as the housing market was peaking. "There has been a complete recognition at the board level that Golden West was a mistake, and we have to deal with the consequences," Smith said. Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Merrill Lynch & Co MER.N and UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) are among other large banking companies that have replaced their chief executives following big mortgage losses. GETTING SMARTER Steel inherits a bank that has several healthy businesses but which is hamstrung by a deteriorating $121 billion portfolio of option adjustable-rate mortgages, which let borrowers skip some payments and was Golden West's specialty. Wachovia last week said it will stop offering option ARMs. Moody's Investors Service on Thursday said it may cut the bank's long-term debt rating because of the option ARM exposure. Problems with mortgages and other complex debt have already led Wachovia to raise $8.05 billion of capital this year and cut its dividend 41 percent. Many analysts say more is needed. "Wachovia may need to cut its dividend again or look at fresh sources of capital," said Michael Nix, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates LLC in Greenwood, South Carolina, which owns Wachovia shares. "Hopefully, Wachovia will emerge from this cycle a little bit smarter." The bank said it approached Steel for the top job and granted him a potential $38.1 million of salary, bonus and other awards in his first year to bring him aboard. Steel has no experience running a commercial bank, but he said that won't be a hindrance. At the Treasury Department, he worked easily with lawmakers on legislation to strengthen the agency that regulates mortgage companies Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. He was also involved in JPMorgan Chase & Co's ( JPM.N ) spring bailout of the investment bank Bear Stearns Cos. "Credit standards deteriorated in the financial services industry, not just at Wachovia but at lots of places," Steel told reporters on a separate conference call. CLEAN-UP TIME Steel denied any conflict of interest in joining the bank, saying he followed proper recusal procedures on Treasury matters while negotiating his employment with Wachovia. He characterized himself as a "collaborative person" who will draw on Wachovia's other executives for help. "No one person will have all the answers," he said. Smith added, "There is nothing in retail and commercial banking that he, as a quick study, can't come to grips with." Wachovia pledged to offer more details on how it will preserve capital and aggressively cut costs when it reports quarterly results on July 22. It also maintained its commitment to staying independent, amid speculation it might be acquired by JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) or even Goldman, which is advising the bank on addressing its loan and risk exposures. Smith said Wachovia has no plans for a deeper relationship with Goldman, calling some market rumors "just silly." In a regulatory filing, Wachovia said it will award Steel a $1.1 million annual salary, an annual bonus targeted at $6 million but which could total zero to $12 million, and an annual long-term incentive award targeted at $15 billion. It said Steel will also get a $10 million one-time restricted stock grant. "Investors will view Mr. Steel as a CEO brought in to fix and clean up the company in short order," wrote Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP. "We don't believe there is any 'silver bullet.'" (Editing by John Wallace)
