 LONDON  (Reuters) - Financial companies have been reducing headcount since the U.S. housing crisis escalated last August. Following is a summary of some of the deepest job losses at major banks: 

 * BANK OF AMERICA CORP ( BAC.N ) The second-largest U.S. bank by assets expects to eliminate about 7,500 jobs over the next two years after it completes its acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp CFC.P, the largest U.S. mortgage lender. Separately, Bank of America is cutting about 3,000 jobs, mainly in corporate and investment banking. * CITIGROUP INC ( C.N ) The U.S. bank said in May it could cut almost a quarter of jobs in its British consumer business, or about 750 positions, as it focuses on its Citi and Egg brands. The reduction is in addition to the 13,200 job cuts Citigroup has announced this year to date. * CREDIT SUISSE GROUP ( CSGN.VX ) The bank has axed a total of more than 1,320 jobs, with the majority in investment banking, since the start of the credit crisis last year. * DEUTSCHE BANK AG ( DBKGn.DE ) The biggest German bank has laid off about 450 people in corporate finance and investment banking this year. * GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC ( GS.N ) The world's largest securities firm laid off hundreds of investment bankers in June, according to people familiar with the situation and Wall Street recruiters. In April Goldman initiated a round of market-related cuts, hitting such areas as leveraged lending and mortgage securities, though none have been announced publicly. In January the bank said it planned to lay off about 5 percent of its global workforce, or 1,500 jobs, deemed the poorest performers. * HSBC HOLDINGS PLC ( HSBA.L ) Europe's biggest bank said in September it will close its U.S. subprime mortgage unit, laying off 750 employees. * JPMORGAN CHASE & CO ( JPM.N ) More than 7,600 Bear Stearns Co's employees, or about 55 percent of its staff, are expected to lose their jobs as the investment bank is absorbed into JPMorgan, JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon said on May 21. On May 13, people familiar with the situation said JPMorgan could cut as many as 4,000 employees worldwide, with roughly 2,000 slated to be replaced by counterparts from Bear Stearns. Between mid-August and before its incorporation into JPMorgan, Bear Stearns announced about 1,500 job cuts. * LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS INC LEH.N The Wall Street investment bank is laying off 5 percent of its global workforce, or about 1,430 people, due to tough market conditions, a person briefed on the matter said in March. * MERRILL LYNCH & CO INC MER.N The U.S. investment bank said on April 17 it would cut headcount by 4,000 from year-end 2007 levels, mainly in global markets and investment banking and support areas, with retail brokers immune to the axe. * MORGAN STANLEY ( MS.N ) The U.S. investment bank is cutting 5 percent of employees across almost every business, excluding the retail brokerage division. This affects about 2,350 people. * NATIONAL CITY CORP NCC.N National City, one of the top 10 U.S. banks, has slashed at least 3,400 jobs since mid-2007, mostly in mortgages. * UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) Europe's worst-hit bank has axed about 7,000 jobs since 2007, mostly in investment banking and fixed income. * UNICREDIT SPA ( CRDI.MI ) Europe's fourth-largest bank said last month it will shed 9,000 posts out of 100,000 in Germany, Austria and its domestic base Italy. * WACHOVIA CORP WB.N In April, the U.S. regional bank said headcount in markets and investment banking had been reduced by 14 percent this year and would be cut an additional 12 percent during the second quarter. Combined, these moves eliminate one of four trading and banking unit jobs. (Compiled by Olesya Dmitracova)
