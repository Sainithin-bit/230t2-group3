 SUN VALLEY, Idaho  (Reuters) - NBC Universal Chief Executive Jeff Zucker said on Thursday he was not looking to spin off or sell some of the company's assets. 

 "It's completely untrue. Nothing to it," Zucker said at the Allen & Co media conference here, referring to a report this week that the company was considering such moves. NBC Universal -- which is part of General Electric Co ( GE.N ), along with private equity firms Bain Capital and Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) -- purchased The Weather Channel from Landmark Communications earlier this week. The New York Post on Wednesday cited sources as saying Zucker was looking to do deals and remake NBC's overall approach. The company is interested in exploring deals for its television stations, theme parks, Ion TV network and Shop NBC, the newspaper cited a banking source close to NBC as saying. NBC, Walt Disney Co ( DIS.N ) and Hearst Corp may also talk about ways to simplify, through some sort of buyout, the complicated ownership structure the three companies share in cable networks A&E and The History Channel, the Post reported the banking source as saying.
