 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) Chief Executive Rick Wagoner on Thursday said speculation that the top U.S. automaker was potentially a candidate for a bankruptcy filing was "inaccurate." 

 Wagoner, who was speaking to reporters in remarks broadcast by business network CNBC, said GM had no plans to eliminate any brands beyond its Hummer SUV line. He also said GM could cut truck production more deeply if the U.S. market shifted farther toward passenger cars. "We don't have plans to eliminate any more brands," Wagoner said. GM shares fell to a new low of $9.42 on Thursday. Last week, Merrill Lynch warned that a bankruptcy filing by the automaker was "not impossible" because of continued projected losses.
