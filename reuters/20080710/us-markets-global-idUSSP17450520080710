 LONDON  (Reuters) - World stocks fell towards this week's 21-month low on Thursday as fresh concerns resurfaced over the financial sector -- the epicenter of the nearly one-year-old credit crisis. 

 Woes at top U.S mortgage lenders intensified overnight as Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N fell 13 and 23 percent respectively on concerns the two home finance firms may need to raise tens of billions of dollars of new capital. Merrill Lynch MER.N -- among several banks which report earnings next week -- saw its shares fell nearly 10 percent after Fitch Ratings said it may cut the bank's debt rating given expected writedowns and diminished prospects for earnings. "Sentiment is bad, that's it. I don't see how we are going to get out of this anytime soon," said Giuseppe-Guido Amato, analyst at Lang & Schwarz in Dusseldorf. "The old problems are still the new ones. People said that with the rescue of Bear Stearns, this was the beginning of the end. What rubbish! We see now that we are only at the end of the beginning. This is to be continued." The FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  fell 1.8 percent while MSCI main world equity index .MIWD00000PUS fell 0.5 percent to stand just above Tuesday's 21-month low. U.S. stock futures rose across the board SPc1, pointing to a firmer start on Wall Street, after Wal-Mart ( WMT.N ), the world's biggest retailer, raised its second-quarter profit outlook. MSCI world equity and other indexes in the United States have fallen in the past few weeks to stand down 20 percent from their peaks, joining their European and Japanese counterparts to plunge into bear market territory. "Fears over the banks continue," said Justin Urquhart Stewart, investment director at Seven Investment Management. "But some shares have fallen to levels where they were in 1988 and people are increasingly thinking about value, which could prompt a rally in the next few weeks." STAGFLATION FEARS Financial markets are facing headwinds as the credit crisis-induced slowdown in the U.S. economy spreads into other parts of the world. Adding to such evidence, data showed French industry output fell 2.6 percent in May, hit by a slump in the automobile and energy sectors. Italian industry output also fell. Surging oil prices are also fanning inflation concerns, a case illustrated by fresh data showing Japan's annual wholesale price inflation hit a 27-year high of 5.6 percent in June from a year earlier. The euro fell a quarter percent on the day to $1.5697. "Overall, this (French data) clearly indicates that the European economy is decelerating very fast and confirms our view that the ECB will have to focus on growth in the medium term," ING said in a note to clients. The dollar was up 0.3 percent against a basket of major currencies .DXY. Emerging sovereign spreads were unchanged while emerging stocks .MSCIEF were steady on the day. The September Bund future fell 16 ticks. U.S. light crude rose 0.2 percent at $136.35 a barrel, still staying off last week's record high above $145. Gold rose to $927.40 an ounce, supported by escalating tensions in the Middle East after Iran test-fired missiles. (Additional reporting by  Sylvia Westall  and Sitaraman Shankar)
