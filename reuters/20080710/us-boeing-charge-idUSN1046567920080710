 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Thursday its second-quarter results will include a charge of 22 cents a share due to previously acknowledged delays on its Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) program. 

 Boeing said it continues to expect earnings per share of $5.70 to $5.85 in 2008 and double-digit earnings growth in 2009, with 2009 earnings per share guidance unchanged at $6.80 to $7.00. (Reporting by  Mark McSherry ; editing by John Wallace)
