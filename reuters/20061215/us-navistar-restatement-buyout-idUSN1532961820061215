 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The top executive at Navistar International Corp. ( NAV.N ) signaled on Friday that the company, which has been struggling to get its finances in order, was open to buyout offers. 

 "If you've got a lot of money, come over and see us," Navistar Chief Executive Dan Ustian said after an analyst asked whether any parties had expressed interest in helping management take the company private. Ustian would not say whether the company had been approached. The question came up in a conference call with investors to talk about Navistar's announcement that it won't meet its own deadline for filing delayed financials.
