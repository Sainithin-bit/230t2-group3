 SILVER SPRING, Maryland  (Reuters) - The Sanofi-Aventis 
antibiotic Ketek is safe enough to stay on the market for 
treating pneumonia, but regulators should withdraw approval for 
bronchitis and sinusitis, a U.S. advisory panel said on Friday. 

  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel of outside 
experts made the recommendations after reviewing information 
about liver failure, blurred vision, loss of consciousness and 
other problems reported in some users.  Panel members voted 16-3 to back continued sales of Ketek 
for treating pneumonia acquired outside of a hospital. They 
voted 17-2 against allowing Sanofi to keep promoting the drug 
for acute bacterial worsening of bronchitis and acute bacterial 
sinusitis.  The FDA will make the final decision but usually takes the 
advice of its advisory panels.  The agency approved Ketek, also known generically as 
telithromycin, in 2004.
