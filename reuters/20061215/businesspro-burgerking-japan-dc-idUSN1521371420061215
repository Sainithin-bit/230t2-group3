 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fast food chain Burger King Holdings 
Inc. BKC.N said on Friday it had awarded rights to develop 
restaurants in Japan, clearing the way for one to open in Tokyo 
in the first half of next year as part of the company's 
international development strategy. 

  Development rights were awarded to Burger King Japan Co. 
Ltd., a joint venture between Lotte Co. Ltd., part of a 
Japanese conglomerate, and Revamp Corp., another Japanese 
partner.  There are more than 11,100 Burger King restaurants in the 
United States and 65 countries, with about 90 percent of those 
owned and operated by independent franchisees.  Shares of the company closed at $21.04 on Thursday. The 
stock is up about 20 percent so far this year. Shares of rival 
McDonald's Corp. ( MCD.N ) have climbed 29 percent.
