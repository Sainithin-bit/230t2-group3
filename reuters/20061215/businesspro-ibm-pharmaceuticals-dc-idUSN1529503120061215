 BOSTON  (Reuters) - IBM said on Friday it has developed 
technology to help drug distributors, manufacturers and 
retailers prevent counterfeit drugs from making their way into 
the market. 

  The product works using an existing technology: radio 
frequency identification devices (RFID) that each have a unique 
ID transmitted via tiny radio antennas incorporated into a 
drug's packaging.  Computer receivers pick up the data at various transit 
points in the drug distribution channel, making it easy to 
track a package's location and also update inventory records.  International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ) said that its 
new technology provides a framework that allows retailers and 
distributors to communicate with manufacturers over secure 
networks, allowing them to confirm that each package is 
authentic and not a counterfeit that somehow made its way into 
the supply chain.  The Armonk, New York, computer company said that it has 
sold the technology to two large drug wholesalers -- 
AmerisourceBergen Corp. ( ABC.N ) and Cardinal Health Inc.  ( CAH.N ).  British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline Plc ( GSK.L ) has said it 
is working with IBM on the RFID project.  IBM said it is also testing the product with several drug 
large retailers, though the computer company declined to 
identify them by name.
