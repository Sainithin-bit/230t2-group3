 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - CBS Corp. said on Friday it will revive its storied CBS Records music label to supply its television shows with less expensive music and to generate digital sales. 

 The company, home to the "CSI" crime drama franchise, inked a deal with Apple Computer Inc.'s iTunes online music service to sell the label's music and videos, which will also be available at www.cbsrecords.com. The new CBS Records aims to tap unsigned musicians who write and perform their own songs that will be used and promoted on prime-time TV shows. The strategy helps CBS reduce licensing fees for using music from other labels on its shows. Owning the music also makes negotiating Internet video deals for CBS shows less complicated and more profitable, as TV show producers seek to strike deals with online video services such as Google Inc.'s YouTube. CBS's online videos on the YouTube service were among the most popular in its first month of the deal. "With more consumers choosing the online download model as the preferred way to purchase their favorite songs, we have an opportunity to use our unique and broad collection of media platforms to create a new music label paradigm for a small price of admission," CBS Chief Executive Leslie Moonves said in a statement. The CBS Records brand dates back to 1938, when CBS acquired American Record Corp, which owned the Columbia brand in the United States. Columbia was one of the first companies to sell pre-recorded music and its roots go back to the late 188Os. CBS Records has been home to top artists including Bob Dylan, Tony Bennett, Aerosmith, Frank Sinatra and Bruce Springsteen. CBS sold the label to Sony Corp. in the late 1980s for about $2 billion. The new CBS Records will launch with no actual vinyl records and plans to sell conventional CDs through partnerships with outside companies. At launch, the label has signed three acts, including 2007 Grammy Award nominee P.J. Olsson, rock band Senor Happy, whose album "I'm Sorry" will be released by CBS Records in January, and Will Dailey, whose song has been on CBS's "Jericho" show. The strategy appears similar to CBS' approach to the movies industry. Moonves has said CBS may create a movie studio focused on financing small budget movies. Owning its own films could help it save on fees it currently pays to other studios to offer films on its cable channel Showtime.
