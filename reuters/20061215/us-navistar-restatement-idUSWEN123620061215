 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Truck and engine maker Navistar International Corp. ( NAV.N ) warned on Friday that it will miss its own deadline for filing delayed financial reports and that the New York Stock Exchange plans to suspend trading in its shares by December 20 and begin procedures to delist the stock. 

 The news sent Navistar shares, which have rallied in recent months on hopes the company was putting its accounting issues behind it, down 9 percent in early trading. In a statement, Bill Caton, the company's chief finance officer, said Navistar's "commitment to accuracy will extend the completion of our 2005 financial statements beyond February 1, 2007, which will then be followed by the completion of our 2006 financial statements." In June, the Warrenville, Illinois-based company, which has not reported earnings since 2005 and is restating results back to 2002, promised to file the restated numbers and delayed results "shortly before" mid-January, when it is scheduled to file its 2006 Form 10-K. The delay is the latest setback in Navistar's year-long effort to clean up its books and burnish its image on Wall Street. Those troubles began in mid-January, when the company said it would not file its form 10-K annual report with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on time. Navistar blamed the delay on a disagreement with its auditors at Deloitte and Touche over "complex and technical accounting issues." It suggested the issue was exacerbated when a key member of Deloitte's audit team, who was more familiar with Navistar's finances, went on an unexpected, extended medical leave. The delay prompted some Navistar bondholders to claim the company was in default on its debt and forced Robert Lannert, Navistar's retiring chief finance officer, to stay on even as he underwent treatment for cancer. In April, Navistar fired Deloitte and Touche and hired KPMG as its new independent auditor. At the same time, it warned that it needed to restate earnings back to 2002 to fix accounting errors. Navistar said the items requiring correction included the way it had timed the booking of some receivables, the way it accounted for warranties honored after they had technically expired, and the way it had shifted balances and expense amounts between reporting periods at one of its foundries. In June, when the company promised to get current by mid-January, it said its audit committee had hired an independent law firm to look into vendor rebates, one of most important issues Deloitte identified as problematic, and that the law firm had "found no evidence of fraud or intentional misconduct." Getting delisted from the NYSE could be bad news for Navistar shareholders because it would likely result in some institutional investors selling the issue. In addition, Navistar would risk being replaced in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Being ousted from the index would put additional selling pressure on the shares because S&P 500 index fund managers would drop Navistar from their holdings. In early NYSE trading on Friday, Navistar shares were down $3.12 at $31.03. Over the past three months, the shares have risen more than 30 percent as investors bet that the company, which is benefiting from strong sales ahead of new clean-air rules, would overcome its problems.
