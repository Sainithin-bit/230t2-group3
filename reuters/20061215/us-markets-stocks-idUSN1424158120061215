 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Friday as tame consumer price data reassured investors that inflation was under control and the economy will still grow strongly enough to support the equity market. 

 But declines in energy shares, which had risen in recent days, braked the market's advance. Investors earlier pushed the Dow to an intraday record high after more robust earnings reports, particularly from technology companies, underpinned the increasingly favorable sentiment about the U.S. economy. Shares of Adobe Systems Inc. ( ADBE.O ) gained 5.2 percent to $42.92 on the Nasdaq after the design software maker late on Thursday reported higher profits and a first-quarter outlook in line with Wall Street forecasts.

The November report on the U.S. Consumer Price Index relieved worries the Federal Reserve might have to resume raising interest rates to keep inflation in check. Both CPI and core CPI, which excludes food and energy, were unchanged from October, the Labor Department said. "The report showed consumer prices were unchanged and that is a good thing. People think the Fed is done raising rates and that we will have solid growth in the first and second quarters," an outlook which helped the stock market, said Anthony Conroy, head trader with BNY Brokerage, a unit of Bank of New York in New York. However, slipping energy stocks curbed some of the markets' gains, traders said. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 32.29 points, or 0.26 percent, at 12,449.05. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 2.07 points, or 0.15 percent, at 1,427.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was up 4.24 points, or 0.17 percent, at 2,458.09. Shares of companies whose performance is closely tied to the economy, such as General Electric Co. ( GE.N ), rose after the data. GE shot up 3.4 percent to $37.45 on the New York Stock Exchange. It ranked as the S&P 500's biggest advancer as momentum carried it through technical levels, pushing the stock to a two-year high at $37.50. GE was the biggest contributor to the Dow's rise, followed by Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ). Shares of Honeywell gained 2.3 percent to $43.65. Honeywell's products range from cockpit electronics to temperature-management systems for buildings. Oil shares fell, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange's Oil Index .OIX declined nearly 1 percent, falling back from the lifetime high reached the day before. The index surged to the new record on Thursday as shares of major components, including Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), rose to their highest levels ever. On Friday, Exxon was down 1.5 percent at $77.53.
