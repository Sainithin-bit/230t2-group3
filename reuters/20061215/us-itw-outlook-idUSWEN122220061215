 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Illinois Tool Works Inc. ( ITW.N ) cut its quarterly profit outlook on Friday, becoming the latest manufacturer to warn of the effects of a slowing U.S. economy. 

 ITW, which also said it had already suffered two months of lower-than-expected base revenue growth, now expects to earn 72 cents to 74 cents a share in the fourth quarter, compared with a previous range of 77 cents to 81 cents. Analysts on average had expected fourth-quarter profit of 78 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. ITW shares fell $1.17, or 2.4 percent, to $46.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Eli Lustgarten, a senior analyst at Longbow Research, said the warning is the result of slowing U.S. economic activity. "We're about to enter a period of lower than average growth at the company," the St. Louis-based analyst said. "It really reflects the softening of the domestic economy. ... We're going to have to get through the next couple of quarters, which in our view is going to be a little dicey." Lustgarten early this month cut his rating on ITW shares to "hold" from "buy." He does not own the shares. The Glenview, Illinois-based maker of products ranging from fasteners to food service equipment said operating revenue had risen 10 percent for the three-month period ended November 30 and that it anticipated weak sales in North America in December. ITW's fourth quarter and fiscal year end December 31, but the company commonly provides trailing three month revenue figures as a performance indicator. ITW is not the first U.S. manufacturer to warn the economic slowdown will take a toll on results. Agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co. ( DE.N ) last month said it expected 2007 profits to be lower than this year's, as a result of a slowdown in the construction and forestry business. Top executives at heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) and diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) have also warned of slowing activity. ITW shares have risen 6 percent so far this year, lagging the 11.7 percent climb of the Standard & Poor's Capital Goods Industry Group Index. .GSPIC (Additional reporting by  Christian Plumb  in New York)
