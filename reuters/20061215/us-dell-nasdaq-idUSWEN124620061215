 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell DELL.O said on Friday it received a letter from Nasdaq saying the computer maker was not in compliance with listing requirements because it was late in filing its fiscal third-quarter report. 

 The world's No. 2 PC maker previously said it would delay filing the report due to an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into the company's accounting and financial reporting for possible misstatements. In addition to the SEC, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the company's audit committee have raised questions about Dell's financial reporting. Last month, Dell delayed publishing third-quarter results due to the accounting probes. When it did report -- nearly a week late -- it said results were preliminary and it did not expect to file its quarterly report on time with the SEC. Round Rock, Texas-based Dell also has not yet filed its second-quarter earnings report with the SEC. Earlier this year, Dell recalled batteries made by Sony Corp. in what was the biggest-ever consumer electronics recall. It has also had complaints of poor after-sales service and recently lost its status as top PC maker to longtime rival Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) Dell shares fell 34 cents, or 1.3 percent, to close at $26.53 on Nasdaq.
