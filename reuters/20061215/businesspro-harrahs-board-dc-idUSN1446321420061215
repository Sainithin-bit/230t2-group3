 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - No decision was expected on Thursday 
by the Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N board on offers 
worth $15.5 billion or more for the world's largest casino 
company, a person familiar with the matter said. 

  Harrah's, which operates casinos under the Harrah's, 
Caesars and Horseshoe brand names, has drawn interest from at 
least two groups of bidders and could also consider a leveraged 
recapitalization, sources have said previously.  But the company has so far only acknowledged one offer 
publicly, leaving investors waiting for news on the takeover 
saga that has been dragging on for more than two months.  Las Vegas-based Harrah's had set a deadline of Tuesday on 
all bids and its board of directors met this week to consider 
the offers, according to sources.  On October 2, Harrah's said a committee of non-management 
directors was reviewing a takeover offer of $81 per share from 
private equity firms Apollo Management and Texas Pacific Group 
TPG.UL. The group, which has since raised its offer to 
$83.50, could further increase the bid to above $87.50 per 
share, according to sources.  Harrah's has also drawn the interest of a group led by Penn 
National Gaming Inc. ( PENN.O ) and hedge fund D.E. Shaw, sources 
have said.
