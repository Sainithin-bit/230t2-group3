 BEIJING  (Reuters) - U.S. Energy Secretary Sam Bodman was disappointed by OPEC's decision on Thursday to cut production further, he said on Friday. 

 The oil exporters' group agreed on Thursday to cut output by 500,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 2 percent, but starting on February 1. when the northern winter period of peak demand is ending. "I am disappointed if in fact they end up cutting supply. I am gratified that they are putting it off here for another month or six weeks. Hopefully (it will) give them more time to evaluate," Bodman told reporters ahead of an U.S.-Asia energy summit. Bodman said the need for supply adjustments should be judged in the light of longer term trends, especially given doubts in the market that OPEC members had fully implemented the group's previous output cut, decided in October. "There are a lot of uncertainties in the market as to the efficacy of what had happened the last time they made cuts," Bodman said. "It has been my position all along that trying to look at this over the short term -- a month, two months, three months -- it's really very difficult." OPEC, which pumps over a third of the world's oil, decided in October to cut output by 1.2 million bpd to 26.3 million, from November 1, to halt a 10-week, 25 percent price decline. By postponing a further reduction until peak demand has passed, OPEC is acknowledging consumer countries' concerns that a cut now would drive prices higher and hurt their economies.
