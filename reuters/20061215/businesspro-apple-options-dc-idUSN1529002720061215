 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Apple Computer Inc. ( AAPL.O ), which 
is undergoing an independent investigation into its historical 
stock option practices, filed with the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission on Friday to delay its 10-K annual report 
filing. 

  The company said it will need to restate its past financial 
statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expense 
relating to past stock option grants. The amount of the 
restatements and which periods will need to be restated are 
being reviewed, Apple said.  Apple has previously disclosed that an internal 
investigation found irregularities with its past stock option 
grants, making it among the long list of companies wrapped up 
in the options scandal.  When it disclosed the irregularities, in October, the 
makers of the popular iPod digital media device and Macintosh 
computer said it would likely need to restate its past 
financial statements.  Because Apple is still studying the amount of charges it 
will need to take when it restates its results, it has delayed 
filing the annual report for the year ended September 30, 2006.  It was supposed to file the report by December 14. The 
company said it will now file the annual report within 15 days 
of that date.  Shares of Apple were down 51 cents at $88.04 in early 
Nasdaq trade.
