 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) Chief Financial Officer Fritz Henderson said on Thursday it is "feasible" but "would be tight" for the auto maker to hammer out a deal with Delphi Corp. by the end of the first quarter of 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site. 

 The paper reported him saying in an interview that it "is actually quite feasible" they could have an agreement in place by the end of the second quarter. GM and Delphi, which is GM's former parts unit and is under bankruptcy protection, are negotiating over how much the auto maker must pay to cover the costs of pensions and other benefits for Delphi union workers who spent part of their careers as GM employees, the paper said. GM was not immediately available for comment.
