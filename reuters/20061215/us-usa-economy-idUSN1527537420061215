 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices held steady in November, confounding expectations of a small rise, as energy and vehicle costs dropped, according to a government report on Friday that eased inflation worries. 

 A separate report showed output at U.S. factories, mines and utilities rose more than expected in November, pointing to resilience among producers. Consumer prices were unchanged in November even when volatile food and energy costs were stripped out, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Reuters were expecting consumer prices and core prices both to rise by 0.2 percent. Markets saw consumer prices as evidence the U.S. Federal Reserve can stand down from its readiness to raise interest rates if necessary to damp down higher-than-desirable inflation, and can now cut rates to help an unevenly growing economy return to full potential. Blue chip stocks and bonds rose on the data, which reassured investors that the economy is growing and inflation is under control. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended at a record high 12,445, while the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note US10YT=RR, which moves in inverse relation to its price, slipped to 4.6 percent after falling as low as 4.51 percent. Fed funds futures rose after the reports to show perceived chances of a March interest rate cut by the Fed as high as 28 percent from 10 percent just before the data, but chances slipped to 14 percent as the day wore on. Markets now fully expect a rate cut by the end of June. "All we wanted from this holiday season was a little more growth and a little less inflation, and Santa looks like he has delivered. This is just a great report," Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina. Consumer prices and core consumer prices were also lower than expected over 12 months. Consumer prices rose a less-than-expected 2 percent over 12 months while core consumer prices rose 2.6 percent from November a year ago. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 2.2 percent 12-month rise in consumer prices and a 2.7 percent gain in core prices from November 2005. The full-year core price gain was lower for the second month in a row after reaching a more than 10-year high of 2.9 percent in September. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said November 29 inflation was "uncomfortably high," but he expected slower growth to ease some price pressures. An index of personal consumption expenditures, a favorite inflation reading of the Fed's, is due to be released December 22. Contributing to lower core prices for November, prices for new and used vehicles fell 0.8 percent, the Labor Department said. At the same time, housing prices rose 0.4 percent and the shelter component was up 0.4 percent. The impact of lower energy prices was also evident in real average weekly earnings by U.S. workers, which rose 0.2 percent in November. Inflation-adjusted weekly earnings were up for the third month in a row, after falling in five of eight months, the Labor Department said. Industrial production rose 0.2 percent in November on gains in manufacturing, but that was after a revision showing output had been weaker in October than originally reported. Industrial capacity use was unchanged last month, the Federal Reserve said. Analysts saw the industrial production data as alleviating worries about the outlook for growth. "There was no evidence of a broadening out of weakness beyond the construction sector," said Pierre Ellis, a senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. "Concerns about worse problems with the economy than already perceived will dissipate," he said. A Treasury Department report showed net overall capital inflows into the United States rose to $62.2 billion in October and were more than sufficient to cover the U.S. trade deficit of $58.9 billion in that month.
