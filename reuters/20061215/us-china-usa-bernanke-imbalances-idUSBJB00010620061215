 BEIJING  (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday that global imbalances were caused in part by the low savings rate in the United States, but that the high savings rate in China and elsewhere -- as well as surpluses in oil-producing countries -- was also a factor. 

 Speaking at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, Bernanke said that a more flexible yuan  CNY=CFXS  would have significant advantages for China, adding that Chinese firms seek more export business than they might otherwise because the currency is undervalued. Bernanke was in Beijing as part of a high-level U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson. U.S. officials are trying to persuade China to work toward a freely floating currency, which they believe could help lessen China's massive trade surplus with the United States. As talks between U.S. and Chinese officials began on Thursday, China let the yuan hit its highest level since it revalued the currency by 2.1 percent in July 2005 and began to allow it to float within tightly managed bands.
