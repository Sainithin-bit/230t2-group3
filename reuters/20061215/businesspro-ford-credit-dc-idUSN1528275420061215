 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) on Friday said it 
has entered a credit agreement including a $7 billion term loan 
facility and a five-year $11.485 billion revolving credit 
facility. 

  Borrowings will be secured by Ford's assets, including 
domestic auto plants, stock of subsidiaries including Ford 
Motor Credit Co. and Volvo, and up to $4 billion in domestic 
cash, the automaker said in a filing with the U.S. Securities 
and Exchange Commission.  The second-largest U.S. automaker had said last week said 
it planned to borrow $18 billion by pledging assets as 
collateral for loans in a plan that included about $8 billion 
in secured revolving credit.  The borrowing plan, which prompted ratings cuts by all 
three credit rating agencies, is expected to finance Ford's 
efforts to rescue its North American operation. The unit has 
lost $12.39 billion before taxes and including special items 
since January 2005.
