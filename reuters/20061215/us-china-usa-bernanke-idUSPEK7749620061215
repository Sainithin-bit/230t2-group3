 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Chinese policy-makers risk losing control of their economy unless they let the yuan rise in value and strengthen their financial system, U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Friday. 

 Bernanke was in Beijing as part of a high-level U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson that was trying to persuade China to let its currency float more freely to help reduce economic global economic imbalances. "Monetary policy may be constrained by the lack of a reliable monetary transmission mechanism and by the relative inflexibility of the exchange rate, which inhibit the central bank's ability to keep inflation low and to stabilize the economy," Bernanke said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing. U.S. officials want a stronger yuan  CNY=CFXS  to help cut America's record trade deficit with China. This reached $24.4 billion in October, 40 percent of the total U.S. trade deficit. But Bernanke stressed that a freer-floating yuan, also known as the renminbi (RMB), was very much in China's self-interest. "More flexibility in the RMB would have important advantages. Forget about the rest of the world: it would have important advantages for China. Without having flexibility in the exchange rate, China cannot have an independent monetary policy," he said in answer to a question after his speech. A stronger yuan, combined with a wider trading band and with the ultimate goal of a market-determined exchange rate, would allow an effective and independent monetary policy and thereby help to enhance China's future growth and stability, he said in his speech, which was distributed by the Fed in Washington. A ROLE FOR EVERYONE Answering questions, Bernanke said the low U.S. savings rate was partly to blame for imbalances in the world economy, but high savings rates in China and elsewhere -- as well as surpluses in oil-producing countries -- were also a factor. "Global imbalances are not the results of actions of any single country. It depends on the entire interaction of all the countries in the world," he said. Bernanke omitted a reference that had been in his advance text about the undervalued yuan providing an effective "subsidy" to Chinese exporters. But he stood by his argument that, to the extent the yuan is undervalued, it acts an incentive for companies to produce for export markets rather than for domestic consumption. China on Friday let the yuan hit its highest level since it revalued the currency by 2.1 percent in July 2005 and began to allow it to float within tightly managed bands. Bernanke urged accelerated reform of China's banking and financial system, saying that central banks can best steer monetary policy when investment and borrowing decisions are sensitive to interest rate rises or declines. "Monetary policy can work well only to the extent that financial markets are sufficiently developed to allow the monetary authorities' interest-rate decisions to affect economic activity in a reasonably predictable way," he said. Bernanke warned that China's central bank will eventually run into problems if it continues to sell bonds to offset the currency interventions necessary to hold the yuan down against the dollar -- a process called "sterilization." Also, perceptions that the yuan is undervalued could fuel additional capital inflows as investors bet on a rise in the yuan, he added. Speculative inflows would in turn increase the need for greater exchange market intervention and bond sales. China also faces distortions in the allocation of capital from an undervalued exchange rate and an underdeveloped financial system, Bernanke said. "The principal imbalance lies in the composition of Chinese GDP (gross domestic product), which is heavily tilted toward investment and net exports and away from domestic consumption and government provision of social services," he said.
