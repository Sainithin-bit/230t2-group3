 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Two casino companies in Atlantic City 
and the New Jersey Transit signed a contract on Thursday, 
finalizing train service between New York and the 
second-largest U.S. gambling market, a spokesman for one of the 
companies said. 

  The service, scheduled to start in about a year, is 
expected to help Atlantic City casinos attract younger and more 
affluent customers from New York. Now, customers usually take 
either a bus or drive from New York City to the oceanside 
resort.  "This will help us attract customers who haven't yet 
visited Atlantic City," said Michael Facenda, a spokesman for 
the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa, a joint venture between Boyd 
Gaming Corp. ( BYD.N ) and MGM Mirage ( MGM.N ).  Borgata and Harrah's Entertainment Inc. HET.N, the 
world's largest gambling company, have formed a joint venture 
company for the purpose, Facenda said. They are investing about 
$17 million to buy and refurbish the rail cars.  The companies have bought eight cars from Bombardier Inc. 
( BBDb.TO ), Facenda said.  New Jersey Transit, the state's public transportation 
corporation, is contributing two electric locomotives and , 
will operate train. New Jersey's Casino Reinvestment 
Development Authority will give $1.5 million a year for two 
diesel locomotives.  The rail service will initially operate from Friday to 
Sunday and is expected to carry about 2,000 people back and 
forth every weekend, Facenda said.  The express train from New York's Penn Station will likely 
have one stop in New Jersey on its way to Atlantic City, 
Facenda said. The trip should take about 2 hours 40 minutes, 
about the same time as it takes on a bus from Manhattan, the 
casinos estimated.
