 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street is set for a firmer start to Friday trade, hovering near multi-year highs, as investors shrug off steeper crude oil prices and focus on recent buoyant corporate earnings ahead of key inflation data 

 "The market is rallying and feeding on itself. It's more of a seasonal pattern than anything else. I'm a little bit cautious going into next year," said Nick Skiming, fund manager at Ashburton in Jersey. "I think the market is fairly valued, the earnings have been very good. I am a little bit worried that the oil price continues to rise." By 1111 GMT, U.S. stock futures were pointing to opening flat to up 0.2 percent for the three main indexes SPc1 DJc1 NDc1. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed at a record high, up 0.8 percent at 12,416.8, while the broad S&P Index  .SPX  hit a six-year high and closed up 0.9 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  finished up 0.9 percent. Crude oil edged up toward $63 a barrel after OPEC agreed to cut supply for a second time in two months, underlining its desire to manage the global market and prop up prices. CONSUMER PRICES No S&P500 companies are scheduled to report earnings, while U.S. November CPI at 1330 GMT dominates the economic agenda. Economists polled by Reuters say overall U.S. consumer prices are likely to have risen in November on the back of higher energy costs, while prices excluding food and energy are likely to also have climbed compared with the previous month. The Consumer Price Index, the government's broadest measure of consumer inflation, is expected to have risen 0.2 percent, according to the median forecast of 82 economists polled. The median prediction on the CPI core rate, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, is also for an 0.2 percent increase. In corporate news, Dell Inc.
