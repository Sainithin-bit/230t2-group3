 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tool maker Black & Decker Corp. BDK.N 
on Friday cut its fourth quarter and full-year earnings 
forecast, citing weak sales in the United States of power tools 
and other products. 

  The company said it now expects earnings of $1.30 to $1.35 
a share in the fourth quarter and $6.50 for the year.  Analysts on average forecast $1.85 a share for the quarter 
and $7.01 for the full year.
