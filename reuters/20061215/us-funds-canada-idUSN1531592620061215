 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Global equity and balanced mutual funds proved to be hot sellers with Canadian investors in November, representing the biggest components of the month's C$2.6 billion ($2.2 billion) in net fund sales, an industry group said on Friday. 

 Total net sales, excluding reinvested distributions, were 25 percent higher than a year earlier, and 57 percent above the previous month, according to data from the Investment Funds Institute of Canada. Foreign equity funds have been rising in popularity, with some industry players citing rich stock prices and realized gains in Canada as factors prompting investors to look abroad for future returns. The S&P/TSX Composite Index  .GSPTSE  rose 3 percent in November, and is up 15 percent year-to-date. Foreign common-share funds racked up C$1.57 billion in net sales in November, followed by balanced funds with C$1.2 billion, IFIC said. Meanwhile, investors pulled money out of Canadian and U.S. equity funds, with net redemptions of C$644 million and C$121 million, respectively. The monthly outflow from Canadian equity funds was the eighth in a row, UBS strategist George Vasic said in a research note. "The big question was the severity of the reaction in income trusts," Vasic wrote, referring to a broad selloff after the Canadian government's October 31 announcement that it would begin taxing distributions from income trusts. Net redemptions in November equaled nearly 5 percent of income trust assets at the end of October, Vasic said. Overall, healthy net sales and strong capital markets have pushed up total mutual fund assets by 16 percent over last year, to C$646.2 billion, IFIC Vice-President Pat Dunwoody said in a statement. There were net inflows into money-market funds in November, while net sales of long-term funds stood at C$2.3 billion, down 10 percent from a year earlier. Gross sales of all types of funds totaled C$15.6 billion, while gross redemptions were C$12.9 billion. One of the faster growing companies by net assets in November was Brandes Investment Partners, which lured well-known money manager Kim Shannon away from CI Financial Income Fund CIX_u.TO in early October. Assets at Brandes grew to C$5.56 billion from C$5.27 billion in October. Shannon's investment firm will manage four funds for Brandes. CI Financial, the country's third-largest fund manager, posted net redemptions of C$213 million in November, although assets under management still grew by 2.4 percent to C$61.6 billion, the firm said on December 1. CI cited institutional investors for the redemptions. IFIC calculates CI's assets differently, putting the figure at C$59 billion at the end of November. As for the other top fund managers, IGM Financial Inc. ( IGM.TO ) saw assets under management grow by 2.6 percent in November to C$104.1 billion, while RBC Asset Management, a unit of Royal Bank of Canada ( RY.TO ), posted 3.2 percent growth in assets to C$70.7 billion, according to IFIC.
