 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS said it would 
voluntarily exchange globally 3.2 million straps attached to 
the controllers of its Wii game console with stronger ones 
after some reports of broken straps. 

  Nintendo also said it would recall about 200,000 AC 
adapters for its hot-selling DS and DS Lite handheld game 
machines in Japan, because they may overheat and cause burns on 
rare occasions.  No injury is reported so far, the Kyoto-based game maker 
said on Friday.  The adapter recall is expected to cost between 100 million 
yen and 200 million yen ($848,600-$1.7 million), and it is yet 
to be decided how the cost will be divided between Nintendo and 
the supplier of the AC adapter, Nagano Japan Radio Co. Ltd. 
( 6878.T ).  The Wii, which competes with Sony Corp.'s ( 6758.T ) 
PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Corp.'s ( MSFT.O ) Xbox 360, features 
a motion-sensitive controller that allows players to control 
the game by swinging the device like a tennis racket or 
wielding it like a sword.  The exchange is expected to cost Nintendo several hundred 
million yen, the company said. Both the AC adapter recall and 
the strap exchange will probably have little effect on its 
earnings, the company added.  For the year to March 2007, Nintendo forecast operating 
profit of 145 billion yen on sales of 740 billion yen.  Prior to the announcement, shares in Nintendo closed up 3.6 
percent at 29,420 yen, outperforming the Nikkei average 
 .N225 , which gained 0.51 percent.  ($1=117.84 Yen)
