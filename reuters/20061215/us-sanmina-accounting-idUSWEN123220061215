 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Electronics manufacturer Sanmina-SCI Corp. ( SANM.O ) said on Friday that it won't be able to file its annual 10-K report with the U.S. Securities & Exchange commission on time as it waits for its auditors to complete their review of the document. 

 The San Jose, California, company said that it expects to submit its 10-K annual report for the year ended September 30 to the SEC before the end of an automatic 15-day extension period. The delay is linked to an internal probe into Sanmina's historical stock option grant accounting practices. In October the company said that its board had determined that it would be necessary to restate historical results to record additional expenses for stock-based compensation.
