 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Investment bank Morgan Stanley's 
( MS.N ) Chief Executive John Mack has been awarded a bonus worth 
about $40 million in stock and options for 2006, according to a 
regulatory filing on Thursday. 

  The payout comes amid a boom time for investment banks, 
advising private equity firms flush with cash in their pursuit 
of acquisitions, raking in hedge fund fees and profiting from 
elevated levels of bond and stock trading.  The high profits are translating into multi-million dollar 
bonus awards for bankers -- two studies released in November 
show that Wall Street bonuses should rise by double-digit 
percentages this year.  However, Mack's compensation is likely to be topped by one 
or more of his rivals, according to a report published on 
Friday on The Wall Street Journal's Web site.  The paper said that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) Chief 
Executive Lloyd Blankfein's compensation will exceed $50 
million, citing a person familiar with the matter. The paper 
said that is believed to be a record for big-firm chief 
executives.  Goldman Sachs was not immediately available for comment.  Analysts say they expect a handful of other CEOs could make 
$40 million to $50 million or higher, including James Cayne of 
Bear Stearns Cos. BSC.N, Stan O'Neal of Merrill Lynch & Co. 
and Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N, the 
WSJ reported.  Goldman, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers turned in record 
profits this week. Morgan Stanley is scheduled to report its 
fourth quarter earnings next week, according to its Web site.  Bonus time is the highlight of the year for many investment 
bankers, as it constitutes much of the annual compensation of 
senior bankers and traders. Banks typically award bonuses 
between December and February.  Bonuses should rise 15 percent to 20 percent, according to 
Options Group, a New York executive search firm, last month. 
Johnson Associates Inc., a New York compensation consultant, 
estimates a 10 percent to 15 percent increase.
  MACK'S BONUS  According to Morgan Stanley's filing, Mack was awarded 
461,821 stock units convertible to shares on a 1:1 basis on 
December 12. The company's shares closed at $78.40 that day, 
according to Reuters data, valuing the total at $36.2 million.  He was also awarded 178,945 options, which the company 
valued at $22.46 each, giving a total of $4 million. Half the 
options will vest in January 2009 and the remainder in January 
2010.  The filing said that the stock and options reflected 100 
percent of Mack's 2006 above-base compensation. His base pay 
last year was $337,534.  Mack rejoined Morgan Stanley on June 30, 2005 after years 
of weak performance, internal strife and a flood of departures 
led to the ousting of CEO Philip Purcell -- the man who pushed 
out then-President Mack in 2001.  When he rejoined the bank Mack received a special long-term 
new-hire award of 500,000 restricted stock units, valued at 
$26.2 million. Mack cannot sell the shares underlying the units 
until they vest, which generally will not happen until Mack is 
no longer CEO.  In February Morgan Stanley disclosed it awarded Mack $13 
million in cash, stock and other compensation for his first 
five months of work, as reward for his role restoring order at 
the investment bank.  Morgan Stanley's shares, which closed on Thursday at 
$79.60, have risen about 40 percent so far this year, 
outperforming a 23 percent rise in the Amex Securities Dealers 
index .XBD.
