 TOKYO  (Reuters) - For someone who describes himself as lackadaisical, Hiroshi Kimura has had a nonstop, picture-perfect career during his 30 years at Japan Tobacco Inc. ( 2914.T ), the world's third-biggest cigarette maker. 

 Barely in his 30s in the early 1980s, Kimura joined a team tasked to prepare the company to go public in 1985 -- a tectonic shift that would drastically change the future course of the state-owned monopoly. It was around that time that Kimura met his mentor Katsuhiko Honda. Six months ago Honda appointed his protege, now 53, to succeed him as JT's president and chief executive, to the surprise of virtually no one among the company's top brass. The two men, separated by an age gap of nearly 12 years, had sweated it out together in 1999 during a high-profile, high-stakes deal to acquire U.S. rival RJR Reynolds' overseas division for an eye-popping 940 billion yen ($8 billion). As a non-executive vice president of corporate planning at the time, Kimura was hardly the most senior member of JT's negotiating team. But during the talks, which began one March afternoon in New York and concluded the following morning, Kimura proved a tough negotiator who ultimately helped land the deal according to JT's terms. Still, the real work, as he would soon find out, lay ahead. Less than six months into the corporate planning post, Kimura, a native of Yamaguchi prefecture, west of Hiroshima, was assigned to oversee JT's international operations from Geneva, integrating what was previously RJR International into the Japanese company's overseas strategy. The pressure to deliver was compounded by a widely held view in financial markets that JT had overpaid for the maker of Camel cigarettes, Kimura's smoke of choice along with the Cabin brand. Unfazed, Kimura plugged on for the next seven years as executive vice president of JT International, successfully expanding sales and profits at Japan Tobacco, which is still held 50 percent by the government, and earning a reputation as a rare talent with a global vision. It was appropriate grooming for someone who was to eventually take over a company facing a stagnant domestic market. After Honda, Kimura is only the second president to rise from the ranks of JT, after a long line of former Finance Ministry officials. Kimura, a salt-and-pepper-haired chain smoker -- he puffs 30 cigarettes a day -- who likes to go fishing to relieve stress, joined JT straight out of the elite Kyoto University, where he read law. Having witnessed first-hand the fruits of the RJR deal, Kimura was always on the lookout for another acquisition. On Friday, he delivered on those expectations: the world's No.3 tobacco maker announced it would buy smaller rival Gallaher Group Plc GLH.L of Britain for $14.7 billion in the biggest-ever foreign acquisition by a Japanese company. Little known outside the industry until he took the helm at JT in late June, Kimura is likely to cement his reputation as a tough go-getter as Japanese companies increasingly embrace cross-border M&A activity. "There are a lot of people from the government in JT management, and there's always the worry that this is going to mean the company is going to be risk-averse," said Kiyokazu Kurauchi, a senior analyst at Yasuda Asset Management. "With this deal, he's shown that he is quite decisive." Kimura, like many of his peers, faces headwinds as anti-smoking regulations around the world grow tougher and as rising taxes and a declining population in Japan are expected to hit demand. But with two ground-breaking deals on his resume now, he may be on a roll. His ultimate goal? Overtaking Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) and British American Tobacco Plc ( BATS.L ) to turn JT into the biggest tobacco firm in the world.
