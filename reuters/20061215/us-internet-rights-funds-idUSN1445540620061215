 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - New York City employee pension funds are calling on two top Internet companies to do more to protect free speech in repressive countries, joining a year-old campaign by human rights groups. 

 On Thursday, Comptroller William Thompson, on behalf of the New York City Pension Funds, called on Yahoo Inc. and Google Inc. to set up standards to enforce policies to protect freedom of access to the Internet around the globe. The New York City Employees Retirement System and pension funds for the city's police department, fire department, teachers and the board of education system have filed shareholder resolutions with the companies in recent weeks. The resolutions decry human rights violations by governments in Belarus, Myanmar, China, Cuba, Egypt, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam, which block, restrict or monitor Internet use. "Technology companies in the United States have failed to develop adequate standards by which they can conduct business with authoritarian governments while protecting human rights," Thompson said in a statement. Activist shareholders at both the Google and Yahoo annual meetings this year pressed them to do more to challenge state repression of Internet users in countries where they do business. In the third quarter, New York municipal employee pension funds had 687,244 shares (valued at $276.2 million) in Google and 4,372,277 shares in Yahoo (valued at $110.5 million), the comptroller's office said. Yahoo said it was talking with governments on policies to protect the open availability of the Internet. "We respect the work of socially responsible investors and are committed to open communication with our shareholders about Yahoo's business, strategy and policies," said Yahoo spokeswoman Mary Osako. She added that the Sunnyvale, California-based company is talking with other corporate, government, academic and activist organizations on what policies it should observe. A Google spokesman was not immediately available to comment. The pension funds call for the two companies to adhere to standards that protect individual users from being identified in countries that restrict Internet access and make free speech a crime. They asked the companies not to actively participate in censorship requests, to use all legal means to resist, and to inform users clearly when being forced to filter the Web.
