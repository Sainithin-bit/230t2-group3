  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer prices were 
unexpectedly flat in November on a drop in energy costs and 
prices were also unchanged from the previous month when 
volatile food and energy costs were stripped out, defying 
forecasts of an uptick in core prices, a government report 
showed on Friday. 

  Economists polled by Reuters were expecting consumer prices 
and core consumer prices both to rise by 0.2 percent.  Consumer prices and core consumer prices were also lower 
than expected over 12 months, a Labor Department report showed. 
Consumer prices rose a less-than-expected 2 percent over 12 
months while core consumer prices rose 2.6 percent from 
November a year ago.  Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting a 2.2 percent 
12-month rise in consumer prices and a 2.7 percent gain in core 
prices from November 2005.  Energy prices were down 0.2 percent from October and were 
3.8 percent lower than November a year ago.  Transportation prices slipped 0.9 percent in November on a 
4.8 percent decline in airline fares and a 0.7 percent fall in 
new vehicle prices.  Signs of steady consumer prices are likely to give relief 
to the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has said it stands ready to 
raise interest rates if necessary to damp down 
higher-than-desirable levels of inflation.
