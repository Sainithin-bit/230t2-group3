 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's competition regulator said 
on Friday it has started a review into an $8.7 billion buyout 
offer for Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ) from a group led by 
Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX and private equity firm Texas 
Pacific Group. 

  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said it 
will assess the likely effect of the proposed acquisition on 
competition, including how the proposed acquisition would 
affect customers, suppliers and other competitors in the air 
transport industry.  It invited interested parties to give submissions by 
January 29.
