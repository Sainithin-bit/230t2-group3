 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A measure of future U.S. economic expansion continued to improve last week, and the annualized growth rate reached its highest level in over a year, a research group said on Friday. 
 The Economic Cycle Research Institute, a New York-based independent forecasting group, said its Weekly Leading Index rose to 126.7 in the week ended September 21 from a revised 125.3 the previous week. That was originally reported as 125.4. The index's annualized growth rate jumped to 3.8 percent from 2.7 percent, hitting the highest level since June 2011.
