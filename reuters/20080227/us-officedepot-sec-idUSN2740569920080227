 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Office Depot Inc ( ODP.N ) is undergoing a formal investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission into its communications with Wall Street analysts, the New York Post reported on Wednesday. 

 The No. 2 office supplies retailer is being probed for allegedly making a series of phone calls to analysts last June, warning them that weak economic conditions were hurting its sales, the Post reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. It said the SEC launched an informal inquiry into the matter last July, upgrading it to a formal investigation last month. Office Depot was not immediately available for comment. Office Depot posted a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday, hurt by higher expenses and lower sales in North America. It also said Chief Financial Officer Patricia McKay will leave the company on March 1. Charles Brown, president of its international segment, will become acting CFO.
