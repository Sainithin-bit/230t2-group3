 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. home builders jumped on Wednesday after positive remarks from Lehman Brothers, comments by the chairman of the Federal Reserve and a decision by U.S. regulators to lift investment caps on mortgage giants Fannie Mae FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N. 

 Shares of U.S. home builders were up nearly 2.6 percent in early afternoon activity. Shares of Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ) rose 4 percent despite reporting a greater-than-expected quarterly loss. The Office of Federal Housing Enterprises Oversight on Wednesday lifted the caps on their portfolio allowing the two companies to buy more mortgages. Whether they will buy more is another story, said Mike Larson, analyst with Weiss Research. "If when it comes down to it Fannie and Freddie get the ability to expand they also may tighten their credit standards," Larson said. "There will likely be some benefit. The question is how much." Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages and then issue bonds based on the payments of those mortgages. Also on Wednesday, Lehman Brothers said it expected home-sales trends to improve within the next two quarters. "As a result attractive investment opportunities do exist in this space," Lehman analysts said in a note. "In our view the builders that have been able to generate the most cash flow while also maintaining the healthiest balance sheets are KB Home ( KBH.N ), Toll Brothers and D.R. Horton ( DHI.N )," the analysts said. The news came on the heels of Toll's release of its fiscal first-quarter results, for which Toll recorded a loss of $96 million, or 61 cents per share, for the three-month period ended January 31, greater than the loss of 51 cents a share analysts had forecast. Analysts attributed the miss to the pretax write-downs of $245.5 million, or 93 cents per share, greater than the mid-point of the $150 million to $300 million the company had estimated on February 6. A year earlier, Toll, based in Horsham, Pennsylvania, posted a profit of $54.3 million, or 33 cents per share. Toll Brothers ended its first quarter with about $950 million in cash and more than $1.2 billion available under its bank credit facility. The U.S. housing market has been in a tailspin for more than two years, with demand falling and builders cutting prices. On Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department said sales of new U.S. single-family homes fell 2.8 percent in January to the lowest level in 13 years, while the median sales price dropped 15.1 percent from a year earlier. The months' supply inched up to 9.9 months, the highest since October 1981. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said the U.S. central bank would act as needed to ensure the beleaguered housing and credit markets would not further undermine the weakening U.S. economy. "We believe that revived buyer confidence is paramount to getting the market moving again," Robert Toll, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. "Only when customers believe we are done with housing deflation will the excess supply clear and the market return to equilibrium." Shares of Toll Brothers rose 96 cents to $24.08 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. KB rose 3.5 percent, or 92 cents, to $26.13. D.R. Horton shares were up 4.2 percent or 69 cents, at $17.12. Meanwhile, the benchmark Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB, rose 3.3 percent. As Robert Toll said last week at the Reuters Housing Summit, the crucial spring selling season was weak compared with a year earlier, which may portend additional impairments, JP Morgan Michael Rehaut wrote in a research note.
