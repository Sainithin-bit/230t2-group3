 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil hit an all-time high of $101.89 a barrel on February 27, closing in on an inflation-adjusted peak of $102.53 seen in 1980. 

 Robust demand for crude, real and threatened disruptions to supply and a weak U.S. dollar have fuelled the rally from a dip below $50 at the start of 2007. FUNDS Investment flows from pension and hedge funds into commodities including oil have boomed, as has speculative trading. At the same time, a global credit crunch has brought some other markets, such as the U.S. asset-backed commercial paper market, to a virtual standstill. Some of that money has found its way into energy and commodities, analysts say. DOLLAR WEAKNESS The fall in the value of the dollar against other major currencies has helped drive buying across commodities as investors view dollar assets as relatively cheap. It has also reduced the purchasing power of OPEC's revenues and increased the purchasing power of some non-dollar consumers. OPEC oil ministers have noted that although prices are rising to record nominal levels, inflation and the dollar have softened the impact. Some analysts say investors have been using oil as a hedge against the weaker dollar. DEMAND While previous price spikes have been triggered by supply disruptions, demand is a main driver of the current rally. Global demand growth has slowed after a surge in 2004 but is still rising, despite an economic slowdown in top consumer the United States. Higher prices have so far had a limited effect on economic growth. Analysts say the world is coping with high nominal prices because, adjusted for exchange rates and inflation, they are lower than during previous price spikes and some economies have become less energy intensive. OPEC SUPPLY RESTRAINT The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, source of more than a third of the world's oil, started to reduce oil output in late 2006 to stem a fall in prices. Fewer OPEC barrels entering the market helped propel the rally and consumer nations led by the International Energy Agency have urged OPEC to pump more oil. At meetings in December and earlier in February, OPEC left output unchanged. Some in OPEC, such as Iran, want the group to cut supplies at the next OPEC meeting, on March 5. VENEZUELA A row between OPEC member Venezuela and Exxon Mobil Corp., the largest fully publicly traded oil company, has prompted price gains this month. Venezuela has suspended oil exports to Exxon, escalating the country's fight with the U.S. oil firm over compensation for an nationalized oil project. Venezuela has also threatened to cut exports to the United States. Oil producers in the Middle East have assured the United States that they could compensate for a supply disruption if Venezuela slows exports. NIGERIA Supply of crude from Nigeria, Africa's largest oil exporter, has been cut since February 2006 because of militant attacks on the country's oil industry. Oil companies have detailed about 515,000 bpd of shut Nigerian production due to militant attacks and sabotage. REFINERY BOTTLENECKS Limited additions to refining capacity in major consumer nations such as the United States are partly behind rising crude prices. The International Energy Agency said last year additional global refining capacity over the next five years will lag earlier expectations as rising costs and a shortage of engineers delay construction. IRAQ Iraq is struggling to get its oil industry back on its feet after decades of wars, sanctions and underinvestment. Exports of Kirkuk crude from the country's north are stabilizing as the system recovers from technical problems that had mostly idled the pipeline since the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003.
