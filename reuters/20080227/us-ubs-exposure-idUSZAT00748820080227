 BASEL, Switzerland  (Reuters) - UBS ( UBSN.VX ) will redouble efforts to cut holdings of the toxic investments that have caused billions of francs in losses, Chairman Marcel Ospel said in an appeal to shareholders to support an emergency capital hike. 

 Ospel on Wednesday said Swiss-based UBS, the European bank hardest-hit by the subprime crisis, was also cutting back proprietary trading and that there were "ongoing uncertainties in the financial services industry." "We will redouble our efforts to manage down our holdings of mortgage-backed securities and derivatives in order to continue reducing the impact of our fixed income business on the balance sheet," Ospel said in the text of a speech. Ospel said it was "absolutely necessary" that shareholders approve emergency capital raising measures, which include a 13 billion francs ($12.2 billion) coming from Singapore and an unidentified Middle East.
