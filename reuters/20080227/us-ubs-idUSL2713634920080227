 BASEL  (Reuters) - UBS chairman Marcel Ospel, braving investor fury over huge subprime losses, said it was "absolutely necessary" for shareholders to back a 13 billion Swiss franc ($11.94 billion) capital injection from Singapore and an unidentified Middle East investor. 

 "Today we need your backing for a massive strengthening of our capital base," Ospel told an extraordinary shareholders' meeting. "We believe that this measure is absolutely necessary." Ospel has survived at the helm of the giant Swiss bank after culling top managers over the past year as UBS chalked up $18 billion in charges following disastrous investments in U.S. subprime mortgages. The writedowns, which led the bank to unveil its first full-year loss in 2007 in more than a decade, have forced UBS to seek the emergency injection to repair its severely depleted capital ratios. Despite facing calls for his resignation, Ospel said he would not "thoughtlessly relinquish" his responsibilities. "I intend to ensure that UBS gets back on the road to success." He also said UBS would redouble efforts to cuts it exposures to mortgage-backed securities and derivatives. The bank had misjudged market trends in subprime and had then failed to react adequately, said Ospel. "We judged certain markets wrongly. We subsequently noticed this error, but due to the rapid evolution of events were unable to react in time." Earlier Thousands of shareholders converged on a sports arena in Basel for an emergency assembly which started at 0900 GMT. The city's green trams were packed as shareholders, many of them former employees of Switzerland's largest financial institution, made the trip to what is being billed as one of the most important shareholder gatherings in UBS's history. Shareholders will be asked to approve the issue of 11 billion francs in notes, convertible into UBS stock, to Singapore's Government Investment Corporation (GIC). The gathering could last for most of the day if many shareholders put their names down to speak at the assembly. A further 2 billion francs of mandatory convertible notes are also to be placed with an unidentified Middle East investor, subject to shareholder approval. UBS also intends to boost capital by a further 6.4 billion francs by replacing the 2007 cash dividend with a stock dividend ad by selling shares from its treasury stock. Analysts believe there is little chance of shareholders throwing out the motion for a capital increase in view of the scale of the bank's losses. UBS's stock price has dropped by well over 50 percent since mid-2007. "I think the result is a bit of a foregone conclusion," said David Williams, banking analyst at Fox-Pitt, Kelton in London. Smaller shareholders are saying it is unfair that they cannot participate in the mandatory convertible bond and say the bank should make a rights issue. But analysts say a rights issue would have to be made at a discount to the market price, forcing the bank to issue even more shares and to dilute the stock further. "Many people will say they are not happy about the capital increase but everyone understands UBS needs this capital and they will vote for it," said Jerome Schupp, a fund manager at Banque Syz et Cie. But Ospel faces a stormy reception from shareholders who have seen shares in the bank slide from a high of 80.45 francs in early June last year to a close of 37.10 francs on Tuesday. Investors fear there may be billions of dollars in fresh writedowns to come after the bank earlier this month revealed exposures to risky U.S. residential mortgages other than subprime, which were much higher than previously thought. Shareholder advocacy group Ethos has put forward a request for a special audit at the bank to establish how UBS, which was reputed to have one of the best risk management systems in the financial industry, got bogged down in the subprime quagmire. Adding to the bank's woes, Germany HSH Nordbank HSH.UL has started legal proceedings against UBS to recover steep losses on a $500 million portfolio of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), linked to the fortunes of the U.S. mortgage market, which it bought from the Swiss bank in 2002. Some investors are surprised that Ospel has not already been forced out. UBS last week said it would propose re-electing Ospel but reducing his term of office to one year. The proposal will be put to shareholders at an annual assembly in April. "I was a bit astonished by the fact that he will stay for a year. Ospel has been too weakened to remain for long. I think they are already looking for a successor," said Schupp. Many shareholders are expected to register their names on Wednesday morning so they can address the meeting. "I am sure Ospel will take some flak at the meeting but I don't think people will shoot at his heart," said one London-based analyst with a European bank who asked not to be identified.
