 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MBIA Inc's ( MBI.N ) newly installed Chief Executive, Jay Brown, has thrown down a gauntlet to the federal government -- close a tax loophole that benefits competitors with foreign affiliates or he will move the Armonk, New York bond insurer offshore. 

 "The issue is when (an insurer) essentially has its operations in the United States and then ships money out to a (foreign) affiliate company," Brown told Reuters in a telephone interview on Wednesday. "By doing that, they avoid paying full U.S. tax on the insurance they are selling." Brown said there were numerous examples of insurers cutting their U.S. tax bill through reinsurance arrangements with affiliates in Bermuda, an offshore insurance and reinsurance center. But he added that any affiliated reinsurance transaction with a company based in a low-tax domicile could benefit under the current U.S. tax code. Brown is serious about getting the tax loophole closed. He is committing $1 million, or more if necessary, of MBIA's money to the Coalition for a Domestic Insurance Industry, an organization lobbying U.S. legislators to cut the tax benefit. Brown -- a former MBIA chief executive brought back by the troubled bond insurer last week -- said the "tax loophole" has broadly benefited companies selling insurance in the United States, from financial guarantors to property-casualty insurers. BERMUDA SHORTS "I still don't look good in Bermuda shorts, but we will eventually have to move the company if the U.S. tax code is not modified," Brown told investors in a letter that discussed the tax issue, among others, this week. But Brown told Reuters he would fight to close the tax loophole before packing his bags. He added there was "time to think about" which lower-tax domicile the bond insurer would move to, if pushed. This is no small issue for MBIA. Brown said in a statement last week that questions about taxes were one reason the insurer withdrew from the trade group that represents the bond insurance industry. Brown, who was CEO of MBIA from 1999 to 2004, had previously been vocal about the tax loophole benefiting rival bond insurer Security Capital Assurance Ltd SCA.N, in which XL Capital ( XL.N ) has a significant holding. That company is based in Bermuda, as is another bond insurer, Assured Guaranty Ltd ( AGO.N ), and several bond reinsurers, including those MBIA does business with, such as RAM Holdings Ltd RAMR.O. CIFG has operations in the United States, Bermuda and Europe. MBIA has a Bermuda reinsurer of its own. In 2004, MBIA and other investors formed Bermuda-based Channel Reinsurance to provide reinsurance protection. Brown was CEO at the time. A month ago Channel Re investors said losses stemming from MBIA were expected to exceed shareholders equity. Moody's Investors Service cut its top "Aaa" ratings on Channel Re on Friday, due to its exposure to residential mortgage-backed debt, through MBIA. But the rating agency affirmed the top rating for MBIA's main insurance unit on Tuesday, easing market concerns. Standard & Poor's affirmed MBIA Insurance Corp's top ratings on Monday.
