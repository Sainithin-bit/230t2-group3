 MELBOURNE  (Reuters) - Westfield Group ( WDC.AX ), the world's top shopping mall owner, sees its U.S. and UK malls withstanding downturns in those markets, given the prime locations and quality of its shopping centers, Managing Director Peter Lowy said on Wednesday. 

 Lowy said he expects net operating income growth in 2008 from its U.S. malls open for more than a year to match the 2.7 percent growth achieved last year, and expected no net loss in tenants. "With the developments, with the capital we've put into the assets, we're increasing the quality of those assets, we'd be looking for it to be flat to slightly up," Lowy said, referring to occupancy levels. Lowy said about A$4.5 billion worth of projects in 2008 was funded, but the group would be watching bond markets for opportunities to raise more debt. Chief financial officer, Peter Allen, said Westfield would be opportunistic in tapping the U.S. 144A market, which is the bond market for professional U.S. investors, and general UK and European bond markets, using its Standard & Poor's 'A' rating. "There's no urgency for us to go out to the debt capital mkts to fund these projects or look at refinancing our maturing debt," Allen said. "If the market is open and it's at the right price, then we'll be looking at raising additional debt." Lowy said Westfield had no interest in buying any assets from smaller rival Centro Properties Group CNP.AX, which is struggling to refinance short-term debt by selling assets and seeking a new cornerstone investor. Westfield sold Centro some U.S. and Australian malls over the past two to three years. ($1=A$1.07) (Reporting by  Sonali Paul )
