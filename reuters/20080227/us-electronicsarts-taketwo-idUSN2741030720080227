 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O, isn't ruling out going hostile with its $2 billion bid for rival video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc ( TTWO.O ), the New York Post reported on Wednesday. 

 The Post quoted EA Chief Financial Officer Warren Jenson as saying the company was "keeping all options open," but said he had declined to elaborate. On Sunday, EA announced its unsolicited all-cash offer. Take-Two rejected the bid as inadequate and accused EA of trying to scoop up a company in turnaround just before the eagerly anticipated release of its "Grand Theft Auto 4" game.
