 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - Microsoft said an 899 million euro ($1.35 billion) fine imposed on Wednesday by the European Commission concerned "past issues" and that it was now looking to the future. 

 "We are reviewing the Commission's action. The Commission announced in October 2007 that Microsoft was in full compliance with the 2004 decision, so these fines are about the past issues that have been resolved," the company said in a statement. "As we demonstrated last week with our new interoperability principles and specific actions to increase the openness of our products, we are focusing on steps that will improve things for the future," the company said.
