 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's biggest mortgage lender HBOS Plc HBOS.L said its margins will be "far more stable" in 2008 than last year, when they were hit by competitive pressure and higher funding costs. 

 HBOS Chief Executive Andy Hornby said his "relatively stable" guidance indicates a plus/minus 4 basis point move in the retail margin this year. The bank's 2007 net interest margin fell to 1.63 percent from 1.72 percent, as the retail banking margin dropped 12 basis points to 1.66 percent due to competitive pressure in the first half of last year and higher funding costs in the second half. "We're quietly confident that prices have moved forward and as the year moves on margins will be far more stable in our retail business," Hornby told Reuters in an interview. "There will come a time when wholesale funding costs start to ease back, it may be late 2008 or early 2009, but at that stage you'll see a really resilient margin performance as underlying pricing is relatively attractive at the moment." Hornby said the bank's cost growth this year will not be higher than the 7 percent growth seen in recent years, and "will probably be lower," but he said the bank will continue to invest in its international growth. He predicted Britain's net mortgage market will grow by between 80 billion ($160 billion) and 90 billion pounds in 2008, lower than in recent years, and for HBOS to continue to write around 20 percent of gross lending, near its traditional share. "It's not a housing market that's gone into free fall, it's still showing good growth but lower growth," he said. Hornby was speaking after HBOS reported a 3 percent rise in underlying profits, just short of analysts' forecasts. (Reporting by  Steve Slater )
