 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norwegian energy group StatoilHydro ( STL.OL ) said there were no official or unofficial cost estimates for its investments in Gazprom's ( GAZP.MM ) giant Shtokman gas field in the Russian part of the Barents Sea. 

 "There are no official or unofficial estimates for investments in Shtokman," Chief Executive Helge Lund told a news conference about StatoilHydro's fourth-quarter results. "Our role in Shtokman cannot be looked at in isolation, but in a strategic light as part of our global Arctic strategy and our knowledge related to this. We think StatoilHydro has a competitive edge if we make the right moves." StatoilHydro has 24 percent in a company that will develop Shtokman. Russian gas giant Gazprom holds a 51 percent stake and French Total ( TOTF.PA ) 25 percent. (Reporting by Joergen Frich)
