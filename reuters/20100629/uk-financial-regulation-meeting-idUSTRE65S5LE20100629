 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. congressional negotiators are expected to meet at 5 p.m. on Tuesday to consider a proposal to shut down the $700 billion bank bailout program to free-up resources to pay for financial reform, Democratic aides said. 

 "The Democrats are putting on the table a proposal to shut down (the Troubled Asset Relief Program) and any unused TARP authority will be counted towards offsetting the cost of the bill," one of the congressional aides said. (Reporting by Tom Ferraro)
