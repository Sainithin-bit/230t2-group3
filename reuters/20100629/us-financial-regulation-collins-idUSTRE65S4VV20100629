 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A Republican senator whose support will be crucial for final passage of a sweeping Wall Street reform bill said on Tuesday she would back it if a proposed $19 billion tax on banks were dropped. 

 "The bill is not perfect. But I believe if you take out the new bank tax that, on balance, it would improve our financial system and I would support it," Susan Collins told reporters in a Capitol hallway. She said she was working with Democratic Senator Christopher Dodd, who headed the Senate's delegation to a congressional panel that finalized the bill last week, "to see if there is a way for us to move away from the new tax and I believe we're making progress in that area."
