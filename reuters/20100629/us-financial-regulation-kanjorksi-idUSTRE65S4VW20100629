 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A U.S. lawmaker said on Tuesday members of the conference crafting financial reform legislation may have to reopen debate over the measure to iron out last-minute objections to the bill. 

 "When members make a decision to do something, they really should be more thoroughly committed... other than that, we move toward something and get very close like this and have to retrack, and that's very difficult," said Democratic Representative Paul Kanjorski. (Reporting by  Mark Felsenthal )
