 (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers will need at least some Republican support to pass a sweeping rewrite of financial regulations through Congress. 

 Democrats stripped out an $18 billion bank tax from the bill to satisfy the concerns of a handful of moderate Republicans in the Senate, where they are several votes short of the 60 needed to overcome an expected procedural hurdle. Here are the lawmakers and other officials whose support -- or lack thereof -- will loom large over the coming days. REPUBLICAN SENATOR SCOTT BROWN A moderate elected in January to fill the seat of the late Edward Kennedy, Brown has previously supported the bill on the Senate floor and, during final congressional negotiations, won significant carve-outs for mutual funds, insurers and other industry players in his home state of Massachusetts. Brown said he would not support the final bill unless lawmakers drop the tax, which was added during a final all-night negotiating session last week. REPUBLICAN SENATOR OLYMPIA SNOWE Snowe, from Maine and another New England moderate, likewise is concerned by the tax. Like Brown, she previously supported the bill on the Senate floor and had been successful easing its impact on small businesses. REPUBLICAN SENATOR SUSAN COLLINS Another moderate Republican from Maine, Collins is responsible for the portion of the bill that would require larger financial firms to boost their capital reserves. The former state banking regulator previously backed the bill on the Senate floor and said on Tuesday she would support it if the tax was dropped. REPUBLICAN SENATOR CHARLES GRASSLEY Grassley's support of the bill has been less consistent than the other Republicans mentioned here. He was the lone member of his party to vote for tough derivatives regulations drafted by the Agriculture Committee, and he voted for final passage on the Senate floor. But he also voted against it in an earlier procedural vote. Grassley's office has said he has not yet decided how to vote. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR RUSSELL FEINGOLD One of the most liberal members of the Senate, Feingold has said the bill does not do enough to prevent future crises and he was one of only two Democrats to vote against it on the Senate floor. His position remains unchanged, though he said the final version contains some improvements. DEMOCRATIC SENATOR MARIA CANTWELL Cantwell, of Washington state, also voted against the bill in the Senate in May on the grounds that it was not tough enough. She is studying the final version and has not yet determined whether to support it or not, an aide said on Monday. WEST VIRGINIA GOVERNOR JOE MANCHIN Manchin, a Democrat, is expected to name a Democrat to replace Robert Byrd, who died on Monday, in the Senate. But he is not expected to act until the memorials for Byrd conclude next week. That could mean a delay of several weeks if Democrats need the vote of Byrd's replacement. Manchin is seen as  a likely candidate in the November 2012 election to fill Byrd's seat. He is expected to name someone without political ambitions of their own to hold the seat until then.
