 (Reuters) - The Democrats' majority in the Senate will be down one -- to 58 versus 41 Republicans -- at least until there is a successor to Senator Robert Byrd, who died on Monday at the age of 92. 

 With Democrats seeking to move quickly on a number of bills, including one to crack down on Wall Street, they want a replacement as soon as possible. But it's going to take time -- at least a week or two or even more. Here's a look at the process: * West Virginia Governor Joe Manchin, a Democrat, is virtually certain to appoint another Democrat to replace Byrd until the November 2012 election, when voters will pick a senator for a full six-year term. * But Manchin will not publicly discuss the selection process until completion of a series of state tributes to Byrd that are expected to run until his funeral Tuesday, an aide for the governor said. * Once Manchin announces a pick, his appointee will come to the floor of the Senate to be sworn-in, likely by Vice President Joe Biden, who also serves as the chamber's president. * If an appointee is selected next week, the person might have to wait to be sworn in until lawmakers return the following week from the July 4 holiday recess. * If the appointee is a Democrat, the party's Senate majority will return to 59-41, one short of the number needed to clear Republican procedural roadblocks. * Senate Democrats are trying to make changes to a bill to tighten regulation of the financial industry that they hope will permit them to pass the legislation by week's end. There is a chance that they may have to wait a bit longer -- perhaps until Byrd's seat is filled by another Democrat. (Reporting by  Thomas Ferraro ; editing by  Jackie Frank )
