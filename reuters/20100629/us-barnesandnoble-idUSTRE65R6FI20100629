 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Barnes & Noble Inc shares hit their lowest level in more than a year even as its chief executive said on Tuesday that the bookseller could win a quarter of the growing e-books market within a few years and generate billions of dollars in new sales. 

 Shares fell as much as 17.2 percent in their first trading session after the company reported a larger quarterly loss on Monday as physical book sales languished and the company spent money on developing its Nook electronic reader and online bookstore. Barnes & Noble's stock was down 14.3 percent to $14.06 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange after touching a session low of $13.58. Last August, its stock hit a 52-week high of $28.76. CEO William Lynch, speaking at Barnes & Noble's investor day in New York, said the company has a 20 percent share of the electronic books market and that its share could lead to sales between $3 billion and $5 billion by 2013. The company set a goal of reaching overall sales of $8.9 billion in 2014, compared to total sales of $5.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended on May 1. Last week, Barnes & Noble shares also tumbled when a price war over e-readers erupted with Amazon.com Inc, which makes the Kindle, in response to competition from Apple Inc's iPad, a tablet that can function as an e-reader. It has invested heavily in its Nook device and e-bookstore, betting that grabbing a share of the growing e-book market would reverse sales declines. Executives said the success of the Nook is central to its ability to sell e-books. "Our goal is to place a Barnes & Noble bookstore in every reader's pocket," Chairman Len Riggio told investors. In its earnings report on Monday, Barnes & Noble warned investors that efforts to beef up its e-book business would weigh on earnings this year. "There's a risk inherent in switching strategies and there is significant investor concern about how long it will take to monetize the e-books strategy," said Standard & Poor's equity analyst Michael Souers, who called Barnes & Noble's sales goals "optimistic" considering the competition it faces from Apple and Amazon. The retailer predicted that online sales, which include sales of e-books through the Nook device, would jump 75 percent to $1 billion next year on the strength of a full year's worth of sales of the device. CONSOLIDATION TO HELP Barnes & Noble, the largest U.S. bookstore chain by sales, on Monday forecast only modest sales growth in its stores next year and said that sales at its stores open at least 15 months fell 3.1 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter ended May 1. The company said sales at its namesake stores would be flat or up as much as 3 percent in its next fiscal year. Given the industry-wide sales declines of physical books, Barnes & Noble executives predicted that it would benefit from consolidation in the bookstore business. Riggio also expects retailers such as drugstores and supermarkets, which he said currently account for about half all book sales, to gradually shrink their bookselling. But Riggio said that physical stores are an important tool for selling the Nook and predicted the company would close only six to ten stores per year for the next few years as their leases expire. In addition, the bookseller has no intention of trying out smaller store formats, he said, but will eventually dedicate more display space to the Nook and other e-readers, with a view to promoting its e-bookstore. Barnes & Noble operates 720 namesake stores in the United States and 637 college bookstores. (Reporting by Phil Wahba. Editing by Maureen Bavdek,  Robert MacMillan  and  Tim Dobbyn )
