 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae FNM.N shares plunged as much as 12 percent to their lowest in more than a decade on Friday, after the company on a conference call failed to calm investors' concerns about loss accounting. 

 Fannie Mae, the largest provider of funding for U.S. residential mortgages, last week attributed $670 million in credit loss reserves to charge-offs taken as it purchased troubled loans out of mortgage bond trusts. Queries over the future "cure rate" on the loans resulted in frustration among analysts, despite Fannie Mae's assurances it was following accounting rules and that the losses were unrealized. "It's very nice for the folks at Fannie to clarify what their cash exposure is, but it still doesn't make me feel that good about credit," said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, which advises companies on risk management. "Investors are trying to understand what the exposure is in this marketplace right now." Fannie Mae shares have slumped since last week after it said the credit crisis had sapped values of mortgages it owns, widening its net loss for the period. The loss, which surprised some investors, fueled speculation the government-sponsored enterprise known for financing mostly "prime" loans is more exposed to risky mortgages than originally thought. The cure rate, or the rate at which delinquent loans bought from trusts become current, has declined and may fall more, Fannie Mae said in a filing last week. Many of the loans bought out of trusts never go into foreclosure and are often cured at no expense, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Swad said on the hastily arranged analyst call to address "technical accounting questions." The accounting "has the effect of pulling forward losses well before they are realized," Swad said. "Some loans we have seen cured at no expense." Under U.S. accounting rules, Fannie Mae must record the "fair value" of the loans, or the price the assets could get in a market transaction. While mortgages were hit especially hard last quarter, executives stressed the loans are often cured and are not destined for sale where actual losses could occur. But the strong historical performance in loan curing probably won't be repeated in today's environment, Moody's Investors Service analyst Brian Harris said in a note on Tuesday. Fannie Mae's third quarter loss had no immediate effect on its Aaa senior debt rating, he said. Requests for more details on the expected cure rate were not fulfilled, frustrating some analysts who chided executives for being unhelpful. Swad pledged to increase disclosures to help analysts understand the cure rate, possibly identifying the number of loans that are being repurchased. Fannie Mae clarified some complex accounting issues but it "continues to fall short on providing sufficient detail for clear analysis of core operating results," Citigroup Inc. analyst Brad Ball said in a research note on Friday. The failure to provide cure rates on delinquent loans has increased uncertainty over future losses, he said. With Friday's drop, the stock has lost more than 16 percent of its value this week. A Fortune magazine article on Thursday questioned some accounting changes, leaving investors concerned about how the company estimating potential losses. Trading in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac FRE.N and major lenders has reached "panic" proportions over whether the companies are viable, said David Dreman, chairman of Dreman Value Management. He likened the trading to the banking crisis of the early 1990s, though said that institutions, including Fannie Mae, today are well-equipped to weather losses. "They're not really write-offs as such," said Dreman, who according to regulatory filings boosted holdings of Fannie Mae by about 15 percent to 10.1 million shares last quarter. "They take back a loss, but they don't write it off because they often get a lot of recovery." Fannie Mae shares recovered some losses by the close of trading in New York. The stock fell $2.35 to $40.69, after earlier touching $36.86, its lowest level since April 1997. The company on late on Friday also said it sold $500 million in preferred stock. Fannie Mae executives declined to address the preferred stock sale ahead of its announcement, but reminded analysts the company exceeded requirements of its federal regulator as of September 30.
