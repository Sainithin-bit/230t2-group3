 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's current policy stance should be just right to help the U.S. economy weather a rough patch in the months ahead without triggering inflation, Fed Governor Randall Kroszner said on Friday. 

 "The current stance of monetary policy should help the economy get through the rough patch during the next year, with growth then likely to return to its longer-run sustainable rate," he said in a speech to an Institute of International Finance conference. "A sequence of data releases consistent with the rough patch for economic activity that I expect in coming months would not, by themselves, suggest to me that the current stance of monetary policy is inappropriate," he added. The Fed makes its decisions about interest rates with an eye to risks, Kroszner said. Worries that the housing slump and financial market turmoil could hurt the economy justified the central bank's cumulative three-quarter point rate reductions in September and October, he continued. But each additional rate action in the same direction has fewer benefits and greater risks, he said. "Unless underlying conditions or risks change substantially, reductions in the target federal funds rate tend to be associated with decreasing incremental benefits in terms of further mitigating ... risks and with increasing incremental costs in terms of the potential for inflation to increase," he said. Kroszner said the Fed's recent rate actions had brought risks of a downturn in growth roughly in balance with dangers that inflation could accelerate. After September's half-point cut, but before October's quarter-point reduction, higher oil prices and the plummeting dollar added greater inflation risks to the mix, he said. Inflation expectations are well-anchored, Kroszner said. Later, in response to a question, the Fed governor said that a moderation in core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, is keeping expectations tethered. "The costs in terms of potential for a movement up in inflation expectations are lower in an environment where the inflation, particularly the core inflation numbers, are coming down," he said. He also ruled out the prospect of stagflation -- a combination of sluggish growth and soaring inflation: "I definitely don't see that." But he added that he will be watching both market indicators and the government's statistical data carefully for any sign inflation expectations have become unmoored. While core inflation has been moving in a favorable direction, spillovers from the run-up in oil prices could add upward pressure, Kroszner said. "The prices of oil and other commodities continue ... to be a source of major uncertainty for the overall inflation outlook," he said. Data on Thursday showed that while the overall consumer price index (CPI) rose 3.5 percent in October from a year earlier, core CPI rose a slower 2.2 percent. At the same time, a period of heavy weather looms on the near-term horizon for economic growth, Kroszner said. Home sales appear likely to weaken further and construction cutbacks look possible, he said. As interest rates on adjustable-rate home loans reset at higher levels, more pain can be expected in the form of higher rates of mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures, he said. Increases in consumer and business spending may be smaller due to the housing fallout and uncertainty. On the other hand, the labor market is relatively solid and demand for U.S. exports remains strong, he said. (Additional reporting by  Mark Felsenthal ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
