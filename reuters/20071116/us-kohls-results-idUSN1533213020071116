 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Kohl's Corp ( KSS.N ), a mid-priced retailer of apparel and home goods, reported a nearly 14 percent drop in third-quarter net income, and cut its earnings forecast for the holiday selling season and full year. 

 The company's shares fell more than 2 percent in extended trading. Net income fell to $194 million, or 61 cents a diluted share, for the third quarter ended November 3, from $224.5 million, or 68 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts expected profit of 60 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Total sales rose about 5 percent to $3.8 billion, below analysts' estimates of $3.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales at stores open at least a year fell 2.6 percent as the average purchase decreased. "We're being very very conservative about what could happen in the fourth quarter, and hopefully business will improve as the weather gets cooler," Chief Financial Officer Wes McDonald said during a conference call. The company said weather-sensitive goods showed significant weakness in the quarter, with the children's category most affected. But Kohl's added that accessories, beauty and jewelry sales were strong, and said it was "extremely pleased" with the performance of clothing by designer Vera Wang and Food Network kitchen gadgets, two recently launched product lines. The company in recent months cited pressure on its business from the weak U.S. housing market and promotions from rivals, and earlier this month had slashed its earnings estimates for the third quarter. Retail watchers have expressed concern about the impact the slumping housing market and higher food and gasoline prices could have on consumer spending heading into the holiday season. Sales of Kohl's department store rivals also have been challenged as consumers wrestled with these factors. Retailer J.C. Penney Co ( JCP.N ) earlier on Thursday posted a 9 percent drop in quarterly profit and cut its holiday forecast. Its chief financial officer said during a conference call that promotional activity would likely increase. On Wednesday, Macy's Inc ( M.N ) also cut its sales forecast for the current quarter and full-year. Earlier this month, Kohl's reported October same-store sales that were weaker than expected, hurt by unseasonably warm weather and the resulting poor sales of cold-weather gear. Its same-store sales also fell in September and August. Kohl's said it now expects fourth-quarter profit of $1.45 to $1.51 a share, assuming same-store sales of flat to down 2 percent. In August, the retailer had forecast fourth-quarter earnings of $1.63 to $1.69 a share. Because of a calendar shift, Kohl's said it expected same-store sales to rise in the high-single digits on a percentage basis in November, but would likely fall in December. The chain said full-year profit was expected to be $3.52 to $3.58 a share, down from its previous forecast of $3.77 to $3.87 a share. Analysts expected a profit of $1.58 a share for the fourth quarter and $3.64 a share for the year, according to Reuters Estimates. Kohl's shares were down 2.9 percent to $47.50 in extended trading from their $48.92 close on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  Karen Jacobs ; editing by Carol Bishopric)
