 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Huntington Bancshares Inc ( HBAN.O ), a large U.S. Midwest regional bank, projected a surprise fourth-quarter loss because of its exposure to a troubled client's mounting mortgage losses, sending its shares down Friday as much as 10.5 percent to a six-year low. 

 The bank projected a charge of up to $300 million, or 81 cents per share, to boost reserves for losses at Franklin Credit Management Corp FCMC.O, a New Jersey mortgage purchaser and servicer that specializes in riskier "scratch and dent" home loans, and the survival of which is now in question. It said Franklin had $1.5 billion of loans outstanding to Huntington, secured by more than 30,000 individual mortgages, as of September 30. Huntington, based in Columbus, Ohio, joins a growing number of U.S. banks suffering from the U.S. housing slump, which has forced many companies to boost reserves for borrower defaults or write down the value of mortgages on their books. "This is regrettable, and upsetting," Chief Executive Thomas Hoaglin said on a conference call. He said Franklin's portfolio suffered "marked deterioration" in October and November, but the charge "positions us against future stress in the mortgage market and fully addresses the issues embedded in our Franklin exposure." Analysts on average had expected Huntington to post a fourth-quarter profit of 44 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The company has $55.3 billion of assets and more than 600 banking offices in six U.S. states. Shares of Huntington were down $1.35, or 8.4 percent, at $14.73 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq. They earlier fell to $14.38, their lowest level since April 2001. Franklin shares dropped $1.71, or 76.7 percent, to 52 cents on the Nasdaq. SCRATCHED AND DENTED Scratch and dent loans commonly have problems in such areas as documentation or borrower credit histories, or may be delinquent or in default. Late Thursday, Jersey City-based Franklin delayed reporting quarterly results, saying the "rapidly deteriorating real estate and mortgage origination credit market" forced it to assess whether it had enough reserves for bad loans. It also said failure to obtain relief from its own lenders could result in "the company's insolvency." Until learning of the problems last week, Huntington had considered its Franklin exposure to be high-quality. Hoaglin said all the loans remain current, but Huntington needs to reassess whether that will continue. Fitch Ratings lowered Huntington's senior debt rating one notch to "A-minus," its seventh-highest investment grade, and said another cut is possible. Moody's Investors Service said it may cut Huntington's "A3" debt rating, equivalent to Fitch's "A-minus." Both cited potential for further write-downs. Huntington became exposed to Franklin after acquiring Sky Financial Group Inc, a Bowling Green, Ohio-based banking company, for $3.3 billion on July 1. Sky had had a commercial lending relationship with Franklin for more than 17 years. Separately, Huntington said its directors met Friday morning and "reaffirmed their confidence in the sustainability" of the bank's 26.5 cent per share quarterly dividend. Huntington also said that even with a $300 million charge, its tier-1 capital level would be around 8 percent, leaving it "well-capitalized" by regulatory standards. The capital level is a measure to assess how well banks can cover losses. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; additional reporting by Aditi Samajpati in Bangalore; Editing by Gerald E.
