 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Trendy yoga wear retailer Lululemon Athletica LLL.TO ( LULU.O ) said on Friday that independent tests have confirmed its VitaSea clothing contains healthful seaweed, a claim called into question this week. 

 Chief Executive Robert Meers told Reuters that a New York Times report on lab tests contradicting Lululemon's seaweed content claims has not hurt sales or business, but has been distracting. The newspaper report, prompted by inquiries from an investor short-selling Lululemon shares, raised concerns about the company and sparked declines in its stock. By "shorting" a stock, an investor is betting it will fall. "People want to trust us," Meers said in an interview. "I feel good that there was a reaction. I think I'd feel worse if no one cared." Shares see-sawed on Friday, up 76 cents on Nasdaq at $42.26 and ahead 31 Canadian cents at C$41.11 on the Toronto Stock Exchange after earlier declines. Lululemon said that lab tests conducted Wednesday night in Hong Kong confirmed June tests that showed the VitaSea fabric contains fibers that match its clothing content labels. Lululemon says the seaweed fiber releases amino acids, minerals and vitamins into the skin on contact with moisture. The Vancouver, British Columbia-based company said SGS SA ( SGSN.VX ), a testing and certification group based in Switzerland, runs tests on all its fabrics before each season. Lululemon said it is offering an exchange on VitaSea products for any dissatisfied customers and now wants to focus on growth plans and the upcoming Christmas shopping season. "What we're going to do is get back to running our business," Meers said. "I think a lot of people, unfortunately, rushed to judgment and it distracted them. And I feel now that everyone's back on track." Meers said the story caught him by surprise and the company did not issue a response until it had retested its products. In the meantime, Meers and Chief Financial Officer John Currie spoke to nearly 25 analysts and major investors to explain the company's testing and quality control procedures. "I think what you have to learn, and I think every CEO of a successful public company has to learn, is that not everybody's rooting for you," Meers said. "And from time to time people are going to make a story that makes their point and you've got to make sure that you run a company that has integrity and I think we do." Smartfiber AG, which developed the SeaCell fiber used in Lululemon clothes, ran independent tests in December 2006, the clothier said. Those test confirmed the presence of vitamins, minerals and amino acids in the fabric used by Lululemon manufacturers. To create the fiber, a seaweed derivative is combined with cellulose material and spun into lycocell fiber, said Lululemon, and specialized testing is needed to measure SeaCell. Smartfiber said in a press release that SeaCell is permanently incorporated in the spun fiber it provides to Lululemon. ($1=$0.97 Canadian) (Reporting by Susan Taylor; Editing by Rob Wilson)
