 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Industrial production unexpectedly fell in October, logging a 0.5 percent decrease, as output shrank at factories, mines and utilities, a Federal Reserve report on Friday showed. 

 It was the biggest decline in output since a matching drop in January and was driven, in part, by a 1.6 percent decrease in utilities output during milder weather that month. Economists surveyed ahead of the report were expecting total output to increase 0.1 percent in October. Output in September was revised up to a 0.2 percent increase from an initially reported 0.1 percent rise. Manufacturing output was down 0.4 percent after a 0.2 percent gain in September. October capacity utilization dropped to 81.7 percent from 82.2 percent. That was slightly below the 82 percent economists were expecting. Motor vehicles and parts production was down 1.0 percent in October after a 3.0 percent drop in September. (Reporting By Joanne Morrison; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
