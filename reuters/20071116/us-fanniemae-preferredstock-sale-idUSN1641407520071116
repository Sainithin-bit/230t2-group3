 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae FNM.N, the largest U.S. home funding company, said on Friday it sold 20 million of preferred shares at $25 per share in a $500 million offering with a 7.625 percent dividend rate. 

 This was the second time in six weeks that the company, which saw its stock sink to a 10-year low earlier on Friday, raised funds by selling preferred stock. Fannie Mae received $1 billion of gross proceeds from a 40 million share variable-rate preferred stock issue on September 28, according to its quarterly earnings filing on Friday. Those shares also had a $25 stated value but a much lower initial rate of the greater of 3-month LIBOR plus 0.75 percent or 4.50 percent. Friday's share sale came as Fannie's common stock has slumped on concern about losses in its loan portfolio and amid market rumors that it needed additional capital. Fannie Mae's shares closed down 5.46 percent at $40.69 on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the session, the stock dropped to a 10-year low below $37.00. When Fannie Mae sold preferred stock in September it made disclosures about its capital levels to preempt investor concerns that it was running short. In its conference call Friday, Fannie Mae declined to discuss a preferred sale but said that it maintained a capital surplus of September 30. A Fannie Mae spokeswoman did not return a call about Friday's preferred share sale. (Additional reporting by Caryn Trokie) (Reporting by  Lynn Adler  and  Al Yoon )
