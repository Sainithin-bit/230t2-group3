 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Workout wear retailer Lululemon Athletica LLL.TO LULU.O said on Friday that its sales have not been hurt by questions raised about company claims that its VitaSea clothing line contains healthful seaweed. 

 Chief Executive Robert Meers told Reuters that a New York Times report on lab tests that contradicted Lululemon's seaweed content claims has not affected business. The yoga-wear retailer said late last night that independent tests have confirmed its fabric contains fibers that match its content labels. Lululemon says the seaweed fiber releases amino acids, minerals and vitamins into the skin on contact with moisture, . "What we're going to do is get back to running our business," Meers said in an interview. "I think a lot of people, unfortunately, rushed to judgment and it distracted them. And I feel now that everyone's back on track." A stock market darling since it went public in July, Lululemon's stock sank in the wake of the New York Times article on Wednesday. Shares see-sawed on Friday, up 3 cents on Nasdaq at $41.53, and down 28 Canadian cents at C$40.52 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The company said it will offer an exchange for any customers who have problems with the VitaSea clothing, or are dissatisfied with Lululemon's response. Meers said the New York Times story caught him by surprise. The newspaper commissioned tests on the clothing after inquiries from an investor who was short-selling the stock, or betting that it would fall. "I think what you have to learn, and I think every CEO of a successful public company has to learn, is that not everybody's rooting for you," Meers said. "And from time to time people are going to make a story that makes their point and you've got to make sure that you run a company that has integrity and I think we do."
