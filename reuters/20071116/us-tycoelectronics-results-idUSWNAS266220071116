 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Tyco Electronics Ltd ( TEL.N ), a maker of components for cars, aerospace and industrial uses, posted a fourth quarter profit on Thursday that exceeded Wall Street estimates as it continued a restructuring. 

 The company, whose stock rose 4.2 percent in electronic trade on Thursday after it reported results, said it expects continued growth in international markets and relatively flat sales in the United States in 2008. Tyco Electronics expects growth in the undersea telecommunications business to be very strong in the first quarter before tapering the rest of the year. Net income fell to $256 million, or 51 cents per share, in its fourth quarter ended September 28, from $369 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier. The company earned 59 cents from continuing operations, excluding restructuring and other one-time items. Analysts, on average, expected profit of 54 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales rose 11 percent to $3.62 billion. Analysts expected $3.42 billion. The company attributed the sales growth largely to international markets, which account for more than 60 percent of its revenue, and a strong quarter from its undersea telecommunications business. Adjusted operating income rose 3 percent to $494 million. Adjusted operating margin slipped 1 percentage point to 13.7 percent largely due to lower production levels in the electronic components business and a lower margin sales mix. Tyco Electronics, spun off earlier this year from former parent Tyco International Ltd ( TYC.N ), reported restructuring and separation-related costs of $79 million. Tyco Electronics said sales rose 8 percent to $2.63 billion in the electronic components business, by far its biggest segment. Sales rose 10 percent in Asia, 4 percent in Europe and declined 3 percent in the Americas, it said. Within the electronic components business, the company reported sales growth in communications, industrial machinery, aerospace and defense, consumer electronics and automotive markets. Computer market sales fell due to a decision to exit low-margin business and appliance market sales were relatively flat, it said. Operating income for its electronic components business rose 5 percent to $370 million excluding restructuring, while margins dipped due to lower production and productivity in North America particularly in the automotive, communications equipment and housing-related markets, it said. Sales also rose in its other three business segments, which are network solutions, wireless systems and undersea telecommunications. Excluding restructuring and other items, Tyco Electronics expects to earn $2.40 to $2.50 per share from continuing operations in 2008, up from $2.18 per share in 2007. Analysts expect $2.35 a share. In its first quarter, Tyco Electronics forecast earnings per share of 56 cents to 58 cents, excluding restructuring and separation costs, up from 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts targeted 54 cents per share. The company sees sales growth of 14 percent to 16 percent in the first quarter versus $3.1 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected $3.35 billion. The company, the world's largest maker of electronic connectors, reported results after Thursday's closing bell. Its shares rose to $34.50 in electronic trade after closing at $33.10 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. (Reporting by  David Bailey ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe/Carol Bishopric)
