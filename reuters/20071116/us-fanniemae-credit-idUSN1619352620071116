 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae's FNM.N credit protection costs jumped on Friday after the company completed a conference call with investors to discuss accounting matters, investors said. 

 The cost to insure the U.S. mortgage finance giant's bonds with credit default swaps rose 3 basis points to 53.5 basis points, meaning it costs $53,500 annually to protect $10 million of its debt for five years. Fannie's debt protection costs are now 10 basis points wider, or roughly 23 percent higher, than they were during Thursday's trading session. This is a "huge move," said Mirko Mikelic, portfolio manager for Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Fannie Mae, the largest provider of funding for U.S. residential mortgages, last week attributed $670 million in credit loss reserves to charge-offs taken as it purchased troubled loans out of mortgage bond trusts. Queries over the "cure rate" on the loans from analysts resulted in frustration despite Fannie Mae's assurances it was following accounting rules and that the losses have not been realized. Fannie Mae's shares plunged 10 percent to their lowest in more than a decade after the conference call. With Friday's drop, the stock has lost more than 20 percent of its value this week.  Rival Freddie Mac's FRE.N debt protection costs also rose 3 basis points on Friday to 51.5 basis points. (Editing by  James Dalgleish )
