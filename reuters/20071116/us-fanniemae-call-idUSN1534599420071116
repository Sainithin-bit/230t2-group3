 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fannie Mae FNM.N shares plunged 10 percent to their lowest in more than a decade on Friday after the company on a conference call failed to calm investors concerned about loss accounting. 

 Fannie Mae, the largest provider of funding for U.S. residential mortgages, last week attributed $670 million in credit loss reserves to charge-offs taken as it purchased troubled loans out of mortgage bond trusts. Queries over the "cure rate" on the loans from analysts resulted in frustration despite Fannie Mae's assurances it was following accounting rules and that the losses have not been realized. Fannie Mae last week said that the cure rate, or the rate at which delinquent loans it purchases from the trusts become current, has declined in recent periods and may fall more. Many of the loans bought out of trusts never go into foreclosure and are often cured at no expense, Chief Financial Officer Stephen Swad said on the hastily arranged call with investors and analysts. The accounting "has the effect of pulling forward losses well before they are realized," Swad said. "Some loans we have seen cured at no expense." With Friday's drop, the stock has lost more than 20 percent of its value this week. A Fortune magazine article posted online on Thursday called into question some recent accounting changes, leaving investors concerned about how the company was estimating potential losses on mortgages it owns. Fannie Mae responded by announcing the conference call at 8:12 p.m. on Thursday to address "technical accounting questions." Analysts peppered management with questions, with Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst Howard Shapiro chiding executives about unhelpful responses. At 11 a.m. (1600 GMT), the stock was off $1.55 to $41.49. Earlier this stock dropped to its lowest since April 1997. (Additional reporting by  Emily Chasan  and Dan Burns) (Editing by Theodore d'Afflisio)
