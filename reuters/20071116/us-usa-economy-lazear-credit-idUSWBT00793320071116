 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - White House economic advisor Edward Lazear said on Friday that the U.S. economy is not "out of the woods" from the ongoing credit crisis but has been "amazingly resilient" in the face of tighter credit standards. 

 There is no doubt that high gasoline and other energy prices have been a drag on growth recently, Lazear told reporters after a speech at a Chicago Federal Reserve conference on labor mobility. U.S. economic growth looks soft in the current quarter but should pick up in the first or second quarter of 2008, Lazear said, adding that between the credit situation and energy prices "there is vulnerability."
