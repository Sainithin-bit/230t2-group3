 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Some 36,000 Chinese-made children's storage racks sold at Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) in the United States were recalled after a baby was suffocated by an overturned rack, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said on Friday. 

 The wooden storage rack, manufactured for Irving, Texas-based Jetmax International Ltd, has three levels and nine removable canvas totes, the safety agency said. One model has red, blue, yellow and green canvas totes, and another model has pastel-colored canvas totes. An 8-month-old boy suffocated after he pulled on a storage rack and it fell over on him, with the top rail landing on his neck, the government agency said. Wal-Mart sold the storage rack organizers under the brand "Home Trend Kids" from August 2004 through July 2005 for about $40, the agency said. The product was also sold at Ollie's stores from July 2006 through June 2007. Consumers should immediately stop children from using the recalled storage racks and contact Jetmax International to receive a free repair kit that adds stability to the base of the rack, the agency said.
