 SAN ANTONIO  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve's recent decision to pump $600 billion into the economy to boost growth is a risky move that can only succeed if lawmakers address the economy's root fiscal and regulatory ills, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Monday. 

 "I would suggest that even if you share my cautious perspective on this matter, you might be assuaged by looking at this new initiative as a bridge loan to fiscal sanity," he told an Association for Financial Professionals meeting in San Antonio. "The Fed, as I see it, has taken a leap of faith that our political leaders will forge a sensible budgetary and regulatory path that incentivizes businesses to put to work the money the Fed is printing to invest in creating jobs for American workers" while averting a fiscal debacle, he said. Fisher, one of the most hawkish members of the Fed's policy-setting panel, said he argued against the move at the panel's meeting last week, He marshaled a range of objections, including his view that companies will not use the extra cash to take on more workers because they are too concerned about fiscal and regulatory uncertainties. "I could envision such action would lead to a declining dollar, encourage further speculation, provoke commodity hoarding, accelerate the transfer of wealth from the deliberate saver and the unfortunate, and possibly place at risk the stature and independence of the Fed," he said. But other policymakers won the day, Fisher said, and the Fed decided to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries in an effort to help bring down a persistently high unemployment rate and boost uncomfortably low inflation. "For the next eight months, the nation's central bank will be monetizing the federal debt," he said. "This is risky business." The case for a new round of monetary easing would have been stronger had there been a clear risk of deflation, Fisher said. But the economy is picking up slightly, he noted, and the deflation risk is receding. The bigger risk, Fisher suggested, is that the new cash will be used not to hire workers but to make speculative investments. "The risk of a double dip in economic activity has lessened, as has the risk of deflation," he told the audience. "Financial speculation and excess, however, is beginning to raise its hoary head." Private equity firms, for example, have begun making acquisitions at prices that rival those paid before the financial crisis. "And the corporations I talk to that are eyeing possible acquisitions with their surplus cash and ready access to the credit markets are not given to thinking of strategic acquisitions as a way to expand payrolls," Fisher added. Speculative activity in stocks, bonds and commodities is already rising, he said, resulting in what amounts to a transfer of income from the poor and the savers to the rich who have the ability to make such investments. Now that the Federal Open Market Committee has made its decision, Fisher urged legislators to do their part. "If the Congress and the Executive fail to deliver, I believe the FOMC will have to consider changing course," he said.
