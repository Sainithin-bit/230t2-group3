 LONDON  (Reuters) - British engineering group Rolls-Royce Plc said on Monday it had made progress on understanding the reasons behind the recent failure of a Trent 900 engine on a Qantas A380 flight last week. 

 "Rolls-Royce has made progress in understanding the cause of the engine failure on the Trent 900-powered A380 Qantas flight QF32 on 4 November 2010," the company said in a statement. "It is now clear this incident is specific to the Trent 900 engine," it added. Rolls said it was making further checks with aircraft maker Airbus and that an incident in August involving tests with its Trent 1000 engine was unrelated. (Reporting by  Sudip Kar-Gupta )
