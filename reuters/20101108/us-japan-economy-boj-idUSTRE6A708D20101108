 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned of looming risks to Japan's economy, stressing that the central bank was ready to boost its asset buying scheme if it sees clear signs of a downturn. 

 Yamaguchi told parliament on Monday that despite strong growth in some emerging and resource-producing countries, there were considerable risks to global growth and very high uncertainty persisted about the U.S. economic outlook. "We need to be quite mindful of downside risks to Japan's economy," Yamaguchi, one of the BOJ's two deputy governors, said. "In case there are clear signs of downturn in the economy and prices, we are ready to act flexibly and decisively, including boosting the asset buying fund," he said. Yamaguchi sounded less optimistic than Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, who on Friday described risks to Japan's economy as evenly balanced. The BOJ kept monetary policy unchanged last week and rolled out its 5-trillion-yen ($62 billion) scheme, under which it will inject funds into the economy by buying assets ranging from government bonds to corporate debt. It started the plan on Monday by offering to buy 150 billion yen of government bonds. Yamaguchi echoed Shirakawa's commitment to expand the size of the fund if economic conditions deteriorate. BOJ officials do not rule out easing policy later this month or in December, if the yen surges above its all time high against the dollar and hurt an already slowing economy. The BOJ's next scheduled policy review is on December 20-21 after it moved forward to last week a meeting originally set for mid-November. That means the BOJ would need to hold an emergency meeting if it wanted act sooner than late next month. Japan's economic growth probably picked up in July-September mainly because of a last-minute boost from expiring stimulus steps, but analysts expect a steep downturn in the ensuing quarter as exports lose momentum and consumption cools. Whether and when the BOJ will relax its policy further will much depend on the yen as its strength hurts the export-reliant economy by making Japanese goods more expensive overseas and hurting business sentiment. The BOJ last eased its policy early in October by setting a new interest rate target in a 0-0.1 percent range, pledging to keep rates effectively at zero until the end of deflation was in sight, and by announcing the asset buying plan. The size of the asset buying pool now effectively serves as the gauge of the BOJ's monetary easing. The plan was greeted with skepticism, given that the BOJ's planned injection pales in comparison with the Federal Reserve's latest $600 billion economic stimulus, even considering that the U.S. economy is nearly three times as big as Japan's.
