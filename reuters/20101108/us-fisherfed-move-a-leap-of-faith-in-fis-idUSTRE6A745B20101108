 SAN ANTONIO  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's recent decision to pump $600 billion into the economy to boost growth is a risky move that can only succeed if lawmakers address the economy's root fiscal and regulatory ills, Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Monday. 

 "I would suggest that even if you share my cautious perspective on this matter, you might be assuaged by looking at this new initiative as a bridge loan to fiscal sanity," he said in the text of a speech prepared for delivery to an Association for Financial Professionals meeting in San Antonio. "The Fed, as I see it, has taken a leap of faith that our political leaders will forge a sensible budgetary and regulatory path that incentivizes businesses to put to work the money the Fed is printing to invest in creating jobs for American workers" while averting a fiscal debacle, he said. Fisher, one of the most hawkish members of the Fed's policy-setting panel, said he argued against the move at the panel's meeting last week, marshalling a range of objections including his view that companies will not use the extra cash to take on more workers because they are too concerned about fiscal and regulatory uncertainties. But other policymakers won the day, he said, and the Fed decided to buy $600 billion in U.S. Treasuries in an effort to help bring down a persistently high unemployment rate and boost uncomfortably low inflation. "For the next eight months, the nation's central bank will be monetizing the federal debt," he said. "This is risky business." (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by  Andrea Ricci )
