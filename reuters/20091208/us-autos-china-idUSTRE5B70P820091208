 (Reuters) - General Motors GM.UL is talking to Beijing Automotive Industry Holding Corp (BAIC), China's fifth-largest car maker, about a partial sale of assets associated with GM's Saab, including tooling and technology, sources with direct knowledge of the discussions said. 

 The proposed tie-up is the latest in a series of contacts this year between Western carmakers and Chinese companies, as big brands seek to restructure to ride out the recession and as the Chinese look to raise their global profile. Following is a TIMELINE tracing some of the proposed, failed or ongoing deals reported this year: March 18 - BAIC said to want U.S. auto parts maker Delphi Corp's DPHIQ.PK non-core assets.
