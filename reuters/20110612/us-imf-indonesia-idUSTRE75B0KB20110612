 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - Indonesia's finance minister said on Sunday he supported his French counterpart Christine Lagarde for the top job at the International Monetary Fund. 

 Lagarde, France's finance minister, is the frontrunner, though Bank of Israel Governor and former IMF deputy chief Stanley Fischer said on Saturday he would run for the job, presenting a new challenge to Lagarde. "Personally I support France," said Agus Martowardojo on the sidelines of a World Economic Forum event in Jakarta. "She is a very professional person. She is smart in interacting between institutions, and has high integrity and skills." (Reporting by Aditya Suharmoko; Editing by Neil Chatterjee and  Alex Richardson )
