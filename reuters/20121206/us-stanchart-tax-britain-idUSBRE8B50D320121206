 LONDON  (Reuters) - Standard Chartered said it could have to pay up to $330 million under a British bank levy next year, some $60 million more than it had expected after Britain this week lifted the charge. 
 Standard Chartered paid $165 million under the bank levy in 2011 and expected that to rise to $210 million this year. It had expected to pay $260-270 million in 2013, but now expects the charge to hit $320-330 million, finance director Richard Meddings told analysts on a call on Thursday. Meddings said he expected the bank to add more than 2,000 jobs this year. He was speaking after the bank released a trading update. (Reporting by  Steve Slater ; Editing by Dan Lalor)
