 (Reuters) - Flight attendants of Compass Airlines, a feeder service for Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ), said they sought arbitration by the National Mediation Board (NMB) that will allow them to strike if management fails to negotiate a new agreement. 
 The flight attendants, represented by the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA), said if the NMB grants its request and agrees that management has refused to make significant movement, negotiations will be declared deadlocked leading to a "cooling off" period and a strike deadline. Compass Flight Attendants have been seeking an agreement that provides fair wages, better working conditions and benefits, AFA Compass President Catriona Bagley said in a statement. When contacted, a response from Compass was not immediately available. Compass, owned by Minneapolis-headquartered Trans States Holdings, provides about 190 daily flights to over 50 Delta Air Lines destinations.
