 PARIS  (Reuters) - Steelmaker ArcelorMittal said on Thursday that an EU pilot project central to its deal with the government to save jobs at a site in northwestern France was not viable today for technical reasons, but it was not permanently ditching the scheme. 
 ArcelorMittal ( ISPA.AS ) earlier withdrew its application for the ULCOS project, which the government hoped could ensure a future for two idled blast furnaces at the Florange site. "(This) is perfectly coherent with what is in the agreement signed with the French government," ArcelorMittal said in a statement after the European Commission said it had pulled its bid for ULCOS. "This in no way means the ULCOS project is being abandoned." (Reporting by  Catherine Bremer ; editing by  Daniel Flynn )
