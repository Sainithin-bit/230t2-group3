 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - United Technologies Corp said on Thursday it had put money aside to cover over $75 million in settlement payments required under an agreement with the U.S. government for past export control violations. 
 The company disclosed in its first-quarter earnings report to the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had set aside $55 million as of March 31, 2012. In a statement, the company said it faced Justice Department penalties of $20.7 million. It must also pay the State Department $55 million in penalties, of which $35 million will be paid in cash over four years. The remaining $20 million will be suspended and used for spending to continue improving export control procedures. (Reporting By  Andrea Shalal-Esa ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
