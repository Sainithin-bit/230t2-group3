 LONDON  (Reuters) - Platinum set a record high for the 13th straight session on Monday on lingering power problems in top producer South Africa that have hit mining and widened the gap between demand and supply. 

 The metal, mainly used in autocatalysts and jewellery, has jumped 22 percent this month, 38 percent so far in 2008 and nearly 75 percent in the past 12 months on supply problems in South Africa, which produces 80 percent of global platinum. Spot platinum surged nearly 3 percent to a high of $2,107 an ounce and was quoted at $2,105/2,115 at 1556 GMT, against $2,050/2,055 in New York late on Friday. "The supply tightness is likely to continue. One way to alleviate that is by giving the miners sufficient energy so that they could produce, but that doesn't seem to be happening," said Michael Widmer, metals analyst at Lehman Brothers. "The price rises will likely not be subsiding. The limit is really when enough demand has been destroyed and enough new supply has been coming online so that the market is balanced. And that's going to take time," he said, adding prices could easily rise to $2,500 in six months. Mines across South Africa have been hit by a lack of power after state utility Eskom ESCJ.UL asked the mining sector to cut power use to 90 percent of normal needs to ease a nationwide shortage caused by the failure of electricity generation to match economic growth. Analysts said the global platinum deficit could widen to 400,000 to 500,000 ounces by the end of 2008, from about 265,000 ounces in 2007. The market had a surplus of 65,000 ounces in 2006 following seven successive years of deficit. "The pressure valve is fully open and the market is still moving higher and that's quite a big concern," Ross Norman, managing director of TheBullionDesk.com, said. "What this does underscore is just how thin this market is and that any kind of disruption can send it spiraling out of control. Unlike most metals, there's little way of sorting this out sensibly as there's no way of accelerating production. "I can almost see this market going up to $3,000 per ounce quite conceivably this year with what we've got going on at the moment," Norman said. RECORD HIGH IN OTHER MARKETS Platinum set historic highs in other markets too, with the most active December contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange surging by the daily 240 yen limit to a record high of 6,945 yen per gram before ending at 6,900 yen, up 195 yen. The Tokyo exchange imposed an additional margin of 60,000 yen per contract to all new positions built for platinum futures contracts from Monday on top of the initial margins in an effort to cool the market. U.S. platinum futures soared to a record high of $2,124 an ounce in electronic trade before falling to $2,106.30, still higher by $42.60 from its close on Friday. But some analysts advised caution. "This is a speculative bubble and it's not sustainable," said Wolfgang Wrzesniok-Rossbach, head of marketing at Heraeus, a precious metals trading group in Germany. "You can't ignore the underlying physical market. Higher prices are already hitting jewellery business. Wherever this rally stops, there is a big danger of a large fall from that point onwards," he said. In other precious metals, palladium jumped to a six-year high of $466/470 an ounce, up from $444/449 in New York. Silver fell to $16.99/17.04 from $17.11/17.16. Gold rose to a high of $909.25 before falling to $903.40/904.30 an ounce, against $903.00/903.80 in New York. U.S. April gold futures gained $1 an ounce to $907.10.
