 COPENHAGEN  (Reuters) - Denmark's Vestas ( VWS.CO ), the world's biggest maker of wind turbines, said on Monday it had won orders in Canada, Poland and Sweden for a total of 67 wind turbines. 

 Vestas said an affiliate of French utility group Suez LYOE.PA placed an order for 33 of its 3.0 megawatt wind turbines for installation in Canada. The contract includes supply and commissioning of the turbines, with delivery starting next year, along with three years of service and maintenance. In a separate statement, Vestas said German developer EAB Projektbau GmbH ordered 16 2.0 megawatt turbines for the project Inowroclaw in central Poland. The Danish firm will also supply a condition monitoring system and five years service. Swedish developer Vindkompaniet AB ordered 18 of the 2.0 megawatt turbines for its project Bliekevare in northern Sweden, Vestas said in a third statement. The Swedish deal also includes a condition monitoring system and two years of service. Vestas said delivery is set for fall 2008, with installation at year-end.
