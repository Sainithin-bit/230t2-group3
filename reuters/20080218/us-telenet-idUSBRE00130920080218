 MECHELEN, Belgium  (Reuters) - Belgian cable operator Telenet ( TNET.BR ) reported on Monday a rise in core profit that was slightly above analysts' expectations and its own guidance, boosted by sales of Internet broadband and television services. 

 "Our financial results for 2007 fully achieved our outlook," Chief Executive Duco Sickinghe told a news conference. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 21 percent to 442.9 million euros ($647.8 million). The average forecast in a Reuters Knowledge poll of 16 analysts was 438.9 million euros.' Telenet's EBITDA margin stood at 47.5 percent while the company had forecast 47 percent. Telenet is the largest broadband cable service provider in Belgium and focuses on offering cable TV, high-speed Internet and telephone services to customers principally in the Flemish part of the country. Liberty Global ( LBTYA.O ), the world's biggest international cable group holds about 52 percent of the company. Sales rose 15 percent to 931.9 million euros, at the upper end of Telenet's guidance for a rise of 14 to 15 percent and nearly in line with the Reuters Knowledge average forecast of 932.7 million euros. "We remain cautious about the increasingly challenging environment we operate in," Sickinghe said, adding the company would focus on controlling costs in 2008. Telenet said it expected revenues and EBITDA to grow in 2008 by between 5 to 6 percent and 6 to 8 percent respectively, excluding a provisional deal struck last year with local cable operators to use their networks under a long-term lease. Telenet said consolidating the deal in 2008 would lead to 9 to 10 percent upside for both 2008 EBITDA and sales. The agreement with the local operators would translate into Telenet acquiring about 800,000 television clients in Flanders. It has not yet received the definitive green light from the local cable companies. The deal was expected to be implemented in 2008 but Belgium's dominant telecom operator Belgacom ( BCOM.BR ) has filed a legal challenge against it. Telenet's CEO said he could give no assurances the deal would be implemented in 2008 "or at all" although he was confident it would go through. Belgacom, which offers a digital television service which competes with Telenet, has said the deal was not transparent and it could be interested in a similar agreement with the local operators. Telenet implemented a debt refinancing plan and capital reduction last year and Sickinghe said the company may return more cash to shareholders in the future. "It is our aim to consider future returns to shareholders based on our continuous assessment of potential value-enhancing acquisitions and the company's operational, financial, corporate and competitive conditions," he said. Telenet, listed on Euronext Brussels in October 2005, was once courted by Mobistar ( MSTAR.BR ), Belgium's second-biggest mobile phone operator, which is owned by France Telecom FTE.PA.
