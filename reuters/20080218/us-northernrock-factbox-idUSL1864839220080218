 LONDON  (Reuters) - The British government drafted new laws on Monday to start bringing embattled mortgage lender Northern Rock NRK.L under the umbrella of public ownership. 

 The whole process could be concluded in days depending on how long it takes parliament to approve the legislation. But the bank's new executive chairman, former London insurance market chief Ron Sandler, said it would take years to turn around the business and repay about 25 billion pounds ($49 billion) of government loans. Here is a guide to what is expected to happen next: LEGISLATION February 18: Finance Minister Alistair Darling introduces draft banking laws to parliament. February 19: Second reading in parliament of the bill. The bill must then be approved by both the House of Commons and the House of Lords before being read into law and rubber stamped by the Queen. As soon as the legislation goes through, the government will have the power to nationalize Northern Rock straight away and delist its shares from the London Stock Exchange. The shares are currently suspended. March 17: The European Commission deadline when emergency funding lines to Northern Rock must cease. STATE-OWNED BANK The bank will be taken into state ownership but run at arm's length by managers selected from the private sector. Executive Chairman Ron Sandler expects to agree on a business plan with the government, Bank of England and industry regulator, the Financial Services Authority, in "a relatively short period of time" and build a new management team. Once in place, he expects to move to a non-executive role. EU CONSTRAINTS Sandler says he has no plans to run down Northern Rock and wants it to compete vigorously for business. But he also says it will be constrained by European rules on state aid and that it will take years to repay government loans. Analysts believe Sandler is likely to have to cut jobs, curtail mortgage lending and sell off assets to repay the bank's debts. RETURNING TO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP The government eventually wants to return the bank to the private sector but this could take years given current instability in financial markets.
