 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's government has said it will nationalize Northern Rock Plc NRK.L -- the first major nationalization in decades and a decision that has provoked intense reaction. Following are comments on the move: 

 - - - - POLITICAL REACTION GEORGE OSBORNE, CONSERVATIVE SHADOW CHANCELLOR: "This is the day when Labour's reputation for economic competence died. Gordon Brown has dithered his way to the disaster of nationalization. "Now the taxpayer will bear the full risk of lending 100 billion pounds of mortgages in an uncertain housing market. We will not back nationalization." VINCE CABLE, LIBERAL DEMOCRAT SHADOW CHANCELLOR: "Belatedly the government has made the right decision. "The first priority must be to work out the seriousness of the problems at the bank with an independent audit of its loan book. "There will be difficult times ahead, especially for the employees, as the bank is downsized. However, there is now hope for the long-term future of the bank when it is eventually sold in more satisfactory conditions." - - - - BUSINESS REACTION MERVYN DAVIES, CHAIRMAN OF UK-LISTED BANK STANDARD CHARTERED  ( STAN.L ): "It's been a well publicized problem but I think in the end it's the right solution. "I think the government had choices here and at the end of the day it is trying to safeguard taxpayers' money." On Ron Sandler: "He's a very accomplished individual and will go through the portfolio and tackle it in the professional way he has done in the past." ANGELA KNIGHT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF BRITISH BANKERS'  ASSOCIATION: "I hope it's nationalization with a purpose and what we will need to see over a fairly short period of time is a plan of how to run the bank for the time being and also a plan for its future." RICHARD BRANSON, HEAD OF VIRGIN CONSORTIUM'S PROPOSAL: "All of us in the Virgin consortium are very disappointed that the government has chosen to opt for nationalization. "We were very clear the business plan we put forward was robust, conservative but ultimately capable of rescuing the interests of all stakeholders. However, we must accept the decision with good grace and hope that the Rock will somehow find better fortune in the future." - - - - SHAREHOLDERS' REACTION UK SHAREHOLDERS ASSOCIATION (UKSA): "UKSA intends to pursue any legal options available to it to thwart the nationalization process and to ensure that fair and reasonable compensation is paid. "We will not accept the transfer of this company to a third party after some temporary nationalization from which that third party will subsequently make substantial profits. "How can (nationalization) be justified where there were two alternatives on the table to ensure the recovery of Northern Rock and to protect the interest of other stakeholders?" - - - - MEDIA REACTION THE TIMES "The decision to nationalize Northern Rock will tarnish both Britain's and Mr Brown's reputation." THE DAILY TELEGRAPH "Nationalizing Northern Rock is the right decision. But it is months too late. Endless dithering by Gordon Brown and his hapless Chancellor Alistair Darling has done untold damage to this Government's relations with the City. It may cost the Prime Minister the next election. "The City is rightly furious. Northern Rock has every chance of being this Government's Black Wednesday." FINANCIAL TIMES "... anybody who suggests that the Labour government has gone back to 1970s socialism deserves ridicule. It has made a sensible, hard-headed, non-ideological choice. But there remain legitimate questions about why it took five months to get there." (Compiled by Steve Slater and Jodie Ginsberg)
