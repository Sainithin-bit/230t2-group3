 LONDON  (Reuters) - Banks drove European shares sharply higher on Monday ahead of key earnings data later this week which will show their progress in writing down losses related to U.S. subprime mortgages. 

 Platinum, meanwhile, raced to new historic highs while the dollar rose against a basket of major currencies after hitting a 1-1/2 week low last week following disappointing U.S. data. Oil climbed above $96 a barrel, helping to erase earlier losses in emerging market assets. Weekend news that the British government is to nationalize Northern Rock <NRK.L, which fell victim last year to a jump in interbank lending rates as a result of the credit crisis, also helped sentiment among British banks. The FTSEurofirst 300 index closed up 2 percent while the DJ STOXX bank sector index was up 2.5 percent. MSCI's main world equity index gained 0.5 percent. U.S. financial markets were closed for Presidents Day holiday. This week's earnings results from scandal-hit French bank Societe Generale, peer BNP Paribas and Britain's Barclays will show the global banking sector's progress in writing down an estimated $300-400 billion of subprime losses. The extent of damage to the sector from the credit crisis holds the key to investor sentiment and the performance of risky assets including stocks after some share indexes dipped into a bear market cycle -- a period of prolonged losses. "The focus this week is going to be on the banks as investors scrutinize their results to see if they've put off balance sheet things that should actually be on balance sheet, and whether we've actually been led a merry dance," said Justin Urquhart Stewart of 7 Investment Management. The iTraxx Crossover index, the most-widely watched indicator of European credit market sentiment, tightened to 560 basis points, after hitting record wide levels last week due to concerns about forced selling on credit products. Emerging sovereign spreads widened 3 basis points while emerging stocks was up 0.6 percent on the day. The March Bund future was down 0.5 percent. SHINING PLATINUM Platinum surged to $2,107 an ounce, gaining more than 20 percent since late January after South Africa, which accounts for 80 percent of global supply, was hit by power cuts that forced mines to shut for five days last month. It was quoted at $2,105 an ounce late in London. Gold was steady at $903 an ounce. U.S. light crude oil rose 50 cents to $96.01 a barrel as an escalating row between OPEC member Venezuela and oil major Exxon Mobil outweighed concerns about the effect of a slowing U.S. economy. The dollar rose 0.2 percent against a basket of major currencies, gaining some support from firmer stocks and recouping some of the losses made on Friday after data showed U.S. consumer sentiment fell to a 16-year low. It was at $1.4649 to the euro and at 108.10 Japanese yen. Investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in March, on top of its rate reduction of 225 bps since September -- moves which have depressed the dollar. "The lethal combination of weakening house prices, high energy prices, tighter lending and volatile asset markets will be difficult to overcome and even the prospect of further rate cuts could do little in this environment," Calyon said in a note to clients.
