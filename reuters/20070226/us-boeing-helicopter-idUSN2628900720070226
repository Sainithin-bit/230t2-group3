 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Government Accountability Office said it would rule on Monday on a $15 billion helicopter contract to Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) that was protested by Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ). 


 Michael Golden, GAO managing associate general counsel, said the ruling would be issued on Monday, but gave no specific time. The GAO is an arm of Congress that reviews federal contract awards if requested by a losing bidder and certain conditions are met. Industry sources said they expected the decision around 12 noon EST (1700 GMT). Lockheed and Sikorksy challenged the Air Force's selection of Boeing last November to build 146 CH-47 Chinook helicopters to replace its aging fleet of Sikorsky HH-60G Pave Hawk combat search-and-rescue helicopters. At the time, the Air Force said Boeing's helicopter represented a low risk option, but some top Air Force officials later said the decision came as a surprise, given the relatively larger size of the Chinook. Lockheed had teamed with AgustaWestland Inc., a unit of the Italian defense manufacturer Finmeccanica SpA ( SIFI.MI ), to pitch the 101 helicopter that has already been picked as the new presidential helicopter. Sikorsky had pitched its HH-92 helicopter. Last month, the GAO held four days of closed-door hearings on the matter, identifying a number of mistakes made in the contract award, according to a source briefed on the hearing. Still, analysts caution that the GAO rarely overturns federal contract awards. An adverse ruling by the GAO would be an embarrassment for the Air Force, which is still recovering from a scandal in which a former top weapons buyer was convicted of favoring Boeing in some weapons deals.
