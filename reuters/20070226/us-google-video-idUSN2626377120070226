 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Google Inc. is working with Dow Jones & Co. Inc., Conde Nast, Sony BMG Music Entertainment and other large content companies to syndicate their video content on other Web sites, the New York Times reported on Monday. 


 The videos appear inside Google ad boxes on sites that are relevant to the content of the videos and advertisements run during or after the content, the paper said. Google shares the ad revenue with the video provider and with the sites that show the videos, the paper said. There are already video ad networks that make similar deals, and NBC Universal is attempting something similar, the paper said, noting however that the Google experiment could be more widespread since the company has a vast reach on the Internet. Google, Dow Jones, Conde Nast and Sony BMG were not immediately available.
