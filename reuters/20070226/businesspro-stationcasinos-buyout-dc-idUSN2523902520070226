 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Station Casinos Inc. ( STN.N ) has 
accepted a revised buyout offer valued at about $5.5 billion 
from a group that includes the company's founding family and 
real-estate firm Colony Capital LLC, according to The Wall 
Street Journal. 


  Station Casinos was not immediately available for comment.  Citing people close to the situation, the Journal said the 
Las Vegas-based casino company's board voted on Saturday to 
enter into a definitive agreement with Fertitta Colony Partners 
LLC, which will pay $90 per share in cash to acquire the 
company and take it private.  Station Casinos shares closed up 30 cents at $83.30 on 
Friday.  Station Casinos first received an $82 per share bid from 
the same group on December 4, the newspaper said.
