 (Reuters) - Marvel Entertainment Inc. MVL.N reported 
lower profit for the fourth quarter, as contributions fell from 
its domestic licensing and Spider-Man merchandising joint 
venture. 


  The New York-based company reported earnings of $11.7 
million, or 14 cents a share, net of a 1 cent charge for 
stock-based compensation expense. Marvel earned $25.9 million, 
or 26 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter.  Analysts expected Marvel to earn 10 cents a share, 
excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates.  (Reporting by Anant Vijay Kala in Bangalore)
