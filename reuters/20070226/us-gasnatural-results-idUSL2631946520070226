 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spanish utility Gas Natural ( GAS.MC ) posted 2006 net profit of 854.5 million euros ($1.12 billion) on Monday, up 14.1 percent year-on-year, and ahead of analysts' forecasts. 


 The results were boosted by Spanish electricity activity, which saw core profit jump 188 percent to 259 million euros as generation capacity increased, and by organic growth in the gas business in both Spain and Latin America. For 2007, the company expects gas demand to rise 9.4 percent in Spain while it will add a further 800 megawatts of electricity generating capacity from mid-year, it said in a presentation to analysts. Gas Natural, which earlier this year pulled its hostile takeover bid for Endesa ( ELE.MC ), said the offer cost it 110.9 million euros which show up as a non-recurring cost in its 2006 profit and loss account, mostly in the EBITDA line. Chief Executive Rafal Villaseca refused to be drawn on whether Gas Natural was contemplating any merger activity. Asked in general and about Britain in particular, he gave little away. "All of Europe is immersed in rumors but opportunities are limited," he said at the analyst meeting. "Our intention is not to speculate on any rumors." Villaseca repeated the company's position on the Medgaz gas pipeline project in Algeria, saying Gas Natural would seriously consider taking a shareholding if current shareholders offer it. The company said 2006 EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) came in at 1.91 billion euros, up 25.9 percent with the electricity business contributing 13.5 percent of core profit. A Reuters Estimates poll of 14 analysts had forecast Gas Natural would post net profit of 848.4 million euros and EBITDA of 1.871 billion euros. Another double-digit percentage rise is expected in core profit for 2007, in line with its strategic plan for 2004 to 2008. Net revenues at the group rose 21 percent to 10.3 billion euros. Analysts had expected Gas Natural's electricity unit to jump because of new output from its Cartagena plant and higher wholesale prices for most of the year. Gas Natural trades on a price to 2007 estimated earnings multiple of 17.9 times, boosted by continued merger speculation in the energy sector, compared to the DJ Stoxx European utilities index .SX6P which trades on 15.9 times. The shares were 1 percent firmer at 33.25 euros by 1611 GMT, after earlier reaching a high on the day of 33.47 euros. Gas Natural said it would increase its 2006 dividend by 16.7 percent over the previous year and Villaseca said it would stick to the dividend policy outlined in its strategic plan. Asked if the company might consider a special dividend or a higher payout ratio, Villaseca said he was convinced the company could reinvest profit to make an even better return for shareholders.
