 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Health insurer WellPoint Inc. ( WLP.N ) stands to become the largest company in the United States with a woman at the helm, on Monday naming General Counsel Angela Braly to replace retiring CEO Larry Glasscock. 


 The choice of Braly, who also previously ran a regional health plan, surprised some analysts. But they said her experience could help WellPoint navigate a potentially challenging political and regulatory environment. "Braly is an interesting choice because she brings great public policy perspective to the leadership role which will probably be increasingly important for all health plans," FTN Midwest analyst Peter Costa said. WellPoint said Glasscock will retire from the health insurer on June 1, but will continue as board chairman. Glasscock, 58, told analysts on a conference call that he was retiring from day-to-day operations because of family reasons, on which he did not elaborate. "The timing of this transition was driven by me, as I said, for family reasons," Glasscock said. Braly, 45, who also holds the titles of executive vice president and chief public affairs officer, has had responsibility for WellPoint's Medicare claims processing business, federal employees' health benefits business and public policy development, among other areas. WellPoint is ranked 38th among U.S. companies by Fortune magazine, reporting $56 billion in revenue for 2006. The Indianapolis-based company is the largest U.S. health insurer by membership, and operates many Blue Cross Blue Shield plans. Glasscock said the board reviewed a range of succession scenarios, including external options, before choosing Braly. Since 2005, he said Braly has partnered with him on "every major strategic initiative." "This is a strong endorsement of our company's performance and our culture," Glasscock said. WellPoint has grown through acquisitions the past several years, capitalizing on a trend of Blue Cross Blue Shield health plans converting from nonprofit plans to publicly traded companies. The company is a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in 14 states, including California. According to WellPoint, Braly was a key strategist in the integration of its blockbuster 2004 Anthem merger and its acquisition of WellChoice. MERGER EXPERIENCE J.P. Morgan analyst William Georges said in a research note that in addition to her policy experience, Braly is a "logical choice" because of expertise in acquisitions, where the analyst sees WellPoint continuing to be active. Before becoming executive vice president in 2005, Braly was CEO of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Missouri, formerly called RightChoice, which she joined in 1999 as general counsel. WellPoint acquired RightChoice in 2002. Braly previously served as partner in a St. Louis law firm. In an interview, Braly pointed to her operational experience at the Missouri health plan, WellPoint's national government services business and its federal employee program when asked about the skills she brings to the new post. "I do think my operational experience is very deep," Braly said in an interview. Braly has perhaps not been in front of investors as much as some of her colleagues. "I don't think she's a bad pick," Costa said. "Perhaps she's a little surprising." Analysts said they would watch whether other executives passed over for the top job would remain at the company, particularly well-regarded Chief Financial Officer Dave Colby. CIBC analyst Carl McDonald said WellPoint shares would likely fall if Colby left, noting he has been WellPoint's main contact with investors. Glasscock, who has served as CEO since 1999, has overseen explosive growth at WellPoint. Under Glasscock, WellPoint and its predecessor companies have grown from 6 million medical members to more than 34 million members, according to the company. Shares of WellPoint fell 58 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $80.92 in afternoon trading amid declines throughout the health-insurance group. The stock is up about 5 percent over the past 12 months, out-performing rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc. ( UNH.N ) and Aetna Inc. ( AET.N ) (Additional reporting by Ramya Dilip in Bangalore)
