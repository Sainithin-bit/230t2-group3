 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Ceradyne Inc. CRDN.O said on Monday 
quarterly profit more than doubled, spurred by higher sales of 
its ceramic body armor plates for U.S. troops. 


  The company, which also makes ceramic materials for 
industrial use, reported fourth-quarter net profit of $37.7 
million, or $1.38 per share, compared with $16.1 million, or 63 
cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.  Wall Street expected $1.19 per share, on average, according 
to Reuters Estimates.  Sales rose 57 percent to $178.7 million, beating analysts' 
average estimate of $174.8 million.  Its shares rose more than 5 percent to $61.99 in pre-market 
trade.
