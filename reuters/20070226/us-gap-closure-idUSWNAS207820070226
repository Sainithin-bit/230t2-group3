 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel retailer Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) said on Monday it will close its Forth & Towne stores that were aimed at women over age 35, in a move that will affect about 550 employees. 


 The company expects pretax expenses of $40 million due to the closure of its 19 stores, which will be recognized over the first and second quarters. Forth & Towne was launched in August 2005 to increase Gap's market share with older women. The stores were designed with larger dressing rooms and stocked with accessories, including handbags, belts, scarves and shoes to help drive impulse purchases and give women ideas on how to combine products. Forth & Towne was set up to compete with department stores including Federated Department Stores Inc.'s FD.N Macy's chain, as well as chain stores like Talbots Inc. TLB.N and AnnTaylor Stores Corp. ( ANN.N ), which sell to career women. Gap shares were up 15 cents at $19.97, in morning New York Stock Exchange trading. The stock has traded between $15.92 and $21.17 over the past 52 weeks.
