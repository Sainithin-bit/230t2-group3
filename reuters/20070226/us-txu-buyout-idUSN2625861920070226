 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Texas power company TXU Corp. TXU.N has agreed to be acquired by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. KKR.UL and Texas Pacific Group TPG.UL for about $32 billion in the largest leverage buyout in history, Bloomberg News reported on Monday. 


 The private equity firms agreed to pay between $69 and $70 per share for TXU, Bloomberg said. That would mark a premium of 15 to 17 percent over TXU's closing stock price of $60.02 on Friday. As of November 6, TXU had 459.2 million shares outstanding. At $69.50 per share, the company would be worth about $31.92 billion. Including debt, the deal is valued at about $44 billion, Bloomberg said. Officials at TXU, KKR and Texas Pacific were not immediately available to comment. The board of TXU met late on Sunday to consider the buyout deal. The company has been battling environmentalists and others who have been working to prevent the company from more than doubling its fleet of coal-fired power plants in Texas. Opponents to the expansion claim the new plants will drastically increase emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury and carbon dioxide in the state.
