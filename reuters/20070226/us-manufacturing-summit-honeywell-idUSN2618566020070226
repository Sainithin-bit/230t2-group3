 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The top executive at Honeywell International Inc. ( HON.N ) said he feels "pretty good" about the U.S. economy and business prospects for the diversified manufacturer. 


 "Most people would say things feel pretty good," said David Cote, Honeywell chairman and chief executive, speaking at the Reuters Manufacturing Summit in New York. "The economy's doing pretty well," Cote said, when asked about customer confidence and business conditions. "Even though it's not growing maybe as fast as it was last year, if it was this bad all the time, we'd be pretty happy," he said. The Morris Township, New Jersey-based diversified manufacturer, which is the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics, also makes products ranging from automation systems for large commercial buildings to industrial chemicals. Wall Street analysts, on average, expect Honeywell to report profit of $2.94 per share this year on revenue of $32.81 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
