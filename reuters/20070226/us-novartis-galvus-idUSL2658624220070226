 ZURICH  (Reuters) - U.S. regulators have asked for more data on Novartis AG's ( NOVN.VX ) diabetes drug Galvus, possibly delaying approval of the potential blockbuster by a year, which dented its shares while boosting its main rival's. 


 The Food and Drug Administration has requested a further clinical study to show its safety and efficacy in patients with kidney impairment, Novartis said on Monday, but the drugmaker remains confident of getting approval for Galvus. "There are no details on the study requirements, but we would expect this study to take a minimum of 12 months to complete, taking likely U.S. approval beyond August '08," JPMorgan analyst Craig Maxwell said in a note. Novartis's 2007 financial outlook remained unchanged for both the pharmaceuticals unit and group as a whole, the company said. The FDA decision puts the Swiss group further behind U.S. rival Merck & Co. Inc. ( MRK.N ) in the race to launch a new class of diabetes drugs known as DPP-4 inhibitors. Merck's Januvia was approved late last year. Novartis pharma development head James Shannon said the FDA was unlikely to request a long-term study, but he could not give further details until the company had had further discussions with the regulatory body. Novartis shares were down 1.9 percent to 70.80 Swiss francs by 1512 GMT, underperforming a 0.5 percent drop in the DJ Stoxx European pharmaceuticals index .SXDP, as investors worried about a potential hole in the company's future earnings. A 12-month delay while a trial is carried out, evaluated and submitted would trim $100 million off sales this year and up to $275 million in 2008, Helvea analyst Andrew Fellows said. "However, this amount of delay will severely hamper the competitive stance of the product , given the presence of Merck's Januvia in the market and the subsequent entry of newer types of diabetes compounds," Fellows said in a note. Merck shares were 3 percent higher at $44.22. BLOCKBUSTER DELAYS Both Galvus and Januvia have been touted by analysts as potential $1 billion-a-year-plus sellers, and the new DPP-4 inhibitors are expected to compete intensely in the lucrative market of oral treatments for diabetes. They are designed to enhance the body's own ability to lower elevated blood sugar and could become an important way to control Type 2 diabetes -- the most common form of the disease, which is becoming a major health problem around the world. A U.S. decision on approving Galvus had previously been delayed by three months after Novartis asked the FDA to consider new data about skin problems. Novartis has supplied the same information on Galvus to other regulatory bodies, including in the European Union, but it is not clear whether they will also delay the approval process, Shannon said. Galvus is one of three blockbuster hopes in the Novartis pipeline of new drugs, along with hypertension treatments Tekturna and Exforge. The U.S. regulatory review of Tekturna was extended by up to three months late last year. Exforge, a high blood pressure treatment, has been approved for use in the U.S. and Europe. Analysts believe DPP-4 drugs are likely to become popular in the market for oral diabetes treatments, since they are not associated with weight gain, a major side effect of established diabetes drugs known as TZDs. That is significant since most Type 2 diabetics are overweight or obese. Weight gain is considered one of the biggest obstacles to effective treatment of diabetes. The two leading brands of TZDs that could be hit by the new DPP-4 competitors are Actos, from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. ( 4205.T ), and Avandia, sold by GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK.L ).
