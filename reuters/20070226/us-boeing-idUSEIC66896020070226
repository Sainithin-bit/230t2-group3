 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Government Accountability Office on Monday sustained a protest filed by Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) and Sikorsky Aircraft, a unit of United Technologies Corp. ( UTX.N ) against a $15 billion helicopter contract awarded to Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) last year. 


 The GAO, an arm of Congress that reviews federal contract awards, said the U.S. Air Force's evaluation of the "life cycle costs" of operating the helicopters was "inconsistent" with the approach it had outlined in the terms of the competition. As a result, GAO said the Air Force should amend the final terms of the competition to make its intentions clear, reopen discussions with bidding companies, and then request revised proposals.
