 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. XMSR.O, which has agreed to be acquired by rival Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ), posted a narrower quarterly loss as it trimmed costs, but gave a lukewarm 2007 outlook that tempered its stock rise. 


 XM shares, which had risen as much as 3 percent, were flat after a morning conference call in which executives gave forecasts for subscriber additions below the expectations of some analysts. The company said gross costs for acquiring each subscriber, including marketing and promotions costs, would likely be flat to marginally higher from 2006. Some analysts had hoped for a fall in this spending. "Guidance was on the negative side," said David Joyce, a media analyst at Miller Tabak + Co. LLC, who expected XM to reach 9.8 million subscribers by the end of this year. XM expected to reach 9 million to 9.2 million subscribers in 2007, up from 7.6 million last year when it added a net 1.7 million new subscribers. The satellite radio operator reported a fourth-quarter loss of $263.2 million, or 90 cents a share, compared with a loss of $270.5 million, or $1.22 a share, a year earlier. Revenue for XM, which offers music, sports, news and talk programs on more than 100 channels for a monthly subscription fee, rose 45 percent to $257.1 million, beating the average analyst forecast of $242.9 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Excluding special items, such as an impairment on its stake in Canadian Satellite Radio and balance sheet restructuring, XM's loss was 70 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations by a penny, according to Reuters Estimates. "They did a good job of controlling costs for the quarter," said Janco Partners analyst April Horace. The company said its subscriber acquisition cost, or SAC, in the quarter was $70, down from $89 in the same period last year. SAC, a closely watched metric, is comprised of subsidies XM pays manufacturers and car makers to add new customers. Cost per gross subscriber addition, which includes SAC and marketing and promotion costs, was $128 compared with $141 in 2005, said the Washington-based XM. Janco's Horace had expected cost per gross subscriber addition of $140. Analysts had hoped for lower spending to court new customers in 2007, but XM executives said they would likely spend more to convince new car buyers to subscribe to the service after trial periods end. XM executives said the company would focus on new car buyers, which accounted for more new customers than retail consumers in 2006, a trend it expected to continue this year. "Merger or no merger, the company is slowly digging its way out of its cost hole," Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett said in a research note. A Congressional antitrust task force will hold a hearing this week on Sirius' proposed takeover of XM, which the companies say will help them better compete with other digital audio products, such as iPods and mobile phones, as well as traditional radio. The combination of the two satellite radio companies must be approved by the U.S. Justice Department and Federal Communications Commission, which review mergers for their impact on competition and customer service. Sirius, which expects to end 2006 with 5.9 million to 6.1 million subscribers, is scheduled to report its quarterly results on Tuesday. XM's shares were down 3 cents to  $15.07 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Sirius were up 2 cents at $3.76.
