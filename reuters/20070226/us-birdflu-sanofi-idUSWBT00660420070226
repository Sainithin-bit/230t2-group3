 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Data on Sanofi-Aventis's ( SNY.N ) ( SASY.PA ) experimental bird flu vaccine shows higher doses worked better, but it is unclear whether those results prove the product's effectiveness, U.S. regulatory staff said in documents released on Monday. 


 Food and Drug Administration staff also said studies of the vaccine, which targets the potentially pandemic H5N1 strain of the influenza virus, showed "no significant safety signals."
