 (Reuters) - R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. said it does not add 
nicotine to its cigarettes, nor does it modify its 
manufacturing standards to increase nicotine levels over time, 
as some recent studies suggested. 


  Responding to recent studies by the Massachusetts 
Department of Public Health and Harvard University School of 
Public Health, R.J. Reynolds, an indirect unit of Reynolds 
American Inc. ( RAI.N ), said it has invited researchers to 
assess its blending and manufacturing processes.  (Reporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore)
