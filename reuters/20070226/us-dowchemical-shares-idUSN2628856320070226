 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of Dow Chemical Co. ( DOW.N ) on Monday soared 8 percent a day after a report in the U.K.-based tabloid Sunday Express newspaper said the company could be a target of a leveraged buyout. 


 The paper, in an unsourced report, said the company might get a takeover offer worth as much as $54 billion from buyout funds. The paper said the approach was likely to come from a combination of global investors and American private equity giants, who intended to break up the group into smaller companies through a highly leveraged buyout. Dow Chemical declined to comment on market rumors. Prior to the report, shares of the company had risen about 8.6 percent over the last 3 months, lagging the Standard and Poor's chemicals index .GSPPM , which had risen about 9.3 percent during the same period. Shares of the company rose $3.45 to $46.90 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange, after touching as high as $47.26 earlier in the session, its highest level since August 2005.
