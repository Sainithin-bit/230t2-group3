 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended modestly lower on Monday as fresh concern about the economic outlook and a rise in oil prices outweighed a frenzy of acquisition activity, including what may become the biggest private equity buyout deal in history. 


 Based on the latest available data, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 15.22 points, or 0.12 percent, to end unofficially at 12,632.26. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 1.82 points, or 0.13 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,449.37. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 10.58 points, or 0.42 percent, to close unofficially at 2,504.52.
