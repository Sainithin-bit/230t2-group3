 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Station Casinos Inc. ( STN.N ) said on Monday it agreed to a $5.4 billion management-led buyout, after the investor group buying the company raised its offer by about 10 percent. 


 The Las Vegas-based company, which operates off-strip casinos used mostly by locals, is being taken over by a group called Fertitta Colony Partners, formed by Station Chief Executive Frank Fertitta, his brother and company vice chairman Lorenzo Fertitta, and a unit of private equity firm Colony Capital. The group said on Monday it would take over Station for $90 per share, or $5.4 billion in cash. It will also assume debt of about $3.4 billion. The price is an 8 percent premium to Station's closing price of $83.30 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday. Fertitta Colony Partners made its original offer to buy Station on December 4, for a price of $82 per share. The deal is expected to close in about six to nine months, Station said.
