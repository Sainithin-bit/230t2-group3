 PARIS  (Reuters) - Carmakers are stepping up efforts to crack booming emerging markets, and Aston Martin, maker of luxury sportscars synonymous with martini-sipping fictional spy James Bond, is on the same mission. "Ten years ago we had one top market -- England. Five years ago we had three -- England, America and Europe. Today we have not only these three main areas, we have South America, Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and India, which are just at the beginning but developing," Chief Executive Ulrich Bez said in an interview. 

 Bez said the company's aim was to have a good balance between markets to protect itself from local peaks and troughs in demand. "England as our home market is key for us to be successful, but it will take only a fraction -- 10 to 15 percent -- of the whole." Aston Martin's unit sales in the UK fell 9 percent to 1,080 last year, the company revealed last month, a fourth consecutive annual fall, though it said global sales were up. It sold about 130 cars in China. Aston Martin unveiled its new Virage at the Geneva auto show, but also showed the small Cygnet city car it developed with partner Toyota Motor Corp, which could draw in new customers in new markets. The small car has a big price tag -- over 35,000 euros ($48,380) -- and could be a second car for existing Aston Martin customers who don't want to take their Rapide or DB9 to the supermarket, Bez said. The car could appeal to existing Aston Martin drivers wanting a more practical car for city driving and could also find new customers in markets like China, now the world's biggest auto market and a goldmine for premium manufacturers. The company expects to sell around 1,500 Cygnets this year, and is beginning sales in the UK and some European markets, with orderbooks already open. The first cars will be on the roads in the second quarter of the year. "The intention is we'll go everywhere," Bez said. Aston Martin also plans an electric version of the Cygnet, with a range of about 80 kilometers, that could be available from around 2012, but unlike some competitors it won't be launching an electric sportscar, he said. MULLING MAYBACH Asked about speculation that Aston Martin could build Maybach models for Daimler, Bez said the carmaker was approached by large-volume carmakers looking for a partner to help make small-volume cars. He said the carmaker was interested in cooperation in general, was considering the offer and could make a decision in the next 12 months. "We have to balance this with our capacity. We are flattered," he said. Aston Martin is half-owned by Investment Dar, and banking sources said last week the Kuwaiti group planned asset sales of about $1.69 billion over three years. It listed its Aston Martin stake as an asset in its restructuring document, but did not outline specific disposal plans, the sources said. Asked about a possible change in its shareholding, Bez said the carmaker's Kuwaiti shareholders were long-term investors. "At some stage our investors will want some benefit out of this. That's a case where we would probably consider an IPO or something similar," he said, adding that there was no rush. "We have various alternatives. Going public is one, but (so is) ... having other shareholders who are not public," he said. (Reporting by Helen Massy-Beresford; Editing by Will Waterman)
