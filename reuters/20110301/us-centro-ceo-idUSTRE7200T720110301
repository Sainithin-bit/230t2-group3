 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Shopping mall owner Centro Properties said on Tuesday it would continue to evaluate all options for the company, including selling its Australian property assets, although that was not the preferred option. 

 Centro chief executive Robert Tsenin told reporters all options would be considered, although talks on establishing a listed Australian property portfolio may create the most value. "We think at the moment the most value for our stakeholders will come from the path we have just outlined," he said. Centro earlier confirmed the sale of its U.S. shopping mall assets to private equity firm Blackstone Group for $9.4 billion. (Reporting by  Michael Smith ; editing by  Sonali Paul )
