 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) could lose up to $3.4 billion from lawsuits and other disputes over the securities it sold and underwrote, the investment bank said in its annual filing with regulators on Tuesday. 

 The bank called the estimate the upper end of a range of "reasonably possible" losses from legal proceedings against it. The amounts it has reserved against such lawsuits "are not significant as compared to the upper end of the range of reasonably possible loss." Separately Goldman Sachs said it had 25 days in 2010 where daily trading net revenue was negative. (Reporting by  Maria Aspan  and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by  Derek Caney )
