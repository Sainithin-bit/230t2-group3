 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy's recovery is moving in fits and starts but improving enough to renew store chains' appetite for private-label credit card deals, MasterCard Inc's head of U.S. markets said on Tuesday. 

 The worst of the economic slowdown is behind U.S. consumers, but rising gasoline prices could once again curb their spending, Chris McWilton, the payment network's president of U.S. markets, said at the Reuters Future of Finance Summit. "It's slow; it's erratic -- the statistics we see suggest it is a slow recovery. People continue to be cautious with what they spend," McWilton said. "Confidence is building, but at a fairly slow rate." He said that confidence will be tested anew by how high gasoline prices rise. Brent crude oil prices pushed back above $114 a barrel on Tuesday because of unrest in the Middle East. "If you get a $4 -- or some people are predicting $5 -- gallon of gas, that could be the wildcard," he said. McWilton also said more retailers would likely introduce their own branded credit cards and find willing bank partners. "Organizations are starting to say, 'This is behind us, we at least can put together a set of assumptions (about bad debt loss rates and unemployment levels),'" he said. Consumers' improving finances have proved to be a boon to major retailers in recent quarters. For example, Target Corp said last week that profit from its credit card business, which it owns, nearly quadrupled over the holiday quarter from a year earlier, as it had fewer bad consumer debts to write off. The big box discounter is trying to sell off some of its credit card receivables and told investors it could land a deal this year. McWilton, whose company processes credit card transactions but does not lend directly, said the market for credit card portfolios has improved enormously in recent months. "There were just not a lot of buyers that wanted to jump in  the middle of the typhoon," he said. McWilton also said MasterCard would try to land more deals in the online retail space dominated by companies like Amazon.com Inc. He called e-commerce "an incredible growth area" that thrived even during the recession. MasterCard paid $520 million in October for the British online payment services company DataCash, and McWilton said the company is looking for similar deals. "It is the only area where you can't do something with cash or a check- it's made for electronic payments products." (Reporting by Phil Wahba and Maria Aspan; Editing by Gerald E.
