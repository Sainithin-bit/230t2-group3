 (Reuters) - The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank on Tuesday named John Williams, formerly the institution's head researcher, as its new president. 

 Williams replaces Janet Yellen, who is now vice chair of the Fed's Washington-based board, and adds another dovish voice to the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. The following is a look at where Fed policy makers stand on a scale of 1 to 5, with "1" signifying doves most likely to support monetary easing and "5" representing hawks most likely to oppose it. 1 -- CHICAGO FED PRESIDENT CHARLES EVANS (2011 voter) Evans was outspoken in his support of the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying stimulus. He has argued Fed policy should remain loose for some time. 1 -- NEW YORK FED PRESIDENT WILLIAM DUDLEY (permanent voter) Dudley has defended the Fed's actions strongly, arguing that the Fed is still far short of meeting its goals of price stability and maximum sustainable employment. 1 -- FED GOVERNOR DANIEL TARULLO (permanent voter) Tarullo, an appointee of President Barack Obama, focuses on bank supervision and does not speak frequently about the outlook for the economy or policy. He has, however, been supportive of quantitative easing. 1 -- FED VICE CHAIR JANET YELLEN (permanent voter) Firmly in the pro-easing camp when she was president of the San Francisco Fed, Yellen took no one by surprise with her support for the Fed's controversial stimulus. 1 -- BOSTON FED PRESIDENT ERIC ROSENGREN (2010 voter) Rosengren has avidly defended the Fed's second round of quantitative easing, dubbed QE2, and has said the economy would need to be on much firmer ground before the central bank thinks of withdrawing its stimulus. 2 -- FED CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE (permanent voter) Bernanke's view on the need for more easing carried the day when the Fed approved its bond-buying plan in November, and all but one of the voting policymakers fell in line behind him. The Fed chief has used a number of venues since to offer an extensive rationale for easing, saying sluggish growth, stubbornly high unemployment and falling inflation forced the Fed's hand. 2 -- SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JOHN WILLIAMS (2012 voter) Seen as a bit less dovish than his predecessor, Williams has nonetheless been openly supportive of QE2. He has argued the U.S. economic recovery is on a sustainable path but made clear that full employment is far off. 2 -- MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT NARAYANA KOCHERLAKOTA (2011 voter) Kocherlakota, initially a skeptic of the effectiveness of easing through long-term bond buying, surprised by backing the plan and expressing confidence it would help by lowering longer-term rates and steering investors to riskier assets. 2 -- FED GOVERNOR SARAH RASKIN (permanent voter) A recent Obama appointee, Raskin's background as a regulatory official for the state of Maryland makes her monetary leanings hard to gauge. However, she put a heavy emphasis on employment during her nomination hearing. 2 -- ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART (2012 voter) Lockhart has defended the Fed's program, saying it is aimed at supporting recovery, not driving down the value of the dollar. 2 -- CLEVELAND FED PRESIDENT SANDRA PIANALTO (2010 voter) Pianalto has supported the Fed's bond buying initiative and has said research at her bank supports the notion that much of the nation's unemployment problem is cyclical rather than structural, suggesting the central bank could effectively combat it by boosting demand. 3 -- FED GOVERNOR ELIZABETH DUKE (permanent voter) In public remarks, Duke tends to focus more on regulatory issues than on the broader economy, but she has defended the Fed's bond-buying program. 3 -- ST. LOUIS FED PRESIDENT JAMES BULLARD (2010 voter) Bullard supported the Fed's decision to ease further in November but has said recently he would like to dial back the bond-buying program. 4 -- FED GOVERNOR KEVIN WARSH (permanent voter) Warsh, who is stepping down at the end of the month, voted with Bernanke on QE2, but expressed skepticism about the policy's effectiveness in a newspaper column soon after the decision. 5 -- DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER (2011 voter) Fisher has pulled no punches in voicing opposition to further Fed easing. Just five days after the early November decision, Fisher said the bond purchases are the "wrong medicine." 5 -- PHILADELPHIA FED PRESIDENT CHARLES PLOSSER (2011 voter) An outspoken inflation hawk, Plosser represents a vocal minority on the U.S. central bank that views the latest policy move as more trouble than it is worth, delivering only modest benefits and possibly providing the kindling for future inflation. 5 -- RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER (2012 voter) Lacker opposed the central bank's new round of easing, saying he believed the risks exceeded the benefits. He has called for the program to be reviewed regularly, and indicated he may want it to end before the June deadline. 5 -- KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG (2010 voter) Hoenig used all of his votes in 2010 to dissent, first against maintaining the Fed's pledge to hold interest rates "exceptionally low" for "an extended period," and again on the Fed's latest round of easing. He has warned that rock-bottom rates could set the stage for another boom-and-bust cycle.
