 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Carol Bartz could announce a major management reorganization as early as next week, most likely on Wednesday, according to the blog AllThingsD. 

 The Wall Street Journal-affiliated blog, citing several sources inside and outside the Internet company, said the shift could be pushed out a week or two or rolled out in pieces. The blog cited a February 20 Bartz memo to employees, in which she said, "Get well-rested, because next week's a biggie." Yahoo officials declined to comment. Yahoo, the leading provider of online display advertising, has been under pressure for nearly a year as it held fruitless merger or partnership talks with Microsoft Corp, Google Inc and Time Warner Inc's AOL. During that time, Yahoo lost market share in search advertising, while display ad sales have been badly hit industrywide by the U.S. recession. The reorganization is expected to include a set-up where executives like chief operating officer, chief technology officer and a new, more powerful chief marketing officer all report to Bartz, the blog said. In addition, several sources suggested Bartz may abandon a recent restructuring that split the world into four operating regions, the blog said. Instead, one executive could head the United States and a second head up all international efforts. (Reporting by  Ben Klayman ; editing by  Mohammad Zargham )
