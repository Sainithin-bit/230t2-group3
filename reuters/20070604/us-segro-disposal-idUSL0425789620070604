 LONDON  (Reuters) - British property firm Segro has agreed to sell its U.S. life sciences real-estate business to Health Care Property Investors Inc. for $2.9 billion as it moves to focus on Britain and continental Europe. 

 Segro, formerly Slough Estates, said on Monday it would return 250 million pounds ($495 million) of the proceeds from the sale of Slough Estates USA to shareholders via a special dividend. The firm, which announced a strategic review of its U.S. assets in November, said it would receive net proceeds receivable would amount to 574 million pounds ($1.1 billion) after deducting tax, debt and related costs. It plans to use the rest of the money to pay down debt. "It (the U.S. business) is not part of our long-term strategy due to its lack of synergies with our UK and European business," Segro Chief Executive Ian Coull told reporters. "This disposal allows us to focus completely on UK and Europe, where we see excellent opportunities to grow and achieve attractive returns." The gross sales amount represents a premium of 26 percent over book value of the property assets as of end-December. The unit comprises 83 properties in the San Francisco Bay area and San Diego County, representing 5.2 million square feet of life science/pharma space including the campuses for Genentech and Amgen in south San Francisco. Health Care said in a separate statement it had obtained a financing commitment for a $3 billion bridge loan in connection with the transaction. Segro, which owns industrial, offices and logistics space in such areas as Paris, Duesseldorf and Brussels, said the auction of the U.S. business attracted more than 20 bidders initially. "Segro considered other transaction structures, including options which might have reduced or deferred the tax costs associated with an immediate exit, but all of these involved maintaining a material presence in the U.S. for a minimum of another five years," it said in a statement. By 0730 GMT, Segro shares were up 1.0 percent to 732-1/2 pence, after rising as high as 749-1/2p. UBS and Merrill Lynch are acting as financial adviser and joint broker to Segro.
