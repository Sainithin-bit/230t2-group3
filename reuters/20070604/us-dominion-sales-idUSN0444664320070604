 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Dominion Resources ( D.N ) said on Monday it would sell most of its remaining gas and oil exploration and production operations to Loews Corp. LTR.N and XTO Energy Inc. XTO.N for about $6.5 billion as part of its plan to focus on its power business. 

 The sale, which brings Dominion closer to completing its plan to sell most of its exploration and production assets, raised less than expected, according to analysts. Including earlier sales, Dominion has agreed to sell $11.84 billion in exploration and production properties this year. Loews, a conglomerate with other energy investments, will pay about $4.03 billion for Dominion's gas assets in the Permian Basin in Texas as well as in Michigan and Alabama. XTO, a natural gas producer, will pay about $2.5 billion for the operations in the Rocky Mountains and South Texas region, including the Gulf Coast, San Juan Basin and Louisiana. XTO said it may include them in a master limited partnership that gives the company tax advantages. XTO also raised its production growth forecast to 15 percent from 10 percent. XTO's shares rose more than 5 percent, while Dominion shares rose less than 1 percent. "The price looks to be be disappointing, at least relative to our expectations," said Nathan Judge, an analyst at Atlantic Equities in London. "Having said that, it looks like they are going to be buying back more stock than they had originally committed to as a percent of total proceeds and their expenses are lower," Judge said. Other Dominion exploration and production sales this year included its Gulf of Mexico properties, which it agreed to sell to ENI Plc ENI.L for $4.76 billion, and its Canadian property, which it plans to sell for $583 million to a Canadian energy trust. The remaining properties earmarked for sale, largely in Oklahoma, will be sold in a new process starting in July, Dominion said. Atlantic's Judge said the Oklahoma assets may fetch $1.7 billion, which would bring the total sales up to about $13.5 billion. While Dominion did not disclose the target sales price, sources close to the situation told Reuters earlier this year it had been seeking to raise about $15 billion overall. Monday's sale of onshore assets, which includes 3.51 trillion cubic feet equivalent of proved natural gas and oil reserve as of December 31 and is expected to close in August, was less than foreseen, said Neil Bigman, a Dahlman Rose analyst specializing in gas assets. "(Onshore was) a little bit lighter than I would like to see, but the offshore was higher than expected," he added, referring to the Gulf of Mexico sale. Daniele Seitz, an analyst at Dahlman Rose who has a buy rating on Dominion and owns no shares, said it was "a little disappointing as we were expecting the company to do better at monetizing these assets," but that the company's restructuring is positive and the move should help earnings. Dominion forecast 2008 operating earnings of $6 or more per share and future growth of 4 percent to 6 percent per share as it operates as a more pure-play power company. As previously announced, Dominion intends to maintain its gas operations in the Appalachian. The company has 26,500 megawatts of power generation and operates a utility in Virginia. The Richmond, Virginia-based company said it had earmarked the asset sale proceeds for about $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion in debt reduction, with the remainder planned for the repurchase of common stock. Shares in XTO rose $3.32, or 5.7 percent, to $61.69, while Loews rose 26 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $51.28. Dominion rose 38 cents, or 0.4 percent, to $88.02.
