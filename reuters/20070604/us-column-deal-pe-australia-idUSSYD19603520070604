 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Private equity's love affair with Australia has taken a surprising turn in recent weeks -- shareholders are suddenly playing hard to get. 

 A waning appetite for cash and soaring valuations have left a trail of unconsummated takeovers such as Qantas Airways Ltd. ( QAN.AX ), although jilted buyout groups say there are plenty more fish in the sea. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and two of its partners became the latest private equity firms to walk away disappointed last week after abandoning ambitions to buy Australian retail giant Coles Group Ltd. CGJ.AX. "KKR found themselves in a position where the mood of the market has changed against all-cash offers and moved to a situation where people don't like giving up their exposure to businesses and assets," one Australian investment banker close to the deal told Reuters. About A$10.4 billion ($8.7 billion) of Australian private equity takeovers announced so far this year have failed, compared to A$11.6 billion for all of 2006, according to Dealogic. Those figures do not include Qantas or Coles, which is still being sized up by two other bidding groups. Private equity flocked to Australia last year, attracted to the nation's mature companies, stable economy and compulsory pension schemes and met little resistance until this year. Bankers say booming stock markets and concern by fund managers about where to park cash from large deals is feeding shareholder resistance but not enough to scare private equity away from Australia, where the value of takeovers doubled to A$100 billion in 2006. "There will probably be some abatement of public to private as people go out and digest whether it is all worthwhile. However, there are no signs of a slow up in private treaty transactions," said Scott Perkins, head of global banking, Australia, for Deutsche Bank. What would have been the world's largest airline takeover, a A$11 billion bid for Qantas by a consortium including TPG, failed last month after key shareholders blocked the offer because it was too low. Private equity bidders for Australasian media group APN News & Media ( APN.AX ) were also left standing at the altar when a key fund manager voted against their joint offer. Other failed Australian buyouts this year include A$10 billion bid for Australian explosives firm Orica Ltd ( ORI.AX ) and Flight Centre Ltd ( FLT.AX ). Most of the troubled deals this year have run into shareholder concerns about valuations being too low. JILTED SUITORS Rather than suppress appetite for Australia, buyout firms say shareholder activism will result in a different approach to deals by actively engaging shareholders as well the target company's board in negotiations. "What it is doing is making the private equity managers who have large public, high-profile brand-name deals in the pipeline pay much more attention to the execution (and) the communication, and that it is properly positioned vis a vis the various stakeholders, which they might have taken for granted historically," said Melissa Ma, co-Founder of private equity fund of fund Asia Alternatives Management LLC. Investment bankers agree. "I think there will be more private equity shareholder activism, in other words seeking to more publicly work with the register of a disgruntled target to bring about a board recommendation," Perkins said. While private equity is finding it harder to make easy money, there is no shortage of cash to spend. Local buyout firm Archer Capital closed a A$1.36 billion fund on Monday, the largest leveraged buyout raising by an Australian firm. Archer focuses on local businesses valued at no more than A$1.5 billion. "We are in the sub A$1.5 billion category so not nearly as important to institutional investors as opposed to a A$20 billion deal which starts putting holes in their portfolio," Archer Capital partner Greg Minton told Reuters. "The market is going to need to more fairly value some of these larger organizations. Qantas' problem is that it was under-valued and restricted the board's ability to raise capital." About A$16.5 million private-equity sponsored buyouts targeting Australian firms have been announced in 2007 so far, making up 24 percent of a total A$67.5 billion in deals, according to Dealogic. Qantas was the seventh-largest failed financial sponsor buyout globally ever and Orica was the ninth largest, Dealogic data shows.
