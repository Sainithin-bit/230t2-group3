 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - When it comes to the question of how executives see their bosses, most said: Anything you can do, I can do better. 

 According to a poll released on Monday by staffing company Korn/Ferry International, 73 percent of the participants in its Executive Quiz said they believe they could do their boss' job better than their current manager. Executives from 70 countries worldwide "representing a wide spectrum of industries and functional areas" participated in the poll, which took place in March of this year. Sixty-five percent of those polled said they aspired to attain their boss' job. "These results suggest that many of today's executives are feeling 'underemployed' -- or in other words, that their employers are not making full use of their backgrounds and abilities," said Bob Damon, president, North America for Korn/Ferry. "The secret for companies is to identify their high potentials and give them strategic developmental opportunities in order to keep them challenged and satisfied, and best leverage their drive and ambition." Although they apparently feel they could outperform their bosses, 42 percent of executives polled thought their current manager's performance was "excellent" or "above average."
