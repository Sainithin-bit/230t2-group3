 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Renewed signs of strength in the U.S. economy have forced a number of Wall Street firms to back away from forecasts for interest rate cuts this year. 

 Merrill Lynch's shift was the most drastic. It went from predicting the Federal Reserve would lower rates by a full percentage point to not seeing any reductions at all. "The Fed is not going to be cutting rates at any time this year," said David Rosenberg, chief economist for North America at Merrill Lynch. The change was based in part on expectations for stronger growth, with the firm raising its estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product to 2.5 percent from 2 percent. UBS economists had also tweaked their GDP predictions higher, up to 2.8 percent from 2.3 percent. This rosier outlook prompted them to take about 0.5 percentage point of rate cuts off the table -- they now see the federal funds rate closing out the year at 4.75 percent. The Fed has held its target rate on overnight loans between banks at 5.25 percent since June 2006. During the preceding two years, it had incrementally raised rates in quarter percentage point increments from a four-decade low of 1 percent. Underlying the alterations was a growing sense that, under Ben Bernanke, the Fed was less likely to act on a hunch than it was under former Chairman Alan Greenspan. As a former academic, Bernanke is seen adhering to implicit data targets on inflation and employment in ways his predecessor might not have. "This is a Fed that is 100 percent concentrated on not only getting core inflation below 2 percent, but as several Fed officials have told us lately, it has to get to 1.5 percent and with a higher unemployment rate," said Rosenberg. Two reports on Friday proved the final straw for those still calling for extensive Fed easing. Not only did the economy generate more jobs than expected, but a widely watched manufacturing survey also hinted at a rebound in the sector. "Our forecast that the Fed would begin to cut rates in Q3 was contingent on a much weaker labor market," said Doug Smith, chief economist for the Americas at Standard Chartered. "We regularly highlighted that the risk to our Fed view was that the labor market would not weaken quickly enough. As such, we are fine-tuning our call for the first rate cut to be in the fourth quarter."
