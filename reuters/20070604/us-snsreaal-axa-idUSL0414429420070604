 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch financial group SNS Reaal SR.AS is to buy the Dutch insurance operations of France's AXA ( AXAF.PA ) for 1.75 billion euros ($2.35 billion) to double its domestic market share and save costs. 

 The bank, which provides retail banking and financial services to small and mid-sized companies in the Netherlands, said on Monday the acquisition would be earnings accretive from 2008 and would be partly funded by an equity issue. "It is a financially attractive transaction," SNS Chief Executive Sjoerd van Keulen told reporters on a call. SNS said it would help fund the deal by selling 350 million euros in equity and also use existing funds. SNS Reaal's controlling shareholding foundation would concurrently sell up to 200 million euros' worth of existing shares, with an over-allotment of 50 million euros' worth. At current prices, that would take the foundation's stake in SNS from 65 percent to about 54 percent, SNS Reaal's Chief Financial Officer Ronald Latenstein van Voorst said. Shares in SNS had gained 3.8 percent by 1000 GMT to 17.63 euros, making it the fourth-highest gainer in Amsterdam's AEX index  .AEX , which was little changed. Van Keulen said the share sales, which could total as much as 600 million euros, would bring much-needed liquidity into the trading of SNS shares, a move welcomed by analysts. Asked whether the foundation controlling SNS Reaal would be willing to sell more of its stake and possibly let it fall below 50 percent, Latenstein van Voorst said: "They are not necessarily against moving into a minority stake." SNS is paying AXA cash plus accrued interest of 4 percent from January 1 of this year, which will be the effective date of the acquisition. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2007, SNS said. SNS is paying 1.1 times the embedded value -- used to measure an insurer's ability to pay out future claims -- and 12 times earnings, according to a banker familiar with the deal. SNS went public in May 2006, and said it planned to use the proceeds to fund acquisitions. Last year, SNS agreed to buy the non-mortgage business of ABN AMRO AAH.AS for 810 million euros. "We think that almost doubling in size should be very beneficial for the efficiency of the company's insurance activities," said Petercam analyst Ton Gietman said in a note. SNS said it expected to find 50 million euros in pretax cost savings from the acquisition by 2011, and that 400 jobs would be cut, mainly by attrition. As a result of the acquisition, SNS said its share of the total Dutch insurance market would grow to 9.2 percent. Lehman Brothers advised SNS Reaal on the deal.
