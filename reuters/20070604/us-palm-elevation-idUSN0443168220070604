 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Palm Inc. PALM.O will sell a 25-percent stake to Elevation Partners, a Silicon Valley private equity firm, for $325 million, the Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Monday. 

 Elevation will bring former Apple Inc. ( AAPL.O ) executives to the maker of hand-held electronic devices, according to the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. Neither Palm nor Elevation immediately returned calls seeking comment. Palm will pay $940 million in cash, or about $9 a share, to existing shareholders whose ownership of the company will drop to 75 percent under the deal's terms, the Journal reported, adding that the deal needs shareholder approval.
