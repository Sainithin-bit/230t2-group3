 (Corrects in third paragraph to show foundation selling 200 million euros' worth of existing shares, not 200 million shares) 

 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Dutch financial group SNS Reaal SR.AS said on Monday it will acquire the Dutch insurance operations of France's AXA ( AXAF.PA ) for 1.75 billion euros ($2.35 billion), which will be partly funded by an equity issue. The bank, which provides retail banking and financial services to small and mid-sized companies in the Netherlands, said the acquisition would be earnings accretive from 2008 and double its share of the Dutch insurance market. SNS said it will partly fund the acquisition with 350 million euros in equity and that its majority shareholding foundation would also concurrently sell up to 200 million euros' worth of existing shares, with an over-allotment of 50 million euros.
