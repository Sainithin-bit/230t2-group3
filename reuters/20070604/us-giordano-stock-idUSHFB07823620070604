 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Shares in fashion retailer Giordano International Ltd. ( 0709.HK ) jumped more than 8 percent on Monday amid speculation that three global retail giants were considering buying a stake in the company. 

 The stock's opening share price was set at HK$3.90, up 5.7 percent. It quickly jumped to as high as HK$4.03. Esprit ( 0330.HK ), Spanish retailer Zara ( ITX.MC ) and Tokyo listed Fast Retailing ( 9983.T ), were seeking a stake in Giordano to increase their exposure in the mainland, the South China Morning Post reported on Saturday. Giordano has 1,793 shops across Asia, the report said. Giordano's stock has now risen some 16.4 percent since Wednesday driven partly by speculation of an acquisition offer.
