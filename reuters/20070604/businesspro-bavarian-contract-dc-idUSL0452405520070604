 COPENHAGEN  (Reuters) - Danish vaccine maker Bavarian Nordic 
( BAVA.CO ) said on Monday it had won a U.S. government contract 
for the manufacture and delivery of 20 million doses of the 
company's smallpox vaccine, Imvamune. 

  "The total value of the deal, including contractual 
options, is $1.6 billion, of which the base contract amounts to 
$500 million," Bavarian said in a statement.  In addition to the delivery of the doses, the base contract 
will support additional research and development of the vaccine 
to fulfill the requirements for the potential use of Imvamune 
during an emergency, Bavarian said.
