 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp.'s ( GM.N ) often 
rocky relationship with its North American auto parts suppliers 
improved over the past year, while Ford Motor Co.'s ( F.N ) 
relations worsened, a study released on Monday found. 

  GM made a sharp turnaround in its relationship with parts 
suppliers, climbing above Ford and out of the basement among 
automakers in North America, Planning Perspectives' annual 
supplier-automaker study found.  Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. 
( 7267.T ) were rated first and second respectively and held 
broad leads over others as automakers that North American auto 
parts suppliers most want to do business with, it found.  Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) finished third and 
DaimlerChrysler AG DCX.NDCXGn.DE fourth in the study.  Birmingham, Michigan-based consulting firm Planning 
Perspectives Inc. surveys suppliers on their relationships with 
the top six automakers in North America on trust, 
communication, assistance in cutting costs, the long-term 
opportunity to make profits and other topics.  GM and Ford both announced programs to improve relations 
with suppliers in 2005 and the study reflects a significant 
positive impact from GM's efforts, Planning Perspectives said.  "In the 15 years we've been doing studies of this type in 
the automotive and other industries worldwide, we have never 
seen such a dramatic turn-around," Planning Perspectives 
President and Chief Executive Officer John Henke said of GM.  "Our study shows the Ford program has been a dismal 
failure," Henke said. "This is unfortunate because Ford more 
than ever is dependent on the support of its suppliers to help 
in its turnaround, just as Chrysler was in early 1990s."  GM's improved scores came from large suppliers, which rated 
the automaker best to work with among U.S.-based automakers.  Planning Perspectives creates an index based on the 
responses from suppliers, with scores below 250 indicating very 
poor to poor working relations, adequate, from 250 to 349 and 
good to very good, from 350 to 500.  Toyota's score rose to 415, from 407 the prior year. 
Honda's score rose to 380 from 368 and Nissan's dropped to 289, 
from 300. Chrysler's score dropped to 199, from 218. GM's score 
rose to 174, from 131 the prior year, pushing it above Ford, 
which saw its score drop to 162, from 174.
