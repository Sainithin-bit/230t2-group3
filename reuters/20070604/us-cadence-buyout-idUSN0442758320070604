 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Cadence Design Systems Inc. ( CDNS.O ), a maker of software for designing microchips, is in talks with at least two buyout firms about a possible sale, the New York Times reported in its online edition on Monday. 

 Cadence has held talks with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts KKR.UL and The Blackstone Group BG.UL, according to the report, which cited people close to the matter. A deal for Cadence would be one of the biggest moves by private equity firms into technology, it said. Neither Cadence nor Blackstone immediately returned calls seeking comment. KKR could not immediately be reached.
