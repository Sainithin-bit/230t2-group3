 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Two former managing directors at Putnam Investments have agreed to pay a civil penalty of $400,000 each to settle charges they engaged in improper trading of Putnam mutual fund shares, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday. 

 The SEC said Justin Scott and Omid Kamshad also agreed to a suspension from an association with an investment adviser for one year. They settled with the SEC without admitting or denying the charges. Attorneys for Scott and Kamshad could not immediately be reached for comment. The SEC said the former managers violated their responsibilities to other fund shareholders by engaging in short-term trades that were made in their Putnam-administered deferred compensation and retirement accounts. Scott and Kamshad did not disclose their trading and potentially harmed other shareholders, the SEC said. The investor protection agency said Scott agreed to pay the civil penalty in addition to $489,439 in disgorgement of ill-gotten profits and $159,475 in prejudgment interest. One-half of his total liability may be offset by payments he makes to settle a related action brought by the Secretary of State of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Kamshad agreed to pay disgorgement of $57,157 and prejudgment interest of $13,709 as well as the $400,000 civil penalty, the SEC said. Half of the total may also be used to offset a related commonwealth of Massachusetts action. Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. ( MMC.N ) is selling Putnam, which manages about $192 billion in assets, to Canada's Power Financial Corp. ( PWF.TO ). A closing is expected in mid-2007.
