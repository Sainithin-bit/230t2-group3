 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - New orders at factories rose a smaller-than-expected 0.3 percent in April, the weakest showing since January, on a sharp drop in aircraft orders, a Commerce Department report showed on Monday. 

 Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting factory orders to rise 0.7 percent. March orders were revised up to show a 4.1 percent gain from the previously reported 3.1 percent. "It's a smaller-than-expected increase, but it doesn't change the improvement in the manufacturing picture this spring," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. Financial markets payed scant attention to the report, though U.S. stock prices pared some of their losses after the report showed durable goods orders were stronger than expected. Excluding transportation, factory orders rose 0.7 percent after a 2.4 percent increase in March. Orders for durable goods, long-lasting items meant to last three years or longer, were revised to show a bigger-than-expected 0.8 percent. Durables orders were previously reported to have risen 0.6 percent, and analysts polled by Reuters had expected the durables figure to stay unrevised. In a sign businesses are continuing to invest, orders for capital goods excluding defense and aircraft, considered a proxy for business spending, were revised to an increase of 2.1 percent after a previously reported 1.2 percent gain. Transportation orders, which swing considerably from month to month because of the large value of aircraft orders, fell 1.6 percent, as orders for civilian aircraft and parts tumbled 10.7 percent. When defense orders were stripped out, factory orders rose 0.3 percent. Machinery orders fell, but orders for primary metals, computers and electronic products, and electrical equipment and appliances all rose. The inventories-to-shipments ratio eased slightly to a 1.24 month's supply. The inventories-to-shipments ratio is a measure of the number of months it would take to deplete inventories at the current pace of shipments.
