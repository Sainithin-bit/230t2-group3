 HUA HIN, Thailand  (Reuters) - Leaders of Myanmar and Cambodia refused on Saturday to meet members of civic groups from their countries at a Southeast Asian summit where the bloc is trying to promote human rights as part of its charter. 

 The meeting with civic groups from eight other countries took place on the sidelines of the summit in the Thai beach resort of Hua Hin. The Cambodian and Myanmar groups agreed to pull out. Exiled Myanmar politician Soe Aung said ASEAN has to abandon its tradition of non-interference in each other's internal affairs if this kind of dialogue is to work in the future. "Until and unless then, this ASEAN human rights body and ASEAN charter will not be effective at all," Soe told reporters. Debbie Stothard of the Alternative ASEAN Network on Burma said that, while the ASEAN charter is meant to promote human rights and democracy, "even in this situation, people are not allowed to have dialogue with their own government." Leaders from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are meeting at the Thai seaside resort of Hua Hin under the theme of "ASEAN Charter for ASEAN Peoples" and has introduced for the first time a dialogue between the leaders and civil society groups. Myanmar's military rulers do not meet with such groups unless they are sanctioned by the state. "The important thing is the process has begun," said the summit host, Thailand's Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva. "We must take gradual steps and encourage wider participation. This is something new. This is the first time and we will continue to make more progress." ASEAN foreign ministers have been unable to make much progress on the scope of a new body to promote and protect human rights in a grouping with political systems that range from Myanmar's junta and Brunei's monarchy to young democracies. ASEAN comprises Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Myanmar, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Brunei and the Philippines.
