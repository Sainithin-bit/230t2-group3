 PORTO, Portugal  (Reuters) - The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) will cut its predictions for world gross domestic product growth March 31, General Secretary Angel Gurria said on Sunday. 

 "We expect 2010 to be positive, but weak," Gurria told journalists. "When we give our forecasts March 31, we will cut our forecasts." Gurria also said the financial crisis has shown no country has successfully de-coupled from the United States. (Reporting by Sergio Goncalves; Writing by Paul Day; editing by  Axel Bugge )
