 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - A strike by more than 1,000 workers was temporarily averted at Sunoco Inc's two refineries in Pennsylvania on Sunday as the United Steelworkers union and the company extended talks for a new contract, the unions said. 

 Union members were poised to walk off their jobs shortly after noon EST on Sunday at the Philadelphia and Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, refineries, which have a combined refining capacity equal to 3 percent of the national total. The two USW locals granted a rolling 24-hour extension to continue talks as progress was made Sunday morning on a new contract, said USW International Vice President Gary Beevers. "We're making progress," Beevers said. "We've still got some yards to make up, but we can't do it in 15 minutes." Talks between the Steelworkers and Sunoco snagged last week on the company's desire to cut staffing by about 15 percent at the two plants, which the union said violates a long-standing no-layoff provision renewed in a national agreement between the USW and U.S. refiners last month and could reduce safety. Sunoco contends its proposed staffing cuts would bring the refineries in-line with safe production practices at refineries across the United States and give it greater flexibility to deal with the sliding demand for motor fuels as the U.S. recession crushes demand. A strike could further push up rising retail gasoline prices, especially in the U.S. Northeast. Prices have been climbing in recent weeks due to escalating oil prices and refiner production cuts.
