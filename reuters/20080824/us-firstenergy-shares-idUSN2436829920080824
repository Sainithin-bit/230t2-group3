 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Power utility operator FirstEnergy Corp is likely to gain more profit next year due to its clean-burning nuclear plants and improved efficiency, which could help lift its dividend and share price, Barron's reported in its August 25 edition. 

 The report said the stock has been weighed down in the low $70-range due to worries about fuel costs, stricter pollution regulations and relatively cool weather that has curbed electricity demand. "Compared with peers with nuclear capacity, FirstEnergy looks modestly priced at 13.5 times estimated earnings for 2009, with a slightly higher than average dividend yield, 3 percent," the report said. It said the company's profit should increase 27 percent next year, and that its nuclear energy assets were a long-term benefit, particularly with the adoption of stricter anti-pollution regulation. Citi Investment Research analyst Greg Gordon was quoted as saying the shares could hit $82 in 12 months, as electricity deregulation allows the company to seek higher rates.
