 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The costs to insure the debt of some big U.S. banks against potential default rose between 10 and 20 basis points on Friday amid a selloff in riskier assets on investors' concerns about Dubai's debt difficulties. 

 Five-year credit default swaps for Morgan Stanley widened to 150 basis points from about 137 basis points at Wednesday's close, according to CMA DataVision. Bank of America's CDS widened by about 10 basis points to 140 basis points and Citigroup's CDS widened by about 20 basis points to 210 basis points. U.S. bond markets were closed on Thursday for the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. (Reporting by  John Parry ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
