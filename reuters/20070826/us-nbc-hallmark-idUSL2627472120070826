 LONDON  (Reuters) - NBC Universal is preparing to buy Sparrowhawk Media, the private-equity backed owner of the Hallmark channel, for 175 million pounds ($351 million) to make its biggest foray into Britain's TV industry, a newspaper said. 

 Sparrowhawk's owners -- 3i ( III.L ) and Providence -- are close to concluding talks with NBC to sell the business, the Sunday Telegraph said in an unsourced report. The move will help NBC, controlled by General Electric ( GE.N ), to achieve its target of increasing the proportion of international revenues to its overall income to 30 percent from 20, it said.
