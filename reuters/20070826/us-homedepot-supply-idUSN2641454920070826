 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) agreed to cut the price of its supply division sale by $1.8 billion, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday. 

 The source said a tentative new agreement has been reached for the private equity buyers to purchase the division for $8.5 billion. The original purchase price was $10.3 billion. Home Depot will also take a 10 percent equity stake in the division after the sale, the source said. The reduced price comes as the credit market crunch has forced banks to reel in loose lending practices that came to define the private equity deal frenzy of the last two years. The private equity buyers are Bain Capital, Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice. The New York Times first reported the lowered sale price on its Web site on Sunday.
