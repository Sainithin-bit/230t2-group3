 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd/Plc ( RIO.L )( RIO.AX ) said on Monday it has received U.S. anti-trust clearance for its $38.1 billion ($36.3 billion) acquisition of Canadian aluminum maker Alcan Inc AL.TO. 

 The U.S. approval follows Canada's Quebec province government approval for the takeover earlier this month. Rio formally launched a pre-agreed offer for Montreal-based Alcan in July, trumping an earlier hostile offer by U.S. rival Alcoa ( AA.N ).
