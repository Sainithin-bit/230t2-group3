 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said fundraising across alternative asset classes, particularly credit and real estate, remains robust in a low-rate, low-risk world, and sees more value in the stocks of asset managers that have a diverse mix. 
 The brokerage said although the outlook for traditional private equity fundraising remains mixed; real estate, distressed debt and mezzanine fundraising has grown steadily since the financial crisis, with a total funding pipeline of $225 billion across all three categories. Goldman raised its ratings on Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) and Apollo Global Management LLC ( APO.N ) to "buy" and kept its top rating on Och Ziff Capital Management Group LLC ( OZM.N ) given their significant exposure to alternative asset classes. It sees opportunities in Blackstone due to its dominant real estate and fund-of-fund businesses and its relatively less reliance on IPO exit for generating performance fees. The brokerage said Apollo's attractive 6 percent yield is diversified and relatively reliable with a high component of carry from interest and dividend income. However, Goldman downgraded BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) by a notch to "neutral" on valuation. (Reporting by Satyanarayan Iyer in Bangalore; Editing by Supriya Kurane)
