 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Olympus said on Tuesday it dismissed Executive Vice President Hisashi Mori after he was found to have been involved in the deferral of losses on past securities investments. 
 Olympus also said in a statement that Standing Corporate Auditor Hideo Yamada has offered to resign, and that the firm has asked a third-party panel to expand its investigation into the deferred losses. (Reporting by  Taiga Uranaka ; Editing by  Chris Gallagher )
