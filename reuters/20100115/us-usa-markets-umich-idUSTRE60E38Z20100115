 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer sentiment was little changed in early January, as worries over income and high unemployment offset news of an improving economy, a survey released on Friday showed. 

 KEY POINTS: * The Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said its preliminary index of sentiment for January was 72.8, up from 72.5 late December and 61.2 a year ago. * The reading is the highest since September 2009, but it fell short of analysts' median expectation of a reading of 73.9, according to a recent Reuters poll. * The survey's gauge of current economic conditions was 81.0 in early January, the highest since March 2008. * It was up from 78.0 in December and the 78.5 predicted by analysts polled by Reuters. COMMENTS: JOSEPH TREVISANI, CHIEF MARKET ANALYST, FX SOLUTIONS, SADDLE RIVER, NEW JERSEY: "If you look at all the numbers that are out today they are all very close to expectations and will make little difference. The farthest from expectations was the University of Michigan confidence number which could put a slight check to some of the optimism for the economy. It should be slightly dollar positive." JAMES DEMASI, CHIEF FIXED-INCOME STRATEGIST, STIFEL NICOLAUS & CO. INC., BALTIMORE: "When you are looking at the consumer confidence surveys from the University of Michigan and Conference Board, they are still closer to the recessionary levels than expansionary levels. We should not be looking for a big tick any time soon. We should not see a big upward move until we see a corresponding down move in the unemployment rate. "The numbers are seeing today are consistent with a slow recovery and low core inflation. The Fed should not be changing its policy stance. I don't see anything today that changes that view. We should see the Fed holding its rate target in the zero to 25 basis point range for the most if not all of 2010. "The yield curve has been so steep so that's drawing money to the long-end. It's hard for the short-end to rally much from here." RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO: "A little below consensus but slightly higher than last month. It's not a bad number and it shows the stock market's rise has had a positive impact on moods. It's also evidence that at least a little of the economic recovery is starting to take hold." PETER JANKOVSKIS, CO-CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, OAKBROOK INVESTMENTS LLC, LISLE, ILLINOIS: "Very interesting, actually. Obviously the top line number missed what people were looking for, but when you look at the internals, it's kind of an interesting mix. In general you saw a gain in the view of the current economy but people becoming more pessimistic about the future and expecting more inflation for the future. So I view that as bearish." DAVID SLOAN, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "It was a bit disappointing. I would say one thing that is interesting is inflation expectations rebounded somewhat after the fall in December. We saw a rise in current conditions but a fall in expectations. The fall in expectations may be partly on a rise in inflation expectations which is not good news for the Fed."
