 CHICAGO/LONDON  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods chief Irene Rosenfeld has a long weekend ahead of her and may leave Cadbury shareholders unsatisfied at the end of it. 

 Kraft is expected to raise its $17.1 billion (10.5 billion pound) bid for Cadbury Plc by a Tuesday deadline in its final offer for the British chocolatier. Shareholders should not expect Kraft's sweetened offer to reach 820 pence per share, from a current offer valued at about 771p, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday. That is nowhere near the 850p level that some investors have signaled they would hold out for. But Rosenfeld is limited in her ability to raise the bid, particularly following a public warning by top Kraft shareholder Warren Buffett against overpaying. On the other hand, she is loath to risk coming in too low and face outright rejection from Cadbury holders or lose a deal to an eleventh-hour bid by potential rival Hershey Co. The bid will be the final move in her four-month quest for Cadbury, now viewed as a referendum on her tenure at Kraft. "At the end of the day, her seat is a lot hotter than it used to be, regardless of whether they get Cadbury bought or not," Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said. Analysts and investors believe that Kraft needs to pay between 800p and 850p a share to seal the deal. But the world's second-largest food maker may be tempted to hew closer to its current offer if it believes the chances for a rival bid from Hershey are low enough. "If the final offer is worth 800 pence, I think there is a 50 percent chance it gets done," said the manager of a New York hedge fund that owns Cadbury stock. "At that level it's the flip of the coin. Every 10 pence on top is an extra 5 percent probability that the deal gets done." The investor added that Kraft should include a cushion in its final bid in case its stock falls on concerns over plans to issue up to 370 million shares to fund a deal. "If the bid is 830 pence, I want to be sure it is still worth that much on the day I tender," he said. Investors have until February 2 to respond to the Kraft bid. QUESTION OF LEADERSHIP Even if Kraft wins Cadbury, Kraft investors will not be sold until the company shows it can manage the integration and that the investment meets financial goals, Arnold said. If Kraft fails to win Cadbury, Rosenfeld will have spent millions of dollars on an array of advisers to doggedly pursue an unwilling target. She will need to show the company can boost sales and profits without Cadbury and without a growing pizza business whose recent sale was meant to fund a bid. D.A. Davidson analyst Tim Ramey wrote a scathing note to his clients this week suggesting that Carlos Gutierrez, a former Kellogg Co CEO and U.S. Secretary of Commerce, might run Kraft instead. "Given the high-profile rebuke by No. 1 shareholder Warren Buffett last week, we wonder how the board feels about the leadership of Irene Rosenfeld," Ramey said. Rosenfeld did gain another influential investor in her corner when William Ackman disclosed his Pershing Square Capital Management bought a 2 percent stake in Kraft and said a Cadbury combination was "good for everyone." [ID:nN15235319] But he also cautioned that Kraft should minimize the use of stock in the deal. A Kraft spokeswoman said the board supports the Cadbury bid and that the company was ready to deliver top-tier performance regardless of whether a deal succeeded. "The Kraft Foods' Board unanimously voted to proceed with this bid and the Board remains unanimously behind our offer," said Perry Yeatman. But without Cadbury, No. 2 in the fast-growing confectionery market, Kraft still needs help to deliver growth. "It's right back to where it started, which is a decent collection of brands with a below-average geographical and category alignment longer-term," Janney Capital Markets analyst Jonathan Feeney said of Kraft in a research note. LISTENING TOUR Rosenfeld went to London this week to listen to Cadbury investors and gauge their sentiment on the bid. "She was encouraged to offer around 850 pence a share," said an investor that attended one of the meetings. "And she told us she was confident that she could finish the deal, although she didn't reveal her hand." The upper end of the range at 850p might be enough to win a recommendation from Cadbury and the deal would turn friendly, although chances of Kraft making an offer that high without a competing bidder are seen as slim to nonexistent. "I'd be disappointed if Kraft only offered 800 pence but if it is 800 pence versus no other bid, then 800 pence would do it for us," said a manager of another New York-based hedge fund that owns Cadbury stock. In December, Kraft offered 300 pence in cash and 0.2589 share for each Cadbury share. Last week, after agreeing to sell the pizza business for $3.7 billion to Nestle, it offered 60p more in cash in lieu of Kraft shares. Kraft made the move to assuage Cadbury shareholders who are skeptical of its growth prospects and to appease Kraft investors over plans to issue new shares. That same day, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway said it was voting against Kraft's proposed share issue, calling it a request for a blank check from shareholders. Buffett has left open the option of changing his mind. Sources familiar with the situation have said that Kraft would be able to finance a bid for whatever it thinks that Cadbury is worth, so Buffett's statement and Rosenfeld's own pledge to be disciplined are likely the main constraints. Rosenfeld has said that any bid must allow Kraft to maintain its investment grade rating and dividend and add to cash earnings per share by the second year. After Kraft makes its final offer, Hershey has until January 23 to make its own fully financed bid. Analysts doubt Hershey can mount a bid that still allows the Hershey Trust to maintain voting control over the company and protects its debt. $1.63 = 1 pound (Reporting by Brad Dorfman.
