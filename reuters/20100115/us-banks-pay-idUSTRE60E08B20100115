 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Total pay at U.S. banks and securities companies jumped nearly 18 percent to a record $145 billion in 2009, the Wall Street Journal estimated in an analysis published in its online edition on Thursday. 

 The analysis by the Journal shows that executives, traders, investment bankers, money managers and others at 38 top financial companies can expect to earn slightly more than in the record year of 2007. The Journal said it based its analysis on securities filings for the first nine months of 2009 and revenue estimates through year-end. U.S. President Barack Obama on Thursday proposed Wall Street banks pay fees to recoup losses from the financial bailout, as he slammed bankers for "massive profits and obscene bonuses."
