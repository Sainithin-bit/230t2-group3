 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose more slowly than expected in December from November on modest gains in food and energy costs, data showed on Friday, pointing to subdued inflation pressures that should permit the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low for a while. 

 Manufacturing growth in New York State accelerated more rapidly than expected in January on surging new orders and shipments, and employment also improved, the New York Federal Reserve said on Friday. KEY POINTS: CPI * The Labor Department said its Consumer Price Index rose 0.1 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in November. * Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast consumer prices rising 0.2 percent in December. * Price rises slowed as gasoline increased 0.2 percent after surging 6.4 percent in November. Food costs increased 0.2 percent last month after gaining 0.1 percent in November. * Compared to December 2008, prices rose 2.7 percent, the largest gain since 2007, the department said. EMPIRE * The New York Fed's "Empire State" general business conditions index jumped to 15.92 in January from a revised 4.50 in December. * Last month's reading was originally reported at 2.55. Economists had expected a rise to 11.28, according to a Reuters poll, which ranged from 2.60 to 18.00. * The survey of manufacturing plants in the state is one of the earliest monthly guideposts to U.S. factory conditions. COMMENTS: TIM GHRISKEY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SOLARIS ASSET MANAGEMENT, BEDFORD HILLS, NEW YORK: "CPI data was really in-line here. The top line CPI was a little bit better than expected, that includes food and energy. Better than expected meaning a little bit lower inflation. But the core number was right on expectations, still showing very little inflation at the consumer level. We do expect the CPI to tick up here in the coming months given very low energy prices a year ago, creating a significant year-over-year increase in energy but that will fade away as the year progresses. Although it could fool some observers." "The Empire state business conditions index climbed to a level that does indicate significant growth. New orders jumped as well and the index for employment turned positive, which is always a good sign for the economy and just for the population in general. So these were significant increases across the board in the NY region and expectations about economic activity remain very positive here in New York." MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, TORONTO: "I'm not surprised that we're not seeing any significant moves because the data, by and large, is in line with expectations, especially on the CPI side. We had more upside surprise in Empire manufacturing, but again, this is only a regional indicator and from that perspective shouldn't have too much of a market impact." MARK VITNER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, CHARLOTTE, NORTH CAROLINA: "It looks very good on the surface. Housing costs continue to help hold down the inflation numbers and we expect that to continue for quite some time. The cost of shelter was unchanged in December for the second month in a row and that is about 40 percent of core CPI. When you get away from housing costs and the core, inflation is still accelerating and we are seeing prices of a lot of goods that are traded in the global economy up quite a bit year over year. Some of that is reflective of what is going on in the auto sector, used car prices and new car prices are up quite a bit in the last year." SEAN SIMKO, FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SEI, OAKS, PENNSYLVANIA: "The Empire State reading is more to the positive side. This was January data so it is a good start to the new year and we had a modestly higher revision to last month." "The CPI is really in line with expectations. Overall, you were expecting to see a modest uptick in the headline number." "Treasury bonds were pretty much unchanged on the news." MICHAEL WOOLFOLK, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, BNY MELLON, NEW YORK: "It's not a surprise to see better-than-expected manufacturing data. A point of this recovery, outside of fiscal stimulus, is that the U.S. manufacturing sector is already on the rebound. We are looking very favorably toward the industrial production print later this morning. "CPI does not appear to be flashing significant inflationary pressure, and I note that we had some CPI figures out of Europe as well. The two releases show the ECB has nothing to worry about (on inflation) and the Fed has nothing to worry about for now." STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO, GREENWICH, CONNECTICUT: "The data is a bit better than expected on the broad-based number and the core is more or less in line with estimates. New York manufacturing was a few points better than expected. But people are expecting data to be strong, so stocks should continue to climb higher over the new few months. "Despite that, the markets have been up 15 out of the last 18 days, so they're somewhat overbought. A lot of the good news from the data can be offset by the earnings. It's getting harder and harder to make good news out of this data. "JPMorgan will be another focus today. That was good on earnings but below on revenue. Banks have had a nice run, so they may not have that much space left to go right now."
