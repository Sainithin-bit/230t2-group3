 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), the second largest U.S. bank, is looking to add financial advisers, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a conference in New York on Tuesday. 

 The bank, which acquired about 350 advisers through its purchase of investment bank Bear Stearns in March last year, is looking to reach a total of about 1,000 advisers, Dimon said. "Our strategy there is to go to 1,000 of the top, top, top," he said, adding, "So if you're really really good, call JPMorgan up and we'll be happy to hire you." Dimon, whose father and grandfather were brokers, made the comments in response to a question from the audience. In a broad ranging discussion at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association annual meeting, Dimon also discussed regulation. He reiterated his support for a resolution mechanism or systemic risk regulator that could deal with banks and other companies that become "too big to fail."
