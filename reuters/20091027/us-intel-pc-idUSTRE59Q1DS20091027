 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - Intel Corp ( INTC.O ), the world's largest chipmaker, expects a rise in corporate spending on personal computers in 2010, Chief Executive Paul Otellini said on Tuesday. 

 Analysts expect the launch of Microsoft's ( MSFT.O ) Windows 7 software to kickstart a spending cycle and boost computer sales to corporates, as the new operating system requires more powerful hardware. "There is a very good chance corporate spending on PCs will improve significantly in 2010," Otellini told reporters at a news conference in the Indian capital, without providing any numbers. Earlier in the month, Intel reaffirmed its outlook of flat to slightly higher PC sales growth in 2009. Four out of every five PCs sold the worldover are powered by an Intel microprocessor. While in New Delhi, Otellini signed a partnership agreement with computer hardware maker HCL Infosystems ( HCLI.BO ) and state-run telecommunications firm Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd BSNL.UL for developing a wireless broadband network in the country.
