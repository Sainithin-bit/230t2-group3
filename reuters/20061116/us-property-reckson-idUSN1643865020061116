 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reckson Associates Realty Corp. received a $4.6 billion takeover offer on Thursday from billionaire investor Carl Icahn and Macklowe Properties, topping a rival bid for the office building owner. 

 Reckson, whose holdings are concentrated in New York City and its suburbs, will review the new offer, a company spokeswoman said. The new bid comes less than a week before Reckson shareholders are scheduled to vote on a cash-and-stock offer worth roughly $4 billion from SL Green Realty Corp. The vote is set for November 22 but could be delayed by the Icahn/Macklowe bid. The SL Green deal calls for a group led by Reckson Chief Executive Officer Scott Rechler to buy most of the company's suburban holdings for $2.1 billion after the deal closes. A group of Reckson shareholders led by Arnhold and S. Bleichroeder Advisers LLC opposes the SL Green deal, saying it undervalues the suburban properties. Arnhold controls about 1 percent of Reckson. Icahn, referring to the proposed sale of Reckson's suburban holdings, told Reuters. "I think this deal is undervalued." The offer is subject to due diligence but not to financing, Icahn said. Icahn declined to disclose if he owns Reckson shares. After purchasing large stakes in companies, investors have 10 days to file with U.S. securities regulators disclosing ownership above 5 percent. SL Green said it would continue to work toward the scheduled Reckson shareholder vote on November 22. Approval requires least two-thirds of Reckson shareholders to vote in favor of the deal. "While the company has been advised of another offer, we have doubts that it is a credible bid," SL Green said in a statement. "The proposal is from a group that has not had access to any non-public information and has conditioned its offer on due diligence." On the other hand, SL Green has been through Reckson's books and said, "there are substantial incremental transaction costs that they have likely not considered.' In addition, SL Green said the rival bid does not show that the rival bidder has the committed and unconditional financing for a transaction valued in excess of $6.5 billion. Reckson has $2 billion of debt that would be assumed by any buyer. Icahn typically takes large positions in a company and agitates for change. In the real estate arena, he owns more than 86 percent of American Real Estate Partners LP, which owns rental, hotel and casino properties, according to the company's 2005 proxy statement. Macklowe, lead by Harry Macklowe, is one of the largest owners and developers of New York properties. His portfolio includes the GM building on Fifth Avenue, which commands some of the highest office rents in Manhattan. Shares of Reckson rose $2.96, or 6.6 percent, to $48.02 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. SL Green shares were off 92 cents, or 0.7 percent, at $126. Bank of America analyst Ross Nussbaum said a heated bidding war was unlikely. "SL Green has previously been a disciplined buyer," he wrote in a research note. "Putting a higher number on the table would impact management credibility, in our view." SL Green's offer was $1 to $2 per share below what Reckson could be expected to fetch, Nussbaum said. Topping the Icahn/Macklowe offer would mean diluting SL Green's funds from operations, a measure of the performance of real estate investment trusts, by as much as 20 cents per share in 2007, Nussbaum said. Prior to the Icahn/Macklowe offer, shareholder advisory services -- including Institutional Shareholder Services; Glass, Lewis & Co., and Proxy Governance Inc. -- came out in favor of the SL Green deal.
