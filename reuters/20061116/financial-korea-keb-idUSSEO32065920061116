 Nov 16 (Reuters) - A South Korean court issued warrants on
Thursday to detain two senior executives of U.S. private equity
fund Lone Star [LS.UL] for questioning in a stock trading probe,
a judge at the Seoul Central District Court said. 

  Prosecutors have been searching for any irregularities in the
way Lone Star bought Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS in
2003.  The probes are increasingly viewed as potential hindrances to
the planned $7.34 billion sale of up to a 71 percent stake of KEB
to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS. They have also made investors grow
wary of anti-foreign sentiment in South Korea.  Here is a chronology of events since Lone Star bought a 50.5
percent stake in KEB for $1.2 billion in August 2003:  - Feb. 28, 2004: KEB absorbs KEB Credit Service Co. Ltd.  - April 14, 2005: Lone Star and other foreign funds start to
be investigated in South Korea over possible tax irregularities.  - Sept. 29, 2005: The National Tax Service imposes more than
$200 million in taxes on five foreign funds, including Lone Star,
for their recent deals in South Korea.  - Feb. 24, 2006: The regulatory Financial Supervisory Service
says it will report Lone Star Advisors Korea and its affiliate
Hudson Advisors Korea to prosecutors for alleged violations of
foreign currency law.  - Feb. 27, 2006: A South Korean parliamentary panel votes to
ask prosecutors to investigate whether Lone Star's purchase of
KEB in 2003 was proper.  - April 19, 2006: Lone Star Chairman John Grayken says at a
news conference in Seoul that Steven Lee, former head of Lone
Star's South Korean operations, has been fired for
misappropriating funds and will be sued by the company. He says
the fund will donating 100 billion won to charity.  - May 11, 2006: The Seoul Central District Court rejects a
prosecutors' request to arrest Paul Yoo, president of Lone Star
Advisors Korea, saying he doesn't represent a flight risk.  - May 19, 2006: Kookmin Bank signs a final deal worth as much
as $7.34 billion to purchase KEB from Lone Star and two other
major shareholders.  - June 19, 2006: The Board of Audit and Inspection says Lone
Star's 2003 purchase of KEB contained some flaws but clears Lone
Star of any impropriety, while leaving the door open to possible
sanctions by prosecutors.  - June 20, 2006: The Financial Supervisory Commission says
its approval of the Lone Star's transaction in 2003 was proper
and disagrees with the audit board's argument that financial
difficulties at KEB had been exaggerated.  - Sept. 18, 2006: Lone Star wants Kookmin Bank to pay more to
reflect KEB's improved earnings during a protracted sale, KEB
Chief Executive Richard Wacker says in a speech to employees.  - Nov. 3, 2006: The Seoul Central District Court rejects
prosecutors' request to detain Ellis Short, Lone Star's vice
chairman and Michael Thomson, its general counsel. It also
rebuffs prosecutors' plan to arrest Paul Yoo again.  - Nov. 6, 2006: Prosecutors arrest Lee Kang-won, who was
KEB's chief executive at the time of the sale to Lone Star, for
breach of trust and other charges.  - Nov. 8, 2006: The Seoul Central District Court again rejects
a prosecutors' request to detain Short and Thomson and to arrest
Yoo.  - Nov. 16, 2006: The Seoul Central District Court approves
prosecutors' requests to detain Short and Thomson, but again
rejects the request to arrest Yoo.
