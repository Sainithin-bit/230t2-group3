 PARIS  (Reuters) - Vivendi ( VIV.PA ) beat analysts' forecasts with a 20.9 percent rise in core third-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by higher margins from video game "World of Warcraft", pay television in France and Maroc Telecom. 

 But share reaction was muted after the French group, which last week confirmed a failed friendly takeover approach by U.S. private equity firm KKR, kept its profit goal for the year. By 0900 GMT, the stock was up 0.4 percent at 29.97 euros, outperforming a 0.4 percent dip in the European media sector .SXMP and a 0.2 percent rise in the European telecoms sector  .SXKP. The group said it still expects 2006 net adjusted profit of 2.6 billion euros ($3.3 billion), or 16 percent growth, with a dividend distribution rate of a minimum of 50 percent of net profit. Vivendi, which controls France's number two mobile operator SFR, reported adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) of 1.3 billion euros. This compared with average expectations of 1.189 billion euros according to a Reuters poll of 11 analysts and a comparative figure for last year of 1.075 billion. Net adjusted profit reached 731 million euros, up 28.2 percent, also above average expectations of 656 million euros. CANAL, MAROC TELECOM BEAT EXPECTATIONS "These are rather reassuring results, topping expectations in pay-TV and Maroc Telecom but they did not raise the profit outlook," one sector analyst said. Core profit at pay-TV unit Canal Plus was up 51 million euros at 148 million, beating expectations for 111 million euros. Canal Plus's core profit was lifted by growth in pay-TV operations in France, which benefited from strong portfolio additions and increased revenue per subscriber and the favorable impact of the calendar timing of French Ligue 1 soccer. Core profit at Maroc Telecom jumped 21.6 percent in the quarter to 281 million euros, also topping expectations for 262 million, helped by revenue growth and cost control. Core profit at Vivendi Games rose 118.2 percent to 24 million euros, compared with forecasts for 22 million, driven by revenue growth and an increased contribution from the higher margin of the "World of Warcraft" business. The SFR mobilephone unit achieved a 2 percent rise in core profit to 706 million euros, almost in line with analysts' forecasts for 702 million euros. Cost controls helped offset the rising cost of the GSM license, which was renewed in April with a new tax of 1 percent of revenues, the statement said. On Tuesday, Britain's Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ) said it was happy with its 44-percent stake in SFR and chances of its sale to Vivendi were "highly unlikely". Vivendi also owns the world's largest record company Universal Music Group, which posted an 11.3-percent rise in core profit at 138 million euros, thanks to improving margins and compensation from the settlement of litigation with Napster. Analysts had forecast 141 million euros. Since the start of the year, Vivendi shares have gained 11 percent, outperforming the DJ Stoxx media sector .SXMP which rose 7 percent and but underperforming the 14-percent gain in the telecoms index .SXKP.
