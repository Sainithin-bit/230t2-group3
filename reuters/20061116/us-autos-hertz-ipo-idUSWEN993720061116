 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Car rental company Hertz Global Holdings Inc. ( HTZ.N ) raised $1.32 billion -- below expectations -- with one of the largest initial public offerings of the year, less than 12 months after private equity firms bought the company, an underwriter said on Wednesday. 

 The offering of more than 88 million shares, which represents about a 27.5 percent stake in the company, sold for $15 per share compared with a $16-to-$18 forecast. The offering price gives the company an initial market value of about $4.8 billion. Park Ridge, New Jersey-based Hertz, which also has one of the largest equipment rental businesses in the United States, plans to use net proceeds from the offering to repay debt and for general corporate purposes, according to a prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In June, the company used a $1 billion loan and cash on hand to pay a $999.2 million dividend to stockholders. The offering was underwritten by Goldman, Sachs & Co., Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. and JPMorgan. Deutsche Bank Securities was dropped as an underwriter after an e-mail written by a Deutsche employee was forwarded to about 175 institutional accounts, according to a filing with the SEC. ML Global Private Equity Fund LP, an affiliate of Merrill Lynch MER.N, and buyout firms Carlyle Group CYL.UL and Clayton Dubilier & Rice bought Hertz from Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) last December for $5.6 billion, or $15 billion including debt.
