 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Reader's Digest Association Inc. RDA.N, publisher of one of the most widely read magazines in the world, said on Thursday it agreed to a $1.6 billion takeover offer from an investor group, sending its shares up as much as 8 percent. 

 Buyout firm Ripplewood Holdings leads the investor group, which will pay $17 per share, a premium of nearly 10 percent to Reader's Digest's closing price on Wednesday. With the deal, Ripplewood adds to its investments in media, where buyout firms see potential to profit from the business upheaval caused by a migration of audiences to the Internet and other outlets. In the publishing industry alone, Tribune Co. TRB.N is weighing at least three private equity bids, or a possible sale of newspapers on an individual basis. Private investors have also acquired newspapers, including the Philadelphia Inquirer, from corporate owners. Reader's Digest, best known for its namesake magazine and its newer Every Day with Rachael Ray, has faced the same types of problems that are hurting many peers in publishing, from long-standing declines in circulation to heavy competition for advertising dollars from new media. Last month, the company posted a quarterly loss of $26.7 million. Including assumed debt, the investor group's purchase is worth $2.4 billion and is expected to close in early 2007. MAKEOVER LITTLE HELP Published in 21 languages, Reader's Digest magazine has a monthly circulation of about 18 million and an estimated 80 million readers worldwide. But it has suffered from the perception that its appeal is limited to an older demographic than the 18-to-49-year-olds whom advertisers covet. The company itself has tried in recent years to win over investors with a redesign of its flagship magazine, the introduction of new publications, and cost cutting that included layoffs and the sale of its headquarters. "The basic strategy is to improve operating efficiencies, optimize cost structure and supply chain, and drive the revenue growth," Robert Berner III, managing director at Ripplewood, said in an interview. "This company has great brands, great assets, but it's a little bit misunderstood," he said, adding that Reader's Digest magazine is only a small portion of the company's North American revenues. Indeed, Reader's Digest, founded by DeWitt and Lila Wallace out of their Greenwich Village apartment in 1922, now publishes 20 other magazines, including cooking magazine Taste of Home. It also publishes books and markets collections of music. Ripplewood already has investments in Direct Holdings Worldwide and WRC Media, which publishes educational materials such as World Almanac. The Ripplewood-led investor group also includes J. Rothschild Group, GoldenTree Asset Management, GSO Capital Partners, Merrill Lynch Capital Corp. and Magnetar Capital. JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch advised Ripplewood. Goldman Sachs provided a fairness opinion to Reader's Digest. In New York Stock Exchange trade, Reader's Digest shares closed $1.19 higher at $16.70 after hitting a 14-month high of $16.80. (Additional reporting by  Michele Gershberg )
