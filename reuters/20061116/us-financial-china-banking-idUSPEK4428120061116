 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Revised rules governing foreign lenders mark a milestone as China opens its financial sector, but they are unlikely to lead to dramatic inroads by overseas banks. 

 China's cabinet and banking regulator said on Thursday that the rules showed Beijing was honoring commitments made when it joined the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 and would create an environment in which foreign lenders could thrive. "We believe that with China's ongoing development and improved financial supervision, foreign banks will have broader scope in which to develop," Song Dahan, vice-minister of the Legislative Affairs Office of the State Council, told a news conference. From December 11, the end of a five-year transitional period for China to implement its WTO promises, foreign banks will have to choose whether to incorporate as local entities. If they do so, by stumping up 1 billion yuan ($127 million) in capital, they will gain full access to China's retail banking market, including some $2 trillion in household deposits, and can issue bank cards. If they do not, they will not be allowed to take deposits of less than 1 million yuan and may not engage in bank card business. They will also have to set aside twice as much capital, 200 million yuan per branch, as locally registered lenders. Standard Chartered ( STAN.L ) ( 2888.HK ) was first out of the starting gate, announcing on Thursday that it had applied to establish a locally incorporated subsidiary. HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) has said it will do the same. But only a handful of other global lenders is likely to take on the huge challenge of competing with domestic banks head on. Even if U.S. financial giant Citigroup ( C.N ) secures operational control of Guangdong Development Bank, which has 500 branches, its venture would be dwarfed by China's big state banks, which have tens of thousands of outlets each. Many smaller Western banks are likely to opt instead to serve customers mainly from home or to take minority stakes in local lenders to tap their well-established distribution networks. "I don't think this is opening the floodgates by any means," said Charlene Chu, a bank analyst for Fitch Ratings in Beijing. Foreign banks had $105 billion worth of assets in China at the end of September, but that was just 1.9 percent of the total. "I think that when we look from a branch network perspective, domestic banks are vastly ahead of foreign banks and will continue to be so," Chu said. NO DISCRIMINATION Draft rules that circulated in August raised fears among some Western bankers that higher capital requirements might make it more difficult to do business in China. But the Chinese officials said the rules were the same for Chinese banks and made supervisory sense. Beijing's rulebook draws heavily on the experience of other regulators -- a point made by HSBC, which said it had complied with local incorporation requirements in a number of countries. Having consulted with foreign banks, officials said Beijing would allow foreign lenders that incorporate to keep enjoying lower taxes than their Chinese peers until foreign and domestic tax rates are harmonized, a step expected in 2007 or 2008. The revisions also give foreign lenders planning to set up locally a grace period so they can meet prescribed asset/liability ratios. Still, Western bankers worry that Beijing will apply the rules in a way that slows the expansion of foreign lenders, at least until China has finally cleansed the big domestic banks of non-performing loans so they are strong enough to compete. "The NPL problem is not yet solved. So, as long as they have this problem, they will be afraid that foreign banks will run over Chinese lenders," one Western banker in Beijing said. Chinese officials said they would not drag their feet. The cabinet statement said the bank regulator would rule on an incorporation application within 6 months. "Approvals are also one of those things where they could be quite liberal to begin with," said Fitch's Chu. "But if they were to start seeing problems down the road, that would be one area that they could fairly easily tighten up on." (Additional reporting by  Eadie Chen )
