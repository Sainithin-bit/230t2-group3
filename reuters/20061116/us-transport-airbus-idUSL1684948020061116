 PARIS  (Reuters) - Aerospace group EADS denied plans to let Gulf investors buy part of Airbus to fill a vacuum left when its British partner walked away from a costly new aircraft, but doubts remained over how the plane will be funded. 

 Daily Les Echos said on Thursday EADS ( EAD.PA ) was in advanced talks with Dubai International Capital (DIC) and Qatar Investment Authority over a direct stake in Airbus, which belongs entirely to EADS after BAE Systems BA.L sold back its 20 percent stake. Citing a source close to the matter, the newspaper said EADS was also looking at possible investors from China, India and Russia -- all major markets for Airbus planes -- as well as the United States, home to its rival Boeing ( BA.N ). "I can deny that. We are not looking for a partner to invest in Airbus," an EADS spokesman in Germany said. Afternoon daily Le Monde reported EADS was nonetheless considering scenarios that included investments by the Gulf funds in EADS or -- despite denials -- in Airbus itself. Such a sale would mark the first time EADS, whose recently battered shares have been the target of Russian buying, has opened up the nucleus of the company to direct investment from countries outside its core European manufacturing base. Franco-German EADS has been rocked by delays to its A380 superjumbo and the decision by Britain's BAE to abandon its stake in Airbus, leaving EADS to find at least $10 billion needed to develop its next jet, the A350. EADS shares rose last week when DIC said a fund it manages was considering taking stakes in a number of European firms including EADS. The shares were flat at 22.37 euros at mid-session on Thursday. FUNDING DILEMMA The government of Dubai, commercial hub of the world's top oil-exporting region, owns DIC and Emirates airline, the biggest buyer of the delayed A380. BAE shareholders approved the sale of the company's stake to EADS last month, a day after the company said fresh delays to the A380 would badly hit earnings. The A380 is running two years behind schedule due to wiring installation problems. The delays have left EADS with a 6 billion euro cash shortfall as it pays penalties to airlines and chokes its assembly lines with undelivered aircraft. The damage wrought by the A380 crisis worsened Europe's dilemma over funding for the A350, whose costs have doubled after an earlier design failed to attract enough airlines. Europe faces pressure from the United States in a trade dispute over development loans provided by European governments. Washington regards these as illegal subsidies, while Airbus maintains Boeing is wrongly pampered by the U.S. defense budget. Airbus is anxious to cut its costs by reducing the number of suppliers it deals with and new investment would also ease the task of building the A350 without inflaming the trade row. At the same time, France and Germany are worried about Russia's recent decision to buy 5 percent of EADS stock, meaning the margin for error is slim in any tinkering with EADS capital. EADS has said it will decide by the end of this month whether to go ahead with the A350, once it has put the finishing touches on company-wide restructuring plans. Daily Le Figaro said Airbus might ask for 25 percent of the A350 costs in reimbursable European government loans, or launch aid, rather than the previous ceiling of 33 percent. Following a previously set timetable, U.S. lawyers on Wednesday filed their arguments at the World Trade Organization against the EU over alleged illegal subsidies to Airbus. Hearings are due to be held next March, with a preliminary ruling to be delivered by the WTO panel of judges in September. No dates have yet been set for the EU's counter-suit. Both sides have expressed willingness to talk. (Additional reporting by  Dayan Candappa , Richard Waddington, Jens Hack)
