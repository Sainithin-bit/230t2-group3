 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A drop in energy prices helped pull U.S. consumer prices down by a more-than-expected 0.5 percent in October, but prices were up 0.1 percent after stripping out volatile food and energy, the government reported on Thursday. 

 Economists in a Reuters survey were expecting overall prices to fall by 0.3 percent after a 0.5 percent decline in September. So-called core prices in the Labor Department report were expected to rise by a greater 0.2 percent after advancing by the same amount a month earlier. Energy prices were down 7 percent last month. For the year to date they were down a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.5 percent after surging 17.1 percent for all of 2005, the Department said. Food and beverage prices were up 0.3 percent in October after gaining 0.4 percent in September. Prices for education and medical care continued to rise last month, while housing prices remained unchanged. October's reading may offer some comfort to Federal Reserve policy-makers who are expected to leave interest rates unchanged when they meet next month.
