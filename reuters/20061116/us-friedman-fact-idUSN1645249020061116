 (Reuters) - Milton Friedman, a towering figure in the economics profession, died on Thursday at age 94. Here are some key facts about the award-winning economist: 

 -- Born July 31, 1912, in New York. Friedman won a Nobel Prize for economics in 1976. He was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award, in 1988. That year he also won the National Medal of Science. -- Friedman, who taught at the University of Chicago from 1946 to 1976, is considered the leader of the so-called Chicago School of economics, which is know for free-market views that stress the importance of money as a determinant of business cycles and inflation. His view that increasing the supply of money raises inflation but not economic growth over the long term is now accepted doctrine in the profession. "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon," Friedman said. -- Friedman was a prolific author on economic matters. Some of his best known works include "Capitalism and Freedom," 1962, "Free to Choose," 1980 -- both of which he wrote with his wife Rose Friedman -- and "A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960," 1963, co-authored with Anna Schwartz. -- Friedman was active in Republican policy circles. He served as an informal adviser to presidential candidates Barry Goldwater in 1964, Richard Nixon in 1968 and Ronald Reagan in 1980. After Reagan won the election, Friedman served as a member of his Economic Policy Advisory Board. -- Friedman earned his bachelors degree from Rutgers University in 1932, a masters from the University of Chicago in 1933 and a doctorate from Columbia University in 1946.
