 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Media conglomerate Time Warner Inc. ( TWX.N ) on Wednesday appointed a television industry veteran from NBC Universal to lead its AOL Internet division seeking to turn around its business amid a major restructuring. 

 NBC Universal Television Group President Randy Falco replaces CEO Jonathan Miller, who oversaw a painful period in the once-dominant online service in which millions of its dial-up subscribers departed. Miller will leave the company. The management switch follows the company's announcement of a major overhaul in August to turn AOL into an ad-supported Internet service instead of a subscription-based business. The plan included about 5,000 job cuts. "AOL is showing early success in transitioning to an advertising-focused business model, and Randy is a first-rate choice to ensure AOL realizes its promise," Time Warner Chief Executive Dick Parsons said in a statement. In Falco, AOL brings on an experienced television executive as the division bolsters its online video strategy. This year the company began offering free vintage television shows on line, as well as offering some movies for download. At NBC Universal, Falco's responsibilities included the group's network and cable sales, affiliate relations, network and studio operations, and worldwide television distribution. The management changes come after Time Warner earlier in November reported that profit grew at its cable and AOL Internet divisions, boosted by strong online advertising sales and new cable subscribers.
