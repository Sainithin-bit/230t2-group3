 (Reuters) - Following are the main points in the regulations, announced by the government on Thursday, that will govern the operations of foreign banks in China from December 11. 

 SCOPE OF BUSINESS -- Unlike a locally registered bank, a non-incorporated foreign bank branch may not engage in bank card business or take deposits from Chinese residents smaller than 1 million yuan. -- All banks may grant loans; handle acceptances; provide letters of credit; and buy and sell bonds as well as foreign-currency securities other than stocks. -- All banks may act as agents for insurance companies; engage in interbank lending; provide safe deposit boxes; and offer credit information and consultancy services. CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS -- A foreign-funded or Chinese-foreign joint venture bank registering locally must have paid-in capital of 1 billion yuan plus 100 million yuan in operating capital per branch. -- Capital allocated to the branches may not exceed 60 percent of the parent bank's aggregate capital. -- A branch of an overseas bank that does not incorporate locally must have non-callable capital of 200 million yuan, 30 percent of which must be in the form of interest-bearing assets. -- Such a branch's operating capital plus reserves must be at least 8 percent of its risk assets, a ratio that regulators may increase if they identify high risk assets and weak risk management. -- To ensure liquidity, a foreign bank branch's ratio of current assets to current liabilities must be at least 25 percent. OTHER REQUIREMENTS -- Foreign banks must have $10 billion in assets if they register locally and $20 billion if they do not. -- They must have been profitable for two consecutive years and have been open for business in China for at least three years prior to applying for a license. -- They must meet capital adequacy requirements and have effective anti-money laundering systems. -- Bank supervisors in their home country must have approved their China application and have in place a well established cooperation mechanism with China's bank supervisors. APPROVAL TIMETABLE -- China's bank regulator must decide on a foreign bank's application within six months, extendable for another three months. -- Upon approval, the foreign bank has six months to prepare to set up its operations, extendable to nine months; if it fails to do so in time, the approval lapses. -- If it passes the preparation inspection, the foreign bank then applies to commence business; the regulator must rule within two months of receiving the application. OTHER PROVISIONS -- Senior executives of an incorporated foreign bank shall not hold concurrent positions at bank's branch engaging in wholesale foreign currency business, and vice versa. -- Transactions between the incorporated foreign bank and its wholesale forex branch "shall be based on market terms and shall not be more favorable than the terms of the transactions between either entity and its non-related parties".
