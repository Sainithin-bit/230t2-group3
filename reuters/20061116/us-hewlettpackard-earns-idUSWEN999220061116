 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) reported on Thursday a quadrupling of net profit as the computing and printing company's sales and margins improved across its key divisions. 

 The results were helped by the absence of last year's charge of more than $1 billion for job cuts, and profit before items handily topped analysts' forecasts. HP shares rose only slightly as analysts said they appeared richly valued after rising more than 40 percent this year. HP has in recent months endured the embarrassing disclosure of its investigation into board leaks to the media, which spurred the collection of phone records of directors, a few HP workers and reporters. The scandal ultimately claimed HP Chairman Patricia Dunn, who has since resigned as a director. But the business itself remains in good shape. Operating profit margins in all its major businesses -- PCs, printers, servers and storage, services and software -- all widened from a year ago as HP continued to cut costs and boost sales. "What a difference a year makes. Last year, HP was a dog and Dell was a darling," said Shawn Campbell, principal at Campbell Asset Management, which owns HP shares. "It's a solid quarter across all the business segments." Last quarter, HP recaptured the worldwide lead in PC shipments from longtime rival Dell Inc. DELL.O for the first time since the end of 2003. Dell has been struggling with weak results and the biggest electronics recall in U.S. history. "The surprise was that their PC business and their imaging business did better than expected," said American Technology Research analyst Shaw Wu. Net income for its fiscal fourth quarter to October 31 rose to $1.7 billion, or 60 cents per share, from $416 million, or 14 cents per share. Revenue climbed 7 percent to $24.6 billion. Excluding items, HP said it had a profit of 68 cents per share. Analysts had expected the Palo Alto, California-based company to earn 64 cents per share before items, on average, on revenue of $24.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. GUIDANCE GOOD For the current quarter, HP expects earnings per share, including stock-based compensation, of 60 cents to 62 cents before items, including 5 cents for amortization of purchased intangible assets. HP expects revenue this quarter of $24.1 billion to $24.3 billion. Analysts had expected HP, led by Chief Executive Mark Hurd, to earn 60 cents per share, on average, on revenue of $23.9 billion in its first fiscal quarter of 2007. "The guidance looks pretty good," Wu said. "I think though their guidance is pretty conservative, which is typical Mark Hurd fashion." HP said fourth-quarter revenue in its lucrative imaging and printing group rose 7 percent to $7.3 billion, and operating profit was 14.8 percent of revenue, up from 13.2 percent a year earlier. HP is the world's biggest maker of computer printers. In enterprise storage and servers, a business that has rebounded recently, revenue climbed 4 percent to $4.7 billion and operating margin widened to 10.7 percent from 9 percent. Revenue in HP's software unit climbed 14 percent to $349 million as its operating margin was 17.2 percent. Revenue in its computer services businesses rose 5 percent to $4.1 billion, and operating margin was 12.4 percent. Hurd said in a conference call with reporters that HP had completed nearly all the 15,300 job cuts announced in July. Due to the board leak scandal, HP has a number of vacancies on its board, and Hurd said it was working to fill them. "We're working on it," Hurd said on the call. "Hopefully you'll see us take action in an appropriate time frame." HP shares rose to $40.35 in extended trading after closing up 0.9 percent at $40.13 in regular-session trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of HP have surged 40 percent this year, compared with a 14 percent decline in those of Dell. The Merrill Lynch Technology 100 Index .MLO, of which both companies are constituents, has advanced 11 percent in the same time period.
