 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on Thursday named a former AT&T Inc. ( T.N ) executive as its new controller and chief accounting officer, following a series of accounting missteps and earnings restatements this year. 

 Nick Cyprus will hold both the titles, which had previously been separate at GM. The world's largest automaker appointed Cyprus controller and chief accounting officer, effective December 1. Cyprus will replace former Chief Accounting Officer Peter Bible, who resigned in June, and Controller Paul Schmidt, who will retire February 1. Cyprus most recently was senior vice president, controller and chief accounting officer at The Interpublic Group of Companies Inc., where he led the company's compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley legislation, GM said. Cyprus was previously controller and chief accounting officer at AT&T Inc. The automaker in May said it would restructure its finance division and hired financial advisory firm AlixPartners to help with a "broad range of accounting, financial reporting and related matters." The move came after GM made a series of accounting errors, including revisions to its quarterly results and restatements dating back several years. The automaker is also under investigation by federal regulators for its transactions in precious metals and how it books supplier credits.
