 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Former Enron Corp. chief executive Jeff 
Skilling was ordered to begin serving a 24-year sentence on 
December 12 in a federal prison in Minnesota, according to 
court documents. 

  Skilling, 52, was sentenced in October to 24 years and four 
months in prison for leading a financial fraud that destroyed 
the Houston-based energy company, according to a court order 
issued on Wednesday. Skilling's sentence is the longest handed 
out so far to former Enron executives.  Skilling is due to serve his sentence at a prison near 
Waseca, Minnesota, near Minneapolis, according to the court 
order.  In May, Skilling was found guilty on 19 of 28 charges of 
defrauding investors by using off-the-books deals to hide debt 
and inflate profits. Skilling has said he would appeal.
