 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) reported lower third-quarter earnings on Thursday as the company struggled to win back customers who had moved to its rivals' stores. 

 The owner of The Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic chains said earnings were $189 million, or 23 cents per share, compared with $212 million, or 24 cents per share, for the same period last year. Analysts surveyed by Reuters Estimates had expected the company to report a profit of 22 per share, on average.
