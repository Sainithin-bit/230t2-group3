 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Shares of Volkswagen extended gains on Thursday on talk that sportscar maker Porsche could mount a full takeover bid for Europe's biggest carmaker, in which it is already the biggest shareholder. 

 VW shares rose 4 percent at one point, and by 1455 GMT were trading 3.3 percent higher at 87.03 euros, helped in part by a Goldman Sachs upgrade to "buy" from "neutral". Goldman Sachs also raised its price target significantly to 110 euros from 77 euros. The DJ Stoxx European car sector index gained 1.5 percent at the same time. Volkswagen stock hit an eight-year high on Wednesday when Porsche announced it had raised its stake to 27.4 percent, aimed to raise its holding as high as 29.9 percent and planned to create authorized capital worth around 8 billion euros ($10.2 billion) as a possible acquisition currency. Porsche has said its stake aims to secure close ties with a strategic partner in case a law limiting voting rights in VW is overturned. It has ruled out so far surpassing the 30 percent threshold that would make it launch a full bid. But the market is abuzz with talk that Porsche, owned by the family of VW Chairman Ferdinand Piech, could at some stage decide to take full control of Wolfsburg-based VW. Porsche's decision to increase its equity capital by half was the most interesting part of Porsche's earnings announcement on Wednesday, Sanford Bernstein analyst Stephen Cheetham wrote in a note to clients. "We believe this may presage a full bid by the company for Volkswagen, fulfilling Ferdinand Piech's evident wish to control the company ahead of a likely expiry of the Volkswagen law limiting any one shareholder to 20 percent of voting rights," he wrote. Credit Suisse acknowledged the possibility of a bid but said it continued to believe Porsche has no interest in crossing the 30 percent threshold. "In our view, this is more posturing rather than preparation for a full bid and we still believe a holding below 30 percent satisfies Porsche's medium term requirements," it said. MOVING OVER? Meanwhile, shares of DaimlerChrysler rose more than 3 percent on Thursday amid market talk that Wolfgang Bernhard, the restructuring expert reported to be quitting Volkswagen, could return to DaimlerChrysler, dealers said. "There are rumors in the market that Bernhard is moving to Daimler," one dealer said. The stock was up 2.3 percent at 1456 GMT. Weekly Manager-Magazin reported that Volkswagen was already looking for a successor to Bernhard. DaimlerChrysler declined to comment. Last week, the VW supervisory board's most influential members effectively unseated CEO Bernd Pischetsrieder in a coup that analysts widely interpreted as a power grab by Ferdinand Piech, the carmaker's controversial chairman and former CEO. Piech enthroned his closest ally, Audi boss Martin Winterkorn, as new CEO in a move supported by three union representatives and the chief executive of Porsche, which is partly owned by Piech. Volkswagen's supervisory board is scheduled to meet on Friday amid expectations that it will bless Winterkorn as new group chief executive, a step that analysts say would likely prompt Bernhard's departure. Retaining Bernhard, a 46-year-old restructuring whiz brought to VW by Pischetsrieder, would lend considerable credibility to the group's commitment to increase pretax profit to 5.1 billion euros ($6.52 billion) by 2008. If he goes, analysts expect VW stock to take a beating.
