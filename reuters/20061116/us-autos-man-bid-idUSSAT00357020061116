 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - German truckmaker MAN AG ( MANG.DE ) officially launched its 10.3 billion euro ($13.2 billion) cash-and-share takeover offer for Swedish rival Scania ( SCVb.ST ) on Thursday, going hostile after failing to clinch a friendly deal. 

 MAN said Scania shareholders had from November 20 until December 11 to tender their shares in Scania in a deal that would create the European truck market leader. Scania and its second-biggest shareholder, Investor AB ( INVEb.ST ), have so far rejected the offer. The German truckmaker, which confirmed the deal was conditional upon receiving a 90 percent acceptance rate, added it reserved the right to extend the acceptance period and to defer the date for settlement. Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), which is the biggest shareholder in both MAN and Scania, had given them until Friday to strike an amicable deal and has left open its options for later.
