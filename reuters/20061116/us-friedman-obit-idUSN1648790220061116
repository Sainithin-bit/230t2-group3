 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Milton Friedman became a towering figure in modern-day economics, a Nobel Prize winner whose view that controlling the money supply was the key to economic health became a central plank of economic theory. 

 Friedman, who died on Thursday of heart failure at a hospital in the San Francisco area at age 94, was regarded as one of the most influential conservative thinkers that America and the famed Chicago school of economics ever produced. "Before Milton, economists were not taken seriously by public policy-makers," St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole told reporters at a Cato Institute conference in Washington, where participants stood silently for a moment in memory. Poole cited the influence Friedman's research had on policy issues as varied as U.S. military conscription, school vouchers and tax policy, in addition to his more popular work on the link between the money supply and inflation. "He was an extraordinarily important figure in the profession," Poole said. Economic historian Anna Schwartz, who was at the Cato conference when Friedman's death became public, praised her long-time collaborator as a teacher who "did so much to make monetary policy a central issue for policy makers." Friedman's line of thought was not always popular theory, emerging as it did when  public spending was still credited with helping end the worldwide depression of the 1930s. The Brooklyn-born Friedman instead preached free enterprise in the face of government regulation -- a theory championed politically by the late U.S. President Ronald Reagan and by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- and advocated a monetary policy calling for steady growth in money supplies. He once summed his "monetarism" this way: "Our attitude has been that the important thing about monetary policy is what happens to the quantity of money and not what happens to interest rates; that changes in the quantity of money have played an important role in producing inflation, depressions and recessions. "The appropriate policy for a country to adopt is a steady rate of increase in the quantity of money," he said. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO DAYS Friedman was a student and long-time professor at the University of Chicago as part of the school's influential circle of economists. He was doing post-graduate work at the university in 1933 when Franklin Roosevelt brought the philosophy of British economist John Maynard Keynes into the White House. The ensuing emphasis on using government as a tax-spend tool to regulate and engineer the economy held sway in much of the world for decades, until it began falling from favor toward the end of the 1960s under a critique spearheaded by Friedman. "For close to three decades he was a voice in the wilderness, trying to explain to the rest of the profession that monetary economics was alive, relevant and important," University of Chicago colleague Arnold Harberger once said. Friedman said keeping the economy on an even keel was not possible if it was operated like a thermostat -- turning spending off and on -- because of the lags between policy changes and their ultimate impact. Instead, a steady and predictable monetary policy was the surest guarantee against excessive fluctuations in prices and the level of economic activity, Friedman believed. In 1976, Friedman's teaching and nearly two-dozen books were recognized with the Nobel Prize for economic science. However, he also came under fire in the 1970s for advising Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. As a columnist and contributing editor for Newsweek magazine and through frequent television appearances, Friedman became one of the country's most visible economists. In a retrospective on his work, Friedman traced his roots and those of the Chicago school of thought that he led back to Adam Smith. He moved his base of operations to California in 1977, when he became a senior research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. "The key to the influence of the University of Chicago on economics throughout the world," Friedman said, "is that ever since it was founded in 1892, the Economics Department of the University of Chicago has regarded economics as a serious subject that has something to do with the real world. "Anybody who sets out to understand the world as it is ... is inevitably driven to recognize the defects of governmental intervention into markets."
