 SEOUL  (Reuters) - A South Korean court issued warrants to detain two senior executives of U.S. private equity fund Lone Star LS.UL, the latest twist in a nine-month probe that is likely to delay the country's second-biggest takeover. 

 The court ruling came a day after the Supreme Prosecutors' Office submitted its third request in two weeks to detain Ellis Short, vice chairman of Lone Star, and Michael Thomson, its general counsel. Prosecutors have been looking into allegations, raised by politicians, that financial data on Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) 004940.KS had been understated to help Lone Star buy the bank in 2003 at a bargain price of $1.2 billion. They also suspect KEB top management of artificially pushing down the share price of a credit card affiliate it bought out in early 2004 and damaging shareholders. The legal wrangling has been a key factor in delaying Lone Star's plan to sell the country's No. 5 lender to top bank Kookmin Bank 060000.KS for $7.3 billion. It also has made investors grow wary of anti-foreign sentiment in South Korea. Prosecutors want to see whether Lone Star was involved, while both KEB and Lone Star have denied wrongdoing. "The KEB situation represents the final phase of the bank reorganizations that took place during the (1997-98) financial crisis," said Ku Yong-uk, an analyst at Daewoo Securities. "Now that the risk is over, people are wondering why companies like KEB were sold and bought at such a low price." Lone Star's planned sale of KEB to Kookmin would rank as the country's second-largest takeover, after No. 2 Shinhan Financial Group's ( 055550.KS ) agreed purchase of LG Card Co. 032710.KS for $7.5 billion. Prosecutors have been unable to find evidence of wrongdoing in the 2003 sale to convict those involved, while the government may not want to face the deal's collapse. THIRD GO-ROUND The Seoul Central District Court had turned down earlier detention requests on grounds the Lone Star executives were not likely to flee or destroy evidence. But the prosecutors' office this time pushed harder to detain U.S.-based Short and Thomson after they refused to come to South Korea for questioning. "Last time, they didn't mention any extradition plans," judge Lee Hyo-jae said by telephone, asked why the court issued the warrants this time. Washington and Seoul have an extradition treaty but it tends to take several months to receive U.S. court approval to exercise warrants against U.S. citizens. Lone Star took issue with the prosecutors. "We have offered repeatedly to come to Korea for questioning, as long as we are allowed to leave. We remain willing to cooperate fully with the Prosecutors' investigation if they abide by international standards of justice," Short said in a statement. Short, 46-year-old graduate of the University of Missouri, worked for GE Capital, General Electric's ( GE.N ) financial arm, between 1983 and 1993. The right-hand man to Lone Star Chairman John Grayken handled the fund's acquisition of Tokyo Star Bank Ltd. 8384.T for 40 billion yen in 2001. Short was last in Seoul in October to negotiate with Kookmin to keep the KEB deal on track. Thomson visited the prosecutors' office for questioning in October when prosecutors guaranteed his return home, according to Lone Star. Prosecutors said the United States would review their request, said prosecutors' spokesman Kang Chan-woo. "We had sent requests to them to come to receive questioning six times," prosecutor Kang added. "But they told us to come and conduct questioning in the United States." The maximum penalties for the charges faced by the two are a 10-year prison term or a 20 million won ($21,250) fine, a court source said. The court also rejected a fourth request to arrest Paul Yoo, the head of a South Korean unit of Lone Star, on allegations of improper stock trading and tax evasion. Kookmin shares ended down 1.99 percent to 73,800 won while KEB shares lost 0.41 percent. (Additional reporting by Marie-France Han)
