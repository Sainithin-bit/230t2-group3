 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Renault SA-Nissan Motor Co. ( RENA.PA ) ( 7201.T ) Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn on Thursday said he is open to expanding the current alliance to include an American automaker, but will wait for the timing to be right for Nissan. 

 "We still think it's a good idea," Ghosn said, referring to a partnership with a U.S. automaker. "But we are not talking to anybody right now. We are not searching for opportunities because we don't think the timing is right for us," he told reporters after a speech to the Detroit Economic Club. After nearly three months of talks, General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Nissan and Renault announced in October that they would end their discussions on a possible partnership. GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said the automaker would benefit from the proposed alliance far less than Nissan and Renault. GM wanted to be compensated for the perceived imbalance, but Renault-Nissan said that demand contradicted the spirit of an alliance. On Thursday, Ghosn said he only considered the proposal in response to an initiative taken by Kirk Kerkorian, GM's largest individual shareholder. "We were responding to an initiative, not taking an initiative," he said. Ghosn said he wants to grow revenue and income at Nissan by focusing on products before he seeks another alliance. "The next time, we will not respond until we think the time is right for us," Ghosn said. "And I don't see that happening in the near future."
