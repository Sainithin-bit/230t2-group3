 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp. ( SBUX.O ), the world's largest coffee shop chain, posted a lower quarterly profit on Thursday and said revenue grew slightly less than Wall Street had expected. 

 Shares of Starbucks fell nearly 6 percent in after-hours trading. One investor said that Starbucks benefited from a lower tax rate. "The quality wasn't quite as good as I believe the Street would have liked to see," said Don Gher, chief investment officer for Bellevue, Washington-based Coldstream Capital Management, who owns Starbucks shares. Net income for the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 1 was $117.3 million, or 15 cents per share, compared with $123.7 million, or 16 cents per share, a year ago. Starbucks said that results in the latest period included the impact of expensing stock compensation, which reduced earnings by 2 cents per share, and a requirement which addresses asset retirement obligations, which cut another 2 cents per share from earnings. Excluding the impact of FIN 47, which addresses asset retirement obligations, Starbucks said that it earned $135 million, or 17 cents per share. On that basis, the results met analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates. But the effective tax rate in the quarter was 33.2 percent, down from 38.1 percent a year earlier. "The tax rate probably added a penny or so to the earnings," Gher said. Total revenue jumped 20.7 percent to $2.003 billion, but fell short of Wall Street's average forecast of $2.01 billion. Revenue from company-operated retail shops rose 22 percent to $1.7 billion, aided by new stores. Sales at stores open at least 13 months, a key measure that is closely watched on Wall Street, rose 5 percent. Shares of Starbucks fell 5.7 percent to $37.20 in extended trade. The shares closed at $39.43 on Nasdaq after rising to a high of $40.01. The company said it still expects to open about 2,400 net new stores this year, post total net revenue growth of about 20 percent and comparable store sales growth of 3 percent to 7 percent. Starbucks also still expects to earn 87 cents to 89 per share this year. Analysts had expected a profit of 89 cents per share. The Seattle-based chain's stock trades at roughly 44.3 times analysts' average 2007 earnings estimate, compared with an average multiple of 19.8 for companies in the Dow Jones U.S. Restaurants and Bars Index .DJUSRU.
