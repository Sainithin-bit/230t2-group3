 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Intel Corp. ( INTC.O ), the world's biggest chipmaker, said on Thursday that Yahoo Inc.'s ( YHOO.O ) chief financial officer would join its board and raised its quarterly cash dividend by 12.5 percent. 

 Yahoo CFO Susan Decker replaces John Browne, who is retiring after serving as an Intel director since 1997. In addition, Intel's board raised its quarterly dividend to 11.25 cents a share, effective in the first quarter of next year, the company said in a statement. Intel began paying a cash dividend in 1992 and has paid out around $8 billion. Cash dividends for 2006 will total around $2.3 billion, the company said. Intel shares fell 0.4 percent to $22.24. Citigroup earlier in the day raised its target on Intel shares to $26 from a previous $24, saying the company had significant room for operating margin expansion.
