 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Factors ranging from drought in Australia to slower exports growth in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan are set to slow economic expansion in most Asian countries in 2007, a Reuters poll shows. Still, economists say the regional slowdown will be mild, provided Asia's main export markets, including the United States, maintain decent growth rates. 

 Government spending on infrastructure is expected to raise incomes and consumption in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. Slower economic growth should also be accompanied by lower inflation, the poll suggests, giving central banks room to boost demand by lowering interest rates. Rob Subbaraman, regional economist at Lehman Brothers, said the 2007 outlook was unusually uncertain. "One big risk is we see a big slowdown in exports," Subbaraman said. "The other uncertainty is what happens to oil prices." "But, provided there is not a sharp global economic slowdown, the region is positioned for pretty solid growth next year. "We don't see a very sharp slowdown as long as the world economy holds up, and that's a big if," Subbaraman said. CHINA TO COOL, AT LAST? The Reuters poll of more than 100 economists in 12 countries showed economic growth will ease next year across the board with the exception of Indonesia and Thailand. Economists expect Australia's growth in the year ending June 2008 to be higher than that in the year ending next June. Asia's rising giant, China, will see growth in 2007 slip into single digits for the first time in five years as government efforts to dampen investment take effect, the poll says. New Zealand's GDP growth is forecast at 1.8 percent in 2007 -- its lowest in at least five years -- as the economy feels the brunt of a cooling housing market and strong currency, on the back of the highest interest rates in the industrialized world. Singapore's export-driven economy could see growth brake by 2.5 percentage points if U.S. demand dips, as is widely expected. Other export-reliant economies, such as those of Malaysia and Taiwan, would also see the pace of overseas sales ease. The World Bank made a similar prognosis in a report on East Asia this week. It predicted growth in East Asia excluding Japan of 7.3 percent in 2007, the slowest pace in four years. It also warned that Asia remained highly dependent on external markets despite a rise in intra-regional trade, so it was vulnerable to a severe slowdown in U.S. growth. But the World Bank reckoned, as did most economists polled by Reuters, that Asian central banks had leeway to ease monetary policy should growth slow to an unexpected degree, given that short-term rates across Asia were raised by 200 basis points between the end of 2004 and early 2006. POLICY FLEXIBILITY Besides, price pressures are abating. The Reuters poll forecast that average inflation in the Philippines would ease to 5 percent next year, from 6.5 percent estimated for 2006. Thai inflation is seen slipping to 3.3 percent next year from 4.7 percent on average expected this year. "One important thing to note is that the region is positioned for a strong policy response if there is weakening in exports," Lehman's Subbaraman said. "And there is scope to expand fiscal policy, too." The World Bank estimated Indonesia's removal of fuel subsidies last year transferred some $10 billion from consumers and businesses to government coffers, leaving it with more funds should fiscal stimulus become necessary. That doubling of fuel prices caused Indonesia's inflation to jump to more than 18 percent in November 2005 and forced Bank Indonesia to push interest rates up. But Indonesia has cut rates six times this year as inflation levels declined steadily, reaching 6.29 percent in October. Benchmark U.S oil prices CLc1 have fallen more than 20 percent from July's peaks above $78 a barrel. But economists believe the worry that oil will spike higher again is one reason why other central banks in Asia are reluctant to cut interest rates.
