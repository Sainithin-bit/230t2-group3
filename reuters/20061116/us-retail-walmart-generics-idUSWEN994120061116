 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said on Thursday it would begin selling certain generic prescription drugs for $4 in 11 new states, including Massachusetts, bringing the total to 38 states. 

 The world's biggest retailer, which launched the $4 generic drug program in Florida in September, said the program would be available in Washington, Idaho, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia as of Thursday. The cut-price drugs are now available in 3,009 pharmacies. Wal-Mart has 3,960 U.S. stores. Wal-Mart said the list of generics, which includes some 143 compounds, represents more than one-fourth of the prescriptions dispensed in its pharmacies nationwide. To date, as new states have been added to the program, 2.1 million more new prescriptions have been filled in those states as compared to the same time periods last year. When Wal-Mart first announced the $4 plan in September, it drove down shares of drugstores chains such as Walgreen Co. and CVS Corp.. The drugstore companies and analysts have said they see little threat from Wal-Mart's plan, noting that cash prescriptions account for only a small portion of their profits.
