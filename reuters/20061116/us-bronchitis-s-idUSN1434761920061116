 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - There is no evidence antibiotics help the vast majority of patients with acute bronchitis, and doctors should stop routinely prescribing them, researchers reported on Wednesday. 

 Acute bronchitis, an inflammation of the main airways to the lungs marked by an irritating cough, is one of the most common conditions treated by primary-care doctors, occurring in about 5 percent of adults each year. Two Virginia Commonwealth University doctors, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, said an exhaustive review of existing research studies and clinical trials turned up no evidence to support prescribing antibiotics for short-term bronchitis. This is because, they stated, almost all cases are viral infections and do not respond to antibiotics. They also found little evidence that cough medicine, also prescribed in most acute bronchitis cases, had any value. Dr. Richard Wenzel, chairman of the Department of Internal Medicine at VCU's School of Medicine, said doctors prescribe antibiotics to 70 percent to 80 percent of patients with acute bronchitis for treatment lasting 5-10 days. Wenzel said doctors generally should send home patients with acute bronchitis empty handed. Wenzel estimated that only a few percent of acute bronchitis cases might have a bacterial cause necessitating antibiotics. Doctors say most cases will go away on their own after a few days or a week, and recommend rest and drinking lots of fluids. 'NOT NEEDED' "We think that for the most part antibiotics are not needed," Wenzel said in an interview. Wenzel, who wrote the paper with VCU colleague Dr. Alpha Fowler, said he had several concerns about the routine prescription of antibiotics in these cases, aside from the fact they do not help most acute bronchitis patients. Wenzel cited the cost of the many millions of pointless doses of the antibiotics as well as side effects from antibiotics such as diarrhea, gastric upset, rash, headaches and muscle aches. Wenzel said the unnecessary prescriptions also contribute to the problem of bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics, thus rendering them less useful for treatment of infections. "I hope that doctors will pause ... and spend a few minutes to say (to patients) why it's unnecessary to take an antibiotic," Wenzel added. "Now I know that I'm floating against the pressures of managed care to move people through. And sometimes I sort of see the obvious -- what's easier for a physician: take 30 seconds to write a prescription, or take five or 10 minutes to say why you don't need one?" Wenzel said.
