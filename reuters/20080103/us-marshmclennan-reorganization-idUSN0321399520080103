 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Marsh & McLennan Cos ( MMC.N ), whose chief executive is being replaced, on Thursday announced a reorganization of its insurance brokerage unit, which also lost one of its top executives. 

 The company said it would consolidate its insurance brokerage into U.S.-Canadian and international divisions. It named Joseph McSweeny, a former executive at Willis Group Holdings Ltd ( WSH.N ), to run the U.S.-Canadian unit, and Alexander Moczarski, who had run the Europe, Middle East and Africa brokerage operations and won credit for improving results, will run the international unit. Phil Moyles, who had been chief executive of Marsh's brokerage unit in the Americas, said he resigned on Wednesday. The reorganization was also to include the departure of Mark Feuer, chief operating officer of the Americas. The changes allow Daniel Glaser, the brokerage's new chief executive, to put his stamp on a unit that has struggled to boost profit and retain market share after agreeing in 2005 with then New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to pay $850 million to settle a bid-rigging scandal. "Simplifying the current structure will enable Marsh to reduce complexity and improve efficiencies," Glaser said in a statement. The former executive at insurer American International Group ( AIG.N ) joined the company last month. Other changes include the appointments of Alexander "Sandy" Vietor as president of global specialties and Timothy Mahoney to oversee global risk management. Henry Allen will continue to oversee the global consumer division. Each reports to Glaser. Problems at the Marsh unit have contributed to Michael Cherkasky being pushed out as chief executive of the entire company, which includes consulting and other operations. He remains at the helm until a new chief executive is chosen. Marsh shares closed up 8 cents, or 0.3 percent, at $27.06 on the New York Stock Exchange. New York-based Marsh was once the world's largest insurance brokerage, but has been surpassed in market capitalization by rival Aon Corp AOC.N. Marsh also faces challenges from investors who might want the company broken up. On Monday, companies controlled by activist billionaire Nelson Peltz received approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to take a stake in Marsh. Through a spokeswoman, Peltz has declined comment. The Wall Street Journal on Thursday quoted a person familiar with the matter saying that Peltz's stake is a "small" one. Moyles had been touted by Cherkasky as one of three leaders who would resurrect the brokerage. In the third quarter, operating earnings missed forecasts by a wide margin due to a shortfall at the Marsh brokerage unit. Brokers negotiate insurance contracts with companies. By contrast, earnings at Aon rose 92 percent. (Reporting by Ed Leefeldt, editing by Dave Zimmerman,  Toni Reinhold )
