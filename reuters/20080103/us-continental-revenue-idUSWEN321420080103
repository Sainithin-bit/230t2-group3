 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N on Wednesday said consolidated passenger revenue per available seat mile, or unit revenues, rose between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent in December, helped by fuller planes and higher capacity. 

 The fourth-largest U.S. airline by passenger traffic said its consolidated load factor -- the percentage of seats filled with paying passengers -- fell 0.8 points from a year earlier to 78.7 percent. Traffic, as measured by revenue passenger miles, rose 1.9 percent in September, while capacity, as measured by available seat miles, increased by 3.0 percent.
