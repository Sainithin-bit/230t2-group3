 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp ( LMT.N ) has agreed to pay a former employee $2.5 million, more than any individual has received in the settlement of a racial discrimination case filed by the U.S. Equal Employment and Opportunity Commission, attorneys for the agency said on Wednesday. 

 Charles Daniels, 45, said he was called derogatory names and threatened by four co-workers and a supervisor between 1999 and 2001 when he worked as an aviation electrician for the company in Florida, Washington and Hawaii. Daniels, who is black, said that when he complained about how members of his six-person team were treating him, a company manager said, "That's just boys being boys, and that's the way it is here at Lockheed." "It was pretty humiliating," Daniels told reporters at a briefing in Honolulu. "To get called names is going to anger you. It's going to upset you. And it makes you frustrated because you know what the law provides." William Tamayo, regional attorney for the EEOC in San Francisco, said the settlement was also the largest ever to be publicly filed in Hawaii. It is also possible that even more hefty settlements have been reached privately in Hawaii and elsewhere and kept confidential between companies and individuals, Tamayo added. Lockheed Martin spokesman Joe Stout said, "We did not settle this matter because we believed we had liability." "Had this matter proceeded to trial, we believe the facts would have substantiated that the company took this matter seriously, investigated, and implemented appropriate actions," he said. "Lockheed Martin has strong policies, and we have a lot of training in place. We do not tolerate unlawful behavior or work place behavior that is inappropriate," Stout said.
