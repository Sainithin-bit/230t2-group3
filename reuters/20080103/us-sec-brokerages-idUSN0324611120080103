 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. regulation of financial professionals is based on distinctions that date back to the early 1900s and does not address the complexity of today's industry, according to a report commissioned by securities regulators and released on Thursday. 

 The report from the RAND Corp, a nonprofit policy group, said American investors do not understand key differences between investment advisers who dispense advice and broker-dealers who carry out investment transactions. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is reexamining the distinction between broker-dealers and investment advisers after a court decision last year overturned its attempt to do so in 2005. The court struck down the SEC's 2005 rule, which had spared some broker-dealers from having to register with the SEC as investment advisers as long as investment advice was only a small part of their business. SEC registration carries with it strict disclosure requirements and fiduciary duties. The SEC said in May that it would not appeal the court decision and commissioned the RAND study that was released on Thursday. "The report will assist the commission's efforts to update our regulations to improve investor protections in today's new marketplace," said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox in a statement. "Our staff is now studying the report and the potential regulatory implications of its findings." The SEC has said that the court ruling affected an estimated 1 million fee-based brokerage accounts holding a combined $300 billion. Fee-based accounts are brokerage accounts in which investors receive advice for a yearly fee and can trade without paying commissions. In September, the SEC gave help to investors with fee-based accounts by temporarily allowing advisers now registered as broker-dealers to meet legal requirements by asking for clients' consent before some trading transactions. Otherwise, the court ruling would have forced many investors to convert fee-based accounts to more costly commission brokerage accounts, or to have fewer investment options if they kept fee-based advisory accounts. The RAND report did not make policy recommendations to the SEC, which is considering what other regulation might be needed for broker-dealers and investment advisers. Daniel Barry, director of government relations for the Financial Planning Association, which brought the case in 2004 that challenged the SEC rule, said he was not surprised by the results of the report. "It bears out anecdotally what we knew all along," Barry said. "There's a lot of confusion among investors, a lot of knowledgeable investors, about financial professionals." Barry said he hopes the SEC holds public roundtable discussions on the topic before recommending any further regulations. The report noted that the financial professional industry has become "extremely heterogeneous," with many firms offering a range of services that are not clearly defined. "These findings suggest that many financial service professionals themselves are confused about how they should be reporting their activities," the report said. The report said that the roles and fiduciary responsibilities of broker-dealers and investment advisers are confusing to most investors. But it said more respondents to its survey generally expressed high levels of satisfaction with their financial service professionals. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA), which represents many broker-dealers and was upset with the court decision, said on Thursday that the broker-dealer industry is already heavily regulated and scrutinized. "But we must recognize that some of the confusion appears related to the broad range of customer choice," said Ira Hammerman, general counsel of SIFMA. "Any efforts to reduce confusion must ensure we don't diminish customer choice." The RAND report was posted on the Internet at:  here (Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
