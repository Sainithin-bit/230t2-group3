 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Corp ( GM.N ) said on Thursday its U.S vehicle sales fell 5.2 percent in December as consumer demand softened amid a weak housing market and higher gas prices. 

 GM said it sold 319,837 cars and light trucks in the United States last month, down 4.4 percent from 334,501 vehicles a year earlier. Including heavier trucks, total vehicle sales were down 5.2 percent to 323,453 units in December, GM said. (Reporting by  Poornima Gupta , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
