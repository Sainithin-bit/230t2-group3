 JAKARTA  (Reuters) - OPEC may decide to increase oil output at its February 1 meeting in Vienna if supply is not sufficient, Indonesia's OPEC governor told Reuters on Thursday. 

 Maizar Rahman said that OPEC has the capability to increase production by 500,000 barrels per day, and warned that oil prices could climb even higher. "There is a possibility the oil price can head to the $100-$110 level," he said. (Reporting by Muklis Ali, editing by Sara Webb)
