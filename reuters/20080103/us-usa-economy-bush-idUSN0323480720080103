 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush said on Thursday he was considering a fiscal stimulus package to shore up the struggling economy but has not made a decision. 

 "In terms of any stimulus package, we're considering all options and I probably won't make up my mind as to whether or not I lay one out until the State of the Union," Bush said in an interview with Reuters at the White House, referring to his State of the Union address to Congress on January 28. A growing number of private economists are worried that a surge in oil prices -- which hit $100 a barrel this week -- and the ripple effects from a sharp housing downturn and subprime mortgage crisis could tip the economy into recession. "We are listening to a lot of good ideas from different people," Bush said. "We've got our people out there carefully -- not only monitoring this situation -- but listening to ... possible remedies," Bush said. "I'm concerned about people losing their homes and paying a lot for gasoline," he added. But Bush said the run-up in oil prices was not the type of emergency that warranted tapping the U.S. emergency stockpile, known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Bush, who attributed the rise in the cost of oil to demand from fast-growing economies abroad, said the stockpile should be reserved for emergencies, such as a terrorist attack. "It's not the kind of emergency that would define the use of the SPR, as far as I am concerned," he said. "Hundred-dollar oil is a reflection of supply and demand." FED ON THE CASE The combined effect of the housing slump and the credit crunch that has followed a spike in mortgage foreclosures appears to have sharply slowed U.S. economic growth in the final months of 2007, raising the chances of recession. A gauge of factory activity released on Wednesday showed U.S. manufacturing contracted last month, adding to recession fears. The report and oil's reaching $100 a barrel knocked the Dow Jones industrial average down 1.7 percent in its first day of trading in 2008. With the bursting of the housing bubble, mortgage delinquencies and home foreclosures have jumped, prompting the Bush administration to broker a mortgage industry plan to freeze rates temporarily on some mortgages facing resets to sharply higher rates in coming years. Most of the problems in mortgage markets are due to loans made to borrowers with blemished credit histories, referred to as subprime loans. The Federal Reserve has lowered its key interest rate by a full percentage point, to 4.25 percent, since mid-September in a bid to buffer the economy. At the same time, higher oil prices have stirred fears that inflation could tie the central bank's hands in its efforts to boost the economy. In the interview, Bush underscored the Fed's independence from the White House in navigating economic risks. "I do have all the confidence in Chairman Ben Bernanke's ability to analyze the situation," he said. "I know he's paying very close attention to it. His response will be independent from the White House." Some prominent economists, from former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers on the left to Harvard University professor Martin Feldstein on the right, have urged the government to give the economy a fiscal boost and lawmakers from both parties have begun to consider what might be done. With presidential and congressional elections looming in November, Republicans could find themselves on the defensive if the economy takes a substantial turn for the worse. Bush made clear he would oppose any attempts to reverse some of the tax cuts his administration has put in place. "I'm going to make darn sure Congress doesn't raise taxes," he said.
