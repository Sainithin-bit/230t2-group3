 PARIS/WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Europe's EADS ( EAD.PA ) trumpeted a deal to sell three jet-refueling planes to Saudi Arabia on Thursday while jockeying with Boeing ( BA.N ) for a far bigger prize, a U.S. Air Force tanker order worth $40 billion. 

 EADS and U.S.-based Boeing are locked in fierce competition to supply the world's air forces with upgraded tankers. Airbus parent EADS said beating Boeing in the Saudi market validated the "superior capabilities" of the KC-30 aerial tanker it hopes to sell to the U.S. Air Force as part of a team led by Northrop Grumman Corp ( NOC.N ). Boeing and EADS' Airbus are also battling for supremacy in the booming commercial plane market. Boeing was expected to report record annual orders later on Thursday, but may yet lose out to its European rival, which reports annual orders later this month. At up to 200 million euros ($295.2 million) per plane, the Saudi deal is small by global aerospace standards. But the decision by a top U.S. ally to buy EADS was hailed by the European company as a breakthrough ahead of the U.S. tanker decision. "EADS' position as a global leader in advanced aerial refueling systems has been strengthened by this key win," said EADS Chief Executive Louis Gallois. He said European refueling hardware had been chosen by six air forces, including U.S. allies Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Canada and Germany. Separately on Thursday, the Northrop-EADS team and rival Boeing submitted their final proposals to the U.S. Air Force to start replacing KC-135 tankers, which average more than 46 years old. The initial order would be for 179 planes. A U.S. selection is due no sooner than late February, Air Force officials have said. With projected follow-on orders, the U.S. tanker market could top $100 billion. An earlier U.S. plan to lease and then buy 100 Boeing tankers was dashed in 2004 by a high-profile scandal that sent two Boeing officials to prison on conflict-of-interest charges. In submitting its final proposal, Boeing referred in a statement to Northrop's KC-30, which is based on the Airbus A330 airliner, as "oversized" for the U.S. refueling job. "Size is not an evaluation criteria" in the U.S. competition, shot back Randy Belote, a Northrop spokesman. "Boeing keeps raising the size issue because the KC-30 is superior in every Air Force capability category." Boeing is again offering the Air Force its medium-sized KC-767, which is based on its 767 airliner. "We raise the size issue because it really does impact how tankers will be utilized in future operations," responded William Barksdale, a Boeing spokesman. Barksdale dismissed the EADS award in Saudi Arabia as old news since it confirmed a decision that had leaked last year. EADS shares slipped 0.4 percent to end at 21.27 euros in Paris. Boeing shares closed up 36 cents at $86.98 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by  Bill Rigby ,  Jason Neely ; Editing by Rory Channing,  Gary Hill )
