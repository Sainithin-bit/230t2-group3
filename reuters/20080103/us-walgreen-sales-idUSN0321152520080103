 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Walgreen Co ( WAG.N ), one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains, on Thursday posted a 2.6 percent increase in sales at stores open at least a year, hurt by weakness in seasonal items and a mild flu season. 

 Also hurting sales were the introductions of lower-priced generic drugs in the past year, which tend to be more profitable for drugstores, but cut into sales. The withdrawal from the market of some cough and cold products for children under 6 also pressured sales, the company said. Pharmacy same-store sales rose 3.3 percent, while same-store sales of general merchandise, or "front end" same-store sales, rose 1.7 percent. Walgreen filled 1.4 percent more prescriptions in the month than a year earlier. The milder flu season lowered the number of prescriptions filled by 2.6 percentage points, Walgreen said. Walgreen shares traded at $36.89 on Thursday in electronic premarket trading, down from Wednesday's New York Stock Exchange close of $37.34. The stock trades at about 16.9 times estimated 2008 earnings, compared with a multiple of 20.5 for rival CVS Caremark Corp ( CVS.N ). (Reporting by  Brad Dorfman ; Editing by Dave Zimmerman)
