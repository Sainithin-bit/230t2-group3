 SYDNEY/PHILADELPHIA  (Reuters) - Centro Properties Group CNP.AX, Australia's second high-profile victim of a global credit crunch, is attracting interest from U.S. hedge fund Citadel Investment Group, a source familiar with the situation said. 

 Centro opened its doors to suitors on Wednesday, after it said last month it was struggling to refinance A$1.3 billion ($1.1 billion) in debt maturing in February sending its shares tumbling 80 percent. The Australian Financial Review newspaper reported on Thursday that Citadel and investment firm Blackstone Group ( BX.N ) had sent teams to Australia to discuss taking a stake in Centro, the fifth-largest shopping mall owner in the United States. Blackstone declined to comment. One source, with direct knowledge of the sale process, told Reuters that a rights issue, coupled with offering an equity stake to strategic investors, was one possibility being considered by Centro. But he said an outright sale of the company wasn't seen as being in shareholders' best interests, adding that a data room for interested parties would be opened up in coming days. Centro said it had decided to invite potential investors after receiving a significant number of unsolicited approaches. A spokeswoman for Citadel declined to comment specifically on Centro, but said the fund was "interested in opportunities to work on large, complicated situations where our scale and experience can help." Citing unidentified bankers for Centro, the paper said Australian fund management firms, including AMP ( AMP.AX ), Colonial First State CFI.AX and property group DB RREEF Trust DRT.AX had also expressed interest in investing in the group. On Thursday, a Centro spokesman declined to comment on the progress made in the strategic review process. POTENTIAL BUYERS AMP and DB RREEF declined to comment on the report, while Colonial First State could not be reached immediately. Centro shares gained 7.7 percent to A$1.12, adding to Wednesday's 3 percent rise. The stock has plunged from around A$5.70 prior to revealing its refinancing difficulties. "Lower-geared industry players that have balance sheet capacity would perhaps be in a stronger position to bid for these assets...than entities that rely on debt funding," said Sydney-based Richard Morris, an investment manager with Constellation Capital Management. Meanwhile, Standard & Poor's cut the ratings of Centro's U.S unit, Centro NP LLC, by six notches to CCC+ from BB+, reflecting concerns over a potential asset sale in softening market conditions, particularly in the United States.  S&P said Centro and Centro NP's liquidity was extremely weak given their sizeable short-term maturities. Centro has A$2.7 billion of debt maturing on February 15, including A$1.4 billion in interests in U.S. joint venture facilities. Centro has a further A$1.2 billion maturing within the next 12 months. Centro, whose market value has shrunk below A$1 billion, has appointed Lazard Carnegie Wylie as its adviser. ($1=A$1.13) (Editing by Carol Bishopric and James Thornhill)
