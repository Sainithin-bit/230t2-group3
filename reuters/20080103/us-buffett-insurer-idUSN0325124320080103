 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's new bond insurer may expand to Rhode Island after hearing that the state's treasurer wanted it to apply for a license to operate in the state, according to a Buffett spokeswoman. 

 "Rhode Island, here we come," the spokeswoman quoted the billionaire investor as saying in an e-mail on Thursday after reading about state Treasurer Frank Caprio's appeal. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc ( BRKa.N ) announced on Friday it was starting a new municipal bond insurer to help state and local governments cut borrowing costs.
