 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling said on Thursday he may vote against a plan drafted by the co-chairmen of a presidential commission to cut the deficit and reduce long-term debt. 

 Hensarling is one of 18 members of the commission asked by President Barack Obama to recommend ways to improve the U.S. fiscal outlet. The commission will vote on Friday. A minimum of 14 members are needed to support the plan to trigger congressional action on it. "I'm a lean no, but I feel an obligation because of my high respect for the co-chairmen to finish analyzing the plan," Hensarling told Reuters. He would be the third lawmaker to announce opposition. So far, nine commission members have said they will support the plan. (Reporting by  Kevin Drawbaugh ; Editing Will Dunham)
