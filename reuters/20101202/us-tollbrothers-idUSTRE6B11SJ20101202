 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Luxury home builder Toll Brothers Inc ( TOL.N ) posted a quarterly profit on Thursday, reversing a year-earlier loss, helped by cost-cutting and a tax benefit. 

 Toll shares were up 3.5 percent on news that the National Association of Realtors' Pending Home Sales Index jumped 10.4 percent in October, indicating housing affordability is attracting buyers. The Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB was up 3.7 percent. Toll, The largest U.S. luxury builder, reported earnings of $50.5 million, or 30 cents per share, for the fiscal fourth quarter, ended October 31, compared with a year-earlier loss of $111.4 million, or 68 cents per share. The latest results included an income tax benefit of $59.9 mln. Selling, general and administrative expenses were down 13 percent. Revenue fell 17 percent to $402.6 million but beat analysts' average forecast of $393.8 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. If the U.S. economic recovery gains momentum, Toll will be well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth, Morningstar analyst Mike Gaiden said. New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week, but a drop in the four-week moving average to a fresh two-year low pointed to an improvement in the labor market. "Land as an asset class is closer to a bottom than a top at present," Gaiden said. "Investors who can accept the near-term headwinds could be well rewarded." ORDERS OFF Before the NAR news, Toll's shares were off slightly on the company's outlook for home closings next year, which foreshadowed persistent soft demand. Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll forecast 2,100 to 2,900 home closings in fiscal 2011, which "implies a flat-to-worse demand environment," Wells Fargo analyst Carl Reichardt wrote in a note to clients. In the fourth quarter, Toll's orders dropped 27 percent to 558 homes. Builders are not out of the woods yet, Gaiden said. Some land continues to drop in value. Toll took land writedowns of $27 million in the fourth quarter, but that was down from $85.5 million a year earlier. Tax refunds are bolstering a balance sheet that was already robust, Credit Suisse analyst Dan Oppenheim wrote in a note to clients. "Toll's strong balance sheet should enable it to continue pursuing attractive opportunities on both land and distressed investments," he wrote. Toll shares, down 15 percent over the last six months, were up 65 cents to $19.11 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
