 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New U.S. claims for unemployment benefits rose last week, but a drop in the four-week moving average to a fresh two-year low suggested the labor market was slowly improving. 

 Initial claims for state unemployment benefits increased 26,000 to a seasonally adjusted 436,000, the Labor Department said. The government revised the prior week's figure up to 410,000. The data has little bearing on Friday's employment report for November as it falls outside the survey period. Anecdotal evidence points to a strengthening in the labor market and the government is expected to report that nonfarm payrolls rose 140,000 last month after increasing 151,000 in October. Last week's claims covered the Thanksgiving holiday and filings tend to fall during that period. However, the decline in actual claims was not as large as the Labor Department's model had anticipated, leading to a rise in the adjusted claims figure, a department official said. The four-week average of new jobless claims, considered a better measure of underlying labor market trends, fell 5,750 to 431,000, the lowest since early August 2008. A total of 8.91 million people were claiming unemployment benefits during the period under all programs. About 2 million unemployed people will lose their benefits by the end of this month after Congress failed on Tuesday to renew them. ANALYSTS COMMENTS: CARY LEAHEY, ECONOMIST, DECISION ECONOMICS, NEW YORK: "The jobless claims figure bounced back to where most people think it ought to be. You continue to have a modest, but not overwhelming, improvement in the labor market. The four-week moving average continues to grind lower. This will not have an impact on tomorrow's monthly payroll release. It takes us back to a more modest trajectory in terms of improvement. "You're talking about a loss of about $60 billion in purchasing power if unemployment benefits are not extended." OLIVER PURSCHE, PRESIDENT AT GARY GOLDBERG FINANCIAL SERVICES IN SUFFERN, NEW YORK: "I think the jobless number is going to get overshadowed with everything happening in Europe. We continue to see a vacillation between improving numbers then slight disappointments. Yesterday's ADP data were better, then this disappoints. We're improving, but not to the rate where its going to have an impact on bringing the unemployment rate down. We continue to be optimistic about incremental improvements, but there's so much else going on that the other issues are going to overshadow the unemployment. "Retail sales are positive. Some of the numbers coming in are really far above consensus, and that's a good thing. That's part of the wealth effect people are feeling because of the stronger stock market." FRED DICKSON, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, THE DAVIDSON COS., LAKE OSWEGO, OREGON: "It may cool off the stock market just a hair this morning. I think probably a bigger factor is that expectations are pretty high for a positive surprise in tomorrow's monthly payroll numbers. "I think the job picture is...we're going to see painstakingly slow improvement. One thing that might be a surprise is if unemployment benefits are not extended, people might quickly find themselves looking for a job." SEAN INCREMONA, ECONOMIST, 4CAST LTD, NEW YORK: "It's a pretty strong correction from last week's decline but it didn't fully reverse last week's decline and it is largely on seasonal factors thanks to the Thanksgiving holiday. Underlying the trend is still declining so this doesn't offset any positive views about the labor market."
