 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is investing $175 million in online coupon company LivingSocial, a preemptive strike against Google Inc which a source has said is looking to buy Groupon, another coupon provider. 

 LivingSocial said on Thursday it also secured an $8 million investment from Lightspeed Venture Partners, adding that it will use the funds to grow its business worldwide. LivingSocial said it is currently booking revenues of more than $1 million a day on average and expects well over $500 million in 2011. Rival Groupon does not reveal financial figures, but its daily e-mails about discounts for goods and services has become an online phenomenon and the company is considered one of the fastest-growing Internet startups. LivingSocial also offers customers deals on local restaurants and spas. Search engine leader Google is talking to Groupon about an acquisition, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. Amazon has been on an acquisition spurt in recent months, snatching up the parent of its smaller competitors Diapers.com and Soap.com for $500 million, and online store Woot.com for an undisclosed sum earlier this summer. Amazon purchased popular online shoe seller Zappos.com last year for roughly $1.1 billion. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando  and  Alex Dobuzinskis ; Editing by Phil Berlowitz and  Tim Dobbyn )
