 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Representative Paul Ryan said on Thursday he will vote against a presidential commission plan to reduce the U.S. deficit, saying it does too little to tackle health care costs and relies too much on tax increases. 

 In a statement, Ryan announced his intention to vote against the plan on Friday when the commission that was established by President Barack Obama holds its final meeting. He is the second lawmaker on the panel to announce his opposition. Nine members so far have announced support, and Ryan's opposition makes it more difficult for the panel's co-chairmen to win the 14 votes on the 18-member panel that would trigger a quick congressional vote.
