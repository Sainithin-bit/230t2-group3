 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Qantas Airway ( QAN.AX ) has filed a statement of claim in an Australian court to ensure it can pursue legal action against engine maker Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) in case a commercial settlement is not possible, the airline said on Thursday. 

 A Qantas Airbus ( EAD.PA ) A380 with 466 people on board made an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4, after one of its Rolls-Royce engines partly disintegrated mid-flight following an oil fire. Qantas said it had started discussions with Rolls-Royce on a range of issues, including the financial and operational impacts of the Nov 4 incident.
