 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus said on Thursday he will oppose a deficit reduction plan drafted by the co-chairmen of a presidential fiscal commission, becoming the third member of the panel to line up against it. 

 "The Deficit Commission recommendations would raise taxes on gas by 15 cents a gallon, which would hurt folks in rural states like Montana where we often have to travel long distances in the course of one day," Baucus, a Democrat, said in a statement. The commission is set to vote on the far-reaching proposal on Friday and 14 of the 18 members need to vote for the plan to trigger a congressional vote. So far, nine commission members have said they will support the plan.
