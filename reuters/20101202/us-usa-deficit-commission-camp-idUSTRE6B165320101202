 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Representative Dave Camp said on Thursday he will oppose a deficit reduction plan drafted by the co-chairmen of a presidential fiscal commission, becoming the fourth member of the panel to line up against it. 

 Camp, who is in line to become chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee when his fellow Republicans take control of the House in January, said tax increases in the plan would impede economic growth. He also said that the proposal fails to address healthcare spending that he said was the No. 1 driver of mounting U.S. debt. The commission is set to vote on the far-reaching proposal on Friday and 14 of the 18 members need to vote for the plan to trigger a congressional vote. So far, nine commission members have said they will support the plan. (Reporting by  Donna Smith ; Editing Will Dunham)
