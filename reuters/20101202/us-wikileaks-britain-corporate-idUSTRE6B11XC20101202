 LONDON  (Reuters) - Whistle-blowing website WikiLeaks, which is causing an international storm over its release of confidential diplomatic cables, said it would also publish disclosures from the corporate world. 

 "I believe that in the future we are going to have more material that is pertaining to the corporate community," WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said late Wednesday. Shares in Bank of America fell 3 percent Tuesday amid investor fears that the largest U.S. bank by assets might be at the center of WikiLeaks' next document release. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said his group planned to release tens of thousands of internal documents from a major U.S. bank early next year, according to an interview published Monday by Forbes Magazine. Hrafnsson, speaking at an event in London, confirmed that the website had information about the operations of a U.S. bank, but declined to identify it. "We usually don't comment on the projects that are ongoing. We take our time in scrutinizing the material before we release it and that applies to this material as well," he said.
