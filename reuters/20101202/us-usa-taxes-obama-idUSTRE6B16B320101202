 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that negotiations with Republicans over Bush-era tax cuts were "ongoing and productive" but no deal had been reached. 

 "Any reports that we are near a deal in the tax cuts negotiations are inaccurate and premature," White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said in a statement. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by  Jeff Mason )
