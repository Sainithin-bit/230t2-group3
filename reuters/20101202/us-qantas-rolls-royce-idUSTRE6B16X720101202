 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Qantas Airways ( QAN.AX ) has alleged engine maker Rolls-Royce ( RR.L ) was in breach of duty when it supplied engines for its Airbus A380 aircraft because of a design defect, the airline said in document filed in an Australian court. 

 Qantas also alleged Rolls-Royce was in breach as the engines were not capable of operating at thrust levels that would allow it to operate its aircraft on routes between Los Angeles and Australia at guaranteed payload levels, the document said. Qantas filed a statement of claim on Thursday to ensure it can pursue legal action against Rolls-Royce in case a commercial settlement is not possible.
