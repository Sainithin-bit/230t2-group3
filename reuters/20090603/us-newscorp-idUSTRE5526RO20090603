 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp named DirecTV Chief Executive Chase Carey as his top lieutenant on Wednesday, marking the return of one of the media conglomerate's most trusted veterans. 

 Carey, 55, will become News Corp's vice chairman, president and chief operating officer on July 1 and supervise the company's global operations, News Corp said in a statement. He also will join the company's board. Carey will take the top slot from departing Chief Operating Officer Peter Chernin, who earlier this year announced his resignation. Carey spent 15 years as a News Corp executive and previously served on the company's board. While at News Corp, he launched Fox Sports, expanded Fox Television Stations from its initial seven stations to 35. He also helped develop Fox cable channels including the Fox News Channel, FX and the National Geographic Channel. Carey joined Fox in 1988 and also served as chief executive officer of Sky Global Networks. Before News Corp, he worked at Columbia Pictures. On Nasdaq, News Corp fell 2.54 percent to close at $10.34, and DirecTV fell 1.73 to $22.69. (Reporting by  Robert MacMillan ; Editing by  Richard Chang )
