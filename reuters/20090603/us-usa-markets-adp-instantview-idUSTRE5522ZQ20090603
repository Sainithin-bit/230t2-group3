 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. private employers shed 532,000 jobs in May, fewer than the revised 545,000 jobs lost in April, a report by a private employment service said on Wednesday. 

 KEY POINTS: * The April figure was originally a decline of 491,000. * The median forecast of economists surveyed by Reuters for the ADP Employer Services report, jointly developed with Macroeconomic Advisers LLC, was for 520,000 private-sector jobs lost in December. * The ADP job reading is seen as a predictor of the government's monthly payroll figure. The Labor Department will release its May employment report at 8:30 a.m. on Friday. COMMENTS: DAVID MORRISON, CFD MARKET STRATEGIST, GFT, LONDON: "The revision for April is bad. "This is a nasty turnaround in the number after last month and doesn't bode well for Friday's non-farm payrolls. It is particularly worrying as the ADP data excludes government jobs. This suggests that the productive portion of the economy is nervous about adding to their overheads. The question now is whether traders shrug this off as a lagging indicator, or see stubbornly high unemployment as a barrier to recovery. "US stocks look overstretched, and even with the S&P busting through its 200 day moving average we may see profit-taking creep in." JACOB OUBINA, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, FOREX.COM, BEDMINSTER, NEW JERSEY: "ADP was a little bit worse than expected. Stocks revisited overnight lows and the dollar got slightly stronger with risk aversion coming back in a little bit. ADP has been over-predicting nonfarm payrolls by about 46,000 lately, so at the margin, we expect a worse-than-expected NFP number. But we'll still wait to see the employment component of today's ISM services report." SCOTT BROWN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, RAYMOND JAMES & ASSOCIATES, ST PETERSBURG, FLORIDA: "On the ADP data there was a big upward revision to April. That is a mild negative for the stock market and a mild plus for Treasuries, but the market reaction should be limited because you will have <Federal Reserve chairman Ben> Bernanke on deck testifying about economic conditions." TODD LEONE, HEAD OF LISTED TRADING, COWEN & CO., NEW YORK: "Basically the revised was a little bit worse than what they were expecting, I always look and see what the futures did. I don't think they were expecting a lot out of this and as long as the number wasn't crazy out of whack, which it wasn't, we'll just kind of hang here and do nothing. I don't think the ADP is going to move the markets much at all. More important is if Bernanke says anything today. I don't expect much coming up, but you never know." JOSH STILES, BOND STRATEGIST, IDEAGLOBAL, NEW YORK: "There is still a lot of weakness in the labor market but I think it is going to be a gradual paring down of job losses as the policy actions gain traction." ANGEL MATA, MANAGING DIRECTOR OF LISTED EQUITY TRADING, STIFEL NICOLAUS CAPITAL MARKETS, BALTIMORE: "The numbers are worse than expected, slightly worse, and that's probably related to the run up that we've had. It's going to give people a reason to sell today. "I don't think this is any kind of a trend. Everyone continues to believe that unemployment is going to go above 10 percent, but if it gets much worse than this that will probably give people another reason to sell." MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: U.S. stock indexes fell. BONDS: U.S. Treasury debt prices added to gains. DOLLAR: U.S. dollar rose against the euro and fell against the yen.
