 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The following is a summary of recent comments by Federal Reserve policy-makers: 

 * Denotes 2009 voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets U.S. monetary policy. KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, JUNE 3: "I suspect we are experiencing the first signs of the markets' concerns (about inflation ) in the rising rates and increased volatility in longer-term Treasury markets." "We need to be alert to the markets' message and begin in earnest to bring monetary policy into better balance before inflation forces our hand." * FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, JUNE 3: "Maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we, as a nation, begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance. Unless we demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal sustainability in the longer term, we will have neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth. "We now are in a process of slow and gradual repair, both in the financial system and the economy ... we have averted, I think, a very, very serious calamity." DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, JUNE 2: "I personally don't believe it (the long-end yield rise) is due to inflation fears, but I want to make sure it doesn't." "I suspect that we're going to have to shift to a higher savings rate versus consumption ... my guess is that it will be a factor we'll have to take into account." DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, MAY 28: "I would be delighted, but surprised, if meaningful sustained growth gets under way before the end of the year." * FED VICE CHAIRMAN DONALD KOHN, MAY 23: "The economy is only now beginning to show signs that it might be stabilizing, and the upturn, when it begins, is likely to be gradual amid the balance sheet repair of financial intermediaries and households. As a consequence, it will probably be some time before the FOMC will need to begin to raise its target for the federal funds rate." DALLAS FED PRESIDENT RICHARD FISHER, MAY 15: "I envision a slow recovery. Not a V-shaped snapback, or even a U-shaped one, but a very slow slog as we find a more sensible and sustainable mix between consumption and savings and investment." MINNEAPOLIS FED PRESIDENT GARY STERN, MAY 15: "I think that there have been a number of more favorable developments in recent months that suggest we are nearing the bottom of the recession." ATLANTA FED PRESIDENT DENNIS LOCKHART, MAY 12: "I believe that (financial market) conditions are now calmer but it is too soon to breathe easy." * FEDERAL RESERVE CHAIRMAN BEN BERNANKE, May 11: "I think the issue at hand is whether or not the dollar will retain its value and I think it will. I think the dollar will be strong. I think it will be strong because the U.S. economy is strong and it will also be strong because the Federal Reserve is committed to assuring that we have price stability in this country." "We are currently of course being very aggressive because we are trying to avoid another form of price instability, which is deflation, and weakening prices and economic growth. But we are also committed to removing accommodation in a timely way to ensure that as we come out of this episode and we move back to sustainable recovery, that we will have price stability, low and stable inflation going forward." * RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, MAY 11: "The financial safety net, especially those parts that were more implicit and perceived than explicit and written into the laws, played a significant role in the accumulation of risks that ultimately led to the turmoil we are still experiencing." "While deployment of the financial safety net is often viewed as an essential response to the financial crisis, I believe we need to give serious thought to the extent to which the safety net was actually a significant cause of the crisis." * RICHMOND FED PRESIDENT JEFFREY LACKER, MAY 8: "While economic activity is still contracting overall, some spending components appear to be bottoming out and the overall rate of contraction is thus slowing." "If the emerging stability in housing and consumer spending persists, as I expect, some segments of business investment spending should bottom out by the end of the year and economic growth would then turn positive. "Choosing the right time to withdraw that stimulus will be a challenge, and I believe it will be very important to avoid the risks of waiting too long or moving too slowly." * SAN FRANCISCO FED PRESIDENT JANET YELLEN, MAY 5: "For the first time in a while, there is some good news to savor. I am hopeful that the recession will end in the second half of this year due to aggressive monetary and fiscal policies and the operation of typical business cycle mechanisms. ... I expect the U.S. recovery to be frustratingly tepid once it does get started." KANSAS CITY FED PRESIDENT THOMAS HOENIG, MAY 4: "We have expended considerable resources addressing this difficult crisis but still we have a ways to go before markets will function effectively without government assistance. This process will go faster and with less ultimate cost if we take decisive steps to resolve insolvent institutions in a timely manner, regardless of their size and complexity."
