 MILAN  (Reuters) - Italian auto maker Fiat ( FIA.MI ) is focusing on its deal with U.S. peer Chrysler CBS.UL, a spokesman said, declining to comment further on the German government's reopening of a deal on Opel. 

 "The priority is Chrysler," a spokesman said on Wednesday. A German government spokesman has said the investment in Opel is still open to all interested parties. Fiat pulled out of talks on taking over Opel, the European arm of U.S. car maker General Motors GMGMQ.PK, last week and Germany agreed a deal with Canadian parts maker Magna MGa.TO.
