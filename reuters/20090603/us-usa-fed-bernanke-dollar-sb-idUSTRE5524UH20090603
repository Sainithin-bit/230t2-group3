 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday the U.S. dollar did not face a near-term risk of losing its reserve currency status and that ensuring a strong U.S. economy was the best way to keep the dollar strong. 

 "I don't see any risk in the foreseeable future to the dollar's status as a reserve currency," Bernanke told the U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee. Bernanke said the share of reserves held by all countries in dollars had gone up a bit recently, but signaled that that was no reason for complacency on the dollar's value. "We do have a responsibility to make sure our economy is appropriately run, and my view is that the best way to get a strong dollar is to get a strong economy -- to get the economy back on a growth path with high productivity, (a) good amount of savings," he said. "That's why I think it's important to get us turned around, get the financial crisis fixed and get the economy growing again." (Reporting by  Tim Ahmann ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
