 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Dai-ichi Life Insurance, Japan's second-largest life insurer, wants to watch the situation closely before deciding its lending stance toward Olympus Corp, a senior executive said on Monday. 
 Hiroshi Kanai, managing executive officer at Dai-ichi Life, refused to disclose how much exposure it has to scandal-hit Olympus. Shares in Olympus were untraded with a glut of buy orders on Monday after a source familiar with the case said it may be hit with only a fine for false financial reports, a move which could prevent a delisting. Japan's securities watchdog may also propose seeking criminal charges against the individuals behind dubious M&A deals in one of corporate Japan's biggest governance scandals, the source said on Sunday.
