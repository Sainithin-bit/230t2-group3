 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Government data showing the U.S. economy contracted at a slower-than-expected pace showed that progress is being made but much work remains, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Friday. 

 Gibbs said next week's report on unemployment is likely to show that hundreds of thousands more jobs have been lost. The news that GDP fell 1.0 percent in the second quarter was evidence that "progress is being made," he said. (Reporting by  Steve Holland )
