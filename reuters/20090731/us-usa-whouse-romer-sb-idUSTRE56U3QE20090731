 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The 'cash for clunkers' car rebate program has not expired, a senior White House advisor said, and promised an update later on Friday, urging people who were mulling buying a new car to go out and spend. 

 "We anticipate later today having more information on this," Council of Economic Advisers Chairwoman Christina Romer told Reuters Television in an interview. "If you wanted to buy a car this weekend, go do it. The program is still there. It has not been suspended, and I can tell you there is a real flurry of activity working with the agencies, the Congress, to ensure we can continue this and get the funds there," she said.
