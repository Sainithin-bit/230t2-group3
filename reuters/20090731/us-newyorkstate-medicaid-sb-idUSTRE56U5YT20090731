 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New York state on Friday rejected Mayor Michael Bloomberg's claim that it had withheld half a billion dollars of federal stimulus money for Medicaid, saying the city "got a fair and equitable share." 

 "Any claim to the contrary is wholly without merit. We fully expect to prevail in this legal action," Jeffrey Gordon, the spokesman for the state Division of Budget said by email. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, in a weekly radio show, said the city was suing the state for withholding the money. Bloomberg's spokesman was not immediately available to comment. Congress included about $90 billion of extra money for Medicaid in the economic stimulus plan approved in February. The aid was to ensure that cash-strapped states would not have to slash the health benefits for the disabled, elderly and impoverished that the program provides. Almost all states split the cost of Medicaid with the federal government, but New York state also requires counties to pay part of the expense. New York City is made up of five counties and the state financial control board estimated its program will cost $5.6 billion in the current fiscal year. Every year, the federal government determines its share using a formula called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. "The City received a fair and equitable allocation of FMAP aid that followed all federal requirements to the letter," said the state spokesman.
