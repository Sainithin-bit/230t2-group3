 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will not try to block passage of a possible $2 billion extension of the "cash-for-clunkers" program, a House Republican leadership aide said on Friday. 

 While many Republicans likely will end up voting against the bill, Republican leaders will not try to stop it from passing in the Democrat-controlled House, the aide said. A vote could come as early as Friday in the House and the $2 billion could still change to a different dollar amount, according to one House Democratic aide.
