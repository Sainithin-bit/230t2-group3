 (Reuters) - The United States said on Friday it had reached an agreement in principle with Swiss bank UBS on their tax evasion dispute and hoped to hammer out the details of a settlement in a week. 

 Following is a timeline of recent events at UBS: April 1, 2008 -- Doubles its writedowns, dumps its chairman, Marcel Ospel, and seeks more emergency capital. It proposes its lawyer, Peter Kurer, as Ospel's successor. May 6 -- Says it will axe 5,500 jobs and sell billions of dollars of ailing assets to weather the subprime crisis. June 19 -- A former UBS banker who once smuggled a client's diamonds into the United States in a toothpaste tube pleads guilty to helping a billionaire hide $200 million from U.S. tax authorities, part of a broader tax evasion probe of UBS. October 16 -- Announces it is to get 6 billion francs from the Swiss government for a 9.3 percent stake and is to unload $60 billion of toxic assets into a new central bank fund. November 12 -- Raoul Weil, head of UBS AG's wealth management business, is charged with conspiring to help thousands of wealthy Americans hide $20 billion of assets from U.S. tax authorities in Swiss bank accounts. February 10, 2009 -- Posts a 2008 loss of 19.7 billion francs, the biggest ever loss for a Swiss company. Cuts 2,000 more jobs. February 18 - Agrees to pay $780 million and identify certain U.S. clients to settle criminal fraud charges that it assisted rich Americans to evade taxes. February 19 - U.S. tax authorities say they are still pursuing a civil lawsuit seeking to access details on 52,000 UBS clients. February 20 -- Warns that it could go out of business if it complies with an order to reveal the names of suspected U.S. tax dodgers and would require it to violate Swiss law in a manner that would expose it to penalties. February 26 - Appoints Oswald Gruebel, former head of rival Credit Suisse, as chief executive, replacing Michael Rohner. March 4 - Chairman Peter Kurer steps down, replaced by Kaspar Villiger, a former Swiss finance minister. March 13 - Switzerland agrees to make concessions on bank secrecy amid a global crackdown on tax evasion.

June 25 - Says it is offering 293.3 million new shares at a price of 13.00 francs per share, a 6.9 percent discount to the day's closing price of 13.97. July 9 - A judge orders the U.S. government to say whether it was prepared to shut Swiss bank UBS AG in the United States.

July 28 - A U.S. client of UBS pleads guilty to using Swiss bank accounts to hide money from the U.S. taxman and says a Swiss government official received $45,000 to help cover up the fraud. Swiss prosecutors launch an investigation the next day.
