 LUXEMBOURG  (Reuters) - European Union leaders will not specifically discuss Spain's fiscal problems at a summit on Thursday, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker said in a newspaper interview. 

 Juncker, who is also chairman of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, told Luxembourg's Wort newspaper that austerity measures announced by Spain and Portugal went "in the right direction." "The heads of state and government of the euro zone agreed on a rescue plan in May for the entire euro zone, and I believe that is sufficient for all the problems that might occur," he was quoted as saying. "Spain may be in difficulty. But today we will not deal with this case specifically. Spain and Portugal have both decided to implement austerity measures, which point in the right direction." Following a decision by Moody's rating agency to cut Greece's debt to non-investment grade this week, he said: "I also think the EU should not respond to every rating agency move."
