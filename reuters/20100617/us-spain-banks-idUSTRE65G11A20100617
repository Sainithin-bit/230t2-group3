 MADRID  (Reuters) - Spain may use as much as 30 billion euros of its Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring (FROB) to cover the financing needs of its banks, the Economy Minister Elena Salgado said on Thursday. The FROB, created to help the banking sector, can issue up to 99 billion euros to aid credit institutions. 

 "(The fund) will be more than sufficient for all of banks' needs," Salgado said during a television interview. "It's going to be much less than (90 billion euros). These figures have to come from the Bank of Spain, but I would estimate, with total certainty, that it will be less than one third." (Reporting by Tracy Rucinksi; Writing by Paul Day)
