 (Reuters) - Here are developments in the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, the largest in U.S. history: 

 TOP DEVELOPMENTS * BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward faced the wrath of U.S. lawmakers on Thursday. He was expected to explain the events leading up to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and what BP has done to clean up the mess. * Shares in BP, which nearly halved in value since the April 20 explosion on an offshore rig that led to the spill, rose 8 percent. Analysts said some of the heat had been taken off the company by its move to set up a $20 billion spill fund and suspend its dividend. * BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg apologized for speaking "clumsily" by referring to those hurt by his company's oil spill as "small people. POLITICS * UK finance minister Osborne told BBC radio that BP "is a very important company, not just to the British economy but to the American economy as well. And we want it to succeed and flourish in the future for all our sakes." * The White House said on Wednesday it was confident BP was financially strong enough to continue to operate and pay damage claims from the spill. COMPANY/MARKETS NEWS * BP announced a $10 billion asset sale program as part of the fund deal, and bankers said most divestments would come from outside the United States. Oppenheimer & Co analyst Fadel Gheit pegged the value of the company's assets at more than $250 billion. * BofA Merrill Lynch expects BP's trading operations to be hurt as the company sets up funds for damage claims from the spill, and downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "buy." Analysts said the outcome of BP's meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama provided little clarity. * Russia's largest oil producer Rosneft said on Thursday that if BP decides to sell its minority stake in Rosneft, it will not inflict any economic damage on the Russian company. SPILL CONTAINMENT EFFORTS * BP is ahead of schedule in drilling a relief well to kill its blown-out Macondo well, the top U.S. spill official said on Thursday. It is still expected to be completed at some point in August. * BP's oil collection system caught 18,600 barrels on Wednesday. OIL SLICK THREAT * The spill has fouled 120 miles of U.S. coastline, imperiled multibillion-dollar fishing and tourism industries and killed birds, sea turtles and dolphins. * Fear that oil from the spill will damage Mississippi's coast is hurting the state's economy more than oil damage itself, according to a new report. QUOTE OF THE DAY "Under your leadership BP has taken the most extreme risks. BP has cut corner after corner" -- Democratic lawmaker Henry Waxman to BP CEO Tony Hayward.
