 ROME  (Reuters) - The chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Thursday praised the fiscal and labor market reform measures taken by Spain and said there was no reason for alarm over the prospects for its public debt. 

 "Spain has adopted a very courageous package of fiscal measures and now it has also presented labor market reforms which are important," Pier Carlo Padoan told reporters in Rome. "Its situation is difficult but completely manageable." Padoan also said that after recent depreciation of the euro against the dollar the exchange rate was now much more desirable. "$1.2 is much better than $1.5, and looking at history forex swings can be very long so there might be a further decline of the euro," he said on the margins of an economic conference. "This gives some relief to euro zone growth but it is not a solution to Europe's growth problems." In other remarks, Padoan said global imbalances, which had declined considerably during the recession of last year, were now widening again, although China's current account surplus continues to shrink in relation to GDP. He urged countries with current account surpluses, like Germany and Japan, to liberalize sheltered sectors of their economies to encourage incoming foreign investment. At the same time, emerging market economies with large current account surpluses should aim at reducing household savings by increasing social safety nets, a familiar recommendation of the Paris-based OECD. Monetary policy room for maneuver in Europe, in terms of reducing interest rates, is now "exhausted," Padoan said, and the ECB's monetary policy "risks becoming captive to emergency."
