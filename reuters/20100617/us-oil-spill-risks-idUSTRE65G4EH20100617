 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - It has been 59 days since an oil rig explosion in the Gulf of Mexico triggered an uncontrolled oil spill that has become the worst environmental accident in U.S. history. 

 Day after day, the world is exposed to pictures showing a heavy stream of crude pouring from the ruptured underwater well, workers on Gulf Coast beaches with oil dripping from their hands and wildlife covered in oily slick. BP, the oil giant that leased the doomed rig, has become a target of scorn. But with each passing day that its well pollutes fragile wetlands along the Gulf coast and harms local economies, politicians also face increased risk. Here are some key political factors to watch: TROUBLE FOR OBAMA U.S. presidents get blamed for just about any bad news on their watch and Barack Obama is not immune in this disaster. For weeks, Republicans have accused the Democratic president of either being slow to respond, or fumbling when it does act. The White House is laboring to prevent the words "Obama's Katrina" from sticking to this president. That's a reference to the widely-perceived poor response by former President George W. Bush to the devastating Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Bush was never able to shake the perception that he was detached and ineffective and it likely contributed to Republican Party election losses in 2006 and 2008. Obama's frustration over the oil spill was evident earlier this month when he observed: "I can't dive down there and plug the hole. I can't suck it up with a straw." But Obama can now point to a major accomplishment: He and fellow Democrats in Congress pressured BP to establish an independently-run $20 billion escrow fund to help compensate victims of the oil spill and clean up the mess. Obama made it clear if more money is needed, BP will have to cough it up. Obama faces continued risks, however. Early this year, he began pushing for a renewal of offshore oil drilling, even though his Interior Department had not yet reformed the agency that oversees the activity and it was widely viewed as an industry lap-dog. A presidential commission investigating the oil spill could have scathing words for both the Bush and Obama administrations. Republicans also are hammering Obama for imposing a moratorium on new deep water drilling projects. That, they say, will scare off the industry and encourage it to move deep water equipment to foreign shores. While environmental concerns abound, U.S. voters' concerns about jobs and the economy also loom large. U.S. CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS On November 2, U.S. voters will elect all 435 members of the House of Representatives and 36 of the 100 Senate seats. The political party in power, in this case the Democrats, usually suffers losses in mid-term congressional elections, in which the presidency is not on the ballot. The president's popularity is one of the factors in how many seats the opposition party picks up. Obama's approval rating has dipped below 50 percent and polls show a strong belief that the government has done a bad job of handling the BP disaster. Republicans might gain from these developments. But they also risk turning off some voters with their backing for offshore drilling and opposition to Democratic legislation uncapping oil company liability in accidents. One prominent House Republican, Joe Barton of Texas, may not have helped his party on Thursday when he called the creation of the BP escrow account "a tragedy of the first proportion, that a private corporation can be subjected to what I would characterize as a shakedown, a $20 billion shakedown." Meanwhile, there are high-profile races for Senate or governor in some of the states hurt most by the oil spill, namely Louisiana and Florida. The environmental disaster no doubt will play a role in those races, especially if the oil well keeps spilling until August or later, as expected. POLICY SHIFTS Obama's move toward more domestic offshore oil drilling has already taken a hit with the suspension of drilling at 33 deep water exploration rigs and the cancellation of a project off Virginia's coast. Democrats in Congress, working with environmentalists, are looking at several other steps, including lifting oil company liability caps and toughening laws governing offshore drilling. The oil spill has also hurt chances of broad climate control legislation passing Congress this year because an expansion of offshore oil drilling was to be included in a Senate bill to lure some needed Republican support. The BP spill made it politically impossible to move a robust offshore oil drilling expansion now. If Congress cannot pass a climate bill this year, the effort could reemerge next year, even if the congressional elections weaken Democrats. That's because some Environmental Protection Agency regulations imposing costly restrictions on greenhouse gas pollution could kick in. Lawmakers in both parties could get a wake-up call if those regulations are triggered as business may realize it's far more preferable to have climate legislation they can mold than relying on EPA. The oil spill could mark the end of the era of government deregulation that caught fire in the United States starting in the late 1970s with the airline industry. The 2008 financial industry meltdown coupled with severe auto industry woes and poor oversight of offshore oil drilling is prompting policymakers to reassert themselves. All this could undercut the message of conservative "Tea Party" activists clamoring for less government. BOBBY JINDAL The 38-year-old governor of Louisiana and former U.S. representative is thought to have a bright future in the Republican Party. Some speculate he might run for president in 2016. Jindal has complained that BP and federal authorities did not react quickly enough in the early days of the disaster, and were slow to bring in the equipment needed to keep the oil slick from reaching Louisiana's shores. Jindal has received plenty of media coverage from the oil spill that could raise his national profile. But it is unclear whether people will simply associate him with the disaster or see him as a rising star. Before the spill, Jindal was best known for his lackluster televised speech in 2009 responding to Obama's first address to a joint session of Congress. Not surprisingly, in that speech Jindal spoke of the need to "increase drilling for oil and gas here at home." BP/OIL INDUSTRY The energy company's shares have plummeted, BP could face criminal investigations for actions taken either before or during the crisis, and nobody knows how high its tab will be in clean-up costs and compensating for economic losses suffered by local fishing and tourism industries. Members of Congress are accusing BP of misleading the public on the scope of the disaster and causing the disaster by cutting corners to save money. The company has deep pockets, with net profits of $5.6 billion just in the first quarter this year. Nevertheless, some are wondering about the long-term impact on BP. More broadly, it's unknown whether the Gulf of Mexico spill will be to the offshore oil industry what the 1979 partial core meltdown at Three Mile Island was to the U.S. nuclear industry: The disaster stopped it dead in its tracks for decades.
