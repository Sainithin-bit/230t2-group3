 (Reuters) - After being subject to harsh criticism for lapses during the financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve looks poised to emerge from an overhaul of financial regulations with a broader role in policing system-wide risk and most of its jealously guarded independence intact. 

 Lawmakers from the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are negotiating a compromise financial regulatory reform bill that melds versions passed in each chamber. Negotiations are ongoing and the final shape of legislation may yet change. The final bill, which Democrats hope to complete by June 24, would be the most sweeping overhaul of U.S. financial rules since the 1930s. Following is a look at provisions so far that affect the Federal Reserve: CONSUMER PROTECTION The Senate would set up an independent Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection in the Fed, funded by the Fed. The agency would have power to write and enforce consumer protection rules, but the Fed would have a role overseeing the agency. The House proposed a new, fully independent U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Agency to regulate mortgages, credit cards and other products. The consumer protection lending rules would not apply to auto dealers. SYSTEMIC RISK REGULATION The Senate measure establishes an inter-agency Financial Stability Oversight Council chaired by the Treasury secretary to watch for dangers that could roil the wider financial system, giving the Fed some powers to take action. The House creates a similar council, but gives the Fed a much larger role in executing policy by setting limits for large, interconnected firms that could threaten economic stability. The Senate bill formally gives the Fed responsibility for monitoring and defusing risks to U.S. financial stability. The House bill allows the Fed to limit credit exposures at financial firms, block acquisitions, restrict pay and shut down undercapitalized firms. SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT FIRMS The Senate bill puts the Fed in charge of supervising all financial firms, not just banks, with assets greater than $50 billion that could destabilize the financial system if they collapsed. The House bill lets a systemic risk council impose stricter standards for systemically important financial firms. AUDITS Lawmakers eliminated a provision that would have allowed reviews of Fed monetary policy decisions by the Government Accountability Office, a congressional investigative agency. They agreed to a one-time audit of the Fed's emergency lending during the 2007-2009 crisis, and to making public activity at the Fed's discount window and open markets operations with a two year lag. The Fed's discount window is where deposit-taking banks go for loans if they are unable to obtain funding in markets. The Fed conducts monetary policy by buying and selling Treasury securities through its open market desk. The Fed successfully fought off a Senate provision that would have exposed it to repeated audits of its emergency lending. GOVERNANCE Lawmakers dropped a plan to make the head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank a presidential appointee subject to Senate confirmation; currently, he or she is chosen by the New York Fed's board of directors. They agreed to establishing a Fed vice chairman for supervision. Members of Congress also decided to prevent bankers supervised by the Fed who serve on the boards of directors of the 12 regional Fed banks around the country from voting for the presidents of those regional Fed banks. Currently, regional Fed boards are composed of three classes of directors: bankers, individuals chosen by bankers, and individuals chosen by the Fed Board of Governors in Washington, all of whom vote for the regional Fed's president. Lawmakers agreed to an audit of Fed system governance by the Government Accountability Office. EMERGENCY POWERS Lawmakers eliminated the Fed's ability to lend to individual firms as it did with Bear Stearns and American International Group and exceptional lending to broad facilities such as ones set up during the crisis.
