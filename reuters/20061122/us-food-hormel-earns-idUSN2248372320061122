 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp. ( HRL.N ) on Wednesday posted higher quarterly profit, in line with raised expectations it announced earlier this month, and gave a forecast for current-quarter earnings that was higher than analysts' estimates. 

 Hormel shares rose more than 3 percent on the New York Stock Exchange and reached an all-time high early in the session. Specialty foods such as ingredients and sugar substitutes, and refrigerated foods like sliced pepperoni, helped the company offset higher costs in its Jennie-O turkey business. Like other meat companies, Hormel has been hit by higher feed costs as grain prices soar. "The protein industry cannot absorb these higher costs long-term," Jeff Ettinger, chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts. He added that the company would raises price "over time," on products affected by the higher costs. Profit rose to $90 million, or 64 cents a share, for the fiscal fourth quarter ended October 29, from $82.2 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 5 percent to $1.56 billion. Analysts, on average, had looked for 64 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. On November 10, Hormel raised its earnings forecast for the quarter to a range of 63 to 65 cents a share. Hormel forecast first-quarter earnings of 52 to 58 cents a share. Analysts, on average, expect 51 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. For all of 2007, the company sees earnings of $2.15 a share to $2.25 a share, saying it expects its "value-added initiatives" to overshadow higher grain costs that will pressure its turkey business. In recent years Hormel, which also makes Spam luncheon meat, has focused on "value-added" convenience products, like precooked bacon and heat-and-eat entrees, in order to boost sales and profits. But some analysts were cautious about the company's prospects for 2007, especially noting that Hormel trades at a higher earnings multiple than other meat companies. "While we appreciate the benefits of the company's diversified and value-added model, we are concerned that higher corn prices in the year ahead will hurt the turkey unit, and that later in (the second half of 2007) higher hog costs (as corn is passed through) may hurt refrigerated meats profitability," Pablo Zuanic, analyst at J.P, Morgan Securities, said in a research note. Hormel shares were up $1.14 at $37.83 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange and traded as high as $38.60 earlier. The stock is up more than 15 percent this year, compared with a 11 percent increase for the Standard and Poor's packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD.
