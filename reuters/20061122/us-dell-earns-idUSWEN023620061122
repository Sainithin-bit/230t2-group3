 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Dell Inc. DELL.O comfortably beat analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings on Tuesday as it sold more laptops and increased sales in China and Europe, sending its shares nearly 10 percent higher. 

 The world's second-largest personal computer maker said net income for its third quarter ended November 3 was $677 million, or 30 cents per share, compared with the average analyst forecast of 23 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "They're making progress," said Shaw Wu, an analyst at American Technology Research who has a "neutral" rating on the stock. "It looks like they hit a low" in the second quarter. Dell a year ago reported net income of $606 million, or 25 cents per share, but the company said prior-period figures were subject to change because of previously disclosed accounting investigations by auditors, regulators and prosecutors. Third-quarter revenue was $14.38 billion, up 3.4 percent from a reported $13.9 billion a year ago. It was the slowest growth in more than four years, but it fell within the range of Wall Street estimates. Dell sold 17 percent more notebook computers and computer sales in China grew 33 percent, while "a more balanced approach to pricing" in Europe helped unit sales there grow 9 percent. "The improvement in Europe by far contributed the most to the overall improvement," said Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities who has a "sector perform" rating on Dell. "It looks like the worst is behind the company." Revenue growth at Dell hit 22 percent in 2002 and hovered in the mid- to high-teens through the middle of 2005 as it undercut rivals by selling directly through its Web site and toll-free phone service. Sales have been dented in the past year as prices fell and it faced tougher competition from Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ), which last week reported a quadrupling of quarterly profit as sales and margins improved. Dell shares had rallied in recent weeks amid optimism that third-quarter earnings would top forecasts. Dell shares gained 9.5 percent to $27.17 in extended-hours trade following the results. The stock, down 17 percent as of Tuesday's $24.82 close, had traded at about 20 times forward earnings per share, a discount to a computer hardware sector average of 37. HP's stock is up 40 percent in 2006. Dell had delayed third-quarter earnings from November 16 amid the accounting probes. Dell said on Tuesday its results were preliminary and it did not expect to file them on time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also has not yet filed second-quarter earnings with the SEC. Dell is also dealing with a recall of Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) battery cells in its laptops and complaints of poor after-sales service. It also just lost its status as top PC maker to HP. PROFITABILITY IMPROVES Dell, based in Round Rock, Texas, reported third-quarter operating profit margin of 5.7 percent, up from the second quarter's 4.3 percent but still short of margins of 8 percent to 9 percent in early 2005. Dell said it was making progress in its long-term efforts to improve the balance between liquidity, profitability and growth. But it cautioned that in the short term, "improvement in growth and profitability may not be linear" as it spends more on customer service, global expansion and new products. Dell forecast a "muted seasonal uplift" due to product mix changes and regional profit and said last year's fourth quarter had an extra week, boosting sales against the current quarter. Customer complaints of poor after-sales service prompted Dell to spend more than $150 million this year to open new service call centers and hire more staff to handle queries. Dell's accounting problems, which it has said relate to revenue recognition, accruals, reserves and other matters, is already the subject of investigations by company auditors. Recently the SEC elevated the status of its investigation to formal from informal, giving it authority to issue subpoenas. The U.S. Justice Department has subpoenaed documents related to Dell's financial reports from 2002 to the present. Dell's missteps have led some analysts to question whether Chief Executive Kevin Rollins' job may be in jeopardy. But Dell spokesman Bob Pearson said on Tuesday founder Michael Dell has "shown his full support for Kevin."
