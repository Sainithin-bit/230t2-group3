 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Monster Worldwide Inc. has fired its general counsel in connection with its internal stock option investigation, the parent company of the leading jobs Web site said on Wednesday. 

 The executive, Myron Olesnyckyj, had been senior vice president, general counsel and secretary. He had been on suspension from his duties since September 19. In July, New York-based Monster said it might restate financial results for 2005 and prior years to record additional noncash charges for stock-based compensation expenses relating to stock option grants. On October 9, Monster named William Pastore, 58, chief executive officer after 71-year-old founder Andrew McKelvey resigned as CEO and chairman. McKelvey, the company's largest individual shareholder, resigned from the board and stepped down as chairman emeritus on October 30 after refusing to be interviewed for the company's probe. More than 150 companies have internal investigations under way or are the subject of federal probes into possible manipulation of stock options. With so many companies under scrutiny, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is relying to some extent on internal company reviews when deciding whether to investigate further. The results of in-house probes are being handed over to the SEC, which reviews the findings. Monster shares were off 7 cents at $44.87 in early trading on Nasdaq.
