 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Billionaire Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. investment firm said on Wednesday it had sold $462 million of stock in General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), cutting its stake in the automaker to 7.4 percent from 9.9 percent. 

 The news sent GM stock plummeting by almost 5 percent on the New York Stock Exchange -- the largest one-day drop since October 6 when the automaker rejected an alliance with Renault-Nissan. News of Kerkorian's sale of GM shares came on the same day he announced a tender offer for $825 million of stock in MGM Mirage Inc. ( MGM.N ) that would raise his stake to almost 62 percent of the hotel and casino operator. Kerkorian's dual moves touched off speculation that the billionaire investor, who has a history of trading corporate assets in Las Vegas, Hollywood and Detroit, could be steering away from a protracted fight for control of GM's board. "It signals that he pretty much is going to go quietly into the night," said Kevin Reale, an automotive analyst at AMR Research. In a U.S. regulatory filing, Tracinda said it had agreed on Monday to sell 14 million GM common shares in a private transaction for $33 per share. The sale turned a profit for Kerkorian, who paid an average of just over $30 for the GM shares he held, but the ensuing sell-off threatened to push his remaining GM stake of over $1.25 billion into a loss. A Tracinda spokeswoman said the investment company had no further comment. GM said it would not speculate on what Kerkorian's sale implied. "GM's practice is not to comment on the actions of its shareholders," said GM spokeswoman Renee Rashid-Merem. Kerkorian's associate Jerry York resigned from GM's board on October 6 in a dispute over board oversight and strategy triggered by GM's decision not to pursue the alliance with Renault-Nissan he had attempted to broker on Kerkorian's behalf. York's resignation from GM's board -- and his public criticism of the oversight it provided -- led many analysts to believe that Kerkorian could be gearing up for a proxy fight to seek control of GM's board and oust Chief Executive Rick Wagoner. But this week's stock sale cast doubt on the view that Kerkorian was readying for a fight with GM. "Maybe he doesn't think there will be a blip in Rick Wagoner's plan -- showing he can't create the controversy he needs to change the board's direction," Reale said. Other analysts said Kerkorian had retained a sizable enough stake in GM to wield influence and could still buy back the shares he had sold. "The tea leaves are a little harder to read on this one," said Pat McGurn, special counsel at proxy advisory service ISS. "If (Kerkorian) had sold off his entire position that would have put an end to it once and for all." Global Insight automotive analyst George Magliano agreed that Kerkorian's actions would keep investors guessing about his intentions. "I wouldn't want to be the one who says he's done with GM and he's going to back off, because his history is that he doesn't back off," he said. Kerkorian first began amassing what became a $1.7-billion stake in GM in April 2005. Tracinda sold shares once in that period. In December, Kerkorian sold 12 million shares for $252 million to show a loss for tax purposes and then bought back the same number in January for $263 million. Kerkorian remains GM's largest individual shareholder, but now ranks as the fourth largest overall behind three institutional investors led by State Street Global Advisors. Tracinda had been the second largest investor in GM before this week's sale. RENAULT-NISSAN TRIGGERED BREAK Kerkorian had been the catalyst behind the proposed tie-up between France's Renault SA ( RENA.PA ) and Japan's Nissan Motor Co. ( 7201.T ), which he and York had seen as a way to accelerate GM's turnaround efforts. Both Renault and Nissan are headed by Carlos Ghosn, and analysts had seen Kerkorian's proposed deal as a way to bring in an executive highly regarded for his turnaround success at Nissan. But GM's board, including York, voted unanimously to break off talks with Renault-Nissan in early October. Kerkorian, 89, responded by withdrawing plans to buy 12 million more shares in GM, something he had said he might do when the potential alliance was still on the table. GM shares closed down 4.7 percent, or $1.53, to $31.09 in heavy volume. Despite an 11-percent sell-off this week, GM shares are still up 60 percent since the start of the year. GM saw its global sales drop by 2.5 percent over the first nine months of the year as it lost market share to Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ). The automaker faces tough contract talks next year with its major union. After slashing costs, analysts have also said GM must now show progress with its plan to increase revenue on the strength of new vehicle offerings.
