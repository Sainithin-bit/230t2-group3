 OSLO  (Reuters) - Norwegian conglomerate Orkla ( ORK.OL ) and U.S. aluminium producer Alcoa ( AA.N ) have agreed to create a joint company combining their soft alloy extrusion businesses, Orkla said on Wednesday. 

 "The new venture will be majority owned by Orkla and is anticipated to be formed by the end of the first quarter 2007," Orkla said in a statement. Orkla said the parties planed a subsequent IPO of the joint venture, related to Alcoa's intention to exit the soft alloy extrusion business. The extrusion business of Orkla's subsidiary Sapa Group consists of 18 facilities in 12 countries and approximately 6,000 employees, while Alcoa's soft alloy extrusion business has 22 facilities in eight countries and about 6,400 employees. "The joint venture will become a global leader in the aluminium extrusion business, with an estimated annual turnover of $4 billion in 2006," said Ole Enger, Chairman of Sapa and head of Orkla's Specialty Materials business in the statement.
