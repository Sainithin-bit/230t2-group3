 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Some bondholders of Delta Air Lines Inc. DALRQ.PK have begun organizing an informal group to support US Airways Group Inc.'s ( LCC.N ) $8.78 billion takeover offer for the bankrupt carrier, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday. 

 The group is considering all options but could end up pressing Delta creditors to accept the US Airways bid, which faces some skepticism from Delta's management and larger creditors, the source said. In conference calls yesterday with Deutsche Bank AG ( DBKGn.DE ) and Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N, bondholders were urged to band together to pressure Delta to fully consider the bid from US Airways and any other offers that arise, the source said. A spokeswoman for Lehman and a spokesman for Deutsche Bank declined to comment. A spokeswoman for US Airways said, "The market has already responded and validated the strength of the bid and the proposal we've put forward." US Airways declined to comment on the splinter group of creditors. Delta was not immediately available to comment. (Additional reporting by  Megan Davies )
