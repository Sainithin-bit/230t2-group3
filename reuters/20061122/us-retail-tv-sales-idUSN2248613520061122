 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - With the official holiday shopping season about to get under way, consumer electronics retailers are rolling out aggressive "Black Friday" deals in an effort to win a larger share of flat-panel television sales. 

 High-definition LCD and plasma TVs, with their sleek shapes and quickly declining prices, are expected to be one of the holiday season's hottest selling items. Profits at consumer electronics retailers have surged in the past year as shoppers replace clunky tube TVs that cost hundreds of dollars with advanced ones that can cost thousands. But with more retailers elbowing in on the flat-panel TV market, the promotional environment has intensified heading into "Black Friday," the day after Thanksgiving that kicks off the holiday shopping season. Consumers can expect to be inundated with special offers on a dizzying array of TVs, and investors are waiting to see if they turn to specialty retailers like Best Buy Co. Inc. ( BBY.N ) and Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N to buy their TVs or if they head to discount retailers like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) and Target Corp. ( TGT.N ) They are also watching to see how Wal-Mart's announcement that it would implement its "most aggressive pricing strategy ever" will factor in to TV sales, and if retailers can offset these overall lower prices with higher volume to keep ringing up strong sales. "With the sharp price declines that commenced in September and continued through November, the TV category has entered the critical holiday selling period with more uncertainty than anticipated," Colin McGranahan, a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, wrote in a research note. At the moment, he said, Best Buy appears "firmly in the driver's seat" and its "secret" specials for Black Friday feature the same Panasonic 42-inch plasma that Wal-Mart discounted in early November. He said Best Buy's price of $999 is a 20 percent reduction from Wal-Mart's $1,249 price. But adding to the mix, Circuit City is advertising a Panasonic 42-inch plasma TV for $1,199.99, while an ad on Wal-Mart's Web site says it will be selling a Viore 42-inch plasma high-definition TV for $988 on Black Friday. In a research note, Goldman Sachs said its latest pricing study suggests annualized price declines for advanced TVs in excess of 30 percent, steeper than the 25 to 30 percent declines suggested by its previous studies. "Over time, encroachment by discounters is likely to eat into share and margins on new TV technologies, but to date we do not believe Wal-Mart and Target have particularly compelling offering of flat-panel," wrote Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler in the note. Best Buy and Circuit City, which have a wider selection of TV accessories and services such as home installation, should be able to use that to their advantage to offset lower margins, he wrote. However this upcoming holiday season shapes up, retailers should enjoy the flat-panel TV sales rush while it lasts. "The cycle has accelerated and compressed to a larger degree than expected, and we are increasingly confident in our view that holiday 2006 will mark the peak growth rate in the category," wrote McGranahan in a note.
