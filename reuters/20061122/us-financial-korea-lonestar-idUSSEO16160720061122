 SEOUL  (Reuters) - U.S. buyout fund Lone Star is close to terminating its $7.3 billion deal to sell Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) to Kookmin Bank 060000.KS because of a prosecutors' investigation, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday. 

 But shares in both Kookmin and KEB both gained over 1 percent in early trade, as the possible collapse of the transaction was seen as being already discounted in Kookmin shares, which have lost ground in the past five sessions. The sale of KEB to Kookmin, which would be the country's second-biggest takeover, has been seen as a litmus test for foreign investors, amid a backdrop of growing anti-foreigner sentiment. South Korean prosecutors started looking into allegations in February that financial data on KEB 004940.KS had been understated to help Lone Star buy the bank in 2003 at a bargain price of $1.2 billion. Prosecutors are seeking to extradite Lone Star Vice Chairman Ellis Short and general counsel Michael Thomson from the United States for questioning in relation to stock trading in KEB Credit Service, after a South Korean court issued warrants last week to detain the two men. The nine-month legal saga has been a key factor in delaying Lone Star's plan to sell KEB to Kookmin, and may give South Korea's top lender the upper hand, should Lone Star be required to jettison its stake in a hurry. Lone Star's decision is expected to be finalized in the next few days, the FT reported. "In light of this investigation being extended again, and the issuance of arrest warrants against Ellis and Mike, we are considering what we should do with Kookmin," Lone Star Chairman John Grayken was quoted as saying. "We're talking about terminating." A Lone Star spokeswoman in South Korea declined to comment, and a Lone Star spokesman in New York could not be reached immediately. Kookmin shares were up 1.53 percent at 73,000 won by 0026 GMT, and KEB shares were up 1.18 percent at 12,850 won, against the wider market's  .KS11  0.38 percent rise. "A possible termination of the deal had been around in the market, and now such a risk has increased with his remarks," said Mok Young-chung, an analyst at Macquarie Securities. "Still many people are sticking with the expectations that the deal would stay on track, although the legal issue would make the process very long." Should the deal fall through, Lone Star would try to put KEB up for sale again after the legal issues were resolved, and Kookmin may join the auction, analysts said. A Kookmin official in charge of the deal said he was unaware of the talk of termination. Officials at KEB and the Financial Supervisory Commission, the country's top financial watchdog, could not immediately be reached for comment. Chae Dong-wook, who is overseeing the Lone Star investigation at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, said the office was preparing to submit extradition requests. He also said he did not know about a report of the possible collapse of Lone Star-Kookmin talks. Foreign direct investment plans received during the third quarter fell 14.8 percent from a year earlier, according to the commerce ministry. The South Korean government tightened regulations this year to close tax loopholes which critics said allowed foreign investors to make tax-free windfalls in the country.
