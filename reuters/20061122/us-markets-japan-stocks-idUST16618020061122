 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Tokyo's TOPIX index  .TOPX  rose 1.30 percent on Wednesday, gaining for the first time in six sessions as investors picked up recently battered stocks such as Softbank Corp. ( 9984.T ) and Fast Retailing Co. Ltd. ( 9983.T ). 

 Small-cap shares recouped some of their recent steep losses, with the Mothers index .MTHR jumping 6 percent, setting a positive tone for the overall market. The broad TOPIX index  .TOPX  advanced 19.92 points to 1,552.87 while the Nikkei  .N225  rose 1.14 percent, or 180.09 points, to 15,914.23. On Monday, the Nikkei ended at its lowest close since late September while the TOPIX was at its lowest close in nearly four months. "Investors are buying back shares or picking up stocks on dips, thinking that the market has been oversold," said Masayoshi Yano, a senior manager of investment information at Tokai Tokyo Securities Co. Ltd., who said the price to earnings ratio for the Nikkei 225 had slipped to around 18 from 20 just a few weeks ago. Japan's markets will be closed for Labor Thanksgiving Day on Thursday, and U.S. markets will be closed for the Thanksgiving holiday. Among the day's fallers, Daiwa Securities Group ( 8601.T ) ended down 0.5 percent at 1,216 yen after a news report that Japan's securities watchdog would call for penalties against Japan's second-biggest brokerage for suspected involvement in insider trading. After the close of trade, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission called for disciplinary action against Daiwa as an inspection found that the country's second-biggest brokerage had been involved in insider trading.  Konica Minolta Holdings Inc. ( 4902.T ) dropped on dilution concerns following its convertible bond issuance plan, while NEC Corp. ( 6701.T ) ended at a four-month closing low after it posted a wider first-half loss and Mizuho Securities cut its rating on the stock.  Some said the market was also aided by hopes that stock tax breaks may not be repealed as previously expected. A government panel had been expected to propose letting preferential tax treatment for capital gains and dividends expire at the end of fiscal year 2007 as initially planned. But the head of the tax panel for Japan's ruling party spoke against ending these measures, and the Nihon Keizai reported in its evening edition that the government had started discussing steps to prevent a rush of stock sales before the scheduled end to the special tax breaks. "Investors had been disappointed by the news that the government may let the tax treatment expire as planned, so now they may be getting their hopes up," said Toshihiko Matsuno, assistant general manager at SMBC Friend Securities. But Matsuno added that investors overall were reluctant to build new positions ahead of the holiday. Takashi Kamiya, chief economist at T & D Asset Management, said the market view on the economy has turned dim but a turnaround was possible depending on Japanese companies' sales during the Christmas season. "The key will be retail sales, especially in the United States," he said. "Piled-up inventories in the Japanese technology sector have been a concern, and investors want to see how they will clear during the Christmas season." Volume rose from the previous session with 1.75 billion shares changing hands on the Tokyo exchange's first section. That was still well below last month's daily average of 1.82 billion shares. Advancers beat decliners by a ratio of more than five to one. INVESTORS RETURN Japan's Internet and telecoms group Softbank, whose shares are one of retail investors' favorites, surged 8.4 percent to 2,320 yen, snapping a five-day losing streak. Retail and property stocks, which are sensitive to domestic demand and have been under pressure due to growing worries about a slowdown in the Japanese economy, also gained ground. Fast Retailing rose 1.5 percent and Mitsubishi Estate Co. Ltd. ( 8802.T ) surged 3.1 percent. Sumitomo Titanium Corp. ( 5726.T ) leapt 7.9 percent to 12,660 yen as news that Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) won one of its biggest aircraft orders raised expectations for increased demand for titanium metal, which is widely used in the aviation industry. After the market closed, Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG) ( 8316.T ), Japan's third-biggest bank, reported a 38 percent fall in half-year net profit on Wednesday, hurt by a lending slowdown and losses on its bond portfolio, and it stood by its full-year forecast for a decline of 17 percent.  Meanwhile, Konica Minolta dropped 3.4 percent to 1,681 yen on fears of share price dilution after said it would issue 70 billion yen in euroyen convertible bonds to raise cash for capital spending and bond redemption.
