 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. consumers were likely less upbeat by the end of November as the slowdown in the housing markets and the uncertainty over the economic outlook took their toll on sentiment. 

 The University of Michigan will release its final reading of the November consumer sentiment index at 10:00 am on Wednesday, ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday weekend. A Reuters poll of analysts expects to see the index ease slightly to 93.1 from the final October reading of 93.6. A reading of 93.1 would still be the highest since mid-2005. Gasoline prices have fallen from the record highs seen over the course of the summer to their lowest levels in six months and the recent erosion in crude oil prices bodes well for the energy-intensive winter months. However, the sharp slowdown in the pace of homebuilding, coupled with a decline in average house sale prices has brought the resilience of the U.S. economy into question. Consumer spending is starting to fade, especially when vehicle purchases are subtracted from the equation. Weakness in the University of Michigan sentiment index may not translate into weakness in retail sales. Unusually low interest rates of the past few years have weakened the relationship between consumer confidence gauges and spending patterns, and retailers will also benefit with the key holiday shopping season kicking off this week.
