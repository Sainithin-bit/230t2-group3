 PARIS  (Reuters) - Commodity-related stocks propelled European shares to 5-1/2 year highs on Wednesday after a jump in oil and copper prices, while mergers and acquisitions buoyed selected chemicals and financial stocks. 

 ICI ICI.L shares surged more than 8 percent after the British chemicals giant sold Quest International for 2.8 billion Swiss francs ($2.25 billion) to Swiss flavors and flagrances maker Givaudan ( GIVN.VX ). Givaudan gained 2.5 percent. Euronext ENXT.PA stock added 3.7 percent following NYSE's NYX.N 10 percent rally overnight, as investors interpreted a change in the terms of the exchanges' planned merger as the removal of one of the last obstacles in the way to completing the transatlantic tie-up. But fears of an earnings slowdown pushed Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) 3 percent lower. France's biggest retail bank posted a forecast-beating 12-percent rise in year-on-year third-quarter net profit but profits fell from previous quarters. "There are a couple of bright spots in the overall earnings mix but frankly I don't take much confidence out of these numbers," a dealer said. "I think you're at a big turning point in the story. The lion's share of the massive gains and relative outperformance have already been earned and I think the stock is going to struggle on this." By 0915 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares was up 0.4 percent at 1,474.22 points, after rising to 1,475.72, an intraday high last seen in May 2001. But trading volumes were lighter than usual ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Thursday. OIL STOCKS RISE Oil prices rose back above $60 a barrel, following an extended disruption to Alaskan crude exports, powering heavily weighted energy stocks Total ( TOTF.PA ) and BP ( BP.L ) 1 percent higher, while a rebound in copper prices gave a boost to miners BHP Billiton ( BLT.L ) and Anglo American ( AAL.L ). Technology shares .SX8P also stood out after U.S. personal computer maker Dell DELL.O comfortably beat analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings. A survey from research group Gartner predicting another year of strong growth for global sales of mobile phones in 2007 helped to lift Nokia NOK1V.DE 2.6 percent higher. Gartner estimated consumer demand next year at 1.1 billion handsets. Around Europe, London's FTSE 100  .FTSE , Paris's CAC 40  .FCHI  and Frankfurt's DAX  .GDAXI  each gained 0.4 percent. The Swiss Market Index  .SSMI  was up 0.3 percent in Zurich. The publication of the minutes from the November meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee at 0930 GMT, and of the University of Michigan's final November consumer sentiment index later in the day, top an investors' agenda otherwise dominated by corporate stories. "The November MPC minutes should reveal an implied tightening bias for UK interest rates ahead," Bear Stearns economist David Brown said in a note. (Additional reporting by  Lincoln Feast  in London)
