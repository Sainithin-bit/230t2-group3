 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Northwest Airlines Corp. NWACQ.PK said on Wednesday that its operations were "running smoothly and normally" after a disruption that occurred when the airline shifted some work from union-represented aircraft cleaners to a third party at its hub airport in Minneapolis. 

 The International Association of Machinists, which represents the workers, said the transition may have caused some operational delays but that there was no concerted job action by its members as had been reported by some media. "No strike is taking place at any Northwest Airlines location," the carrier said in a statement. An airline spokesman said the transition caused minor delays and the disruption has ended. The Wednesday before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday is one of the busiest travel days of the year. The transition of the cleaning duties to a third-party vendor had been agreed upon by the airline and the IAM as part of a cost-cutting measure by Northwest, which is restructuring in bankruptcy.
