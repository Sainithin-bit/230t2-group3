 LONDON  (Reuters) - Britain's FTSE 100 index  .FTSE  rose 0.3 percent in early trading on Wednesday as European and Asian bourses swept to multi-year highs and as ICI ICI.L leapt more than 9 percent on a sale of one of its units. 

 ICI shares climbed to their highest since March 2001 after Swiss flavors and fragrances maker Givaudan ( GIVN.VX ) said it agreed to acquire rival Quest International from the UK chemicals firm for 2.8 billion Swiss francs ($2.25 billion). The overall index was helped higher by rising global markets, with the MSCI world index .MSCIWD reaching a record high in early European trading. European stocks jumped to their highest in 5-1/2 years. "A rally on Wall Street off Tuesday's late-morning lows, combined with an upbeat performance in Asian markets overnight, should offer some upside," said Matt Buckland, a trader at CMC Markets. UK investors awaited the release at 0930 GMT of the minutes of the Bank of England's latest policymaking meeting for indications on future interest rate decisions. By 0840 GMT, the FTSE 100 index was up 20.2 points, or 0.3 percent, at 6,222.4. Dealers said trading volumes were thinning ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday. Oil and gas producers led the index, with BP ( BP.L ) and Shell ( RDSa.L ) both adding about 1 percent. Oil held above $60 a barrel on Wednesday, helped by expectations of a decline in fuel stocks in the United States. POSITIVE RESULTS Shares in Johnson Matthey ( JMAT.L ) rose 0.6 percent after rising platinum prices boosted first-half sales at the British precious metals refiner, which reported an 8-percent rise in first-half profit on Wednesday. "The results are bang in line with their expectations -- they've had a good run," said David Buik of Cantor Index. But Europe's biggest electricals retailer DSG International Plc DSGI.L dropped 4.9 percent after a trading update highlighted weak margins despite a 5 percent rise in first-half like-for-like sales. Shares that went ex-dividend also weighed on the index, taking 10.1 points off the FTSE 100, and included HSBC ( HSBA.L ), Next ( NXT.L ), Sainsbury ( SBRY.L ) Scottish Power SPW.L and Vodafone ( VOD.L ). Drug maker AstraZeneca ( AZN.L ) lost 0.8 percent after saying it expected 2006 earnings per share to be at the lower end of its $3.85 to $3.95 forecast range following the launch of a copycat version of its heart drug Toprol XL on Tuesday. The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker also said it had signed an agreement for Par Pharmaceuticals to distribute an authorized generic version of Toprol XL in the United States.
