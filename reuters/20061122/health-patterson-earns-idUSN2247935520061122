 NEW YORK  Nov 22  (Reuters) - Dental products maker
Patterson Cos. ( PDCO.O ) reported a higher quarterly profit on
Wednesday, narrowly beating Wall Street expectations, and its
shares rose 11 percent as an analyst upgraded the stock.  The company, which also sells veterinary and rehabilitation
supplies, posted a net profit of $48.2 million, or 35 cents per
share, for its fiscal second quarter ended Oct. 28, compared
with $44.7 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier.  That beat analysts' average earnings forecast by 1 cent per
share, according to Reuters Estimates.  Barrington Research raised its rating on Patterson shares
to "outperform" from "market perform," with analyst Derek
Leckow saying a return to mid-to-high-teens earnings growth
rates "appears achievable within the next six months."  Sales for the quarter rose 8 percent to $694 million, shy
of Wall Street forecasts of $699 million.  But FTN Midwest Securities analyst Ed Snyder in a research
note expressed confidence that growth in Patterson's dental
business was poised to accelerate.  "We expect the company's internal growth rate to reach
double digits by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, driven by
stronger dental equipment sales," Snyder said.  Sales of Patterson's largest dental business rose 7 percent
to $512 million for the quarter, while sales from its Webster
veterinary unit increased 15 percent to $95.4 million.  St. Paul, Minnesota-based Patterson forecast third-quarter
profit of 43 cents to 45 cents per share, including 1 cent a
share in stock compensation expense. Analysts expect 43 cents a
share.  The company reiterated its full-year fiscal 2007 earnings
forecast of $1.58 to $1.61 per share, or $1.54 to $1.57 after
about 4 cents of stock compensation expense.  Patterson shares were up $3.69 to $36.69 in afternoon trade
on Nasdaq.
