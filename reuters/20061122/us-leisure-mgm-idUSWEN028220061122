 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tracinda Corp., the investment firm controlled by billionaire Kirk Kerkorian, on Wednesday said it plans a tender offer for $825 million of stock of MGM Mirage Inc. ( MGM.N ), which would raise his stake in the hotel and casino company to as much as 61.7 percent. 

 Tracinda, which already owns 56.3 percent of the shares of Las Vegas-based MGM Mirage, said it would offer to buy up to 15 million more shares, or 5.3 percent of its shares outstanding, for $55 each. That is a 12 percent premium to MGM Mirage's closing price of $49 on Tuesday. The shares rose 7.8 percent to $52.80 -- an all-time high -- in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Tracinda, which Kerkorian has used as a vehicle to lobby for changes at auto maker General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), in which it holds a 9.9 percent stake, said in a statement that the tender offer "demonstrates our confidence in MGM Mirage and its management and our commitment to the company's future."
