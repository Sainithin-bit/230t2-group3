 SYDNEY/NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shares of copper producer Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. ( FCX.N ) jumped 5 percent in U.S. trading on rumors of a takeover bid by BHP Billiton Ltd/Plc ( BHP.AX )( BLT.L ), but analysts gave an offer low odds. 

 A deal for $11 billion Freeport would not be financially attractive enough for BHP, which has a number of big projects of its own under development, and there are also risks associated with Freeport's assets, they said. Freeport's Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia is a world class orebody, but faces operational and environmental problems reminiscent of the Ok Tedi copper mine in Papua New Guinea which BHP finally exited in 2002, they added. "I'd be a little surprised if BHP is queuing up, if only because they had a pretty bad experience with Ok Tedi and they've got a pretty full list of internal opportunities," said Daiwa analyst Mark Pervan. The project might also not meet BHP's acquisition criteria, said ABN AMRO analyst Rob Clifford. "If they were to buy Freeport at the current price on market copper price expectations, it would be earnings accretive over the next couple of years. But that's not what they look at. They look at long-term value. I suspect it may struggle," he said. BHP Billiton was also concentrating on increasing output at the giant Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine in outback Australia, and developing its Ravensthorpe nickel project, said Macquarie analyst John Moorhead. However, they said it was impossible to rule out a takeover in the current climate as global miners scramble to add reserves and try to capitalize on record-high metal prices. The speculation came only two days after Freeport itself agreed to buy much larger Phelps Dodge Corp. PD.N for $25.9 billion to create the world's largest publicly traded copper company. Shares in Freeport rose to $58.41 on Tuesday, valuing its offer for Phelps at $127.13 a share. That was up slightly from $126.46 a share when the companies announced the deal. Phelps shares, however, fell 2.4 percent to $117.60, indicating some investors believed it may be left at the altar. Traders said BHP Billiton, with a market capitalization of about $114 billion, was big enough to bid for Freeport-McMoRan, Phelps Dodge, or even both. If it was interested in Grasberg, it would likely bid before any Freeport/Phelps Dodge tie-up as the Phelps Dodge assets were of less interest, added Daiwa's Pervan. BHP Billiton shares rose 2.9 percent to A$26.43 in a firmer overall market on Wednesday, while rival Rio Tinto Ltd ( RIO.AX ) added 2.6 percent to A$74.44 on a bounce in metals prices. "We don't comment on market rumors and speculation," said BHP Billiton spokeswoman Samantha Evans. Freeport-McMoRan spokesman Bill Collier said: "We don't comment on rumors."
