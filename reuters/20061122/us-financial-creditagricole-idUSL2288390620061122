 PARIS  (Reuters) - Credit Agricole ( CAGR.PA ) showed a continued slowdown in profit growth and reported weaker-than-expected revenues on Wednesday that caused shares in France's biggest retail bank to fall more than 4 percent. 

 Gross operating profit during the third-quarter rose 19 percent to 1.29 billion euros as revenues rose 15 percent to 3.81 billion euros. Both these figures were below market forecasts. "The net profit came in ahead of consensus due to a low tax rate and low risk charges, but the operating number came in below our expectations with weak revenues at its asset management arm," said West LB analyst Christoph Bossmann. Credit Agricole was the biggest loser on France's benchmark CAC 40 index  .FCHI . The stock was down 4.3 percent at 32.8 euros by 0922 GMT. Credit Agricole said net profit rose 12 percent from a year ago to 1.15 billion euros ($1.47 billion), with earnings partly boosted by its acquisition of full control of Greek bank Emporiki. Fifteen analysts polled by Reuters gave an average net profit forecast of 1.12 billion euros. However, the third-quarter net profit fell from a second-quarter net profit of 1.28 billion euros and a first-quarter net profit of 1.39 billion euros. "Overall, not an impressive set of results, in our view," said broker Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Ltd, which cut its rating on Agricole to "market perform" from "outperform" and recommended switching out of Agricole into BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ). SLOWDOWN IN SECTOR Earlier this month, rival French banks BNP Paribas ( BNPP.PA ) and Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) reported a 25 percent and 12 percent rise in third-quarter net profit respectively but also showed a fall in profit from previous quarters this year. The investment banking divisions of leading European banks had a drop in trading volumes during the third-quarter as investors stayed away during the summer holiday season. Rising interest rates also hurt retail banks, such as Credit Agricole. As short-term rates have risen, long-term rates have remained low, flattening the gap between the two known as the yield curve. The flattened yield curve squeezes banks' net interest margin, which is the difference between what banks pay to borrow money and what they charge to lend it. Last month, Credit Agricole struck a $7.5 billion deal to buy more than 650 Italian bank branches, and the French bank remained upbeat over its prospects. "Credit Agricole's excellent performance since the start of the year, in parallel with the rapid implementation of the business development plan, confirms the group's strong growth potential," Chairman Rene Carron said in a statement. Chief Financial Officer Gilles de Margerie declined to comment on press reports that Agricole might bid for Turkey's Oyakbank, but reiterated that the French bank remained interested in the Turkish market. He also said the situation regarding Nextra, Credit Agricole's fund management venture with Italian bank Intesa BIN.MI, remained "open". French press reports have said Intesa might buy back Agricole's stake in Nextra. Based on latest prices, Credit Agricole shares have risen around 23 percent since the start of 2006, outperforming an 18 percent rise in the DJ Stoxx European bank sector .SX7P. The stock reached a record high of 36.15 euros last month. (additional reporting by Lincoln Feast)
