 HOUSTON  (Reuters) - Shares in Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) firmed in early Wednesday trade, boosted by its new restructuring and job cuts as the aluminum giant continued its push to trim costs and focus on more profitable businesses. 

 The shares climbed 2.1 percent, or 62 cents, to 29.81 per share in the opening minutes of trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Alcoa announced late on Tuesday it would slash its work force by about 10 percent, or 13,100 jobs, through plant closings and by spinning off one business through a joint venture. The moves are expected to yield cost savings of $125 million per year before taxes, or about 10 cents per share, according to analyst Chuck Bradford of Bradford Research. "It's a step in the right direction, but it's not a terribly big number," he said. The Pittsburgh company's plan to link its soft alloy extrusion business -- in which aluminum is molded into various shapes for products such as furniture - with Norway's Orkla ASA ( ORK.OL ) was also a positive move. That lower margin business "is probably not a place to be" for Alcoa, Bradford said. Shares in Alcoa have bounced sideways between $26 and $37 in 2006, and were up less than 1 percent so far this year including Wednesday's gains.
