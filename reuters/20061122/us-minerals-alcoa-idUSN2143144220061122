 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Aluminum producer Alcoa Inc. ( AA.N ) on Tuesday announced a restructuring of its product operations that will include plant closings and could ultimately result in a 10 percent reduction of its worldwide work force. 

 About 6,700 jobs will be cut in the next year and a further 6,400 jobs will be moved into a joint venture with Norway's Orkla ASA ( ORK.OL ) with the intent eventually to spin it off, the Pittsburgh-based company said. The restructuring program is expected to save $125 million per year before taxes, said Alcoa, which currently employs 129,000 people globally. Alcoa said it has a letter of intent with Orkla ASA's Sapa Group to form a joint venture to combine its soft alloy extrusion business -- in which aluminum is molded into various shapes for products such as furniture -- with Sapa's extruded aluminum business. The venture will be majority owned by Orkla and operated by Sapa and is expected to be set up by the end of the first quarter next year, subject to approvals. "There have been questions about the profitability of our downstream (product) operations, in particular soft alloy extrusion," spokesman Kevin Lowery told Reuters. "So we will be exiting that business through a joint venture." Alcoa's operations are split between upstream, such as bauxite mining and refining to produce aluminum, and downstream businesses that produce a variety of aluminum products for the aviation and automobile industries, as well as for food cans and kitchen wrap. The joint venture with Orkla will allow Alcoa to focus on better-performing downstream businesses. "Our overall downstream operations have continued to improve their financial performance the past few years," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Alain Belda. He noted that flat-rolled product segments have grown 14 percent annually since 2002 and are in a strong position to capture further growth in China and Russia. Also Alcoa Howmet and Alcoa Fastening Systems have improved profitability by more than 60 percent in the past year, Belda said. Alcoa said it will have restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of between $375 million and $425 million after tax. The company also will recognize an $85 million to $95 million after-tax gain in discontinued operations in the fourth quarter from its sale of its Home Exteriors business on October 31. As part of the review of its overall downstream operations, Alcoa plans a targeted restructuring program to further increase efficiency and profitability. The restructuring will include some plant closings and consolidations that will affect about 6,700 positions during the next year. In the flat rolled products business, the restructuring of can sheet operations will result in the elimination of some 320 positions, including the closure of the Swansea can sheet facility in Wales. Restructuring of the hard alloy extrusion production operations serving the aerospace, automotive and industrial products markets, will result in approximately 370 positions being eliminated in the United States and Europe. In the automotive and light vehicle wire harness and component operations, the manufacturing operations of the AFL Seixal plant in Portugal will close and restructuring of the AFL light vehicle and component operations in the United States and Mexico will affect more than 4,800 positions, Alcoa said. The consolidation of selected operations in global packaging production will eliminate approximately 470 positions, while reduction in the global primary metals and alumina operations will affect about 330 positions. In January 2005, Alcoa said it was exploring streamlining its operations as a result of the company's new global business structure. The plans called for the reduction of about 2,000 positions during the year. (Additional reporting by Leonard Anderson)
