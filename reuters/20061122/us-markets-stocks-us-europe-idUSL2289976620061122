 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks look set to open higher on Wednesday as technology shares could be boosted by Dell's DELL.O better-than-expected third-quarter results, while investors awaited key U.S. macro economic data. 

 A day before the Thanksgiving holiday in the United States, investors will focus on the final November reading of Michigan's consumer sentiment index at 1500 GMT and weekly initial jobless claims at 1330 GMT. "Ahead of the holiday I expect very little volume in the markets," Roland Hirschmueller from Baader brokerage said. "The only big surprise were Dell's preliminary results overnight, and because of this I expect slightly better markets today," Hirschmueller said. By 1031 GMT, U.S. stock futures SPc1 DJc1 NDc1 were all indicated between 0.1 and 0.2 percent higher. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  edged up 0.04 percent on Tuesday. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was up 0.16 percent at 1,402.81, while the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 0.09 percent to 2,454.84. Shares in aircraft maker Boeing ( BA.N ) and Web search leader Google ( GOOG.O ) rose to record highs on Tuesday, outweighing rising oil prices. Shares in Dell Inc., the world's second-largest personal computer maker, jumped 9.5 percent after the close on Tuesday as it reported earnings per share that exceeded Wall Street's average estimate, though revenue was short of expectations. "This will boost the technology sector today," Hirschmueller said. The oil price slipped just below $59 on Wednesday after big gains in previous sessions and before U.S. inventory data forecast to show a further rise in crude inventories. "The oil market is overall well-balanced," Hirschmueller said. "And unless there is any unexpected news it will stay that way," he added.
