 LONDON  (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's monetary policy should remain accommodative for some time yet, Chicago Federal Reserve President Charles Evans was quoted on Wednesday as saying. 

 "While I'm very pleased at the improvements in the economy I think it's going to continue to be a while before we're safely past these conditions," Evans, a voter on the Fed's policy-setting panel this year and a consistent policy "dove," told the Financial Times in an interview Evans said last week that the U.S. economy still needs the Federal Reserve's super-easy monetary policy, but that the recovery may be strong enough by June that the central bank will not need to extend its current $600 billion bond-buying program. The FT said he reiterated that the United States was still caught in a "liquidity trap" and that inflation was still very low and policy should stay loose until such risks abated. "The message that comes out of what I think of as high-quality research on this subject is that policy ought to remain accommodative for really quite a while, even a while after conditions start to improve," the FT quoted him as saying on Wednesday.
