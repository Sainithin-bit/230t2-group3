 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Air Force may announce as early as Thursday whether Boeing Co or Europe's EADS has won a projected $35 billion contract for 179 new refueling planes, a senior defense official said. 

 No final decision on the timing of the long-awaited contract announcement had been made, said the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record. "It could be this week, it could be as early as Thursday," said the official on Tuesday. Defense consultant Loren Thompson said the announcement would come after U.S. financial markets closed, and predicted that EADS would win the deal with its A330-based plane. Analysts widely expect the losing bidder to file a protest against the decision with the Government Accountability Office, the arm of Congress which rules on federal contract disputes. Pentagon acquisition chief Ashton Carter declined to make any comment on the issue at a speech in Washington on Tuesday evening, saying that the contract was "in source selection." The high-stakes contest has fanned transatlantic tensions and jockeying among U.S. lawmakers eager to bring jobs to their states. Boeing and EADS submitted final bids earlier this month. An award would mark another pivotal moment in a saga that began almost a decade ago. The Air Force has tried since 2001 to begin replacing its Boeing-built KC-135 tankers that now average more than 50 years old. An initial $23.5 billion plan to lease and then buy 100 modified Boeing 767s as tankers, fell apart in 2004. EADS, partnered with Northrop Grumman Corp, won a 179-plane deal in February 2008, only to have it canceled after government auditors upheld parts of a protest by Boeing. The Pentagon's inspector general, Gordon Heddell, last week said he saw no need to further investigate a data mix-up in the competition and that the evidence showed the release of sensitive data to the wrong companies was inadvertent and not a violation of federal law. Pentagon Comptroller Robert Hale last week told reporters that the Air Force was requesting an initial amount of nearly $900 million for the tanker program in fiscal 2012, and expected to award a contract in "a month or so."
