 Brazil works hard to increase trade with Africa. Here's a look at the big players: 

 * Mining giant Vale is to invest a total of $15-20 billion in Africa within the next five years with most of the money spent in Mozambique, Zambia, Guinea and Liberia. The aim is to become the third-biggest copper producer on the continent. Total investment in Africa so far is about $2.5 billion but as most of the projects are in the exploration phase, there is a chance to significantly increase investment. *Infrastructure firm Odebrecht operates in Angola, Lybia, Liberia, Mozambique and Ghana and has also completed projects in Congo, Botswana, South Africa, Gabon and Djibouti. In 2009, Africa accounted for $2.427 billion in revenues for the group, or about 10 percent of its earnings. *Oil company Petrobras plans to invest some $3 billion in Africa from now until 2013, mainly in Angola and Nigeria. Following 2009 discoveries of huge reserves far below ultra-deep waters off the Brazilian coast, some experts believe similar deposits may exist along the West African coast. In Nigeria the company operates one block and is a non-operating partner in two others. *Agriculture is one of the main areas of technical cooperation with Africa. Brazil provides technical assistance to the cotton sector in Benin, Burkina-Faso, Chad and Mali through EMBRAPA, a state agricultural research institute. In 2008, Brazil opened an EMBRAPA office in Accra to facilitate the transfer of agricultural technology from Brazil to Africa.
