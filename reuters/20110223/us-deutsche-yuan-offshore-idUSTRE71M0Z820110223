 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Daily trading volume in the offshore yuan spot market will nearly double to $1 billion by the end of the year, Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday. 

 Trade settlement in yuan has jumped and deposits have soared since landmark reforms taken by authorities last July to promote Hong Kong as the offshore trading hub. Trading volumes would rise sharply as more trade is settled in yuan, Jens Scharff-Hansen, co-head of FX trading for Deutsche Bank ( DBKGn.DE ) in Asia, said at a briefing to launch its Web-based electronic trading platform. "Having one billion by the end of this year, I think, is quite conservative. I actually think that it's going to be beyond that," Scharff-Hansen told reporters. He added that the bank's forecast for yuan appreciation versus the dollar for 2011 was 3.5 to 4 percent. Beijing has only allowed the yuan to edge up 0.2 percent so far this year. Deutsche's move to launch an electronic, web-based trading platform for offshore yuan comes on the heels of other platforms by banks such as HSBC ( HSBA.L ) ( 0005.HK ) and companies such as Thomson Reuters Corp ( TRI.N ) ( TRI.TO ) and ICAP-owned EBS. ICAP.L Yuan deposits in Hong Kong have quadrupled to $315 billion at the end of December from a year earlier. (Reporting by Emma Ashburn; Editing by Kim Coghill)
