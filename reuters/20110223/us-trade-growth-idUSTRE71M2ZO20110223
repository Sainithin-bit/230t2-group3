 GENEVA  (Reuters) - World trade volumes exceeded pre-crisis levels for the first time in December, and global trade expanded by a record 15.1 percent in the whole of 2010, the Dutch CPB economic institute said on Wednesday. 

 The data were further evidence of a buoyant global economy, with the full-year expansion in trade more than compensating for a 13.0 percent contraction in 2009 in the wake of the financial crisis, it said in its monthly world trade monitor. (Reporting by  Jonathan Lynn )
