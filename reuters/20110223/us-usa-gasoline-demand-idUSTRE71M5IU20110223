 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retail gasoline demand rose last week as much of the country thawed out from weeks of winter storms, MasterCard Advisors' SpendingPulse report showed on Wednesday. 

 Average gasoline demand climbed 4.5 percent to 8.847 million barrels-per-day in the week to February 18. Year-over-year, demand increased by 0.8 percent, the sixth consecutive weekly rise this year. Over the latest four weeks, U.S. gasoline consumption rose by 2.5 percent year-over-year. Retail gasoline prices rose 2 cents last week to $3.15, the highest price seen since October 2008 and 21.2 percent higher than a year ago, MasterCard said. MasterCard Advisors estimates retail gasoline demand based on aggregate sales activity in the MasterCard payments system coupled with estimates for all other payment forms including cash and checks.
