 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase executive Timothy Ryan has withdrawn from consideration to become the U.S. Treasury Department's top international official, the White House said on Thursday. 

 "He withdrew himself from this opportunity for personal reasons," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said. In February, the White House named Ryan as the nominee to become under secretary for international affairs, succeeding Tim Adams who had announced earlier that he was resigning to spend more time with his family. Adams' last day at the Treasury will be Friday, April 27, according to a Treasury official. Clay Lowery, the assistant secretary for international affairs, likely would handle the portfolio until another successor to Adams is named and confirmed by lawmakers. Ryan, a widely experienced banker, was reportedly the choice of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to take over the under secretary's post. His nomination had not yet formally gone to the Senate, which must approve candidates for the high-level job, so as a result it did not have to be withdrawn and it was Ryan's decision to remove himself from the running. Ryan, 61, had experience from his service in the administration of former President George H.W. Bush, where he was credited with having played a key role in the cleanup after the savings and loan crisis in the early 1990s. Ryan was director of the Office of Thrift Supervision from April 1990 until early December 1992, a position that made him effectively the lead manager in the extensive overhaul of the industry after dozens of savings and loans collapsed. Earlier in his career, Ryan was director of the Resolution Trust Corp. and was a director of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. From 1983 to 1990, Ryan was a partner in the Washington office of law firm Reed, Smith, Shaw and McClay. The post of under secretary for international affairs at Treasury is a sensitive one. It covers a range of topics from encouraging reform at global institutions like the International Monetary Fund to pushing China to speed up its move toward a more flexible currency. Paulson has made China his number one priority, and is trying to build his own team to apply expertise to Treasury's efforts to persuade China to make the reforms it needs to support a gradual move toward a fully market-driven currency value that might help correct imbalances stemming from the United States' huge trade deficit. Earlier this year, Paulson announced that Alan Holmer, a former pharmaceuticals industry lobbyist, will lead Treasury's strategic economic dialogue with China. The second session of the dialogue is to be held in Washington on May 23-24 with a large delegation to top Chinese officials expected to participate.
