 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - American Express Co. ( AXP.N ) said on Thursday that quarterly profit rose 21 percent, as the fourth-largest U.S. credit card company cut marketing costs. 

 Results beat expectations, but the company's shares rose just 0.3 percent in after-hours trading amid concerns that lower marketing expenditures might hurt future revenue. The company said it cut back marketing costs in anticipation of higher credit losses and interest costs in the first part of 2007, but revenue growth was stronger than it expected. "Looking back on the quarter...we probably overflexed our cost control muscles too much," said Dan Henry, acting chief financial officer at American Express. The New York-based company said net income in the first quarter rose to $1.1 billion, or 87 cents a share, from $873 million, or 69 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Analysts' average estimate was 79 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue, net of interest expense, rose 10 percent to $6.67 billion. Credit quality was not as bad as some investors had feared -- about 4 percent of annualized managed credit card loans globally were written off, up from 3 percent a year earlier. Historically, American Express' write-offs have hovered in the 4 percent area, said Sanjay Sakhrani, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York. Other credit card issuers have also moved closer to their historical loss averages this week. Interest expense rose 44 percent to $963 million. The company had used derivatives to lock in low funding costs, but those transactions expired late last year. Without those derivatives, interest expense will rise about $200 million over the next three quarters, Henry said. Henry became acting CFO after Gary Crittenden left to take the same job last month at Citigroup Inc. ( C.N ) CREDIT NOT SO BAD Credit card issuers including JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) Citigroup Inc., ( C.N ) Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and Capital One Financial Corp. ( COF.N ) have reported higher first-quarter card writeoffs this week, after unusually low losses in the first quarter of 2006 following stricter bankruptcy legislation. But writeoffs on the whole seem to be within or below historical averages, analysts have said. At American Express, total cards in force rose 10 percent to 79.9 million from last year's first quarter. Average basic cardmember spending rose 8 percent to $2,817 in the quarter. American Express now trades at about 15.4 times expected 2008 earnings. But if the company grows fast enough in coming quarters, that multiple could approach its historical average of 19 times, KBW's Sakhrani said. In after-hours trading, American Express shares rose 15 cents to $59.10. They have fallen nearly 3 percent this year, while the Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Finance index .DJUSSF is little changed.
