 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N, the world's largest brokerage, posted a higher-than-expected increase in first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by a 42 percent increase in trading revenues. 

 The company's shares edged higher even as the broader market declined. Merrill Lynch has been boosting its commitment to areas like trading and private equity for several years, to catch up to rivals like Goldman Sachs Group Inc. ( GS.N ) "The investments Merrill Lynch has made to diversify its franchise have clearly paid off," said analyst Joseph Dickerson of Atlantic Equities in London. Merrill joined Citigroup, ( C.N ) JPMorgan Chase, ( JPM.N ) and investment banks that include Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LEH.N and Goldman Sachs in turning in strong trading results in recent weeks despite rising subprime mortgage defaults. Merrill Lynch's quarterly net income rose to $2.2 billion, or $2.26 a share, from $475 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier, when the company booked about $1.2 billion in after-tax compensation expenses. Excluding those expenses, earnings rose nearly 31 percent. The latest results beat the analysts' average forecast by 29 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net revenue rose 24 percent to $9.85 billion. Analysts on average had expected $9 billion. Revenue from stock and bond trading, including products like commodities and stock options, jumped 42 percent to $5.2 billion. Merrill cited strength in areas including commodities, credit products, currencies and equity-linked products. Revenue from mortgage-related products declined, but that area accounted for less than 1 percent of total net revenue over the last five quarters. Investment banking revenues rose 47 percent to $1.4 billion, helped by a 55 percent increase in merger advisory revenue. Global wealth management net revenue rose 16 percent to $3.4 billion. The first quarter 2007 figures include results from BlackRock, ( BLK.N ) the asset manager that last year bought Merrill's investment management business in exchange for a stake in the combined company. REASONABLY PRICED In morning New York Stock exchange trading, Merrill's shares rose 53 cents to $91.19. The stock trades at about 10.7 times Merrill's expected 2008 earnings, below its historical average of about 11.6 times, said Jim Huguet, president of Great Companies LLC in Tampa, Florida, which does not own the company's shares. There may be some room for Merrill Lynch's multiple to expand closer to its historical average, Huguet added, but the shares are more or less reasonably priced. At Wednesday's close, Merrill Lynch shares had fallen more than 2 percent this year, compared with a 3 percent increase in the Amex Securities Broker-Dealer index .XBD (Additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
