 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) said on Thursday President and Chief Executive H. Lee Scott earned $23.03 million in the year ended in January. 

 In its proxy statement, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Wal-Mart said Scott earned $1.3 million in base salary, which was unchanged from a year earlier. Scott also received an incentive payment of $4.3 million linked to company performance, $17.02 million in stock and options awards and $731,070 from changes to his pension plan and other compensation, including personal use of the corporate jet. The world's largest retailer also said Scott's base salary for the current year, fiscal 2008, would be $1.4 million, which it said was near the median salary in a retail industry survey. Wal-Mart also disclosed 11 shareholder proposals -- on topics ranging from health care and executive compensation to labor standards and social responsibility -- which will be voted on at the June 1 annual shareholders' meeting in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Those proposals include a request the board of directors' compensation committee evaluate senior executive compensation packages to determine whether they are excessive. Shareholders also want a report that includes a comparison between top executives' compensation and that of "our company's lowest paid workers" and "the rationale justifying this trend." Shareholders, citing a pending gender discrimination lawsuit at Wal-Mart, also requested a report documenting the distribution of equity compensation broken down by recipients' race and gender and a report that looks at "the negative social and reputational impacts" of reported cases of noncompliance with international labor organization standards. Critics have long accused Wal-Mart of paying its employees poverty-level wages, offering inadequate health care and subverting employees' efforts to unionize.
