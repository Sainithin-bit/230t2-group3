 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Movie theater company AMC Entertainment Inc., formerly known as Marquee Holdings Inc., on Thursday set its planned initial public offering at 39.47 million shares for an estimated price of $18 to $20 each. 

 Stockholders are selling all of the shares in the IPO, and AMC will not receive any proceeds from the offering, according to an amended filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. For the year ended March 30, 2006, the company reported a net loss of $216.2 million on $1.69 billion in revenue. As of December 28, AMC owned, operated or held interests in 382 theaters with a total of 5,340 screens, about 87 percent of which were located in the United States and Canada. Assuming an offering price of $19 per share, the midpoint of the range, the Kansas City, Missouri-based company will have an initial market capitalization of $2.78 billion. AMC said Goldman Sachs & Co., Citi, Deutsche Bank Securities, and JPMorgan were the lead underwriters for the  IPO. The underwriters have the option to buy an additional 5.9 million shares of common stock. AMC intends to list its stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AC." AC.N
