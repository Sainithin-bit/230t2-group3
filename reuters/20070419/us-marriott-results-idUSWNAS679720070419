 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Marriott International Inc. MAR.N, the top U.S. hotel operator, said on Thursday quarterly profit nearly tripled, helped by higher room rates, but the company lowered its outlook for full-year room revenue and shares fell 5.7 percent. 

 Marriott, which mostly manages hotels rather than owning them, slightly raised its profit forecast for the year, but said North American revenue per available room (revpar) -- a key measure of health in the industry -- would increase by 6 percent to 8 percent, down from its previous forecast for growth 7 percent to 9 percent. First quarter net income increased to $182 million, or 44 cents per share, from $61 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. Net income in the year-ago quarter was reduced by 25 cents per share due to losses caused by a change in the way it accounts for timeshare deals. The company, which operates hotels under brands such as Marriott, Ritz-Carlton and Fairfield Inn, reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of 40 cents per share, beating Wall Street analysts' forecast of 38 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Adjusted earnings exclude the impact of Marriott's synthetic fuel business. "As the first major hotel company to report, Marriott's results may serve as a wake-up call that trends on the top-line are deteriorating," Goldman Sachs analyst Steven Kent said in a research note. Marriott said revenue rose 7 percent to $2.9 billion, helped by higher management and franchise fees. Analysts had expected $2.75 billion. Revenue per available room rose 6.6 percent at the company's comparable properties worldwide and 5.2 percent in North America, driven by an increase in rates. Marriott expects revpar to increase 7 percent to 9 percent at comparable hotels worldwide in 2007 and it expects a gain toward the lower end of the 6 percent to 8 percent range in second-quarter North American revpar. It forecast earnings per share, excluding its synthetic fuel operations, for the second quarter of 51 cents to 55 cents, compared with analysts' average forecast of 49 cents. For the full year, Marriott forecast earnings per share on the same basis of $1.84 to $1.94, up 2 cents from its earlier outlook. Analysts expect it to post a profit of $1.90. The forecast comes at a time when growth is slowing in limited-service hotels and secondary markets in the United States, leading some investors to worry the lodging industry's multiyear boom might be losing steam. Hotel operators such as Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. ( HOT.N ) and Hilton Hotels Corp. HLT.N, which have a disproportionate exposure to urban markets, will probably post stronger revpar growth numbers, Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Robert LaFleur said. "I don't think we are going to see any material decrease in the outlook for the lodging industry," LaFleur said. Shares of Marriott were down $2.94, or 5.7 percent, to $48.93 early on the New York Stock Exchange.
