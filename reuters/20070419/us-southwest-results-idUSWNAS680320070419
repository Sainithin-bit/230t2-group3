 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co. ( LUV.N ), the leading U.S. discount carrier, said on  Thursday it posted higher first-quarter earnings but that its jet fuel hedges are gradually unwinding. 

 Net profit for the largest U.S. airline by market value rose to $93 million, or 12 cents per share, from $61 million, or 4 cents per share, in the same period last year. However, economic net income fell 48 percent to $33 million, or 4 cents per share, from $64 million, or 8 cents per share, a year earlier.
