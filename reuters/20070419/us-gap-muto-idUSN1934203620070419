 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Gap Inc. ( GPS.N ) on Thursday named Gary Muto, a 19-year veteran at the apparel retailer, as president of Gap Adult and GapBody, the latest senior executive change at the company intended to help reinvigorate merchandise to better appeal to consumers. 

 Muto, 47, most recently led Gap's Forth & Towne chain of stores, which the company said in February it would close. In his new role, which he will assume effective immediately, he will report to Marka Hansen, president of Gap North America, who was named in February. Tom Wyatt, who previously led GapBody, will become president of Gap's outlet division, focusing on Gap Outlet and Banana Republic Factory Stores. Since the recent announcement of the closure of Forth & Towne, many analysts have wondered whether there would be a new role at the company for Muto, who is respected by retail experts as a talented merchant. After joining the company in 1988, Muto became president of Banana Republic, the company's more upscale chain, in 2001. He became president of Gap brand a year later before launching the Forth & Towne chain, which was intended to appeal to women over age 35. Muto's new position is the latest in a series of senior management changes at the San Francisco-based company, the world's largest apparel retailer, which is still searching for a new chief executive after the January ouster of CEO Paul Pressler. The company is trying to reinvigorate its casual clothing in order to revive sales, which have been sluggish for over two years amid what analysts characterized as uninspiring merchandise and intense competition. Muto's predecessor at Gap Adult, Denise Johnston, left the company in January after serving since April of 2006. Shares of Gap closed at $18.54 on the New York Stock Exchange and rose 6 cents in after-hours trade. (Additional reporting by  Nichola Groom )
