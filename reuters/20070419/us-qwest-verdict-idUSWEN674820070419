 DENVER  (Reuters) - Joseph Nacchio, the former chief executive of Qwest Communications International Inc. ( Q.N ), was found guilty on Thursday of insider trading on stock sales worth millions of dollars in April and May of 2001. 

 Prosecutors had accused Nacchio, who was also acquitted of some charges, of selling Qwest shares in 2001 after company insiders warned him that the phone carrier could not meet its financial forecasts. Each of the indictment's 42 counts correlated with individual stock sales.
