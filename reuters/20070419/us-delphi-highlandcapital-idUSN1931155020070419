 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Hedge fund Highland Capital Management is interested in making another offer for auto parts maker Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Thursday. 

 Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, rejected a $4.7 billion bid by Highland earlier this year, choosing instead an offer from a group led by Appaloosa Management and Cerberus Capital Management. Highland, which is based in Dallas, wrote to Delphi on Wednesday, expressing its interest in making another offer, the Journal reported, citing unnamed sources and a draft of the letter. Delphi is interested in knowing more about Highland's potential offer but wants to be convinced the hedge fund can sway the UAW, the paper said. Highland Capital and Delphi could not immediately be reached for comment.
