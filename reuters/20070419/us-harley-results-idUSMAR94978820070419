 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc. ( HOG.N ) reported lower quarterly earnings on Thursday, hurt by a strike at a key plant, but results were better than expected and sent the motorcycle maker's shares up 3 percent. 

 First-quarter profit fell to $192.3 million, or 74 cents a share, from $234.6 million, or 86 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 8.3 percent to $1.18 billion. Even so, the results were better than expected, thanks in part to higher average selling prices, which rose, on average, 4 percent to $13,000. Analysts, on average, had expected the Milwaukee-based company to earn 72 cents a share on sales of $1.10 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Harley said the number of motorcycles shipped tumbled 14.8 percent during the quarter to 67,761 due to a three-week strike in February at its largest plant, in York, Pennsylvania, where its popular Touring and Softail bikes are assembled. But that was a better shipment number than the company had forecast in the strike's wake. Earnings per share "exceeded post-strike expectations as shipments finished above guidance" and average selling prices rose, Craig Kennison, an analyst at R.W. Baird, said in a note to investors. Harley expects to ship between 94,000 and 97,000 motorcycles in the second quarter, up strongly from the first quarter. While total retail sales fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter, pulled down by a 5.9 percent decline in the United States, sales in international markets grew 16.5 percent. Sales overseas were strong almost everywhere except Japan, where they fell 7.7 percent. "We never like to see a retail sales decline," Jim Ziemer, Harley-Davidson chief executive, said in a statement, "but first-quarter sales are not necessarily indicative of sales for the full year." Ziemer said the company expects "positive worldwide retail sales growth for 2007," and earnings per share growth of 4 percent to 6 percent, accelerating to between 11 percent and 17 percent in 2008 and 2009. Harley-Davidson shares were up $1.90 to $63.16 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange after rising as high as $64.26 earlier in the session.
