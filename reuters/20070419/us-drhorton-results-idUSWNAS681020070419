 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc. ( DHI.N ), the largest U.S. home builder, said on Thursday quarterly earnings fell 85 percent, in part due to charges related to the lower value of land. 

 For the fiscal second quarter that ended March 31, D.R. Horton earned $51.7 million, or 16 cents per share, down from $352.8 million, or $1.11 per share, a year earlier. The Fort Worth, Texas-based builder said results included charges totaling $81.2 million, or 16 cents per share for land options forfeited and for the lower value of inventory of land and houses it owns. Excluding the land and inventory-related charges, Horton would have reported earnings of 32 cents per share, short of the 36 cents that was the average of analysts' forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates. "Market conditions in the home-building industry continue to be challenging in most of our markets as inventory levels of both new and existing homes remain high, and further increases in the use of sales incentives continue to put pressure on profit margins," Chairman Donald Horton said in a statement. During the quarter, Horton closed on the sale of 9,792 homes, down 22 percent from the prior year. Home-building revenue sank 26 percent, to $2.62 billion. The downturn in the U.S. housing market has hit home builders and related sectors hard, and tightened loan policies due to the subprime mortgage crisis have only exacerbated the industry's pain. Last month, Chief Executive Donald Tomnitz said he expected the industry's pricing power to return by January and that 2008 would be somewhat better than 2007. Earlier in April, Horton reported net sales orders fell 37 percent to 9,983 homes, and the dollar value of the orders sank 41 percent, to $2.6 billion. It also said that prospective buyers canceled at a 32 percent rate from January to March, down from 33 percent in the prior quarter, but above the usual 16 to 20 percent rate. First-time home buyers account for about 40 percent of D.R. Horton's sales. It operates in 27 U.S. states and builds homes with sales prices ranging from $90,000 to more than $900,000. Shares of D.R. Horton closed up 2.63 percent on Wednesday at $23.04. Horton shares are off 13 percent this year, in line with the Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index .DJUSHB.
