 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A sharp drop in classified advertising sales brought on by free Internet listings and a cooling real estate market helped push U.S. newspaper publishers' quarterly financial results lower on Thursday. 

 Gannett Co. Inc. ( GCI.N ), New York Times Co. ( NYT.N ) and Journal Register Co. JRC.N reported a drop in first-quarter revenue and profit, while Tribune Co. TRB.N and Media General Inc. ( MEG.N ) posted a loss. "The theme here is severe, almost unprecedented declines in classified advertising, particularly real estate and auto," Benchmark Co. analyst Ed Atorino said. The Times, Tribune and Media General posted results ahead of analyst forecasts, according to Reuters Estimates, while Gannett and Journal Register narrowly missed expectations. Newspaper shares fell in morning trading, with the Times taking the biggest drop at nearly 2.5 percent. Tough economic conditions in some U.S. regions, as well as slowing home sales and winter storms hurt classified sales, publishers said. But beyond that, the industry still is reeling from sites such as Craigslist.org that offer free classifieds. Newspapers are making deals with companies such as Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) and Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) to expand their advertising reach, and online sales are rising as a result. But they still form only about 10 percent or less of total revenue. Still, the results were close to analysts' expectations. "I don't think this is some kind of death knell," Atorino said. "The numbers were in line with some of the low expectations." POOR WEATHER AND AUTO WOES Gannett cited severe winter storms in parts of the United States for curtailing ad spending during the quarter as well as a weak real estate market. Net income fell to $210.6 million, or 90 cents a share, from $235.3 million, or 99 cents a share, last year. Revenue fell to $1.87 billion from $1.88 billion a year ago. U.S. newspaper pro forma ad revenue fell 4.8 percent, while at USA Today it fell 7.9 percent. Journal Register cited difficult economic conditions in Michigan, where it publishes several papers, particularly as the auto industry based there overhauls its business. Ad revenue fell 6.9 percent to $86.4 million. Tribune, which swung to a loss on special charges, saw ad revenue fall 6 percent, with classified ad revenue down 14 percent. Especially hard hit were South Florida and Orlando, with real estate down 15 percent, help-wanted down 14 percent and auto revenue down 16 percent. "Tribune's first-quarter results were largely in line with our expectations and highlight continued newspaper softness," Morgan Stanley analyst Lisa Monaco wrote in a note to clients. Tribune is going private in an $8.2 billion deal involving Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell. The New York Times did not offer details on quarterly classified ad performance, but in a separate statement it said sales weakened in March, the last month of the quarter. Media General, which publishes the Tampa Tribune, also saw poorer results in Florida, though its Richmond Times Dispatch paper in Virginia saw a 2.8 percent increase in revenue on higher average rates and real estate linage. Overall Media General classified sales fell 13.8 percent. Gannett shares fell 56 cents to $57.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Journal Register shares rose 10 cents to $6.01. Media General shares fell 19 cents to $38.90. New York Times shares fell 38 cents to $24.18 and Tribune shares rose 2 cents to $32.71.
