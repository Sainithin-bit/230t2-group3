 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Sunglasses maker Oakley Inc. OO.N said on Thursday that first quarter net profit tripled, beating analysts' estimates, as results were helped by a 31 percent rise in sales and an income tax benefit. 

 The company also raised its 2007 earnings guidance. Oakley, which has streamlined its business to focus mainly on sunglasses, said first quarter net profit was $5.7 million, or 8 cents per share, compared with $1.9 million, or 3 cents per share a year earlier. Sales rose to $199.2 million from $151.7 million a year ago, the Foothill Ranch, California-based company said. Wall Street, on average, had been expecting earnings per share of 3 cents on sales of $182.7 million, according to Reuters Estimates. Oakley has been acquiring eyewear businesses since 2006 to beef up its portfolio of brands and increase its number of stores. The company bought upscale eyewear brand Oliver Peoples and retailer The Optical Shop of Aspen last year. Earlier this year it acquired Eyewear Safety Systems, a company that makes protective eyewear for the military, firefighters and law enforcement. In a statement, Oakley said that its acquisition of Australian retail chain Bright Eyes had been completed. First quarter results included a 1 cent-per-share benefit related to an income tax refund. The company increased its full-year earnings outlook to a range of 95 cents to 98 cents per share, due to the income tax refund benefit. Earlier this year, Oakley had said it expected 2007 earnings to range between 94 cents to 97 cents a share on revenue of $900 million to $930 million. Shares of Oakley closed at $22.39 on the New York Stock Exchange and rose 15 cents in extended trade.
