 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc. MER.N, the 
world's largest brokerage, said on Thursday that first-quarter 
earnings jumped, helped by a surge in trading revenues. 

  Net income rose to $2.2 billion, or $2.26 a share, from 
$475 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier, when the 
company booked about $1.2 billion in after-tax compensation 
expenses.  Excluding those expenses, first-quarter earnings rose 
nearly 31 percent.  Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates on average expected 
earnings of $1.97 a share before special items.  Net revenue rose 24 percent to $9.85 billion, helped by a 
42 percent increase in fixed income and equity trading.  Analysts had on average expected revenue of $9 billion, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Merrill Lynch shares have fallen more than 2 percent this 
year, compared with a 3 percent increase in the Amex Securities 
Broker-Dealer index .XBD
