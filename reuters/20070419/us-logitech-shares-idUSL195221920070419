 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Shares in Logitech ( LOGN.S ) ( LOGI.O ), the world's largest maker of computer mice, fell on Thursday after a drop in Web camera sales caused the group to miss its full-year sales target. 

 Sales for the full year rose 15 percent to $2.07 billion, missing a target of a 17 percent rise, after sales of Web cameras dropped 32 percent year-on-year in the last three months of the reporting year, which ends on March 31. "We expect by the second half of the 2007/08 (fiscal year) this (Web camera) category can come back to double digit growth," Chief Executive Officer Guerrino De Luca told Reuters in an interview. By 0805 GMT, shares in the group had fallen more than 7 percent to 31.70 Swiss francs ($26.29) per share. The group planned to market its products better and increase in-store activities to boost sales of web cameras in the coming quarters, Guerrino said in a statement. The group posted full-year net income, according to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) of $230 million and its GAAP gross margin was 34.5 percent. "While Logitech failed to deliver the promised top-line growth, all other metrics were up to or even exceeded expectations," said Vontobel analyst Michael Foeth. "We see no major changes to our earnings per share estimates and would view a negative share price reaction as a buying opportunity," he said. Looking ahead, Logitech said it backed its earlier goals of a 15 percent growth in sales and operating income for fiscal year 2008. Gross margin is expected to be at the high end of the company's long-term target range of 32 percent to 34 percent. In a Reuters poll of nine analysts, the average estimate for full-year net profit was $229.1 million. (Additional reporting by Peter Maushagen)
