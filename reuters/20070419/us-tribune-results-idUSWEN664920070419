 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tribune Co. TRB.N, which is going private in an $8.2 billion buyout, reported a quarterly loss on Thursday as its daily newspapers coped with a continuing drop in advertising sales. 

 The company posted a first-quarter loss of $15.6 million, or 6 cents a share, compared with a profit of $102.8 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 4.3 percent to $1.21 billion. Tribune owns some of the most prominent U.S. newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, the Sun in Baltimore, Maryland, and the Hartford Courant in Connecticut. It also owns television stations in several major markets. Tribune has accepted a buyout bid from Chicago real estate magnate Sam Zell that will give investors $34 a share and restructure the company under an employee stock ownership plan. Zell will have the option to get 40 percent of the company. It accepted Zell's plan after taking flack from shareholders who were upset with a fall in the company's stock price during the past few years because of a steady decline in ad sales and newspaper circulation as people drop printed papers in favor of the Internet.
