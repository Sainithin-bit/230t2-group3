 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended nearly flat on Thursday as a rally in health-care shares after earnings from companies such as Schering-Plough Corp. SGP.N offset worries China may take steps that reduce demand for U.S. goods. 

 The Dow eked out a record closing high for a second day. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  was up 5.20 points, or 0.04 percent, to end unofficially at a record 12,809.04. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 1.73 points, or 0.12 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,470.77. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  was down 5.15 points, or 0.21 percent, to close unofficially at 2,505.35.
