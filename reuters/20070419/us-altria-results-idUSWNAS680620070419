 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ) posted quarterly earnings below expectations on Thursday as weakness in its Philip Morris USA tobacco business overshadowed improved results abroad. 

 The company, whose shares fell almost 2 percent, also said it could be several months before it decides whether to spin off the Philip Morris International business. "Over the next several months, we will continue to carefully and diligently examine the benefits of a spinoff of Phillip Morris International," and other options, Dinyar Devitre, Altria chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts. The Philip Morris International spinoff would be the much-anticipated second step of a corporate restructuring that began with Altria's spinoff of Kraft Foods Inc. KFT.N at the end of March. U.S. MARKET SHARE FLAT Altria said profit from continuing operations was $1.03 a share, excluding special items, up from 98 cents a year earlier, but below the average Wall Street estimate of $1.06 a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Net income, which includes Kraft, fell 21 percent to $2.75 billion, or $1.30 per share. Altria had a gain of 30 cents per share from a reversal of tax reserves following an Internal Revenue Service review of tax returns for the years 1996-99. First-quarter net revenue rose 8.2 percent to $17.56 billion. Excluding collected excise taxes that are included in the net revenue figure, sales were $9.04 billion. Analysts had forecast $9.17 billion. The Philip Morris International unit benefited from price increases in some markets and also from the weaker dollar, which increases the dollar value of sales overseas. The international unit shipped 213.3 billion cigarettes in the quarter, up 1.5 percent, as an acquisition and gains in Italy, Argentina and other markets outweighed declines in Russia and Japan. International profit rose 9.5 percent to $2.2 billion. Altria's Philip Morris USA unit shipments fell 6.2 percent to 40.6 billion cigarettes, though the company said shipments improved in March. Devitre said smoking bans in part of the country contributed to the depth of the decline. "Volumes were expected to be weak due to price increases, however the shipment volume decline was greater than we had estimated," Bonnie Herzog, analyst at Citigroup, said in a research note. Market share for the U.S. unit was flat at 50.4 percent of the nation's retail cigarette market, but the market share of the top-selling Marlboro brand rose to 40.8 percent from 40.4 percent. The company raised prices by 10 cents a pack on December 18, which helped U.S. income rise 1.3 percent to $1.1 billion. INTERNATIONAL CONSOLIDATION U.S. cigarette consumption has fallen almost every year since hitting a peak billion cigarettes in 1981, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That is one reason the international business is seen as having more growth potential going forward. The international tobacco industry has also going through a phase of consolidation, with acquisitions this month by Britain's Imperial Tobacco Group Plc ( IMT.L ), the world's fourth-largest tobacco company and No. 3 Japan Tobacco Inc ( 2914.T ). Some news reports have speculated that Altria could make a major international acquisition, speculation Devitre addressed briefly. "We take a very disciplined and judicial approach to acquisitions, and we will only pursue those that provide attractive economic returns, are strategically compelling, and create long-term value," he said after citing the company's policy to never comment on speculation. For the year, Altria raised its earnings forecast to a range of $4.20 to $4.25 a share, up from a previous forecast of $4.15 to $4.20. Altria shares fell $1.16 to $68.93 stood on Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. The Dow Jones industrial average stock trades at about 16.3 times estimated 2007 earnings, compared with an average multiple of 14.8 for the blue chip index.
