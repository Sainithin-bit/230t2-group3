 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Research In Motion Ltd. RIMM.O RIM.TO said on Thursday the full analysis of the cause of the North American outage of its BlackBerry e-mail service "will take more time," but the company expected to have an update by Friday morning. 

 Thousands of users, from business executives and lawyers to White House staffers, were left without on-the-go e-mail service provided by RIM's BlackBerry devices in the wake of the outage that hit Tuesday night and lasted well into Wednesday for some.
