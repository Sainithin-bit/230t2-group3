 BOSTON  (Reuters) - General Electric Co.'s ( GE.N ) WMC Mortgage subprime lending unit plans to lay off 771 workers, about half of its staff, a spokeswoman said on Thursday. 

 The layoffs will include the closing of facilities in Costa Mesa and San Ramon, California, as well as Addison, Texas. Following the cuts, WMC will employ about 700 people, spokeswoman Brandie Young told Reuters. "We have realigned our resources to meet customer needs and we've announced a layoff, a work force reduction, which will include the closure of three smaller offices," Young said. "It certainly is in response to the changes across the industry and to align us to the current operating environment." The Burbank, California-based lender in March disclosed layoffs of more than 460 people. At that time, WMC also stopped writing new loans to people who do not make any downpayment. When GE reported first-quarter financial results, the company said it had cut lending dramatically, making just $3.4 billion in new loans during the first quarter, down from $9 billion in the fourth quarter. SMALL SLICE, BIG PIE GE, the world's second-largest company by market capitalization behind Exxon Mobil Corp. ( XOM.N ), is best known for its industrial businesses -- making jet engines, gas turbines and the like. But its commercial and consumer finance arms are up a big slice of the pie, and last year kicked in $45.55 billion of GE's $163.39 billion in revenue. Still, subprime lending represents a small piece of GE's financial operations. Equity analysts estimated it generated less than 0.5 percent of GE profit last year. GE bought WMC in 2004, when it was the sixth-biggest subprime lender. GE shares edged down 10 cents to $35.03 late Thursday afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange. Subprime lenders make home loans to less-creditworthy buyers. As the U.S. housing market has cooled, that business has slowed dramatically and faced higher rates of default. At least 20 subprime lenders have gone out of business as a result. Rising U.S. home prices over the past few years attracted many new buyers into the market, with more lenders and borrowers willing to take on risky loans, gambling that home price appreciation would make them pay off. Subprime loans last year grew to represent 13.6 percent of the total mortgage market, up from 2.4 percent in 2000, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data. As the rise in property values has slowed, default rates have increased. The rising default rates have attracted the attention of the U.S. Senate, which last month held committee hearings on the matter. New Century Financial Corp. ( NEWC.PK ), one the largest U.S. subprime lender, early this month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. For more on the subprime lending crisis see <ID:nN1619544>
