 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - An executive of South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. ( 005930.KS ) has agreed to plead guilty to price-fixing in the U.S. government's long-running investigation of the computer memory chip business, the Justice Department said on Thursday. 

 Il Ung Kim, vice president of marketing for the memory division at Samsung, became the sixth Samsung executive to plead guilty in the case, the department said. He agreed to serve 14 months in a U.S. prison, the department said. As part of his plea agreement, Kim agreed to pay a $250,000 criminal fine and to cooperate with prosecutors in the ongoing investigation. The government has blamed the price-fixing scheme for driving up the price of chips used in personal computers, servers, cell phones, cameras and game consoles. To date, courts have imposed criminal fines totaling more than $730 million against members of the computer chip cartel, the department said. A total of 18 individuals and four companies have been charged in the case.
