 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - U.S. shares looked set for a weaker start on Thursday as fears of overheating in China's economy weighed on global equity markets, while investors eyed results from Google ( GOOG.O ) and Merrill Lynch MER.N. 

 June Dow Jones index futures DJM7 were 0.6 percent lower, while S&P futures SPM7 declined 0.6 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures NDM7 dropped 0.7 percent. Data showing China's economy grew 11.1 percent in the first quarter and inflation rose to 3.3 percent in March cemented expectations that tighter monetary policy will be needed to cool the country's overheating economy. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  was almost 1 percent weaker at 1,549.65 at 1007 GMT. "I wouldn't dismiss what we see today as a one-off," said Lutz Roehmeyer, fund manager at LBB Invest, referring to Friday's options expiry, which some could use to smooth out imbalances in their positions after the recent rally in U.S. stocks which saw the Dow close at a record on Wednesday. Google will be in focus after tech stocks fell on Wednesday following disappointing results from Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) and International Business Machines Corp.( IBM.N ). Shares in online auction leader eBay Inc. ( EBAY.O ) rose 5.3 percent in electronic trade after the market closed after the company's quarterly results beat estimates. "First-quarter estimates for the U.S. earning season were very low, which is why it is so important now to find our how companies are really doing. And for now most of them clearly beat market estimates," Roehmeyer said. Earnings updates from banks such as Bank of America ( BAC.N ) and Merrill Lynch will also be in focus after stronger profits than expected from JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) eased concerns about the impact of the subprime lending crisis on big banks on Wednesday. "Banks have so far beat analysts' expectations, which is an important indication, as there is a lot of merger and acquisition activity going on in the sector," Roehmeyer. Other earnings include quarterly results from Altria Group Inc. ( MO.N ), American Express Co. ( AXP.N ), and Union Pacific Corp. ( UNP.N ). The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 0.24 percent to close at a record 12,803.84 on Wednesday, boosted by JPMorgan Chase after the investment bank reported stronger-than-expected profits. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 0.07 percent, but the Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  slipped 0.26 percent. For a broader view of the U.S. economy, investors will eye weekly jobless claims data as well as the forward-looking report of leading economic indicators and the Philadelphia Fed index reading.
