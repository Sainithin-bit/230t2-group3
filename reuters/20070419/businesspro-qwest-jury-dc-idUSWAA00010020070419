 DENVER  (Reuters) - The jury in the insider trading trial of 
former Qwest Communications International Inc. ( Q.N ) Chief 
Executive Joseph Nacchio reached a verdict on Thursday, which 
is due to be read by the judge later this afternoon. 

  Nacchio, 57, is accused of selling more than $100 million 
in Qwest shares in 2001 after company insiders warned that the 
phone carrier could not meet its financial forecasts.
