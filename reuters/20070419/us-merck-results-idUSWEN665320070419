 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merck & Co. ( MRK.N ) said on Thursday first-quarter earnings rose as booming sales of newer prescription drugs offset declines in older products such as its Zocor cholesterol fighter. 

 Merck, which on April 12 preannounced the quarterly earnings trends, posted net earnings of $1.7 billion, or 78 cents per share, compared with $1.52 billion, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. Merck earned 84 cents per share excluding restructuring charges, matching its forecast of last week.
