 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Lockheed Martin Corp. ( LMT.N ) has 
been cleared to start building F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 
production models for the U.S. military, a watershed for the 
costliest weapons procurement ever, the Pentagon said Thursday. 

  The Defense Department approved the release of full funding 
for two conventional F-35 aircraft, plus "long lead" funding 
for 12 planes to be built in a second batch, a statement from 
the Pentagon's top weapons-buyer said. Until now, the aircraft 
built have been prototypes and test planes.
