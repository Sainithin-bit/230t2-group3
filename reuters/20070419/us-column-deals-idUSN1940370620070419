 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - And they said a leveraged buyout of a big financial services company couldn't be done. 

 Well, Sallie Mae's SLM.N agreement to a $25 billion takeover by a group of private equity firms and banks set a precedent for such a transaction this week, and experts say similar deals will now follow. The student loan company's deal has shown that the debt implications of a leveraged buyout need not, as many thought, preclude an LBO of a financial company. "You could put anyone else in Sallie Mae's shoes," said John Orrico, portfolio manager at the Arbitrage Fund in New York. Sallie Mae on Monday accepted an offer from private equity firms J.C. Flowers & Co. and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe, as well as JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ) and Bank of America Corp.  ( BAC.N ). Until now, the theory was that the debt typically taken on in an LBO would be a dealbreaker for many financial companies, which often have high borrowings to begin with and can face tough regulatory scrutiny. More debt could bring downgrades of the credit rating of a financial company to "junk" and hurt its ability to borrow. However, the dealmakers in the Sallie Mae transaction came up with a solution -- an alternative source of funding and the heavy backing of two big banks. Under the plan, Sallie Mae could rely on the securitization of its student loans for most of its funding, and it also has a commitment of up to $200 billion from JPMorgan and Bank of America. That means any downgrade in the company's credit rating would not matter so much. "Sallie Mae has locked up its funding," said Orrico. "So what do they care about tapping the credit markets, or what do they care about their credit rating?" A report from CreditSights analysts said the major lesson from the Sallie Mae deal was that LBO-type deals are now possible for financial companies that can rely on securitization, the selling of loans to investors. "Sallie Mae can forgo investment grade ratings and rely almost solely on securitization while plan B comes from a large liquidity facility from the bank investors," the CreditSights analysts wrote. With a precedent set, experts say the field is now open for private equity firms to target most types of financial companies for LBO-style deals. COMPLEX, CLEVER, CREATIVE Deals involving private equity firms totaled about $737.4 billion last year, helping global M&A reach a record value of $4.06 trillion. But so far, financial firms have been largely out of the buyout shops' reach. That's about to change. Shares of financial companies seen as potential takeover targets rose in the wake of the Sallie Mae deal. According to CreditSights, possible candidates for Sallie Mae-type buyouts include mortgage lender Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N and consumer and commercial finance company CIT Group ( CIT.N ). CIT Chief Executive Jeff Peek said on Wednesday that management was focusing on building the company rather than selling it. Countrywide was not immediately available for comment. Some argue that mainstream, depository banks are still not suitable for LBOs because of stringent regulation, but others say it's only a matter of time before those concerns are overcome. "The sky's the limit here," said William Hickey, co-head of investment banking at Sandler O'Neill & Partners, one of the advisory firms that worked on Sallie Mae's deal. UBS ( UBSN.VX ) was lead financial advisor to the student loan company. "There is a lot of money out on the sidelines looking for opportunity," said Hickey. "Is there somebody too big to do? No." Last year 717 private equity funds raised $451 billion, the highest amount ever in a single year, according to Private Equity Intelligence Ltd. And now, it seems, the big private equity players can finally target the financial services sector. "Private equity firms have ... had zero exposure to financial services, but financial services are 35 percent of the market -- they need that exposure," said a dealmaker who requested anonymity. However, Sallie Mae's LBO agreement doesn't mean similar deals will be easy to construct. The Sallie Mae transaction was complex and clever -- and experts said any other M&A bankers hoping to execute an LBO of a financial firm would have to come up with an equally creative solution. Under Monday's deal, J.C. Flowers & Co. and Friedman Fleischer & Lowe would invest $4.4 billion and own 50.2 percent of Sallie Mae. Bank of America and JPMorgan will each invest $2.2 billion and own 24.9 percent. Experts said the backing of two banks with such deep pockets was crucial in a deal viewed as a breakthrough transaction that will open the gates for others. "There is not a deal that can't be done," said Orrico, "as long as the credit or funding sources are secure."
