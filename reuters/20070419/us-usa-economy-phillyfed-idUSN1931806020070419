 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing activity in the Mid-Atlantic region stalled in April, with a factory activity index unchanged from the previous month, a survey showed on Thursday. 

 The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index was at 0.2 in April, sharply lower than Wall Street forecasts of a gain of 2.0. The index was at 0.2 in March. Any reading above zero indicates growth in the region's manufacturing sector. The index has remained above zero for four straight months, but has been nearly flat since February. The new orders index, a gauge of future growth, rose to 2.8 in April from 1.9 in March. "The Fed gets no message that the economy is emerging from the current slowdown/pause situation," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Decision Economics in New York. "Nor does it gain any confidence that business investment, which in recent weeks has become a key element of uncertainty in the economy, is reviving." The survey also showed price pressures remained, with the prices paid index edging up to 24.3 in April after 21.8 in March. The employment index was at 2.5 in April from 2.3 in March. The business outlook was slightly optimistic, with the six-month business conditions gauge rising to 25.8 in April from 17.4 in March. The survey covers factory activity in a region encompassing eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware and is looked at closely as one of the first indicators of the health of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
