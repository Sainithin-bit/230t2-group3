 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The Wall Street Journal has named Marcus Brauchli as its new managing editor, succeeding Paul Steiger next month, a Journal spokesman said on Wednesday. 

 Brauchli, 45, most recently oversaw the Journal's redesign, which launched earlier this year, the paper reported on its Web site. He was a former foreign correspondent at the Journal before becoming global news editor, the Journal said. The managing editor reports to Journal publisher Gordon Crovitz and oversees the news operations of what many regard as the top U.S. daily business newspaper. Brauchli would be one of the younger people to take the job, though previous managing editors Warren Phillips and Barney Kilgore were younger, a Journal spokesman said. He beat out Dow Jones Newswires President Paul Ingrassia, the other top contender for the job. "Obviously I'm disappointed, but I respect Rich's and Gordon's right to make the decision," Ingrassia said in a statement released through the spokesman. Rich Zannino is chief executive of Dow Jones. Steiger, 64, is retiring at the end of the year, as required by parent company Dow Jones & Co. Inc.'s corporate policy, the Journal said. Steiger will become editor-at-large. His and Brauchli's appointments are effective May 15. During the past few months of Steiger's reign, the Journal has undergone a redesign and shrunk its size. It won more than a dozen Pulitzer prizes under his tenure, including two this week. The paper has taken other action to broaden its appeal, including a Saturday edition to seek advertisers beyond its traditional stable. But it also has cut some overseas coverage as well as its reporting staff in Canada. The cuts come as the Journal and other local Dow Jones papers deal with sliding advertising sales and an increasing migration of readers to the Internet. The Journal's subscription-only site performed well, the company said when it announced its first-quarter results on Tuesday. Paid subscriptions to the online journal rose 20 percent to 931,000, boosted by a promotion and a change in how it counts registered users.
