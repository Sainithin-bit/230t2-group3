 DETROIT  (Reuters) - General Motors Co ( GM.N ) is "not betting on" an uptick in European auto demand later this year and has no plans to provide additional funds to its struggling partner in the region, France's Peugeot SA ( PEUP.PA ), GM's chief financial officer said. 
 "We have no intention of putting more cash into Peugeot," GM CFO Dan Ammann told reporters on Thursday during a briefing for the largest U.S. automaker's fourth-quarter results. GM's fourth-quarter profit of 48 cents per share fell short of Wall Street expectations by 3 cents. (Reporting By  Ben Klayman  and  Deepa Seetharaman ; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
