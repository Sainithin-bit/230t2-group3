 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE is advancing plans to sell or spin off Chrysler Group, its struggling U.S. unit, and has already received "several expressions of interest from around the world," the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Sunday. 


 The newspaper cited two people close to the situation for the report, but did not name the potential suitors for the U.S. automaker. Reuters reported Friday that General Motors ( GM.N ) was in preliminary talks to buy Chrysler, or strike a strategic alliance with the automaker, citing sources. Last week, DaimlerChrysler said it would cut 13,000 jobs in North America and indicated it could sell or spin off the unit, which it bought nine years ago.
