 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Recent launches of new video game consoles from Sony ( 6758.T ), Microsoft ( MSFT.O ) and Nintendo 7974.OS are benefiting game maker Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O, which is aiming to garner 20 percent of total game sales, according to Barron's. 


 In its February 19 edition, the newspaper said analysts forecast Electronic Arts earnings for the fiscal year ending March 2009 could be triple that of the current fiscal year. Analyst Michael Pachter of Wedbush Morgan Securities sees shares climbing to $65 within 12 months. Shares closed at $50.01, down 10 cents, on Nasdaq on Friday.
