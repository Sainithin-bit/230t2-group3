 LONDON  (Reuters) - Commodities fell for a fourth straight day on Thursday as a broad-based sell-off gathered momentum. 

 Oil dropped below $118 a barrel, more than 7 percent below a peak above $127 hit a month ago and around 6 percent below its close at the end of last week. Silver headed for its biggest weekly drop since the late 1980s. Following are analysts views: STERLING SMITH, SENIOR ANALYST, COUNTRY HEDGING INC IN MINNESOTA "The longer-term bull cycle is still in place, but this correction may have a life span of several months, as weaker economic data is fueling this correction to a large part. "The very oversold dollar will have some sort of technical correction, probably of a violent nature, especially as trading thins some in the summer months, and there is some profit taking before that happens. "Silver has certainly caused some worry and serves as a reminder of how fast commodity markets can correct. "Coffee has the fundamentals to keep moving higher despite current head winds. Wheat also can have good fundamental backing if the weather remains a problem. Sugar will likely struggle as will the metals and especially copper. "Livestock will likely be one of the earlier markets to begin an upside recovery as current prices vs. grain prices are wreaking havoc on the industry. "Markets influenced by weather can build risk premiums and also return to bullish if and when weather becomes a factor." NICK GENTILE, HEAD OF TRADING, ATLANTIC CAPITAL ADVISORS "I feel this is just a correction. I believe it is just a function of the massive longs in the markets and some of the fundamentals playing out in some of the commodities that do not have a story. Also, the assassination of (Osama) Bin Laden could have some effect on the energy complex. "I think the grain complex could recover quickly because there is still a big issue with corn and this will carry over to (soy)beans and the weather for wheat is not good as well. "I think the softs markets will have the biggest problem except for coffee because you will have a frost scare in that market and I believe that Central America is running low on coffee and that could be a problem. " SHAWN HACKETT, PRESIDENT OF HACKETT FINANCIAL ADVISORS, INC "I think this is a major top like we had in late 2008, early 2009. I would think this is going to be at least a 20 percent down move ... maybe as much as 30 percent. "I've been pretty bearish over the last several months due to the unrealistic chasing of commodities that has taken place. "My expectation is that ultimately from the highs that we've recently set to the lows that we will likely set, I am looking for a minimum of 20 percent down. "The inflation trade got super crowded. There were record-long speculative positions in all commodities, the TV was telling you how hyper-inflation was around the corner ... they were all signs that markets were not going up based on fundamentals, but they were going up because money was chasing money. "All of a sudden, all of the top-money leaves the market, and then the market has to find what the fundamental value is based upon supply and demand. "Real demand is not supporting these prices and the speculators are getting out. "My view is that a correction is going to take at least 6 months. "If I had a guess, I would think that your best opportunities would likely be some of the Ag markets because I think that the Ag markets would have the least demand-side impact from a slowdown in the global economy. "I think some of the Ag markets will likely offer you a best risk/reward. "To me, the economically-sensitive commodities just have a tough road ahead of them because the economy in the U.S. and the global economy are just not going to be robust. "The economy is just not going to provide the cyclical demand for the cyclical commodities that it has in the past, so those markets I think are going to be increasingly under-performing those that are less economically sensitive." JAMES CORDIER, SENIOR ANALYST AT OPTIONSELLERS.COM IN FLORIDA "We think that we just saw a commodity bubble pop here this week. We think the speculative buying that has taken place in commodities the past six months well exceeded fair value in so many commodities. "Long-only funds, commodity funds, they're long coffee, they're long gold, they're long oil, they're long soybeans. When they're long, they're long all of them. When they sell, they sell all of them." GREGORY CAIN, MANAGING PARTNER AT EBULLIO, A COMMODITY FUND "We've been trading at these higher prices for such a long time people are starting to talk about no QEIII and what they are going to do in June when QEII ends. We've had a good rally and there is an element of profit-taking. We've had a pretty big sell off over the last couple of days and CTAs have been getting out. It's basically become self-perpetuating. "If you look at the rally, most people didn't believe prices should be that high, and now prices are coming down everyone is saying: this is the move to the downside. So you have those who want to go short, those who are long stopping out, and those who are taking the risk off their books." "Given that silver has rallied so hard and so fast, I think it's inevitable that this would happen to silver. Once they started selling silver I think it probably was a trigger in the sense that people decided the commodity rally had come to an end for the time being. People will probably hang fire, take a little breather and see what happens in the second half of the year." "For buying things back we need to see demand and a real economic recovery, with Joe Public getting a new job, and real spending. Most of the QEI and QEII money that has been pumped out has not filtered down to Joe Public, it has stayed within the financial system - hence this massive commodity rally. Mr Joe Public is still not buying anything -- he doesn't have job security. "We haven't seen much demand yet for our physical metal holdings from any of our clients for the last five months because the price is too high - when they come back then we'll consider going long base metals but until that happens we're very bearish." TOM GIDLEY-KITCHIN, MINING ANALYST, CHARLES STANLEY "There's no doubt that commodities became extended... but I'm not seeing anything approaching panic. I've no feeling that this is going to be more than just a slight pullback yet, but if the news continues to deteriorate, I would assume that markets will follow that." "What's happened recently is it's become more certain that QE2 won't be extended... so bad news on the U.S. economy is bad news for the dollar and also bad news for global demand and therefore for commodities, there's been a reversal in the usual causal link...when you put that on top of a bit more tightening in India, more tightening in China, then maybe then everyone's perspective changes from a glass half full to a glass half empty." "In your list of bad news, you have the increase in the margins on silver, which got wildly out of control. Some people will be taking hits on that, quite large ones, and they're going to have to finance them somewhere, especially if they bought on margin." EMMANUEL FAGES, ANALYST AT SOCIETE GENERALE: "We have seen sentiment turning quite rapidly since Tuesday. While the end of last week saw a rally -- not massive, but energy prices were rather moving up -- the Indian interest rates rise, the continuing signs of China in the same direction, and the topic about a possible 'hard landing' in China and also in OECD in H2 as QE2 ends, all this is making investors more cautious about commodities. "Since no new developments are occurring in the MENA, Bin Laden's death has provided a good pretext for the first profit-taking from Monday. "Some people came out for opportunity buying, but it seems it is a rising tide, and funds are definitely of the view that the upside potential is reduced for now, and the game is over. "They are reducing exposure. Tactically, nothing absurd. Our commodities team here has been saying this for weeks. The only hard part -- as usual -- was to get the timing right.... We were too early." THORBJOERN BAK JENSEN AT CONSULTANTS GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT: "There is fear for global growth following the at-best mediocre ISM (Institute for Supply Management) data from Wednesday." HARRY TCHILINGUIRIAN, HEAD OF COMMODITY MARKETS STRATEGY AT BNP PARIBAS: "The market has been balancing upside and downside risks over the past month, and the more recent economic data alongside pronouncements by the Fed are suggesting more clearly a soft patch ahead. "At the same time, the market is looking more closely for signs of demand destruction at the current price level. In the U.S. in particular, you have gasoline prices at nearly $4/gallon." OLIVIER JAKOB, OIL CONSULTANT AT PETROMATRIX IN ZUG, SWITZERLAND: "The risks are better defined, less easy to make all sorts of 'what if' scenarios ... On the other hand, we are starting to get some data confirmation about demand erosion and even demand destruction. STEPHEN BRIGGS, ANALYST AT BNP PARIBAS: "Was silver a bubble? I think to a large extent it was. It's notoriously volatile. The fundamentals of silver are simply not as good as gold's. "Metals have all gone down indiscriminately, even though their fundamentals vary greatly. It's mainly a kneejerk reaction. But at the end of this people will still think that the underlying story for copper and tin is still good. For both there are underlying deficits, with less being produced than is being consumed. "Commodities are one small cog in a big wheel. Big swings have tended to take place with turns in wider risk-on, risk-off appetite. Prices will come back at some point, but the specific trigger is difficult to identify. GAYLE BERRY, ANALYST AT BARCLAYS CAPITAL: "It looks to me as though its broad-based, risk-off selling momentum that has gathered pace. Something has spooked the market, sentiment has nosedived and I think the fact that it is sentiment driven is illustrated by the fact that it's not just happening in the base metals. "Yesterday we had U.S. ISM data, which was rubbish, and since then we have just gone lower and lower. But I would be surprised if it was that one data point that is taking everything across the board lower. "The end of QE2 is coming up in June, we have had pretty big political development with the death of Osama bin Laden, and we've got still a number of uncertainties about Chinese monetary policy, so we have a cumulative unsettling of market sentiment. "It could reverse as quickly as it started, and I wouldn't expect it to be sustained indefinitely."
