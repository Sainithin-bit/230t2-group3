 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices plummeted more than 10 percent on Thursday, dragging down stocks and fueling demand for safe-haven assets, after new data cast fresh doubts on the strength of the global economic recovery. 

 U.S. crude oil ended below $100 a barrel and extended losses after settlement, as reports showed new weekly U.S. jobless claims jumped to an eight-month high and the country's productivity growth slowed in the first quarter. It was the second-largest single day loss on record for U.S. crude oil, considering the post-settlement trade. For Brent crude, it was the largest one day fall on record. The euro tumbled 2 percent against the dollar, its worst day against the greenback since August, after the European Central Bank signaled it will refrain from raising interest rates next month. On Wall Street, the Dow and the S&P 500 fell about 1 percent as energy shares slumped with the price of oil. "The longer-term bull cycle (for oil) is still in place, but this correction may have a life span of several months, as weaker economic data is fueling this correction to a large part," said Sterling Smith, senior analyst for Country Hedging Inc in Minnesota. Some investors also saw the recent disappointing economic data as a bad omen for Friday's key U.S. jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  ended down 139.41 points, or 1.10 percent, at 12,584.17, while the Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  lost 12.22 points, or 0.91 percent, to 1,335.10. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  fell 13.51 points, or 0.48 percent, at 2,814.72. Expectations of stable euro zone rates cushioned a fall in European stocks, which closed slightly lower after data showed German industrial orders declined unexpectedly in March. The FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  index of top European shares closed 0.29 percent lower after falling 1.4 percent on Wednesday. The MSCI All-Country World index .MIWD00000PUS fell 1.3 percent while the MSCI stock index for emerging markets .MSCIEF lost 1.0 percent. Before this week's decline, world stocks had risen more than 8.0 percent this year on investor confidence in strong corporate earnings and robust growth in emerging markets. Among the safe-havens benefited by Thursday's data, 10-year U.S. Treasury notes jumped 17/32 in price, while their yield fell to 3.16 percent. The Japanese yen gained around 0.4 percent against the U.S. dollar at 80.22 yen. The euro lost 2.0 percent against the greenback, to $1.4525, after ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet mentioned upside risks on prices but did not use the phrase "strong vigilance" on inflation, which traders said suggests the ECB won't hike rates again in June. COMMODITIES SUFFER Commodities extended their sell-off into a fourth consecutive day as investors worried about faltering economic growth in major economies and excessive monetary tightening in China, the world's top consumer of raw materials. U.S. crude oil prices settled down 8.64 percent at $99.80 a barrel, before hitting $98.25 a barrel in post-settlement trade. Brent crude ended 8.57 percent lower at $110.80 a barrel. The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB, a global benchmark for commodities prices, dropped 4.9 percent on Thursday. It has lost about 8 percent so far this week. Silver was set for its deepest weekly decline since the late 1980s after the CME Group, in a move to curb speculation, raised margin requirements for the 5,000-ounce COMEX silver futures contract. Silver has fallen more than 20 percent this week, with investors taking profits from a recent rally that took it to a 31-year high just shy of $50 an ounce. It closed down 10 percent on Thursday, at $35.34 an ounce, its biggest one-day loss since October 2008. Copper, seen as a proxy for global economic growth, dived more than 3 percent to its lowest level since December. "I think what's happening is risk aversion across all the asset classes. Everyone thought the U.S. was on a growth trajectory, but now some talk out of the U.S. is showing pretty mediocre growth," said Patrick Armstrong of Armstrong Investment Managers in London. "We have not been adding any commodity exposure in the dips, but we're still positive on commodities. U.S. dollar depreciation in future will provide a positive tail wind," he added.
