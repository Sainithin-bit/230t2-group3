 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has not yet decided how much bank-specific information it will release from new yearly bank stress tests mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday. 

 "We haven't yet come to an internal view" on how much information to disclose, Bernanke told a banking conference at the Chicago Fed. The Fed must balance the "legitimate" business interests and privacy concerns of banks against the legal mandate to give the public a better view into bank safety and soundness. The Fed will probably not release as many details from yearly bank stress tests as it did in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis. (Reporting by  Ann Saphir ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
