 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Home improvement retailer Home Depot Inc ( HD.N ) has scrapped a plan to buy a bank as it focuses on shoring up its retail business. 

 The company in 2006 had announced plans to buy EnerBank USA, a Utah loan provider, from CMS Energy Corp ( CMS.N ). "Earlier this week, we informed EnerBank that we no longer intend to acquire the company," Home Depot spokesman Ron DeFeo said on Friday. "This acquisition is no longer a part of our strategy and we are turning our attention to our core retail business," he added. The decision comes as the clock winds down this month on a bank industry-backed moratorium to keep retailers out of banking. Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT.N ) withdrew its request to open a specialty bank last March after immense opposition from politicians, consumer groups and community banks.
