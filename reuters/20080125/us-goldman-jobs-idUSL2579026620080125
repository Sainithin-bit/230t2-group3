 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs plans to sack about 5 percent of its global workforce in coming months after its annual staff evaluation, a company spokesman said on Friday. 

 Goldman Sachs employs about 30,500 people worldwide, meaning the cuts would represent about 1,500 employees. The New York-based bank said those being dismissed will be the worst-performing employees. Details of who will be affected by the cuts, which are set to take place across the bank's departments, are set to be announced by March, the spokesman told Reuters. He added that this was the part of a normal employee evaluation process. "We conduct performance reviews every year and this is part of that process," said the spokesman. The spokesman added the bank is continuing to hire. The move came as the credit crunch hits banks' balance sheets and earnings outlooks, causing Goldman's rivals such as Lehman Brothers, Citigroup and Credit Suisse to slash jobs. In December, Goldman announced its fourth-quarter earnings had risen 2 percent, beating expectations, but the company gave a cautious outlook and said trading and investment banking markets would make earnings growth challenging. The company had declined to provide details on mortgage-related write-downs but said losses and offsetting gains from hedges were both "modest." (Editing by David Cowell)
