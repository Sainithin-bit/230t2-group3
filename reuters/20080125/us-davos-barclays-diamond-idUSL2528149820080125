 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays ( BARC.L ) said on Friday that tougher market conditions over the next 12 months were an opportunity for its investment banking arm to grow and invest, particularly in the United States. 

 "2008 brings one very important change to our priority list, and that's the United States. It is difficult to get into the home market of the U.S bulge-bracket firms, but as we go into 2008, so many of them are retrenching," Bob Diamond, president of Barclays and head of its investment banking arm, said. "I am determined that in two, three or four years' time we don't look back and say this was the market opportunity to move up into the top tier and we flinched," he told Reuters. Diamond was speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of policymakers and business leaders in the Swiss resort of Davos. (Reporting by  Clara Ferreira-Marques ; editing by Sue Thomas)
