 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wyeth WYE.N on Friday said it is considering cost cuts that could eliminate 10 percent of its work force over a three-year period, although the U.S. drugmaker said details of the initiative are not "etched in stone." 

 The company, whose earnings prospects have been hurt by delays last year in approvals of new medicines and the recent launch of a generic form of its blockbuster Protonix ulcer medicine, currently has 50,000 employees worldwide. "It is premature to even begin to discuss which positions will be affected or how (job cuts) will be achieved," said company spokesman Doug Petkus. He noted that details of the initiative will be presented to employees toward the end of March. "We are evaluating our business and trying to find ways to be more efficient, and part of that is to keep costs under control," Petkus said. Asked if the delay in approvals of Wyeth drugs, including its Pristiq depression drug, was a motivation for the initiative, Petkus said: "There have been delays, but these drugs will get on the market and contribute to our revenue stream."
