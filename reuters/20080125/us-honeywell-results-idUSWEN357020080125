 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer Honeywell International Inc ( HON.N ) said on Thursday its fourth-quarter profit and sales rose from a year earlier, helped by strong economic conditions. 

 Honeywell, the world's largest maker of cockpit electronics, said its quarterly earnings rose to $689 million, or 91 cents per share, from $585 million, or 72 cents a share, in the same quarter a year earlier. Quarterly sales rose 12 percent to $9.3 billion, it said. Analysts on average expected earnings of 91 cents on sales of $8.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. Honeywell Chief Executive Dave Cote said the company expects "softer global economic conditions in 2008" but it would continue to invest and expand, seeking to achieve double-digit growth in earnings per share and higher free cash flow this year. Results at Honeywell, which also makes automation systems for large commercial buildings, have been boosted by strong investment in factories, airports, power plants and other infrastructure projects in the developing world. Details showed fourth-quarter aerospace sales rose 11 percent from a year earlier, helped by both commercial and defense and space businesses. Sales from its automation and control business rose 13 percent. (Reporting by  Ritsuko Ando ; Editing by  Valerie Lee  and Steve Orlofsky)
