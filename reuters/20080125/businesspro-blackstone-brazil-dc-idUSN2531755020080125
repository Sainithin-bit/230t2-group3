 RIO DE JANEIRO  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ), the 
U.S. private equity company, is setting up a $675 million fund 
to invest in Brazil and will contribute $500 million in 
capital, the Valor Economico newspaper said on Friday. 

  "We're raising the money, it's for this year. Brazil is 
very popular," Valor quoted Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen 
Schwartzman as saying. The group is one of the world's largest 
private equity firms.  Schwartzman said global market turbulence was not affecting 
its Brazilian plans or its ties with local partner Patria 
Investimentos, which already has two funds in Latin America's 
largest country.  "Brazil is doing very well and the world has realized 
that," Schwartzman told Valor.  The newspaper also quoted Alexandre Saigh, a senior Patria 
partner responsible for private equity, as saying that the new 
fund was almost ready and would mainly invest in 
infrastructure, civil construction, food, health and education.  (Reporting by Andrei Khalip; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
