 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Beleaguered discount brokerage E*Trade Financial Corp ( ETFC.O ) posted a larger-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday but said it expected to return to profitability in 2008, sending its shares higher. 

 The company announced details of a widely anticipated "turnaround plan" and acting Chief Executive Jarrett Lilien said he was confident of achieving profitability this year despite some dark clouds on the U.S. economic horizon. "We have factored in a pretty dim economic year ahead but we think customers will remain active, and that is what we have baked into (our) plan," he said in an interview. Shares of E*Trade rose 9 percent to $3.80 in extended trading from their $3.48 close in the regular Nasdaq session. The stock has fallen about 85 percent in the past 12 months, prompting a number of shareholder lawsuits. The turnaround plan includes disposing of non-core assets and cost-cutting and possibly raising money in capital markets later in the year. After a $2.2 billion charge related to the sale of its asset-backed securities portfolio, the company reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1.7 billion, or $3.98 per share, compared with net income of $177 million, or 40 cents per share a year ago. Reported revenue was negative $2 billion. Analysts on average expected E*Trade to post a quarterly loss of $3.14 per share, on negative revenue of $1.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. During the quarter, the company also increased its provision for losses on home equity loans to about $500 million, and recorded a $100 million impairment to goodwill. DEAL OR NO DEAL? E*Trade rivals Charles Schwab SCHW.O and TD Ameritrade ( AMTD.O ) both said last week that they were interested in acquiring rival brokerage operations. But Lilien declined to say whether the company has been approached by any bidders. "We don't need to do a deal, we have a great growth franchise, but if a good one comes along we will have to consider it," he said. E*Trade, badly hit last year by losses in its mortgage business, received a $2.55 billion cash infusion from Chicago-based hedge fund Citadel Investment Group in late November, including the sale of its $3 billion ABS portfolio for about $800 million. At that time, the company said it expected to take a fourth-quarter charge on its asset-backed portfolio sale, and to increase loan-loss provisions. The company said it expects an additional $400 million to $600 million in loan loss provision expense in 2008, related to its home equity loan business. Lilien said the company's turnaround plan will include the sale or closure of non-core assets, trimming costs by $360 million during the year, and may include capital-raising transactions later in the year. "Down the road there are things we can do as the turnaround shows results -- this would more than likely be in the second half of the year and would require that things have improved," he said. Lilien said the company was budgeting for a slow down but not a recession. Lilien, who stepped in as acting CEO when former chief Mitch Caplan stepped down in late November, said the company's main brokerage business was strong. Net revenue in its retail segment rose 10 percent to $476 million in the fourth quarter, the highest level ever recorded by the company. The company recorded its greatest customer activity in at least 5 years on Tuesday, when U.S. markets took a nose dive before recovering from their worst levels. While volatile markets historically have scared away brokerage customers, Lilien said this time around the company has seen a steadier pattern emerge. "The investor is staying engaged, and we find that that has changed with retail investors getting more sophisticated," he said, adding that options trading -- which investors can use to hedge risks -- accounts for about 17 percent of trading activity. The company ended 2007 with about 4.7 million customer accounts. Lilien said some 70,000 customers spooked by the financial upheaval E*Trade did close their accounts, but the rate of defections slowed markedly after Citadel's cash infusion. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also in November disclosed an investigation into the company's mortgage business. Lilien said the company had not set aside any funds in the quarter for legal liabilities as insurance is expected to cover costs, if any. There has been no further development in the SEC's review, he added. (Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
