 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The pilots of Continental Airlines Inc CAL.N are preparing for a potential merger and plan to have a say in any deal. 

 "We will not stand idly by and allow a change in the airline landscape without taking steps to protect the interests of our pilots," Tom Donaldson, chairman of Continental's pilots' union said in a statement late Thursday. "The pilots of Continental must be key in the decision to welcome or reject any merger candidate," he added. The union said it was activating its Strategic Merger and Acquisition Response Team, or "SMART", to take steps to protect the pilots' position in the airline. The union didn't define what those steps were. Continental, the No. 4 U.S. carrier, is seen as an attractive merger partner because of its strong international route network. The airline has said it would prefer to remain independent but would act if its competitive position were threatened by a merger of rivals. Delta Air Lines Inc ( DAL.N ) is reported to be in merger talks with Northwest Airlines Corp NWA.N and United Airlines parent UAL Corp UAUA.O. The airlines have declined to comment. Industry experts see a Delta-Northwest deal as most likely and feel that could prompt a tie-up between United and Continental. Airline workers, a powerful force in the industry, have been clamoring for higher wages after being forced to accept steep concessions during the industry's five-year slump that ended in 2006.
