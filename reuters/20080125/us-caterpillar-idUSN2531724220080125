 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Caterpillar Inc. ( CAT.N ) said on Friday its profit in the latest quarter rose more than 10 percent as strong international mining, energy and construction sales offset a decline in U.S. equipment and engine sales. 

 The fourth-quarter results boosted shares of Caterpillar, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average  .DJI  and a U.S. business bellwether, in pre-market trading. They were last up about $2.25, or about 3.4 percent, from their Thursday close of $65.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. Looking forward, Caterpillar said it expected continued "anemic growth in the U.S. economy" where the housing slowdown has hammered sales. But it predicted its fast-growing overseas sales would permit it to meet it 2008 sales and profit forecasts even if the U.S. economy slips into recession -- a prospect Caterpillar said was a real possibility. Caterpillar predicted 2008 would be another tough year for the U.S. residential housing market -- a key customer for its earth-moving machines -- and predicted "recessionary conditions to persist" in other key markets. It said it expected housing starts to decline to 1.1 million units, down from 1.35 million in 2007, and said new problems would roil the property market, including "a high level of mortgage resets, an increase in home repossessions and the likelihood of a significant decrease in home prices." But the company said "positive conditions" for its sales everywhere else in the world would continue to offset domestic weakness. "It sounds like 2008 could be a challenging year, certainly (for) them domestically," said John Kearney, an analyst at Morningstar, "but it sounds like things should hold up pretty well provided we don't slip into a global recession." The world's largest maker of construction and mining equipment reported a profit of $975 million, or $1.50 a share, compared with $882 million, or $1.32 a share, last year. Sales rose 10 percent to $12.14 billion as a 31 percent increase in sales outside North America offset an 11 percent decrease in North America. Analysts' average expectations were for a profit of $1.50 per share on revenue of $11 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. (Editing by Phil Berlowitz)
