 DAVOS, Switzerland  (Reuters) - Reuters Group Plc RTR.L expects to deliver signature 2007 results and has seen a good start to 2008 with no signs of major weakness in the U.S. markets, Chief Executive Tom Glocer said on Friday. 

 "I've been calling for a signature year ... and I'm very confident we'll have and we'll deliver just that signature year," Glocer said in an interview on CNBC Television on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos. Glocer also said 2008 had got off to a good start. "Our Asia business, which is significant, has been doing very well of late," he told Reuters in a separate interview, adding: "We have not seen a profound softening in the U.S." He said the acquisition of Reuters by Canada's Thomson Corp TOC.TO was going according to schedule and would be cleared by regulatory authorities in the first quarter. "I'm absolutely confident. There's no change to the public timetable. This deal will get approved in this quarter and we're in the final stretch to completing it and getting on with the integration," he said. In a separate interview with CNBC Thomson Financial Chief Executive and President Sharon Rowlands said the year had also started well for her business. "At Thomson we also have had a very, very strong 2007 and the outlook going into 2008 is very good," she said. "I think we are going to see the financial market or at least financial institutions come back very strongly towards the back end of 2008," Rowlands added. Thomson is scheduled to announce its annual results on February 7 and Reuters reports its 2007 results in March.
