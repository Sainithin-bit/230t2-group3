 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. health officials said on Friday they would review whether to take regulatory action over Merck & Co Inc and Schering-Plough's cholesterol medicine Vytorin following the drug's failure to work better than a generic drug in a study of plaque build-up in neck arteries. 

 The Food and Drug Administration said it had not yet received a final report on the study, called Enhance. The agency's review will take about six months after the final report is received, the FDA said. (Reporting by  Lisa Richwine ; Editing by  Tim Dobbyn )
