 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse Group said on Friday it was cutting about 500 jobs across the investment banking division. 

 "Due to market conditions and projected staffing levels required to meet client needs, we are reducing headcount by approximately 500 across the investment banking division, primarily in the global securities department, the company said in a statement. The company also said it plans to hire several hundred people this year in areas expected to show revenue growth. Those include global securities, algorithmic trading, emerging markets, commodities and derivatives. The Swiss bank has been relatively unscathed by the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, but a global credit crunch has disrupted the fixed-income operations of investment banks while they experience a slowdown in merger and acquisition activity.
