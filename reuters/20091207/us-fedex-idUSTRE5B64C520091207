 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - FedEx Corp said on Monday that its second-quarter earnings would easily beat its previous forecast, citing strong growth in international demand for its air services, especially in Asia and Latin America, and its shares rose more than 3 percent. 

 FedEx said it now expects to report earnings for the second-quarter which ended November 30 of $1.10 a share, above the range of 65 to 95 cents a share the company had previously predicted. The company earned $1.58 a share a year ago. Analysts, on average, expected the Memphis-based company to report a second-quarter profit of 85 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. FedEx said the improved outlook reflects "better-than-expected growth in FedEx International Priority and FedEx Ground volumes" as well as "the benefits of ongoing cost control programs." It was the second quarter in a row that FedEx preannounced expectation-topping earnings. Analysts say the company is positioned to benefit from even a modest economic recovery because as shipping activity ticks up and its underutilized aircraft begin to carry larger cargoes, FedEx's margins improve. FedEx shares rose to $90.35 after closing at $87.52 on the New York Stock Exchange. The company is due to report second-quarter earnings on December 17. (Reporting by  James B.
