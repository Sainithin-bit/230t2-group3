 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve has the tools it needs to withdraw its extraordinary support for the financial system in a "timely and effective" way to avoid future inflation, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Monday. 

 The Fed cut interest rates to near zero last December and has kept them there since. It has also pumped more than $1 trillion into the U.S. economy to combat the crisis and promote economic recovery. An important tool when the time comes to tighten policy will be the Fed's ability to raise the interest paid on the balances banks hold at the central bank, Bernanke said. Below are the Fed's exit strategy tools mentioned by Bernanke and some drawbacks noted by market participants. PAYING INTEREST ON EXCESS RESERVES: By raising the interest rate on reserves the Fed essentially creates a magnet for banks to keep those reserves with the Fed rather than lend them out into the financial system. "Banks will be unwilling to make overnight loans to each other at a rate lower than the rate that they can earn risk-free from the Fed, and so the interest rate we pay on banks' balances will tend to set a floor below our target overnight loan rate and other short-term interest rates. Banks generally will not lend funds in the money market at a rate lower than they can earn risk-free at the Fed," Bernanke said in his December 7 speech. A number of central banks around the world have effectively used this tool. Cons: There could be a political backlash if the Fed was paying banks a significant amount of money to push up interest rates. "That payment is perfectly logical from a monetary policy perspective, but it is a disaster from a public relations perspective," according to BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. LARGE-SCALE REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS: The Fed could arrange large-scale reverse repurchase agreements, or repos, with financial market participants, which would temporarily drain reserves from the banking system and reduce excess liquidity at other institutions. Reverse repos involve the sale by the Fed of securities from its portfolio with an agreement to buy the securities back at a slightly higher price at a later date. "Through the use of a short-term funding method known as reverse repurchase agreements, we can act directly to reduce the quantity of reserves held by the banking system," Bernanke said on December 7. The Fed has said it could conduct reverse repos with a number of institutions, not just primary dealers, its usual counterparties. Cons: Who the counterparties are will be key to the scope of the program and the ease with which it can be set up, according to a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee cited in the group's November minutes. "In all cases, the program will compete with other short-term investments and put upward pressure on Treasury bill rates," according to the committee member, who was not named in the minutes. "Moreover, draining excess reserves may dampen the demand for Treasury securities by banks given that banks are investing in securities -- particularly Treasuries -- in the absence of loan demand," he said. TERM DEPOSIT FACILITY: The Fed could create a new "term deposit facility" for banks, similar to certificates of deposit offered by retail banks. Like the reverse repos, this would reduce the supply of funds banks have available to lend to each other, putting "additional upward pressure on short-term interest rates" Bernanke said on Dec 7. "By paying a slightly higher rate of interest, we could induce banks to lock up their balances in longer-term accounts with us, making those balances unavailable for lending in the overnight market," Bernanke said on December 7. Cons: Taking in term deposits lacks a clear mechanism for rate setting and bank use, according to a member of the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee cited in the minutes. ASSET SALES: The Fed could sell a portion of its securities holdings into the open market. "If necessary, we always have the option of reducing the size of our balance sheet by selling some of our securities holdings on the open market," Bernanke said on December 7. Cons: Large-scale selling of Treasury securities could disrupt markets and potentially hamper the Treasury's ability to issue new debt, analysts said. The Fed is likely to be very cautious about selling its agency mortgage-related assets for fear of distorting those less-liquid markets, analysts say.
