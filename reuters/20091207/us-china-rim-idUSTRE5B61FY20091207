 BEIJING  (Reuters) - Digital China ( 0861.HK ), a Hong Kong-listed information technology company, will distribute RIM's Blackberry smartphones in mainland China, the two companies said on Monday. 

 An announcement emailed to reporters by the two companies said their agreement would "help RIM further expand its business in China" by giving RIM RIM.TO access to Digital China's national distribution network. (Reporting by Chris Buckley and  Simon Rabinovitch ; editing by John Stonestreet)
