 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc won U.S. antitrust approval to take over railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp, the Federal Trade Commission said on Monday. 

 Berkshire is on track to buy the 77.4 percent of Burlington Northern it does not already own for $26.4 billion. The approval was announced in a list of deals cleared by U.S. antitrust regulators that the FTC issues several times a week. (Reporting by  Diane Bartz , editing by Gerald E. McCormick)
