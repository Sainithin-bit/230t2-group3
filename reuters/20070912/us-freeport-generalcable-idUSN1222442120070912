 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Cable Corp ( BGC.N ) said on Wednesday it would buy the global wire and cable business of Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc ( FCX.N ) for $735 million, expanding its reach into Latin America, Asia and Africa. 

 General Cable shares rose around 8 percent after the deal, and were among the top gainers on the New York Stock Exchange. General Cable Chief Executive Gregory Kenny said the deal would accelerate plans to expand into many of the world's faster growing emerging economies. "We are effectively merging one company principally concentrated in North America, Western Europe and Oceania with one focused in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia," he said in a statement. He said the move would also give General Cable additional capacity, helping it to expand cheaply and effectively into new markets. Freeport-McMoRan acquired the business in its $26 billion purchase of Phelps Dodge Corp in March and had said it intended to sell the unit as it tightened its focus on mining. General Cable said the purchase would contribute about $1.4 billion in revenue at current metal prices and would add 20 cents to 30 cents per share to results in the first full year after the deal is completed. General Cable will use its available cash, as well as a secured revolving line of credit and an additional interim loan from Merrill Lynch Capital Corp, to pay for the purchase. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter. Merrill Lynch was General Cable's financial advisor and BlackEagle Advisors LLC advised Freeport-McMoRan. General Cable shares were up $4.09 at $57.29 in midday trading on the NYSE. Freeport-McMoRan rose 87 cents to $92.84. (Reporting by  Matt Daily  and  Michael Erman )
