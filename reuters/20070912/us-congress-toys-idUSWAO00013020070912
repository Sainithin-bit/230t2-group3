 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Mattel Inc Chief Executive Robert Eckert apologized on Wednesday for three huge recalls this summer of Chinese-made toys tainted by lead paint and said the company supports strengthening the U.S. consumer product safety agency. 

 Mattel has beefed up its testing and safety systems after a "handful" of vendors broke Mattel's rules, Eckert said in remarks to a Senate subcommittee. "On behalf of Mattel I want to apologize again sincerely to every parent," Eckert told the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on financial services and general government. Toy safety and the role of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) have come under increased scrutiny after recent recalls of millions of Chinese-made toys by Mattel and other companies, mainly due to excessive levels of lead. Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, has introduced a bill to boost the agency's budget and increase the maximum penalty for companies failing to quickly report hazards to $20 million from $1.25 million. "This commission is significantly understaffed," said Durbin, displaying a photograph of a CPSC testing laboratory with boxes piled chaotically on a workbench. The CPSC had just one person responsible for toy safety, he said. Its laboratory is staffed by 30 technicians and engineers housed in a former missile station. CPSC Acting Chairman Nancy Nord told the subcommittee the agency had boosted its surveillance and enforcement activities with Chinese toy imports and was encouraging the toy industry to develop its own testing programs. "The CPSC's laboratory must be modernized and we've been talking to the Congress for a number of years about that," Nord said in response to questioning from Durbin. Retailer Toys "R" Us, which on Monday said it was increasing the frequency of safety checks on products in its stores, told the Senate panel it believed in a strong, well-financed CPSC. "We were frustrated by some of the large recalls earlier this year, especially by what appeared to be an unacceptably long timeframe between discovery of a problem and actual consumer recall," said Toys "R" Us Chief Executive Jerry Storch. Walt Disney Co has announced random tests of toys and Wal-Mart Stores Inc has said it is asking toy suppliers to resubmit testing documentation. Recalls of defective tires, pet food ingredients, toothpaste and seafood, although not covered by other agencies, have added to consumer anxiety about Chinese exports. "Made in China has now become a warning label," said Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas, the ranking Republican on the subcommittee. Durbin's bill would increase the CPSC's $63 million annual budget to $70 million in fiscal 2008, which begins on October 1, and to $100 million by 2012. Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said the CPSC opened its doors in 1974 with a staff of 786 and a budget of $34.7 million, the equivalent of about $125 million today. "Today the CPSC is a mere shadow of its former self," said Consumers Union Senior Product Safety Counsel Sally Greenberg, who said the agency had dwindled to about 400 employees. CPSC Commissioner Thomas Moore said the rule banning children's products with "lead-containing paint" has been on the books for 30 years. "There is absolutely no excuse for a violation of this regulation," Moore testified. He said the CPSC has been trying to get funding to modernize its laboratory since 1995, "yet we have never received any significant funding for that goal." Carter Keithley, president of the Toy Industry Association, reiterated his group's call for a mandatory program to require that all toys sold in the United States be subjected to standardized tests to ensure they are safe. Toys "R" Us is owned by a consortium that includes Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co and Vornado Realty Trust. (With additional reporting by Kevin Drawbaugh)
