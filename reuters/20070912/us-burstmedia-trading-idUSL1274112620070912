 LONDON  (Reuters) - U.S.-based online advertising firm Burst Media BRST.L said on Wednesday results for 2007 are likely to come in below market forecasts because of higher-than-expected ad campaign cancellations. 

 Burst, whose share price dropped 60 percent when it warned on 2006 profits almost a year ago, just five months after it floated, said it expects revenue of between $28.5 million and $29.5 million for the year to December 31, 2007. AIM-listed Burst now expects adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $2.4 million to $2.7 million, it said. House broker Altium Securities had previously expected adjusted pretax profit of $4 million on revenue of $31.4 million. The ad cancellations "appear to be a function of heightened competition as high profile players including Google and Yahoo look to increase their exposure to the fast growing online advertising space," said Altium analyst Roddy Davidson in a note as it cut its recommendation to hold from buy. Burst said the cancellations had happened since the company issued a trading statement six weeks ago which said it expected to meet 2007 expectations. The firm also posted half-year results on Wednesday which were broadly in line with Altium's expectations.
