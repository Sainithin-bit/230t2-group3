 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Retailer Toys "R" Us said on Wednesday that it is expanding its efforts to inform shoppers of the latest toy recalls after a slew of Chinese-made toys were pulled from store shelves this summer due to unsafe levels of lead paint. 

 The retailer said it has launched a toy safety Web site -- www.Toysrus.com/Safety -- that includes information about its safety procedures and specific recall information. Toys "R" Us also said it is introducing an e-mail notification system for recalls and adding bilingual recall notices. "We are also moving to require that our vendors submit to us certification of testing for each batch coming to Toys "R" Us," Chief Executive Jerry Storch said in prepared remarks to be given to a Senate subcommittee. Storch said the company favors legislation that would shorten the time between the identification of a potentially dangerous product and its eventual recall. Storch also called for products to be stamped with production codes, so potentially harmful items can be traced more effectively. Earlier this week the company said it would increase the frequency of safety checks done on products sold in its stores after millions of Chinese-made toys were recalled this summer due to dangerously high levels of lead paint. Last month, Toys "R" Us pulled Hamco Inc's Koala Baby, Especially for Baby and Disney Baby vinyl baby bibs from its shelves after an independent tester found they contained too much lead, which can cause brain damage in children. Toys "R" Us is owned by a consortium that includes Bain Capital Partners LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co and Vornado Realty Trust. (Reporting by  Nicole Maestri  and  Justin Grant )
