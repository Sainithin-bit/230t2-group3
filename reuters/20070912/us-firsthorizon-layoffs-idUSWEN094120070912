 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - First Horizon National Corp ( FHN.N ), the largest bank in Tennessee, said on Wednesday that it plans to eliminate at least 1,500 jobs by the middle of next year as it slashes its mortgage sales force and closes branches. 

 The bank added that it expected mortgage originations to decline significantly as it cuts up to 50 percent of its home loan sales staff. (Reporting by  Christian Plumb )
