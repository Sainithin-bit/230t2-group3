 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Mercedes will have to put its marketing might to work to ensure wary consumers embrace pricey technology that protects the environment, the marketing head for DaimlerChrysler's AIGn.DE premium division said on Wednesday. 

 Surveys show that around 80 percent of people surveyed will respond to the climate debate by simply driving less, Klaus Maier told Reuters at the Frankfurt International Motor Show. "Somewhat more than 10 percent are ready to invest more in environmentally friendly technology," he added. "We have to make environmentally friendly technology just as attractive and sell it with the same emotion and passion that we have had in the past for performance, engine capacity and other features." Mercedes presented 19 next-generation cars at the Frankfurt show that showcase fuel-saving technology, including hybrids and a hydrogen fuel cell car that emits only water. Maier said the cost of the technology meant Mercedes would have to charge more for the new models, but he did not say by how much.
