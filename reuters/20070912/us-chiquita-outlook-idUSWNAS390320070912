 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Chiquita Brands International Inc ( CQB.N ) on Wednesday said that it expects third-quarter sales to be up slightly, helped by higher banana prices, though costs for food safety and marketing in its packaged salads business will pressure margins. 

 The company, which sells fresh produce, also said that European competitors' banana supplies from the Caribbean were damaged by Hurricane Dean, causing a shortfall of about 6 percent to 8 percent of five million boxes of bananas shipped weekly to the European Union. The shortfall and resulting higher prices are likely to affect the European market for at least six to nine months, Chiquita said. Chiquita's own supplies in Central America were only minimally hurt by Hurricane Felix earlier this month, the company said. Chiquita said costs behind new products, food safety, marketing and merchandising expenses to drive a recovery in its Fresh Express salads business will be part of the reason operating expenses will be up by $30 million in the quarter. Fresh Express sales had been hurt in recent quarters by an industry-wide E. coli scare last September. The company said it still expects a modest improvement in third-quarter operating results year on year. In North America, banana prices in July and August were up 5 percent from a year earlier and sales volume rose 2 percent, the company said. Prices rose 17 percent on a U.S. dollar basis in the company's main European markets, which include much of the European Union, while volume was flat, the company said. Fresh Express salad business saw a 3 percent increase in net revenue per case, with volume up 1 percent. Chiquita shares were down 9 cents at $15.84 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock is down 1.13 percent this year, compared with a 3.5 percent increase in the Standard & Poor's packaged foods index .15GSPFOOD.
