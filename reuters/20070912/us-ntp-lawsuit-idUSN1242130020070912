 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NTP Inc, which last year won a $612.5 million settlement from the maker of Blackberry, has sued four of the top U.S. mobile service providers for infringing eight patents related to wireless e-mail. 

 The lawsuits, against Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel Corp ( S.N ), T-Mobile USA and the mobile unit of AT&T Inc ( T.N ) were filed September 7 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, according to court documents. NTP, which is asserting patents related to products, processes and services used for wireless e-mail systems, said it was seeking a jury trial, injunctive relief and monetary damages. The suits follow a case NTP brought against Treo mobile phone maker Palm Inc PALM.O in November last year. The judge in the Palm case granted a stay of the suit in March this year and agreed to strike an NTP complaint alleging misbehavior by Palm at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Virginia-based NTP is best known for its prolonged patent infringement battle with Research In Motion Ltd RIM.TO, maker of Blackberry, the popular wireless e-mail device. Officials for AT&T and Verizon Wireless, owned by Verizon Communications Inc ( VZ.N ) and Vodafone Group Plc ( VOD.L ), declined comment. Sprint and T-Mobile USA, owned by Deutsche Telekom AG ( DTEGn.DE ), were not immediately available. (Reporting by  Lewis Krauskopf  and  Sinead Carew )
