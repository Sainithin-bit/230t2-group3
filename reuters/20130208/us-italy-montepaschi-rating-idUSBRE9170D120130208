 MILAN  (Reuters) - DBRS Ratings Limited confirmed its long-term rating for Monte dei Paschi ( BMPS.MI ) at 'BBB' with a negative outlook, the troubled Italian lender said on Friday. 
 The short-term rating on debt and deposit was affirmed by `R-2 (mid)' with a stable outlook. The move came after the bank - at the center of a widening scandal because of concealed derivatives trades - said on Wednesday losses linked to three problematic derivative trades totaled 730 million euros, not far from preliminary estimates.
