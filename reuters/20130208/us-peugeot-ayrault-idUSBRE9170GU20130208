 GRENOBLE, France  (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said on Friday that PSA Peugeot Citroen ( PEUP.PA ) had not asked the state to take a stake in it and that the matter was not on the agenda. 
 The comment came a day after PSA, suffering falling sales in a depressed European car market, highlighted the scale of its woes by taking a 4.1 billion euro ($5.5 billion) write-down on the value of its plant and other automotive assets. (Reporting By Catherine Lagrange,; Writing by  Brian Love )
