 WASHINGTON/BANGALORE  (Reuters) - The Treasury confirmed on Friday it is reviewing its decision to award nearly $400 million in federal bailout funds to California lender City National Corp's ( CYN.N ) City National Bank. 

 "We are looking at the process of selection for City National Bank as a case study. It is not a reflection on the bank or a pre-judgment," Richard Delmar, counsel to the Treasury's Office of the Inspector General, told Reuters. Shares of City National fell as much as 6 percent in early morning trade Friday but were off almost 2 percent at $47.78 by midday on the New York Stock Exchange. News of the probe comes amid criticism from U.S. lawmakers over the lack of transparency in the Treasury's selection process for $250 billion in capital injections from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the $700 billion bailout fund approved by Congress in October. Many have complained that banks were hoarding TARP funds or were using them for acquisitions instead of making loans that could help the economy. One particular case that drew the ire of Ohio lawmakers was the denial of TARP funds requested by the National City Corp in Cleveland. The Treasury instead gave $7 billion to Pittsburgh-based PNC Corp ( PNC.N ) to help it acquire National City, a deal that was completed on Wednesday. "Treasury is picking winners and losers. They picked National City Bank, with its 163-year history in Cleveland, to be a loser," Rep. Dennis Kucinich, an Ohio Democrat, said in a statement in November. The selection process could become even more crucial for banks that have yet to receive federal funds in coming weeks, because with the payment of $6 billion in aid for GMAC LLC, the Treasury has now allocated more than the first $350 billion tranche of the TARP fund. Unless Congress approves the second $350 billion, some banks requesting funds could be shut out. FTN Midwest analyst Brett Rabatin said the Treasury probe does not relate to City National in particular and the Treasury is just looking at the bank to determine how the bailout program is working in healthy institutions and how it could be improved. The reason for the study is that the government wants the TARP program to work faster than it is happening at the moment, Rabatin told Reuters. A City National spokesperson said the company would respond to queries about the probe at a later time. In October, the Treasury said it would infuse $395 million in the Beverly Hills bank as part of the government's $250 billion bailout program. City National is sometimes called "bank to the stars" due to its heavy concentration of loans and wealth management clients in the entertainment industry. However, in an interview with Reuters on October 27, City National Chief Executive Russell Goldsmith had said the bank was under no requirement to increase lending. Goldsmith had also said that the company planned to use some funds to make acquisitions and was "not aware of any focused kind of requirements that are that detailed." FTN Midwest's Rabatin said the company may look at acquisitions if something fits really well. "I don't think pressure from the Treasury changes their overall strategy."
