 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Yucaipa Cos, a private equity firm controlled by billionaire Ron Burkle, said on Friday it had acquired an 8.3 percent stake in bookseller Barnes & Noble Inc ( BKS.N ), saying it believed the shares were undervalued. 

 Yucaipa funds said it had bought about 4.58 million shares since November 24 for about $67.3 million, net of commissions, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Yucaipa said it would hold the shares as an investment, but would "closely monitor the company's performance and may modify their plans in the future." Barnes & Noble shares were unchanged at $15.32 after-hours from their close on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's stock sank to nearly $12 after reporting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss and cutting its full year forecast on November 20.
