 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - An investor has sued for the return of $10 million wired to the firm of accused fraudster Bernard Madoff six days before he was arrested, claiming Madoff made up a transaction using the money. 

 The complaint filed on Thursday by Rosenman Family LLC said its managing member Martin Rosenman talked to Madoff on the telephone on December 3 about investing in his fund. Madoff told Rosenman the fund was closed until January 1, but he could wire money to an account where it would be held, the complaint in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan said. It said Rosenman transferred $10 million to a JPMorgan Chase account on December 5. Rosenman received a "confirmation" of the transaction on December 9 from Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities (BMIS) stating Rosenman Family LLC sold short $10 million in U.S. Treasury Bills that mature on March 26, 2009. "Mr Rosenman never authorized this transaction," the complaint said. It said multiple electronic searches for securities under the identification number given by BMIS with the confirmation "have shown that it does not exist. "In other words, BMIS never transacted a trade of U.S. Treasury Bills on Family's behalf." On December 11, Madoff was arrested and charged with securities fraud after authorities said he admitted to running a scheme that had lost $50 billion over many years. Madoff is under house arrest and faces criminal and civil charges. Madoff's firm is being liquidated under court-appointed trustee Irving Picard, a lawyer. Rosenman, who is also president of the Stuyvesant Fuel Service Corp in New York, sued Picard and JP Morgan Chase Bank for recovery of his money. A lawyer for Picard declined to comment. Rosenman's lawyer said on Friday that his client was not available. A spokesman for the bank declined comment. "Family seeks a mandatory injunction requiring Chase to turn over $10 million," the January 1 complaint said. "Family demands judgment that the funds deposited by Family in the Chase Account on December 5, 2008 are not property of the debtor's estate and the debtor has no interest in these funds." The complaint said Rosenman had neither invested nor conducted business with Madoff or his firm before the December 3 phone conversation. The cases: Rosenman Family LLC v Irving Picard, as Trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC and JP Morgan Chase Bank - number not yet assigned; U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). Securities Investor Protection Corp v. Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, 08-01789, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan). (Reporting by Grant McCool; Editing by  Andre Grenon )
