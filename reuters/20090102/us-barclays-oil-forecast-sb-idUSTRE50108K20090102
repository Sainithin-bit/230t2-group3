 SINGAPORE  (Reuters) - Barclays Capital stood by its forecast of $76 a barrel for average U.S. crude in 2009, saying improving demand and a supply slide will combine to buoy oil prices. 

 The forecast, at more than $17 above a consensus $58.48 in the most recent Reuters poll, was among the highest in the survey of 30 analysts. Morgan Stanley topped the list at $82. <O/POLL> Barclays, a stalwart bull, was one of the first to predict oil's years-long rally more than five years ago. "Consensus is way, way, way wrong in terms of supply, demand and price," Barclays analyst Paul Horsnell said in the latest review of weekly oil data. "We'll stick to our $76 per barrel for the moment on the basis that demand will look better over time than is embedded in current perceptions, and that supply-side dynamics will look dramatically worse," he said in the note. He said the U.S. fall in demand in October -- 4.1 percent versus original estimates of 7 percent -- was the slowest since April and much better than September's 12.8 percent decline. U.K. oil demand too showed a recovery, with inland deliveries for October at a slight 0.3 percent growth year-on-year, reversing falls of 10 percent and 4.7 percent in August and September, respectively. "The supply indications, however, are worse, and the mounting evidence of sharp falls in OPEC output...make us suspect that the global market is likely to tighten appreciably next quarter," Horsnell said. To combat the slump in demand and oil prices, OPEC agreed last month to cut output 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), its steepest reduction ever, taking its total reduction since September to the equivalent of 5 percent of world supply. Oil kicked off 2009 on a weak note on Friday, falling by more than 4 percent as traders bet a late-day rally that drove prices 14 percent higher on Wednesday was overdone. <O/R> Record high prices last year and the deepening economic recession had knocked crude off by more than $100 from its peak above $147 hit in July. "One of the pure joys of the oil market is that the path it takes tends to be almost deliciously surreal and counterintuitive," Horsnell said. "If at the start of the average year this decade you had been able to state precisely what was going to happen, it would have seemed ludicrous."
