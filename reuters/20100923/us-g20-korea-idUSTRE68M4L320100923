 PARIS  (Reuters) - Korean Finance Minister Yoon Jeung-hyun said on Thursday it would not be appropriate for a G20 summit in Korea this year to discuss the level of China's yuan currency despite U.S. pressure for faster appreciation. 

 Yoon, currently on a tour of G20 nations to prepare the groundwork for the November summit in Seoul, told Reuters in an interview he believed the meeting would endorse the Basel III deal on bank capital ratios agreed by regulators this month. But he said there was not much support within the G20 for a global tax on financial transactions, which has been floated by leaders, including French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. He also said designing measures to address the risk posed by banks considered too big to fail, which the G20 has entrusted to the Financial Stability Board, "will take some time." Asked whether calls by U.S. officials for China to let its currency appreciate more rapidly would be discussed in Korea, Yoon said: "By the nature of the G20, which is an open forum, we may discuss, for example, the general approach toward foreign exchange rates ... or the impact foreign exchange could have on the global economy. "But aside from that, I do not believe that it is appropriate to have a discussion regarding the foreign exchange rate or level of a specific country," Yoon said in comments translated from Korean by his official interpreter. President Barack Obama, who met Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Thursday on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly, said on Monday that China had not done enough to raise the value of the yuan since allowing it to appreciate in recent weeks. EXPECTS DEAL ON IMF REFORM Korea's Yoon said he expected an agreement would be reached in Korea before the summit on reform of the IMF Executive Board and its quota system, which big G20 emerging economies say underestimate their importance. "These issues, the key (IMF) issues, will be dealt with in a package approach," said Yoon. "I believe that those issues regarding the IMF and its reform will come to a conclusion in Korea before the Seoul summit." Emerging economies have pressed for the issue of board seats to be dealt with as a package together with quotas. Washington has been ratcheting up pressure on reluctant Europeans -- who hold several of the board's 24 seats -- to relinquish some. There is already a global consensus for over-represented developed countries to cede roughly 5 percent of the IMF's quota to under-represented developing countries. Yoon said emerging economies were also pushing for the IMF to adopt a kind of financial safety net, the Global Stabilisation Mechanism, to provide proactive financing to prevent the spread of contagion in systemic regional crises. "The advanced economies are concerned that this may lead to moral hazard or risk-taking behavior by some countries," Yoon said, adding Korea would consult with the IMF on ways of mitigating this threat. "We will make this a proposal (to the G20) and hopefully this will be accepted and agreed on." (Reporting by Daniel Flynn; Editing by Ron Askew and Kenneth Barry)
