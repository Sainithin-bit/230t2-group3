 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said in a meeting on Thursday with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao that China needed to do more to resolve a dispute over the value of the Chinese currency, a senior U.S. official said. 

 Obama told Wen in their bilateral talks on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly that the currency was the "most important issue" of their meeting, the official said.
