 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Adecco SA ( ADEN.VX ), the world's largest staffing company, hit an upbeat note about temping demand, suggesting companies are still hiring despite signs the global economic recovery remains fragile. 

 Concerns are mounting about the health of the world's economy in the wake of the European sovereign debt crisis and as the recovery in the United States, considered a harbinger for many other countries, loses momentum. But Swiss-based Adecco's comments could soothe worries as temporary employment is often seen as a leading indicator for future jobs growth and a bellwether for economies as a whole. "Demand remained robust across most markets with no signs of a slowdown and management continues to be confident in healthy demand progression near term," the company said in a statement ahead of an investor event in Miami from September 23 to 24. Economists are grappling with mixed signs about the strength of the recovery. Services and manufacturing businesses in the euro zone are more optimistic about the future, surveys showed on Thursday, despite the fact growth in those sectors slowed much more than expected this month, stoking concerns about Europe's recovery. DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH "Adecco's comments are certainly positive. Generally we had a very strong first half and if a globally operating company has this impression, then that is certainly encouraging," said Credit Suisse economist Fabian Heller. "What we stress is that indicators are flattening, but on a high level. We don't see a double-dip scenario, but growth figures will generally come in lower in the second half than in the first half and we also see some easing of growth next year. We continue to expect the recovery will remain in place," he said. At 0958 GMT, shares in Adecco were trading 0.4 percent lower, largely in line with the 0.6 percent drop in the industrial goods and services index .SXNP as worries about the economy weighed on shares across Europe. Adecco's comments contrast with those of U.S.-listed Manpower ( MAN.N ), which recently issued a survey showing global employers remain wary about expanding staff, with the fourth-quarter hiring outlook dipping slightly in the United States and Germany. Adecco caters to a large variety of segments, with industrial workers accounting for nearly half of its revenue and office and IT workers the next biggest segment. Its biggest markets are France and North America. Adecco, which also competes with Dutch group Randstad ( RAND.AS ), said sales had risen around 16 percent in the first two months of the third quarter, compared with a year before, when adjusted for business days, in line with the level recorded in June. The group, which will provide personnel for the London Olympics in 2012, said it was still committed to its mid-term EBITA (earnings before interest and tax) margin target of above 5.5 percent.
