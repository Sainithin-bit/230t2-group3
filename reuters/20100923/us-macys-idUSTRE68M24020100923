 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Macy's Inc ( M.N ) said it plans to hire about 65,000 seasonal staff for the holiday season -- a slight increase from previous years. The rise in hiring reflects Macy's expectation that same-store sales will grow 3-3.5 percent in the second half of fiscal 2010, the company said in a statement. 

 Macy's will hire the staff in its stores, call centers, distribution centers and online fulfillment centers throughout the United States. The company, which employs about 161,000 staff on a year-round basis, said most of the seasonal positions were part-time. Shares of Macy's closed at $22.00 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. They have risen about 43 percent in value since touching a year-low in February. (Reporting by Mihir Dalal in Bangalore; Editing by Anne Pallivathuckal)
