 SYDNEY/TORONTO  (Reuters) - Potash Corp ( POT.N ) ( POT.TO ) has sued BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) in the United States, seeking to block the miner's $39 billion hostile bid for the world's largest fertilser producer. 

 Potash's U.S.-listed shares closed at $146.3 on Wednesday, 12.5 percent above BHP's $130 per share offer, suggesting investors anticipate a higher bid. With competing bids a possibility, here are some scenarios that might play out. CHINA COUNTERBID Probability: Most likely China's state-owned chemicals group Sinochem Corp has hired banks to advise it on how to foil BHP's bid, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter. China, as a top consumer of potash, wants to keep prices low for the vital crop nutrient and does not want Potash to fall into BHP's hands. But its options are seen as being limited due to Sinochem's lack of financial firepower and potential Canadian regulatory obstacles, and it is not clear whether Sinochem will successfully put together a competing offer. Sinochem is expected to link up with a Chinese partner and find other foreign partners to form a consortium. Sinochem has reached out to large investors such as Singapore's Temasek TEM.UL, sources said. Canadian public sector fund manager Alberta Investment Management Corp said it was approached by Chinese parties looking to broker a bid for Potash. COURT RULES AGAINST POTASH Probability: Most likely Potash filed a lawsuit against BHP on Wednesday with a U.S. District Court alleging the miner misrepresented material facts related to its bid. The court is expected to decide on the matter before the bid deadline of November 18. Potash is seeking an injunction which, if successful, could delay the offer by 60 days and force BHP to provide more information relating to its offer. Legal experts say the move is a common stalling tactic while the target tries to find a rival suitor. "Litigation ... accomplishes only modest goals of giving the target a window into the bidder and some delay, some smoke," said John Coffee, a professor at Columbia Law School in New York. "It is very unlikely to result in a permanent injunction that ends the contest." BHP says the legal action will not affect the process. Potash is not seeking damages. HOSTILE SHOWDOWN Probability: Highly likely BHP might persist with its hostile bid and hope Potash shareholders will be convinced of the bid's merits. For now, Potash is sticking with its "just say no" defense. Potash shareholders had indicated they would need BHP to raise its $130 per share bid to $162 a share before accepting an offer, according to a Reuters poll last month. If BHP raises its bid, but still can't win over Potash's board, it may again take its higher bid directly to shareholders. POTASH FORMS A JOINT VENTURE Probability: Possible Potash could foil BHP's takeover attempt by selling a portion of its assets into a joint venture at a price that implies a substantially higher value for the whole company than BHP's current bid. Sinochem, China's top fertilizer maker and its No. 4 oil company, is seen as a likely joint-venture partner, especially given that regulators are expected to take a tough stance if a Chinese entity bids to acquire the whole company. A Chinese company would ideally seek a supply agreement deal with Potash in the event of a joint venture. However, any agreement on this would have to be structured around Canpotex -- the international marketing arm of potash producers Potash, Mosaic Co ( MOS.N ) and Agrium Inc ( AGU.TO ). Some analysts also believe a consortium of companies may consider the joint-venture model if they are unable to secure enough capital for an all-out bid. BHP WALKS AWAY Probability: Possible BHP has a history of being conservative and disciplined on takeovers. In this scenario, it can abandon the bid just as it did with its attempt to take over Rio Tinto ( RIO.L ). Alternatively, BHP can raise its bid, but after surveying shareholders, find it would be unsuccessful and back out. BHP Chief Executive Marius Kloppers will want to avoid a replay of Rio Tinto's 2007 takeover of Canadian aluminum company Alcan, in which Rio got caught up in a bidding war at the height of the commodities boom. OTHER WHITE KNIGHTS Probability: Unlikely Analysts and investment bankers said that of the global miners, only Rio Tinto and Brazil's Vale ( VALE5.SA ) are big enough to consider bids on their own. Vale has said it is not planning a bid for the company. It already has some potash assets, and is under heavy political pressure to invest in Brazil. Rio Tinto is also viewed as being a long-shot bidder. It recently sold potash assets and is still recovering from its ill-timed $38 billion takeover of Canadian aluminum group Alcan at the top of the commodities cycle in 2007. A NEGOTIATED DEAL Probability: Possible but unlikely This outcome is only possible if BHP is willing to substantially raise its bid for Potash. Some analysts argue that it would take an offer of at least $150 a share, while others say Potash's net asset value alone is in the region of $160 to $170 a share. Potash shares touched a high of $240 in 2008. Some analysts say a deal above $165 a share would hurt earnings, but those levels are unlikely. However, the BHP bid faces an obstacle -- formal approval by its own shareholders -- if it sweetens its offer by more than 22 percent.
