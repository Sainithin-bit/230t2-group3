 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The 50 some venues where U.S. stocks can now trade are due for a pruning, industry executives said on Thursday, citing both free market forces and new rules expected in the wake of the May "flash crash." 

 The rapid breakdown on May 6 has been blamed in part on the sharp fragmentation in the marketplace, where sell and buy orders are electronically routed to the exchange or alternative venue with the best bid or offer. U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro on Wednesday amplified concerns the agency raised earlier this year, telling the Security Traders Association conference she is concerned that the dozens of venues make the marketplace as a whole too complex. Market participants on Thursday said a contraction was very likely. "If you're going to have a competitive market, you're going to have venues that start small, may get bigger, may not get bigger. But at some point capitalist forces will force people to ... shut down." Joe Mecane, chief administrative officer of U.S. markets at exchange operator NYSE Euronext NYX.N, said at the conference. There are now 11 operational exchanges, with two more set to launch next month. Besides those displayed venues, there are nearly 40 alternative trading systems, many of which are anonymous systems that do not display quotes or public prices. Additionally, Schapiro said there are more than 200 broker dealers, such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc ( GS.N ) and Credit Suisse Group AG ( CSGN.VX ), that execute orders in-house -- something known as internalization. The market landscape looks little like it did 15 years ago, when the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market were the dominant public exchanges. "Don't forget, the brokers didn't want the duopoly. They wanted more competition," said Brian Hyndman, senior vice president of transaction services at Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. ( NDAQ.O ) "Clearly the pendulum has swung too far." DISPERSED LIQUIDITY Following the flash crash, regulators and others pointed to the lack of coordinated rules among exchanges as a partial cause. Others wondered whether liquidity -- or the availability of standing buy and sell orders -- would have dried up so dramatically if it wasn't dispersed so broadly. Tom Gira, executive vice president for market regulation at the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, said: "What we're dealing with is more of uncoordinated markets in the sense of rules, where you can have liquidity gaps like we saw on May 6." Nasdaq OMX received SEC approval last week for its PSX exchange, the company's third, which is set to launch early next month. Once broker-owned BATS Global Markets launches its planned second exchange in October, all four of the main exchange operators will run multiple venues. Any pruning is unlikely to come among the formal exchanges, but rather among the alternative venues that have grown popular with institutions looking to trade larger blocks of stocks. Nearly a year ago, the SEC proposed tighter rules for so-called dark pools, these anonymous venues that allow investors to hide their intentions from the broader market. The flash crash, which has already spawned a handful of rule proposals, could target fragmentation even more. "Several of the existing proposals that the SEC has in place already should address many of these themes," Michael Masone, a counsel in Citigroup Inc's ( C.N ) equities division, said of market fragmentation. "The dark pools proposal in and of itself, along with purely economic forces, should likely facilitate consolidation among dark pools and lead to less market fragmentation."
