 SAO PAULO  (Reuters) - Banks managing the record-setting stock sale by Brazil's state-run oil giant Petrobras will earn more in fees from the deal than in any other share offering in the country. 

 Still, the real prize may be further down the road. The experience of handling the world's largest-ever stock sale, estimated at nearly $79 billion, could help banks deepen their relationship with large fund managers and sovereign wealth funds. A successful transaction might also work to the advantage of the underwriters in winning new business from a big client like Petrobras ( PETR4.SA )( PBR.N ), ranging from takeovers to global bond sales. Bankers pitching the Petrobras deal will gain priceless knowledge on what investors from Beijing to Boston and Mumbai to Dubai want to buy, how much they want and what they're willing to pay, paving the way for a series of other transactions in the near term. "This deal is priceless, you could do it for free," said Rodolfo Riechert, chief executive of securities firm Plural Capital in Sao Paulo and a former head of investment banking at Banco Pactual. "It's not about the league table rankings. You have all these interactions with the government, Petrobras, funds, the entire market. You know what's really happening and that gives you a huge competitive advantage on future deals." Underwriters stand to earn as much as 281 million reais ($163.3 million) from the offering, with a fee ratio of 0.21 percent of the total sale, according to the Petrobras prospectus. The Petrobras fee ratio would be one of the lowest recently and compares to the 0.5 percent state-run Banco do Brasil ( BBAS3.SA ) paid for its 9.8 billion-real follow-on share sale in June and an average of about 4 percent for previous stock offerings this year in Brazil, Latin America's largest economy and home to the region's hottest capital markets. DUKING IT OUT Banco Bradesco BBI, the investment banking arm of Banco Bradesco ( BBDC4.SA )( BBD.N ), is the lead manager of the offering. Bank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC.N ), Citigroup ( C.N ), Santander ( SAN.MC ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and Itau BBA, the wholesale banking arm of Itau Unibanco ( ITUB4.SA )( ITUB.N ), will act as global bookrunners of the deal. Winning the Petrobras mandate will catapult Itau BBA, Bradesco, Citigroup and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to the top of the stock underwriting ranks in Brazil. Local investment bank BTG Pactual BTG.UL, owned by Brazilian billionaire Andre Esteves, leads the ranking now, followed by Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) and JPMorgan ( JPM.N ), respectively, according to Thomson Reuters data. Petrobras also hired 12 more banks to help underwrite the massive offering, including Banco do Brasil to run the sale for retail investors in Brazil and large international firms such as Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) and ICBC International, the investment bank unit of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( 1398.HK ) ( 601398.SS ). "A deal of this magnitude is duked out by everyone, no one wants to be excluded," said Luiz Fernando Resende, founder of boutique firm SRB Banco de Negocios and former head of investment banking at Santander in Brazil. Competition among banks was probably one of the factors driving down the fee ratio on the Petrobras offering, Resende added. Despite the work to distribute such a large offering among investors around the globe, the resulting new business makes it more than worth it, he said. "You have a track record, you have that experience and can show people you can do relatively large deals," Resende said. "It could help you win future business."
