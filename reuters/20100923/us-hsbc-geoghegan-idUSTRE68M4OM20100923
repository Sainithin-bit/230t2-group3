 LONDON  (Reuters) - HSBC Holdings ( HSBA.L ) Chief Executive Michael Geoghegan is to step down at the end of this year, the Financial Times reported on its website on Thursday, citing two unnamed people close to the bank's board. 

 The report said he will be replaced by Stuart Gulliver, head of the group's investment bank. The bank's finance director Douglas Flint will take over as chairman at the same time. An HSBC spokesman declined to comment on the report. Geoghegan had threatened to leave after reacting badly when he was told at a meeting last week that the board was not ready to give him the chairmanship, the newspaper reported earlier this week. Europe's biggest bank had been expected to decide at a board meeting in Shanghai next week on a replacement for Chairman Stephen Green, who is leaving to become Britain's trade and investment minister in January. HSBC has a history of promoting its CEO to the chairmanship, and Geoghegan, who has been at the bank for 37 years, had been seen as one of the two leading contenders for the job.
