 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Short interest on the Nasdaq ticked down in the second half of January, the exchange said on Wednesday. 

 Through January 31, short interest edged 0.43 percent lower to 6.48 billion shares, compared with 6.51 billion shares as of January 14. This is 2.97 days' average daily volume, compared with an average of 4.14 days for the previous reporting period, the exchange said. Investors who sell securities short seek to profit from a decline in their prices. Short-sellers borrow shares and then sell them in hope of buying them back at a cheaper price, pocketing the difference. (Reporting by  Rodrigo Campos ,Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
