 LONDON  (Reuters) - The largest McDonald's franchisee globally is planning a U.S. listing that could raise as much as $1 billion (622 million pounds), the Financial Times said on Wednesday. 

 Arcos Dorados might file for an initial public offering within days and could start trading in New York in April, the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources. The company has appointed Bank of America ( BAC.N ), Morgan Stanley ( MS.N ) and JPMorgan ( JUSRX.O ) as underwriters on the offering, the newspaper said.
