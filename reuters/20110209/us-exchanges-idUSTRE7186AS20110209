 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Major global stock exchanges have been losing market share to smaller rivals in recent years, as traders turn to alternatives that operate faster, cheaper and often less transparent venues. 

 Recouping that lost market share is one driving factor behind the recent wave of deals sweeping the exchange sector, with the London Stock Exchange agreeing to take over TMX Group, which runs the Toronto Stock Exchange, and Germany's Deutsche Boerse in advanced talks to buy Big Board operator NYSE Euronext. Here is a look at some market share figures from the merging companies: LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE: The LSE's share of UK equity trading in February 2011 has been 54.9 percent, down from 96.3 percent in February 2008, according to Thomson Reuters data. TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE: TSE's market share dropped from nearly 100 percent in 2007 to 72.6 percent in 2010, according to data from Macquarie Securities. DEUTSCHE BOERSE: Deutsche-Boerse's U.S. options market, International Securities Exchange, handled 17.5 percent of total U.S. stock-options trading in January, down from 28 percent two years earlier. NYSE EURONEXT: The New York Stock Exchange handled 35 percent of NYSE-listed shares in December. That's down just slightly from a year earlier, but reflects massive erosion over the years from competitors like Nasdaq OMX Group as well as smaller, private rivals.
