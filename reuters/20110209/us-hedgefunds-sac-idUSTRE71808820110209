 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The government's big insider trading investigation ensnared its first hedge fund managers on Tuesday, as U.S. prosecutors charged three managers and one analyst with insider trading. Two of those charged were former employees of Steven A. Cohen's $12 billion SAC Capital Advisers, one of the biggest hedge funds in the world. 

 The following lists some of the links that have emerged to the fund in the probe: * Noah Freeman, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital, has agreed to plead guilty to charges related to insider trading and is cooperating with the investigation. * Donald Longueuil, a former hedge fund manager at SAC Capital, was arrested Tuesday morning at his Manhattan home on charges of conspiracy and obstruction of justice in the insider trading probe. * SAC Capital said in a statement on Tuesday that the firm is "outraged" by the alleged actions of two former employees in the insider trading probe. * Two of the hedge funds raided in November as part of the probe were Diamondback Capital Management LLC and Level Global Investors LP. Both funds are based in Connecticut and run by former managers of SAC Capital. * SAC had its records subpoenaed by the U.S. Attorney in Manhattan as part of the investigation after the FBI conducted raids of several hedge funds in November. * Cohen told investors in a letter last month that they would not suffer losses or incur costs related to the government inquiry and that the management company would bear any expense, according to the Financial Times. * John Kinnucan, the Portland, Oregon-based research analyst who refused an FBI request to wear a wire as part of the probe, sent an email to his hedge fund clients warning them an investigation was under way. Some of the funds mentioned in the email: SAC, Citadel, Level Global, and Maverick Capital. * Richard Choo-Beng Lee, a former SAC trader and hedge fund manager who pleaded guilty to insider trading as part of the Galleon Management hedge fund cases last year, has also been a key witness in the recent round of arrests. As part of his plea deal, Choo-Beng Lee has agreed to tell prosecutors of any insider trading he may have done at SAC when he worked at the hedge fund from 1999 to 2004. * Jonathan Hollander, a 34-year-old former analyst at SAC, was tipped by a former Blackstone Group investment banker about the 2006 buyout of the Albertson's supermarket chain and traded on the inside information, according to people familiar with the matter. SAC investigated the situation itself, presented the findings to government authorities in February 2009, and is cooperating with the government in the case. Prosecutors have not charged Hollander with any wrongdoing. (Compiled by Emily Chasan)
