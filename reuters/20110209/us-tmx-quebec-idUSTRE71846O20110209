 OTTAWA  (Reuters) - Quebec's securities regulator has the authority to block the London Stock Exchange's takeover offer for the TMX Group, Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachand said on Wednesday. 

 "The transaction is subject to the approval of the Autorite des marches financiers (Quebec's regulator)," Bachand said in a French-language statement that cited promises made when the Toronto Stock Exchange took over the Montreal Stock Exchange in 2008 and formed the TMX Group. "We are going to take our time to study the details of this transaction to be sure that this meets Quebec's economic needs. We need to assure that access to capital is maintained for Quebec businesses, if not improved." Bachand asked the Quebec regulator to hold public hearings on the proposed merger. Demonstrating Quebec's often-seen desire to stake an independent line, he said the proposed deal showed the importance of having a strong local regulator to protect Quebec investors' interests. The Canadian government has been pushing for one national regulator. (Reporting by  Randall Palmer ; editing by Peter Galloway)
