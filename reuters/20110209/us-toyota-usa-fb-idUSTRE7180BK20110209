 (Reuters) - A government investigation cleared Toyota Motor Corp's electronics of causing unintended acceleration, a big victory for the world's top automaker, struggling with the impact of the safety crisis on sales and its reputation. 

 The findings supported Toyota's position that it had identified and fixed the only known safety problems related to two massive recalls in 2009 and 2010. Regulators say driver error may be behind many complaints. The following are other important developments in the Toyota recall saga: ______ * Toyota recalls 3.8 million vehicles in October 2009 in the United States to address the risk that floormats could trap the accelerator pedal in an open position. The recall is expanded in January 2010 to more than 5 million vehicles. * Later in January, Toyota announces recall for about 2.3 million models to fix sticky pedals. Toyota halts U.S. sales of eight models, including its best-selling Camry and Corolla sedans, and says it will halt production for the first week of February until recall fix developed. * The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in February renews its investigation into Toyota's electronic throttle control system. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood warns recalled Toyota owners to stop driving, then withdraws his remarks, saying it was a misstatement. * Toyota President Akio Toyoda and top North American executive Yoshimi Inaba testify February 25 before U.S. lawmakers on recalls and expresses remorse about accidents blamed on runaway acceleration. They say Toyota's race to become a top global producer led to compromised quality and safety and they will work to restore their customers' trust. * NHTSA said in March it would tap the expertise of the country's top space and aeronautics experts to analyze Toyota electronic throttles to see if they are behind the reports of unintended acceleration that have hounded the automaker. Toyota launches a task force aimed at regaining consumer trust. * Toyota agreed in December to pay the maximum fine of $32.4 million related to two U.S. probes into its handling of recalls. The fines center on allegations by the U.S. government that initial action taken by Toyota to address safety problems was insufficient and the required notification of problems to regulators was not timely, as required by law. Toyota agrees to another $16 million fine over a third recall involving steering rods in certain trucks. * Toyota was the only major automaker to lose ground on sales in the United States last year although some blame the safety crisis for just part of its slump. Sales in January kept pace with other automakers but prompted new discounts for Toyotas. Toyota lost U.S. share in 2010 as sales fell 0.4 percent while overall industry sales rose 11.1 percent. Toyota said its global sales grew 8 percent year over year to 8.418 million vehicles, helping it keep its No 1 ranking. * U.S. officials have been looking into 89 deaths that may be associated with sudden acceleration in Toyota and Lexus vehicles. Only a handful of fatalities have been definitively linked to the problem by authorities, including four in the crash of Lexus sedan in California in August 2009 that was blamed on a jammed floor mat.
