 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - The Boeing Co ( BA.N ) on Wednesday said it would deliver the first 787 Dreamliner aircraft to Air India in the fourth quarter of 2011, indicating a further delay from its prior delivery estimates. 

 In November, the state-run Indian carrier said it expected to take delivery of its first Dreamliner plane in June 2011, already delayed from an earlier estimate of April 2011. Air India is entitled to compensation by Boeing for delays in delivery, the world's second-largest aircraft maker's India head Dinesh Keskar said in August. Air India has said it has plans to buy 27 Dreamliners from Boeing in phases. Boeing mentioned the new delivery timeline in a statement issued at the biennial Indian air show in the southern city of Bangalore, where it is displaying its F/A-18 Super Hornet. The Hornet is competing for an $11 billion Indian contract for 126 fighter jets. (Reporting by  Jui Chakravorty ; Editing by Aradhana Aravindan)
