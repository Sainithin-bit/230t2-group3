 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Apple has begun to make a new version of its iPad tablet computer with a front-facing camera and faster processor, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 The new iPad will be thinner and lighter than the first model and sport a more powerful graphics processor, the Journal said. It will have at least one camera on its front for features such as video conferencing, and will also have more memory, according to the paper, adding Apple plans to unveil the new iPad through Verizon Wireless and AT&T. Early in February, a Reuters eyewitness saw what appeared to be a working model of the next iPad with a front-facing camera at the top edge of the glass screen at a press conference to mark the debut of News Corp's Daily online paper in New York. Apple was not available for comment. (Reporting by  Sakthi Prasad  in Bangalore; Editing by Dan Lalor)
