 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. LEH.N is looking at boosting its investment management business overseas, and may do so through acquisitions, the company's chief financial officer said. 

 Lehman's assets under management grew by nearly 40 percent during the second quarter, to $263 billion, but more than 80 percent of those assets, and more than 80 percent of the firm's revenue from investment management, are from the United States, Lehman CFO Christopher O'Meara said in an interview. "We're encouraged by what we've been able to do with our investment management business in the U.S., and we see an opportunity to diversify that business further," O'Meara said. Many Wall Street managers are boosting their asset management businesses, which can offer relatively stable returns compared with securities trading. Also, in theory, an investment management business can generate revenue for other parts of the bank, and vice versa. For example, investment bankers can introduce high-net-worth chief executives to a private bank. And fixed-income departments can sell bonds securitizing a fund managed by the investment manager. Lehman as a whole has grown less dependent on the United States as a revenue source. In its fiscal second quarter ended May 31, 48 percent of the company's revenues were from outside the United States, compared with 37 percent for the whole of fiscal 2006. The company wants its investment management business to follow that trajectory, and is adding staff in Europe and, to a lesser extent, Asia, O'Meara said. Acquisitions are also possible, if Lehman can find the right assets at the right price, O'Meara said. He declined to comment more specifically on deals that may be under consideration. Lehman jump-started its U.S. investment management business in 2003 when it acquired Neuberger Berman for about $3.1 billion, which more than doubled Lehman's assets under management to over $100 billion.
