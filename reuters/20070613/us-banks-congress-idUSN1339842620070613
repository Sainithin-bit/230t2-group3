 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A senior House Democrat warned the Federal Reserve on Wednesday to protect consumers against unfair banking and mortgage practices or Congress will give that power to another federal agency. 

 "I just want to put you on notice," Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told Fed Governor Randall Kroszner at a hearing on consumer protection regulations. "If the Fed doesn't start to use that authority to roll out the rules, then we will give it to somebody who will use it," added the Massachusetts Democrat. Frank held the hearing almost two months after the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that blocked state efforts to enforce strict consumer protection laws for mortgage units owned by national banks. Kroszner will chair a Fed hearing on Thursday on its enforcement of the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act (HOEPA), which gives the central bank broad authority to prohibit unfair lending practices. He told Frank the central bank takes very seriously the issue of consumer protection. Kroszner also said the Fed is considering whether it should ban some mortgage lending practices that fueled the recent housing market boom. John Dugan, who heads the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), suggested that federal agencies write regulations defining "unfair and deceptive practices," a term that Kroszner said depends on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. But Frank said the Fed should use its rule-making authority to protect consumers, especially in the aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling that eroded the states' enforcement powers. "I don't think case-by-case does it," Frank said. "You reinforce my sense that the Fed is not the best place to do consumer protection." Frank asked federal regulators which agency should be given the power to police mortgage providers that are not insured by the federal government. "We're going to have to create some new rules about subprime" lending to borrowers with poor credit history, he said. During the hearing, Frank criticized the OCC for not doing enough to protect consumers. The OCC regulates national banks. Dugan said the agency has a strong supervisory program, which means fewer enforcement cases arise. He also said the OCC follows the standards of determining what is unfair to consumers based on the Federal Trade Commission Act. "We will rewrite the Federal Trade Commission Act with Mr. Dingell's cooperation," Frank said. He was referring to Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over the FTC and also consumer protection. MORTGAGE BROKERS Some progress was made in a long-running fight between federal and state banking regulators when Dugan announced at the hearing an agreement between the OCC and some states to conduct parallel examinations of national banks and the state- licensed mortgage brokers they use. Dugan said the coordinated effort is in its early stages and limited in scope. The OCC, Office of Thrift Supervision and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a state regulatory group, previously agreed to share consumer complaints and resolutions. "These are all positive steps to improve service to consumers," Steven Antonakes, Massachusetts bank commissioner, said on behalf of the state regulatory group. Worried that the court ruling weakened state enforcement powers, some U.S. lawmakers saw the Supreme Court ruling as a reason to give more power to federal agencies. Last month, Frank and Dingell urged federal agencies, including the FTC, to strengthen rules to protect consumers against deceptive financial services practices with credit card fees, interest rates and mortgage lending.
