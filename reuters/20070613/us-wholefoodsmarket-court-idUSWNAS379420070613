 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Whole Foods Market Inc. WFMI.O and Wild Oats Markets Inc. OATS.O on Tuesday said a preliminary injunction hearing into antitrust authorities' bid to block their $565 million merger will be held on July 31. 

 The hearing, to be held in a federal court, is scheduled to conclude on August 1, the grocery chains said in a statement. The Federal Trade Commission had said it would challenge the deal because it would eliminate competition between "two uniquely close competitors" in many local markets around the United States. The natural and organic groceries have said they have consented to a temporary restraining order pending the hearing, but have said they would fight the FTC in court, arguing that the merger should be allowed to proceed in light of the fierce competition in the overall grocery business. Whole Foods, the largest natural and organic grocer, announced plans to buy Wild Oats in February after coming under increased pressure from mainstream grocers that were selling more organic, natural and prepared fare. Whole Foods has asserted that the FTC is looking at the deal in the wrong way by focusing on the natural and organic grocers, rather than looking at the overall industry. Whole Foods, which has 195 stores, rang up less than $5.61 billion in sales in its fiscal year ended in September, while Wild Oats has annual sales of about $1.2 billion and 110 stores.
