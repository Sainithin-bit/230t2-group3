 (Reuters) - A large shareholder of Ceridian Corp. ( CEN.N ) said it does not support the sale of the company to a consortium of buyers as the price offered was low. 

 In a regulatory filing, William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which owns almost 15 percent of the company, said the $36 per share offer is suboptimal for Ceridian stockholders and it intends to pursue one or more value-maximizing alternatives. Ceridian last month agreed to be bought by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and insurance company Fidelity National Financial Inc. ( FNF.N ) for $5.3 billion in cash or $36 per share. (Reporting by Aditi Samajpati in Bangalore)
