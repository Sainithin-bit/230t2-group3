 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp. NEWCQ.PK said on Tuesday it dismissed Chief Executive Brad Morrice "without cause," leaving the bankrupt subprime mortgage lender owing him more than three years' salary as a payout. 

 The company, the largest to go bankrupt among lenders of mortgages to risky borrowers known as subprime, is unlikely to be able to pay Morrice what it owes, since bankruptcy rules sharply limit payouts and the company is winding down. But the terms of the June 8 dismissal would allow him three times his $750,000 base pay plus the highest bonus in the last three years. He received a bonus of $3.4 million in 2004. Morrice could take legal action to go after the funds. Chief Restructuring Officer Holly Etlin was named chief executive officer in his place, and Controller Michael Tinsley will become chief financial officer, the company said. Dozens of subprime lenders have sold or quit their businesses or gone bankrupt in the last year as mortgage defaults soared. Many defaults were "early payment defaults" by borrowers who fell behind shortly after getting their loans. New Century, seen as a leader in the field in its hey day, is now facing federal criminal and regulatory probes. Last month it said accounting errors "more likely than not" caused it to "materially" overstate 2005 pretax earnings, and that investors should not rely on its financial statements for that year. New Century, which filed for bankruptcy in April, has also said it planned to restate results for the first nine months of 2006, citing increases in loan losses. New Century said Morrice had tendered his resignation from the company board and that Anthony Meola had been terminated as executive vice president, loan production, without cause, also entitling him to a payout upon departure.
