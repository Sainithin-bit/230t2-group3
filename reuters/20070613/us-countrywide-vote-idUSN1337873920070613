 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Countrywide Financial Corp. CFC.N shareholders on Wednesday rejected a proposal to give them an advisory vote on setting pay for top executives. 

 The result was a victory for Chief Executive Angelo Mozilo, whom critics have long targeted for his hefty compensation, which totaled $42.98 million last year. Mozilo co-founded the largest U.S. mortgage lender in 1969. Countrywide said the so-called "say-on-pay" proposal won support from 31.7 percent of the votes cast -- less than last year -- with 59.6 percent opposed. The rest abstained. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which owns 4,000 Countrywide shares, had offered the proposal. It won the backing of some governance experts and the California Public Employees' Retirement System pension fund. Shareholders have submitted proposals seeking nonbindingvotes on executive pay at dozens of U.S. companies this year, winning passage at least four times. Companies have generally opposed such proposals. Speaking at Calabasas, California-based Countrywide's annual meeting, AFSCME representative Scott Adams argued "the current system of paying CEOs in the U.S. is broken." He said five top Countrywide officials were last year paid $117 million, including some $267,000 in country club fees. Mozilo defended the payouts, saying Countrywide pays top executives for performance. Countrywide shares rose 24 percent last year, topping a 7 percent gain in the KBW Mortgage Finance Index .MFX. "The board has done a very good job in aligning my compensation with the benefits to the shareholders," Mozilo said. He also called say-on-pay proposals "irresponsible, irrelevant" and a "destructive concept." There is "absolutely no evidence" that they enhance shareholder value and they make it harder to attract talent, he said. Mozilo's compensation for 2006 excludes $78.87 million of gains from stock options and the vesting of shares. Saying it was acting "proactively," Countrywide this year cut Mozilo's annual salary by a third to $1.9 million and potential bonus and equity awards by half to $20 million. Mozilo's contract ends in 2009, when he will be 71. Shareholders have this year endorsed say-on-pay proposals at Blockbuster Inc. BBI.N, Ingersoll-Rand Co. ( IR.N ), Motorola Inc. MOT.N and Verizon Communications Inc. ( VZ.N ). The U.S. House of Representatives in April approved a measure requiring companies to hold nonbinding votes on say-on-pay. Sen. Barack Obama, an Illinois Democrat seeking the White House, offered a companion bill in the Senate, whose approval would also be necessary to enact a law. Many British companies give shareholder nonbinding votes on executive pay, though the concept is new to the United States. Countrywide shares fell 20 cents to $37.90 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They began the year at $42.45
