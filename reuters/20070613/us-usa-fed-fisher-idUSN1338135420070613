 DALLAS  (Reuters) - Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Richard Fisher said on Wednesday the recent rise in U.S. Treasury debt yields and steepening of the yield curve was part of "a global phenomenon." 

 "The Euro curve has steepened. The Japanese curve has steepened," Fisher told reporters after a speech on education to the Rotary Club of Dallas. Fisher skirted a question on whether a rise in yields could make the Fed's job of tamping down inflation easier, as some bond market pundits have suggested recently. "Our job in terms of dealing with expectations or underlying forces that give rise to inflation impulses will continue regardless of what happens in the marketplace." Noting that "markets come and go," Fisher said the recent action was not "a lack of confidence" in the Fed. Policy-makers will "deal with market conditions are they are presented to us." "If the Fed does its job, then we can accommodate economic growth and keep inflation down." Fisher, who is not a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee in 2007, was the first Fed official to address the recent slide in bond prices, which has pushed Treasury yields up sharply. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield is now at 5.22 percent, after trading on Tuesday above the Fed's overnight lending rate of 5.25 percent. Financial markets expect the Fed to hold rates unchanged at its June 27-28 meeting but have started to price in a small chance of a rate hike later in the year -- a sharp reversal from recent expectations for one or more rate cuts in 2007. Fisher said higher-than-expected retail sales for May reported on Wednesday was "encouraging," especially on the heels of other solid economic reports. "The economy is not as weak as some of the negative pundits would view it ... it's not a discouraging story as far as the economy's growth," Fisher said. Sales by U.S. retailers rose 1.4 percent in May, the biggest monthly rise since January 2006 and well above the Wall Street consensus.
