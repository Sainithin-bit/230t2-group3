 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Jones Apparel Group Inc. ( JNY.N ) is nearing a deal to sell its Barneys New York department store chain for $950 million to a private equity firm owned by the Dubai government, according to The New York Post. 

 The talks with private-equity firm Istithmar have reached the final stages, the Post said, citing sources. A $950 million deal would be more than double what Jones Apparel paid for Barneys three years ago, according to the report. The company could not immediately be reached for comment. A deal could be announced as soon as this week, or early next week, the Post said.
