 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Computer Sciences Corp. ( CSC.N ), the fifth-largest U.S. technology services seller, posted quarterly revenue on Wednesday that missed Wall Street expectations, hit by a fall in U.S. commercial-sector sales. 

 Its shares slipped 2 percent in extended trading following the earnings report, after closing up 2.4 percent in regular-session trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Net income in the company's fiscal fourth quarter ended March 30 increased to $249.7 million, or $1.42 per share, from $158.8 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier. While revenue advanced to $4.05 billion from $3.89 billion, it missed Wall Street's average estimate of $4.1 billion, as compiled by Reuters Estimates. Computer Sciences said fourth-quarter revenue from U.S. commercial accounts fell 3 percent to $991.1 million. Weakness in technology spending by large U.S. businesses earlier this year also was reported by International Business Machines Corp. ( IBM.N ), network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc. ( CSCO.O ) and data-storage company Network Appliance Inc. ( NTAP.O ). Computer Sciences, which earns more than a third of its revenue from the U.S. government and helps run Internal Revenue Service computers, said North American public-sector revenue rose 4.8 percent to $1.43 billion in the fourth quarter. Computer Sciences, based in El Segundo, California, in May had forecast fourth-quarter earnings per share before items of $1.51 to $1.61 and revenue of $4 billion to $4.1 billion. Computer Sciences forecast first-quarter earnings of 65 cents to 75 cents per share before items and revenue of $3.7 billion to $3.8 billion. For the fiscal year ending March 28, 2008, Computer Sciences forecast earnings per share of $4 to $4.20 before items such as expenses for restructuring and a retirement agreement. The company said it expects revenue growth of 6 percent to 7 percent from $14.9 billion in fiscal 2007. The company ranks fifth by revenue among U.S.-based technology services companies, behind IBM, Electronic Data Systems Inc. EDS.N, Hewlett-Packard Co. ( HPQ.N ) and Accenture Ltd. ( ACN.N ). Computer Sciences said it expects to double its staff in India to about 14,000 after completing the $1.3 billion acquisition of Covansys Corp. CVNS.O. It expects to pay about $40 million this fiscal year for a five-point program to improve its business, including boosting its India operations. The company's shares, up 5 percent this year, fell to $54.94 from a close of $56.03.
