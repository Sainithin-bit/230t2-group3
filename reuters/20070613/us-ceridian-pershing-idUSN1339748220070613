 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A large shareholder of Ceridian Corp. ( CEN.N ) is expected to say that he opposes the $5.3 billion sale of the company and has hired bankers to find a higher bidder, The Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition on Wednesday. 

 William Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management, which holds a roughly 15 percent Ceridian stake, argues that the business services company isn't valued fully, according to the report. Neither Ceridian nor Pershing Square, a hedge fund, were immediately available for comment. Ceridian last month agreed to be bought by private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners THL.UL and insurance company Fidelity National Financial Inc. ( FNF.N ) for $5.3 billion in cash or $36 per share. Ceridian had been battling with Pershing Square, which wanted the company to spin off its Comdata division and replace its board. Ceridian shares closed at $35.21 on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday.
