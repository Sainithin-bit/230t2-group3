 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. economic activity expanded from mid-April through May, with some regions reporting stronger growth, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday. 

 Separately, a Fed official called the rise in U.S. Treasury debt yields part of a global phenomenon of higher interest rates and said the Fed would stay focused on fighting inflation. "Our job in terms of dealing with expectations or underlying forces that give rise to inflation impulses will continue regardless of what happens in the marketplace," Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said. Fed policy-makers will deal with market conditions as they arise, he said. "If the Fed does its job, then we can accommodate economic growth and keep inflation down," he added. Meanwhile the Fed, in its Beige Book summary of anecdotal economic conditions, said seven of the 12 Fed districts described growth as modest or moderate. The others reported growth as moderately strong, edging up, or somewhat faster than in recent months. At the same time, the Fed said overall wage pressures had not increased and that districts did not indicate an increase in overall price pressures. However, there were "significant" price increases for energy-related products. The Beige Book comes as a string of data showing a stronger economy than in the beginning of the year has markets guessing the Fed's next move may be an interest rate increase rather than a cut. Retail sales in May rose at the strongest pace since January 2006 while import prices surged, other data showed on Wednesday. The Fed has said core inflation, which excludes food and energy items, is elevated and that its main concern is that core inflation will not ease as expected. The U.S. central bank has held its target for benchmark overnight rates steady at 5.25 percent since June 2006 and is widely expected to hold them steady at its June 27-28 meeting. Stock prices rose following the Beige Book release, with the Dow industrial average closing 1.41 percent higher after its best day since July. The Fed said weakness in residential real estate was countered by rising strength in the commercial real estate sector. Housing markets were weak in most districts and no district reported an increase in new home construction. The job market for skilled workers was tight, but layoffs continued among home builders and in industries associated with home building, the Fed said. Wage gains were described variously as moderate, steady, or easing in different Fed districts. Meanwhile, the Fed said consumer spending -- which makes up two-thirds of the nation's output -- and retail sales were higher in late April and May. In other official speeches, Fed Governor Randall Kroszner discussed bank regulation and New York Fed President Timothy Geithner called for more flexible foreign exchange rate regimes in emerging Asian countries, but neither official addressed the outlook for the U.S. economy or interest rates.
