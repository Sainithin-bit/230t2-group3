 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sony Corp. ( 6758.T ) ( SNE.N ) said on Wednesday it sees its electronics sales growth outpacing the industry in the current fiscal year, fueled by demand for big televisions and digital cameras, while a decline in component pricing could benefit profits. 

 Stan Glasgow, president and chief operating officer of Sony's $11 billion electronics arm, said the company's electronics sales grew 7 percent in the fiscal year that ended in March. The Japanese company holds an 18 percent share of consumer electronics sales in the U.S., he added. "We grew substantially greater (than the industry) last year, and we plan to grow substantially greater this year," Glasgow said at a press briefing on Wednesday.
