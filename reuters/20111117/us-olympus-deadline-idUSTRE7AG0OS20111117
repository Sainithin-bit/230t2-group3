 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Olympus Corp said on Thursday it plans to submit an audited second-quarter earnings report by December 14. 
 If it missed the December 14 deadline, it would automatically be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In a presentation material given to bankers at a meeting on Wednesday and made public by the company on Thursday, the company said it plans to cut its short-term and long-term interest-bearing debt to 408.7 billion yen ($5.3 billion) by March 2015, down from 648.8 billion yen as of end-March this year. It also said that it was aiming to cut its long-term interest-bearing debt to 221.9 billion yen by March 2017. ($1 = 76.950 Japanese Yen) (Reporting by  Taiga Uranaka ; Editing by  Edwina Gibbs )
