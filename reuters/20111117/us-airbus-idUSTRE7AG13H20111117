 PARIS  (Reuters) - Honolulu-based Hawaiian Airlines ( HA.O ) ordered five additional A330-200 aircraft from European planemaker Airbus ( EAD.PA ) on Thursday to help expand its network and replace Boeing ( BA.N ) 767-300 planes, the airline's chief executive said in an Airbus statement. 
 The order, worth $1 billion at list prices, takes Hawaiian's commitments for A330 planes to 22, including four under lease. It currently operates five A330s, Airbus said. "Adding these additional A330-200s to our fleet over the next four years will support the continued expansion of our network and replacement of our current 767-300s," airline CEO Mark Dunkerley said.
