 (Reuters) - SemGroup ( SEMG.N ) on Thursday again rejected the unsolicited $1 billion bid from rival Plains All American Pipeline ( PAA.N ), saying the offer does not provide any reasonable basis to begin a discussion. 
 On Wednesday, Plains urged SemGroup to defer the IPO of a master limited partnership unit and reiterated its $24 a share bid. SemGroup had rejected the offer in October as soon as it was made public. SemGroup's shares closed at $28.04 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
