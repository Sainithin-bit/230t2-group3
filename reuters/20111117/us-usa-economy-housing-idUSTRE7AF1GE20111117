 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Housing starts fell less than expected in October as a drop in groundbreaking for multi-family units narrowly outweighed more new construction of single family homes. 
 The Commerce Department said on Thursday housing starts edged down 0.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 628,000 units. Analysts had expected the annual rate would fall to 610,000. Housing starts for buildings with two or more units fell 8.3 percent to a 198,000-unit rate. Single-family home construction -- which accounts for a larger share of the market -- increased 3.9 percent to a 430,000-unit pace. (Reporting by  Jason Lange , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
