 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - European Central Bank policymaker Lorenzo Bini Smaghi said on Wednesday he hoped a solution based on the 'Vienna Initiative' would provide the answer to the Greek debt crisis but pleaded for patience. 

 "I hope so, we are working on it, be patient," said Bini Smaghi when asked by Reuters in Amsterdam whether the Vienna Initiative -- in which banks agreed to maintain their exposure to crisis-hit Central and Eastern Europe in 2009 -- offered a solution to Greece's debt woes.
