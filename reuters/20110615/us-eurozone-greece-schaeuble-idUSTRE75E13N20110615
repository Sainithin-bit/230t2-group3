 BERLIN  (Reuters) - Greece's debt woes cannot be resolved without help from private sector creditors, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said in comments to a magazine made available on Wednesday. 

 "It cannot be that state creditors carry this weight alone," he told German magazine Super Illu in comments to be published on Thursday. "Private creditors must also extend their debt schedule. That is a precondition that we cannot forego under any circumstances," he added. (Reporting by  Gernot Heller )
