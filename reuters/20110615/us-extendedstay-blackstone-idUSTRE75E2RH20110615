 WILMINGTON, Delaware  (Reuters) - Blackstone Group LP ( BX.N ) was sued for allegedly siphoning $2.1 billion from the leveraged buyout of Extended Stay America Inc ESAIN.UL, a deal blamed for the hotel chain's bankruptcy, according to court documents. 

 Blackstone teamed with Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) in 2007 to sell the chain of about 680 hotels for $8 billion to little-known private equity investor David Lichtenstein, a "mark" who was willing to overpay, according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit filed on Tuesday in Manhattan's bankruptcy court was brought by a trust that is seeking to recover funds to benefit creditors who lost money in the bankruptcy. "The grossly inflated purchase price was engineered by the Blackstone-affiliated sellers looking to maximize their profits, working in concert with a buyer that assumed little to no risk of loss," the lawsuit said. Lichtenstein put up little of his own cash for the deal, which loaded up Extended Stay with too much debt and so many restrictions on its finances that the chain landed in bankruptcy just two years later, the complaint said. Extended Stay emerged from bankruptcy in October after selling the chain for $3.93 billion to an investment group that included Paulson & Co and Centerbridge Partners, both hedge funds, and Blackstone. The lawsuit was filed as Blackstone is close to clinching a deal to buy German outdoor clothing and equipment maker Jack Wolfskin, sources told Reuters. The deal could be worth as much as $1 billion, one source said. The lawsuit alleges the participants in the leveraged buyout knew or should have known the deal would render Extended Stay insolvent and could potentially wipe out its creditors. Blackstone said the lawsuit was without merit. "The real cause of the company's bankruptcy was an economic tsunami," Blackstone said in a statement. The company said it "would not have taken the unusual step of retaining an equity participation in Extended Stay" if it had known at the time of the sale that the recession was coming. Creditors of bankrupt media company Tribune Co ( TRBCQ.PK ) are planning to pursue similar claims against the shareholders who sold into a leveraged buyout led by real estate entrepreneur Sam Zell. Creditors have had some success bringing claims against sellers involved in failed buyouts, for example reaching a settlement in the case of Best Products Co in the 1990s. The selling shareholders generally defend themselves by arguing they sold in good faith and without any knowledge the sale would render the company insolvent, according to legal experts. That defense becomes more difficult for large shareholders, who are more likely to understand the risks of the transaction. The lawsuit by the trust also blames Citigroup for assuring Lichtenstein of the soundness of the deal, even after Lichtenstein's own independent valuation contradicted projections provided by Blackstone. "Citigroup dismissed that valuation and questioned Lichtenstein's judgment in relying on a relatively obscure source over the collective 'wisdom' of Citigroup," the complaint said. The complaint said Citigroup had a conflict of interest because it was advising Lichtenstein while coordinating Blackstone's IPO. The lawsuit said Citigroup wanted to position Blackstone for its IPO in part by closing the Extended Stay sale. Citigroup did not immediately return a call for comment. The bankruptcy trust was set up to allow Extended Stay to emerge from bankruptcy while creditors continue to pursue legal claims, including those against the parties responsible for the bankruptcy. The trust also sued Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), which funded the buyout. Bank of America declined to comment. The trust's case is The Extended Stay Litigation Trust v The Blackstone Group LP, et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, Adv. Pro. No. 11-02254. The main bankruptcy case is Extended Stay Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 09-13764.
