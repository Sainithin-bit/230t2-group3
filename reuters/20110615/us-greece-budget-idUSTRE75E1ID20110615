 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's central government deficit widened by an annual 13 percent in the first five months of the year, missing an interim budget target under the country's bailout plan, the finance ministry said on Tuesday. 

 Budget slippages amid a deeper-than-expected recession caused the government last week to agree even harsher austerity measures in a bid to qualify for its second rescue package in the span of one year. Protesters vowed on Tuesday to cordon off parliament to prevent deputies from debating the new measures. The central government deficit stood at 10.28 billion euros ($14.86 billion) between January and May, higher than a 9.07 billion euro target for the period, the government said in a statement. Net budget revenues dropped 7.1 percent year-on-year to 18.36 billion euros, compared with a 20.52 billion euro target. Spending before payments on the country's debt increased 4.3 percent to 21.29 billion euros, compared with a target of 19.92 billion euros. The ministry attributed the revenue shortfall to a worse slump than expected recession and one-off road taxes that boosted revenue in early 2010. Spending rose to settle public hospital debts, the statement added, even though the government kept slashing public investment, down 47 percent year-on-year. Hurt by austerity, the Greek economy contracted at an annual pace of 5.5 percent in the first quarter. The EU and the IMF last week revised downwards their 2011 growth forecast for Greece to -3.8 percent from -3.0 percent. The budget data refers to the state budget deficit which excludes local authorities and social security spending and does not coincide with the general government shortfall -- the benchmark for the EU's assessment of Greece's fiscal progress.
