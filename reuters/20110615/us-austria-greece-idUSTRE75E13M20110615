 VIENNA  (Reuters) - Letting Greece default on its sovereign debt could trigger a chain reaction with dire consequences for the rest of the euro zone, Austrian Finance Minister Maria Fekter told parliament on Wednesday. 

 "If European countries would abruptly send Greece into default this shock wave would raise the danger of contagion and put other countries into serious difficulties," she told a debate on euro zone bailouts demanded by the opposition. "You can't forecast who might get hit," she said, adding a careful and controlled approach to helping Greece reduce its debt was the wiser course of action.
