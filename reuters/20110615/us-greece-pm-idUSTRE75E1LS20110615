 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou said on Wednesday he was still seeking a consensus among the country's political parties on a fresh round of austerity measures. 

 "We are at a historically crucial moment ... and I believe that national consensus is important for the country's interest," Papandreou told President Karolos Papoulias. "Even today, I am communicating with the leaders of other parties toward this direction." (Reporting by Renee Maltezou; Writing by  Ingrid Melander )
