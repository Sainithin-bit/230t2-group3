 DETROIT  (Reuters) - DaimlerChrysler AG's DCXGn.DE DCX.N Chrysler Group said on Tuesday its U.S. sales rose 2 percent in April, driven by strong sales of its Jeep brand vehicles. 

 The automaker sold 193,104 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 190,095 a year earlier. The results were not adjusted for the two extra selling days in April 2006.
