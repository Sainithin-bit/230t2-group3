 DETROIT  (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union is readying a counterproposal as soon as this week intended to break its deadlock with bankrupt Delphi Corp. DPHIQ.PK over wages and benefits, the Detroit News reported on Tuesday. 

 Representatives for Delphi and the UAW could not immediately be reached for comment. The newspaper quoted two unnamed sources familiar with the  labor talks as saying that a "comprehensive" proposal from the union would be delivered at a meeting between the parties later this week. It was not clear what kind of concessions -- if any -- the UAW would offer the auto parts supplier and an investment group working to bring it out of bankruptcy, the newspaper said. Analyst Kirk Ludtke of CRT Capital Group said in a note on Tuesday that the "seeming willingness of the UAW to renew negotiations" was a favorable development for Delphi investors. In March, UAW officials rejected as "pathetic" a contract offer from Delphi and an investor group proposing a $3.4 billion equity infusion to support the parts maker's emergence from bankruptcy. The investment proposal is contingent on Delphi reaching agreements with its unions and former parent General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) on issues ranging from wages and benefits, to potential plant sales and closings, as well as GM commitments for future business with Delphi. Cerberus Capital Management has signaled that it intends to withdraw from the Delphi investment deal that it had led with Appaloosa Management LP. A labor disruption at Delphi, which remains GM's largest parts supplier, has been viewed as a lingering risk for the automaker since even a short disruption could force a costly shutdown of production. GM Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said late last month that there were still "ample solutions" that would allow Delphi to emerge from bankruptcy even after the withdrawal of Cerberus. Delphi posted a $63 million net loss for March, the company said on Monday in a limited report prepared for the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Delphi, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, reported net losses totaling $381 million for the first three months of 2006, according the court filing.
