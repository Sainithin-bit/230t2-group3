 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - A former Tyco International Ltd. ( TYC.N ) executive has agreed to settle civil charges he helped inflate the company's profits through sham transactions, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said on Monday. 

 Edward Federman, who was the chief financial officer of Tyco's electronics division until he resigned in 2001, will pay $2.65 million in disgorgement, interest and civil penalties under the settlement, the SEC said. Federman did not admit or deny the allegations in agreeing to settle, according to the SEC. As part of the agreement, he will be barred from serving as an officer or director of a public company for five years. The settlement still must be approved by a U.S. District Court judge in Manhattan, the SEC said. Federman joined Tyco in 1983 as an assistant corporate controller. He was controller and vice president of finance from February 1998 through April 1999, when he became CFO of the electronics unit. Former Tyco Chief Executive Dennis Kozlowski and former finance chief Mark Swartz were convicted of criminal charges in June 2005 of stealing more than $150 million from the company. They are now in prison. Attempts to reach Federman's attorney were unsuccessful.
