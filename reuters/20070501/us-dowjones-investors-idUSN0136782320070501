 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Fund managers who own a piece of Dow Jones & Co. welcomed News Corp.'s bid to buy the media company but said the price may keep rising if the controlling Bancroft family continues resisting the offer for one of America's most prestigious newspapers. 

 "If someone is willing to pay $6 billion for it, why wouldn't someone else want to pay $8 billion?" said value investor Mark Boyar, who has owned Dow Jones stock for four years. "Would I accept $60? Yes. Would I like more? You bet!" The $60 per share bid, while high, will likely prompt other potential buyers to emerge and will surely accelerate a trend where billionaire investors have been taking stakes in media companies at a time many are flush with cash and hunting for targets, investors agreed. "This will definitely reshape an already changing environment even more," Boyar said. "This is not Murdoch's attempt at philanthropy or to gain social prestige and if one accepts the premise that the business is mismanaged and that he can do it better, the price is not going to look that ridiculous," said Jean-Marie Eveillard, the legendary investor who recently returned from retirement to manage the First Eagle Global fund. "This may lead to other bids from some unusual places," he added. Dow Jones said it was informed by a representative of the Bancroft family, which holds 64.2 percent of voting power, that it would cast slightly more than 50 percent of the outstanding voting power against the proposal. But investors said a 65 percent premium to the closing share price on Monday could prove hard to turn down. "A big number like this puts the onus on the family to prove to the shareholders that they can operate this business better than Murdoch could," said Todd Bourell, a partner at hedge fund ValueAct. The number will also likely whet other investors' appetites for a flagship newspaper broadly called a "trophy." "Every investment banker in America is probably out there making calls and I think a lot of other people are going to show up," Boyar said, adding "This thing isn't going for 60 bucks. If Murdoch offered that much it is bound to suggest that that is only the beginning price." Boyar said he thought the company would be fairly valued at $70 a share. Dow Jones shares closed up $19.87 or 55 percent at $56.20 on Tuesday. David Wallack, who manages the T. Rowe Price Mid Cap Value fund which owns Dow shares, said the family would likely look closely at Murdoch's proposed ownership, with a view of maintaining the Journal's editorial integrity. "We are talking about a fairly significant premium to where the stock has been trading in recently years and I think that they will have to consider it seriously," Wallack said. Investors speculated the Bancroft family might try to find an alternative to Murdoch in a hurry. "There is a possibility that the Bancroft family would go to someone like Warren Buffett and ask quietly to be bought at a higher price," Boyar said. No matter how the bidding proceeds, Murdoch's proposal will be seen as a "stake in the ground from opportunistic buyers who see value in owning brand-name newspaper businesses," Bourell said.
