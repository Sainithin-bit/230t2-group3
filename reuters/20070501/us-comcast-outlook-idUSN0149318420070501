 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Comcast Corp. ( CMCSA.O ), the largest U.S. cable television operator, said on Tuesday it expects cable revenue to grow a compounded average of 12 percent per year from 2007 to 2009. 

 The forecast came ahead of Comcast's analyst meeting in Philadelphia on Tuesday. Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Roberts said in a statement ahead of the meeting that he expected Comcast's digital voice service to penetrate more than 20 percent of the homes it serves by the end of 2009. Comcast has been reporting strong growth on the back of so-called triple play packages that combine cable television, phone and Internet services. "The triple play is driving incredible operating momentum and we see that accelerating as it continues to roll out," Roberts said in the statement. The company also forecast cable operating cash flow to grow a compounded average of 14 percent per year for 2007 to 2009. Comcast last week reported an 80 percent rise in first-quarter profit to $837 million, or 26 cents per share, fueled by subscriber growth and a $300 million gain from dissolving a partnership with Time Warner Cable Inc. ( TWC.N ) Profit excluding that gain was in line with market expectations, though subscriber growth for Comcast's digital television and telephone services beat some analysts' forecasts. Wall Street is looking for revenue to grow 12 percent to $30.9 billion this year, to rise 12 percent to $34.7 billion in 2008, and to rise 11 percent to $38.5 billion in 2009, according to Reuters Estimates.
