 DETROIT  (Reuters) - U.S. auto sales stalled in April as a weaker housing market and higher gas prices hurt consumers, raising further doubts about the industry's outlook for the remainder of the year. 

 Sales at General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ) fell 2 percent, while Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) sales dropped 6 percent. Declines for the No. 1 and No. 2 U.S. automakers had been expected after executives at both companies warned about April results. Even Toyota Motor Co. ( 7203.T ), which has been taking U.S. market share from the Big Three Detroit auto makers, posted its lowest monthly sales growth since August 2004 at just under 4 percent. Toyota had outpaced the rest of the industry with 11 percent growth and overtook GM on a global basis in the first quarter. Sales of Toyota's passenger cars, including its powerhouse Corolla sedan, were down in April in a striking reversal from recent months. Other Japanese automakers also had weaker results. Honda Motor Co. ( 7267.T ) sales were down 2 percent and Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. ( 7201.T ) reported an 11 percent sales drop. Sales at Chrysler Group, the Detroit-based automaker that faces a possible spin-off as a unit of Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE, bucked the downtrend with a 10 percent gain, boosted by aggressive discounts. Percentage sales changes were adjusted for two fewer selling days in April than in the same month a year earlier. Overall light-vehicle sales slipped to an annualized rate of 16.27 million in April, tracking service Autodata Corp said. That was down from 16.69 million a year earlier and the weakest tally since November. "It appeared to us that consumers were just frozen," Nissan U.S. sales chief Brad Bradshaw told Reuters. "It just seemed to us that these housing issues ... along with higher gas prices seem to have frozen everybody." Sales analysts at other automakers were also cautious. Ford and GM both said they were sticking with forecasts that see full-year, industry-wide sales down only slightly for 2007, although both noted the risks to that outlook. "We're dealing with volatile gas prices and the correction (in) the housing market -- at least in some parts of the country -- and that's certainly not creating ideal conditions," GM sales analyst Paul Ballew said. GM trimmed its second-quarter North American production forecast by 1.3 percent to 1.145 million vehicles. Despite the drop in overall sales, the company said higher-margin retail sales gained almost 4 percent in April. Ford's chief sales analyst, George Pipas, warned last week that overall sales in April were shaping up as "terrible," citing deepening uncertainty from a weaker housing market. Even so, Ford's own sales decline for April was more limited than some analysts expected. Ford's retail sales dropped 17 percent, Pipas said. "Make no mistake about it: retail sales were down for the industry," Pipas said. INCENTIVES DOWN, BUT CHRYSLER GETS A LIFT Amid the weaker sales, overall incentives on new cars dropped 5 percent to $2,342 in April, according to industry tracking service Edmunds.com. Edmunds estimated Chrysler Group led the industry in incentive spending in April at a per-vehicle average of $3,994. Ford was No. 2 with an average incentive of $3,016, it said. GM, which ran a month-end program offering lower-cost financing to less credit-worthy borrowers, was third at $2,768 per vehicle, the report said. Chrysler attributed its stronger results to the success of marketing efforts in April, including zero-percent financing on its Dodge Ram pickup trucks and its best-selling minivans. The automaker extended zero percent financing for up to five years on select Jeep, Chrysler and Dodge vehicles with additional bonus cash for buyers this month. "We were just very fortunate to catch the wind when we did in the month of April," Chrysler's sales chief Steven Landry said. "We had a very strong close." Jim Sourges, an auto analyst at consulting firm Capgemini, said other automakers could be forced to discount more heavily if May and June results extend the weakness seen in April. But Sourges noted some luxury brands, including Toyota's Lexus, which saw a 14 percent sales gain in April, appeared insulated from the economic uncertainty. "There are still pockets of the market that are being steered to luxury and appear immune to what's happening in housing or incentives," Sourges said.
