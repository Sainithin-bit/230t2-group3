 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - News and financial information company Bloomberg LP said on Tuesday there was no truth to speculation it could counterbid against News Corp. for Dow Jones & Co. Inc., owner of The Wall Street Journal. 

 Media conglomerate News Corp. said earlier on Tuesday it has made a "friendly" offer to buy Dow Jones for $60 per share. CNBC, which reported the story earlier, said that there could be other bidders for the company such as Bloomberg. Bloomberg spokeswoman Judith Czelusniak said via email that there was no truth behind the speculation.
