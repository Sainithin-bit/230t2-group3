 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Tuesday said it may cut its ratings on Dow Jones & Co. and Standard & Poor's said it may change them, citing the company's possible acquisition by News Corp. for $5 billion. 

 S&P also said it may still raise its ratings on News Corp. despite the media company's possible acquisition of Dow Jones, which is rated "BBB," the second-lowest investment grade rating. S&P may change Dow Jones's rating "once it is clear that a definitive acquisition or other potential transaction is likely to occur," S&P analyst Peggy Hwan Hebard wrote in a statement. Dow Jones has about $508 million of outstanding debt as of March 31, 2007, S&P said. The rating company placed Dow Jones, owner of The Wall Street Journal, on watch "with developing implications," which means S&P may raise or lower the company's "BBB" rating. News Corp. also carries a "BBB" corporate credit rating from S&P. Fitch Ratings earlier on Tuesday said its ratings for News Corp. would not be affected by the company's potential acquisition of Dow Jones. For details see. However, Fitch said that ratings on any Dow Jones senior unsecured debt assumed by News Corp. would likely be cut to "BBB," the second lowest investment grade, if a deal took place.. Moody's Investors Service late on Tuesday affirmed its "Baa2" rating of News Corp., the second lowest high-grade rating. Moody's also revised its outlook on Dow Jones to developing from stable.
