 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Media conglomerate News Corp. said on Tuesday it has made a "friendly" offer to buy Dow Jones & Co. Inc. for $60 per share. 

 If successful, the estimated $5 billion deal, which Dow Jones confirmed earlier, would make News Corp.'s Rupert Murdoch a major player in the global financial news business. News Corp. said it would acquire all of the outstanding shares of the company for $60 per share in cash, or in a combination of cash and stock.
