 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The financial-aid office of the University of Texas at Austin partly rated student lenders based on how they treated officials to meals and other extras, the Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Monday. 

 The Office of Student Financial Services, in internal reviews of lenders, rated companies based on loan volume, customer service and whether they offered students reduced fees, the Journal reported, citing school documents. But the office also looked at "visibility," which was "based on the number of lunches, breakfasts and extracurricular functions for entire OSFS staff," the paper reported. Student Loan Xpress, now a unit of CIT Group Inc., was rated "very good" in free meals and functions, the Journal said, citing a school analysis from March 10, 2006. The Journal cited University of Texas System vice chancellor and general counsel as saying that he was conducting an investigation, which would cover issues brought up by the documents. CIT could not immediately be reached for comment. The report comes amid probes, in which New York, several other U.S. states and Congress have targeted banks, loan companies and schools, alleging that some university lending officials took kickbacks in exchange for giving the companies so-called "preferred lender" status.
