 LONDON  (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks were set for a slightly firmer start to Tuesday trade, recouping some of the previous session's fall as investors focused on a batch of heavyweight corporate earnings and economic data. 

 General Motors ( G.N ) and Ford ( F.N ) were among major U.S. corporates to report earnings, with U.S. pending home sales and the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing data on the economic calendar. "On a very short-term measure, perhaps there'll be some buying into the weakness we saw yesterday as the earnings have been coming in so much better than expected and have surprised to the upside," said Nick Skiming, fund manager at Ashburton in Jersey. "The valuation on the market is relatively supportive, notwithstanding that interest rates might not fall as soon as we hoped." Stock index futures were pointing towards a firmer start, with June Dow Jones DJM7, S&P SPM7 and Nasdaq NDM7 June futures all indicating a rise of 0.2 percent. The majority of European equity markets were closed on Tuesday, with the exception of Britain, whose FTSE 100  .FTSE  index was down 0.5 percent. U.S. stocks ended lower on Monday as investors locked in profits on some of April's big gainers at the end of Wall Street's strongest month in three years. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed down 0.4 percent, at 13,062.91. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  was down 0.8 percent, while Nasdaq  .IXIC  ended down 1.3 percent, its biggest percentage decline since March 13. EARNINGS FLURRY Watson Pharmaceutical WPI.N, Procter & Gamble ( PG.N ), Avon ( AVP.N ), Qwest ( Q.N ) were due to report their results on Tuesday, alongside Ford and General Motors. Scheduled economic releases included the Institute of Supply Management's April Manufacturing index at 1400 GMT, with weekly chain store sales at 1145 GMT and Redbook data at 1255 GMT. U.S. pending home sales for March was due for release at 1400 GMT. U.S. electronic retailer Circuit City Stores Inc. CC.N could fall in early trade after forecasting a first-quarter loss and withdrawing its previously issued earnings guidance for the first half of its 2008 fiscal year. Its shares fell 5.2 percent to $16.55 in electronic composite trading. The New York Post reported on its Web site that Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ) has emerged as a contender to buy Internet advertising firm 24/7 Real Media Inc. TFSM.O and is considering a price in the $1 billion range.
