 BUTTE, Montana  (Reuters) - A senior Democratic senator on Tuesday said World Bank President Paul Wolfowitz should step down, while a top Democratic voice on economic issues said if Wolfowitz quits, it was important for an American succeed him. 

 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus of Montana said Wolfowitz should bow out before the bank's credibility was further damaged by the controversy surrounding his role in directing a promotion and pay raise for his girlfriend. "It would be my hope, frankly, that Mr. Wolfowitz realizes that discretion is the better part of valor and finds a graceful way to no longer be president of the bank," Baucus told reporters at a state economic development conference. Without the "trust of the world ... it is very difficult for the bank to function as an institution," he said. A committee set up by the World Bank's board has been examining the role Wolfowitz played in helping arrange a high-paid promotion for his girlfriend, bank employee Shaha Riza. In a statement to the panel on Monday, Wolfowitz accused his critics of a "smear campaign." Wolfowitz, an Iraq-war architect when he was U.S. deputy defense secretary, has said he followed guidance offered by the bank's ethics officers in arranging Riza's promotion and transfer to an outside job at the State Department. In calling for Wolfowitz to step down, Baucus joined a number of other prominent Democrats, including presidential candidates Bill Richardson, a former U.N. ambassador, and John Edwards, a former U.S. senator and the party's 2004 vice presidential nominee. The controversy swirling around Wolfowitz has raised questions over whether the 60-year-old convention of having only Americans head the global poverty-fighting institution should give way to a more transparent system that would eliminate nationality as a criteria. Appearing with Baucus, former Clinton administration Treasury chief Robert Rubin, a leading light in the Democratic party on economic issues, said it was important the United States hold the World Bank presidency, even if the selection process was opened up to greater input from other countries. "For a whole host of reasons it's important that the United States continue to have the presidency, but I think it has to be somebody that the rest of the world feels enthusiastic about," Rubin said. Baucus said it was "premature to name names" for a possible successor to Wolfowitz. Rubin, now chairman of the executive committee at Citigroup, said he would not consider the post.
