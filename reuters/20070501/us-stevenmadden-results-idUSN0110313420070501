 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Shoe company Steven Madden Ltd. ( SHOO.O ) posted lower first-quarter profit on Tuesday due to the discontinuation of two product lines and weak performance of items such as women's boots. 

 But net profit, at $9.5 million, or 43 cents per share, was better than Wall Street expectations of 41 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates, sending Steve Madden shares up 4.5 percent. The company earned $10.9 million, or 50 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Net sales for the quarter that ended March 31 also fell slightly to $106.7 million, missing analyst estimates of $107.7 million. Steven Madden, known for its fashionable shoes and accessories, discontinued its Rule and l.e.i. brands over the last 12 months. It also suffered from poor sales of Steve Madden Women's boots, men's sport products and Betsey Johnson handbags during the quarter. Same-store sales, a key retail industry measure, decreased 1.7 percent during the quarter. The company now expects 2007 net sales to be flat to 2 percent higher than 2006. Full-year earnings per share will be between $2.00 and $2.10, which compares with analysts' average estimate of  $2.05. The company slashed its 2007 earnings forecast in March, but remains "cautiously optimistic about 2007," Karson said. Plans for 2007 include opening more stores in key retail markets like New York, Miami and Las Vegas, a new line of Steve Madden dresses and expanding the range of footwear under its various brands. "If the company is able to resolve its issues with men's and continue recent improvement in the accessories business, it could provide upside to current estimates in the second half of 2007," wrote Wedbush Morgan Securities analyst Jeff Mintz in a research note. "However, if it misses on the fashion in its women's businesses, results could be lower." The company's shares were up $1.28 at $31.03 in midday trading on the Nasdaq.
