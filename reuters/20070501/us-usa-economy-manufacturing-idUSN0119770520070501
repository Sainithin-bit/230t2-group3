 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. factory activity expanded more than expected in April and employment and prices paid rose, according to a survey published on Tuesday. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 54.7 in April, the highest since May 2006, from 50.9 in March, above economists' median forecast for 51.0. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the sector. The prices paid index, which measures inflationary pressures, rose to 73.0 in April, from 65.5 in March. New orders, a gauge of future growth, rose to 58.5 in April from 51.6 while the employment index rose to 53.1 from 48.7.
