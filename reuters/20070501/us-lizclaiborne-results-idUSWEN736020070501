 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Apparel maker Liz Claiborne Inc. LIZ.N posted a 65 percent lower quarterly profit on Tuesday that missed Wall Street estimates, hurt by restructuring charges, lower-than-expected wholesale sales and higher markdowns. 

 Liz Claiborne, whose shares fell 18 percent in premarket trading, said net income was $16.2 million, or 16 cents per share, for the first quarter, down from $46.9 million, or 45 cents per share, in the year-earlier period. Excluding the impact of expenses related to the company's restructuring and closing of underperforming stores, earnings were 22 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 60 cents per share excluding items, according to Reuters Estimates. Net sales in the first quarter fell 1.6 percent to $1.15 billion, as a change in retailers' calendar shifted $45 million of wholesale shipments into the second quarter from the first. The company, which owns Juicy Couture, also said it expects adjusted 2007 earnings per share in the range of $1.90 to $2.05, excluding charges, way below analysts' average estimate of $3.12 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. "Clearly, we wish we could have reported better first-quarter earnings and provided a stronger outlook for the year," said Liz Claiborne Chief Executive William McComb. Liz shares fell $8.22 to $36.50 in premarket trading. It closed on Tuesday at $44.72.
