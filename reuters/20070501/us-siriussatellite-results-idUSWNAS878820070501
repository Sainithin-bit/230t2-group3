 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. ( SIRI.O ), which plans to acquire rival XM Satellite Radio, on Tuesday reported a smaller first-quarter loss as revenue increased from new subscribers. 

 The New York-based company, No. 2 in the nascent pay-radio market to XM Satellite XMSR.O, said its net loss narrowed to $144.7 million, or 10 cents a share, from $458.5 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue at Sirius, the satellite radio home of shock jock Howard Stern and the National Football League, climbed 61 percent to $204 million from $126.7 million. Analysts on average expected a loss of 11 cents a share on revenue of $213.4 million, according to Reuters Estimates. During the quarter, Sirius added 556,490 net subscribers to end at 6.6 million in total. Its average monthly subscriber churn -- a measure of users who quit the service -- was 2.3, which Sirius said was consistent with a previously provided 2007 churn outlook. Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said the results were solid, particular with Sirius' gross additions -- the raw number of new subscribers -- at 988,000, compared with his forecast of 889,000. "By handily beating expectations in arguably the most important metric -- subscriber growth -- Sirius continues to show solid growth as a stand-alone business," he said in a note to clients. Subscriber acquisition cost, or SAC, per gross subscriber addition was $104 for the first quarter of 2007. Sirius said that was 8 percent better than the year ago quarter, and keeps it on track for its full-year target of $95. Sirius plans to buy XM in an all-stock deal worth about $4 billion when it was first announced, but some U.S. lawmakers and consumer groups have criticized the merger as anti-competitive. Sirius said it was confident that it would complete the transaction by the end of 2007. The deal requires the approval of the U.S. Justice Department's antitrust division, as well as the Federal Communications Commission. Sirius said it still expected full-year 2007 total revenue "approaching $1 billion" and anticipated more than 8 million subscribers at year-end. Sirius shares were nearly unchanged in morning Nasdaq trade, after closing on Monday at $2.96. The stock is off about 20 percent since the merger was announced in late February.
