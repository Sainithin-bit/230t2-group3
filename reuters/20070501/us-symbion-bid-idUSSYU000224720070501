 SYDNEY  (Reuters) - Australia's Symbion Health said on Tuesday it has received a takeover approach valuing the pathology company's ordinary shares at A$2.78 billion ($2.32 billion) from a consortium led by Healthscope HSP.AX. 

 Symbion said the cash and share offer had an indicative value of A$4.30 per Symbion share. Symbion shares closed on Monday at A$4.11. The consortium included private equity firms Ironbridge Capital and Archer Capital. Symbion said the proposal would lead to substantial cost savings and other benefits, but said talks were incomplete and there was no certainty a formal offer would be made. ($1=A$1.20)
