 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn on Tuesday took direct aim at Motorola Inc.'s MOT.N Chief Executive Ed Zander on Tuesday, as he stepped up his efforts to win a seat on the mobile phone maker's board. 

 In a letter to investors, published as a full-page advertisement in the Wall Street Journal, Icahn said Motorola "suffered a critical failure in oversight and leadership." Icahn, who said he was seeking one board seat and not control of the company, used the letter to air his most pointed criticism yet of Zander since late January when he began his quest for a board seat. The vote is scheduled for May 7. Citing a Journal report that Zander was apt to say that he loved his job, but hated his customers Icahn said the comments sounded like "something straight out of 'Alice in Wonderland.'" Icahn said Motorola, which has seen its shares lose about a third of their value since mid-October amid weak handset sales, had been "shaken by leadership setbacks that ... could have, and in fact should have, been averted." Motorola shares were up 28 cents or 1.62 percent at $17.71 in early afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The company fought back by repeating its opposition to Icahn and questioning how he would balance the trading restrictions a Motorola directorship would bring with his responsibilities to his own investors. "If there were an opportunity for Carl Icahn's funds to sell Motorola shares at a favorable price, would he simply resign from your Board to take advantage of it?," Motorola said in an amended proxy statement filed with regulators. Motorola filed a first-quarter loss earlier this month and said its 2007 outlook was significantly worse than expected due to a lack of advanced phones and a tough pricing environment. The company has been criticized for a stale product line as it has not followed its aging Razr phone with another hit. TIME TO IMPROVE Jefferies & Co analyst Bill Choi said Icahn was hoping to stir up discontent among already unhappy investors. "Some investors are obviously frustrated at how quickly things have demised. Icahn is trying to play to some of the investor sentiment," Choi said. Pressure on Zander would increase unless he brings improvements, Choi added. "I think he has some time but he needs to show progress in the second half of this year," Choi said. Motorola, which has said Icahn is unqualified for its board because of his lack of industry experience, said it had offered help Icahn to find a "mutually acceptable" candidate. Icahn has accused the current board of being passive, and, if elected, would as the board's biggest stockholder, speak for large shareholders by asking tough questions if he were elected. "I am convinced that significant stockholder representation in the Motorola boardroom, even by a single director, is absolutely necessary at this troubled company," he said. Some buyside experts said Icahn may have a good chance of winning a seat after leading proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), whose clients hold $25.5 trillion in investments, recommended voting Icahn onto the board. Jane Snorek, an analyst at First American Funds, which holds Motorola shares among its $100 billion of investments, also said that without concrete financial arguments, many ISS clients would be unlikely to dismiss the firm's endorsement. "I think he definitely will get elected," said Snorek. "If you're a shareholder, I don't know why you wouldn't vote (Icahn) on. I can't think of one good reason." Icahn said he and affiliates own over 68 million Motorola shares, or a roughly 3 percent stake, with a value of over $1.2 billion.
