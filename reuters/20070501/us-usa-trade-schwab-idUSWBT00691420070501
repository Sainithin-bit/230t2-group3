 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said on Tuesday discussions in the Doha round of trade talks are accelerating, but cautioned it is too early to tell if negotiators can reach a breakthrough in coming weeks. 

 "We definitely have picked up the pace. There is definitely a sense of momentum ... Does that translate into a successful outcome in the next several weeks? I think it's too early to tell," Schwab said. The World Trade Organization is pushing to wrap up the talks by the end of 2007, but there are no visible signs yet that leading players -- the United States, the European Union, India and Brazil -- have resolved wide differences over agricultural tariffs and subsidies. Last week, WTO chief Pascal Lamy visited Washington to lobby for a swift conclusion to the round. He suggested that a breakthrough was needed soon if negotiators were to have enough time to hammer out details by year's end. Speaking on Monday at an event marking increased farm trade between the United States and India, Schwab said it was too soon to gauge if that goal was attainable. "There's a lot of work to do," she said. While no single country will make or break the round, Schwab called on India to "recognize its role" in the talks. India and the United States, in particular, have been at odds over India's desire to shelter some goods from duty cuts. New Delhi has also emerged as a spokesman for developing countries that are pressing the United States to reduce farm subsidies more than it has offered to do. Schwab said that in upcoming talks, details on things like market access for specific commodities would be more important than overall, "headline" figures. Washington's top agricultural negotiator, Richard Crowder, is meeting this week with his counterparts, and the so-called G4 is scheduled to gather several times in coming weeks. Schwab also said the Bush administration is "very close" to striking a deal with Congress that could pave the way for renewal of White House trade negotiating authority and help secure passage of pending trade deals with countries Peru, Colombia, Panama and possible South Korea. The Bush's trade negotiating authority, called fast track, expires at the end of June, and it's unclear whether Congress will extend it. Without that authority, most analysts believe Washington will not be able to take an effective role in world trade talks. Congressional leaders have been pushing for stronger protections for workers and the environment in trade deals.
