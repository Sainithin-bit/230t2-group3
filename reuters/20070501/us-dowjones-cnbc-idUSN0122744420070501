 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's estimated $5 billion bid for Dow Jones & Co. Inc., which comes as the Australian media mogul is gearing up to launch a new cable business news channel, could pose a new threat to General Electric Co.'s CNBC business channel, industry analysts said. 

 News Corp. on Tuesday offered $60 a share for Dow Jones, publisher of the Wall Street Journal, driving its shares up 55 percent, to $56.20 on the New York Stock Exchange. "It certainly is going to be extraordinarily competitive, and I would guess that people at CNBC, and NBC generally, will have to look very, very hard at how they are going to meet the competition," said Mike Ludlum, associate professor of journalism at New York University. "Murdoch has been thinking about this for a long time, this has been something that has been juggling around in his mind. Now he says, 'OK, let's go,' and he can reach into his back pocket and pull out his wallet," Ludlum said. "And I suspect that Rupert Murdoch, with his background, is going to throw a lot of other resources into it." Murdoch's Fox Business Channel would be a third competitor in a space that has been split by just two players, CNBC and Bloomberg Television, since 2004, when Time Warner Inc. shut its CNNfn business news channel. Bloomberg is privately held. "To cut it up any more looks to me like it's going to be quite a contest," Ludlum said. Dow Jones provides news to CNBC under a contract due to expire in 2012. A CNBC spokesman declined to comment on what any changes to that contract would mean for the channel. "Is it a problem for GE?" said Peter Klein, senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management, which manages about $20 billion in assets and holds GE shares. "I can't imagine why News Corp. wouldn't want to still sell information to anybody who wants to buy it. I can't imagine they would all of a sudden want to shut it off." NEW LIFE TO NBC SALE NOTION? Investors in GE, the world's second-largest company by market capitalization behind Exxon Mobil Corp., said the News Corp. bid for Dow Jones could reinvigorate the idea of GE selling its NBC Universal media business. That notion was most recently put forth by Citigroup analyst Jeffrey Sprague in a Friday research note, though GE officials have said they are pleased with NBC's performance. "Folks are asking the question of whether GE ought to be in the business of broadcasting. I think it makes more sense now that there are willing buyers out there for media assets," said Fifth Third's Klein. After a string of profit declines, NBC has reported rising profit in the last two quarters. "It wouldn't be hard to fathom a good premium (for NBC), from the standpoint of just the sheer amount of liquidity that's out there," said Eric Schoenstein, a principal in Portland, Oregon-based Jensen Investment Advisors, which manages about $3 billion in assets and holds GE shares. "On the other hand, it would be a tougher one to sell in that it's not a traditional business," Schoenstein noted. "Private equity couldn't come in and just leverage it up and suddenly make it make more programs."
