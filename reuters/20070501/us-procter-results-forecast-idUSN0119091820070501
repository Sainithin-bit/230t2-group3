 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) is comfortable with analysts' forecasts for higher earnings next year, even though it plans to spend more to keep its competitive edge in a tough market, company executives said on Tuesday. 

 They also said that based on feedback from many long-term shareholders, the maker of Tide detergent and Folgers coffee will soon end its long-time practice of giving mid-quarter financial updates. As P&G has been digesting its $57 billion acquisition of Gillette in October 2005, smaller rivals such as Avon Products Inc. ( AVP.N ), Colgate-Palmolive Co. ( CL.N ) and Kimberly-Clark Corp. ( KMB.N ) have used savings from restructuring programs to increase marketing spending. While others have taken massive restructuring charges, Chief Financial Officer Clayt Daley said P&G expects to fund its projects internally. It plans to spend more on restructuring in fiscal 2008 than in the current fiscal year, which ends in June. Kimberly-Clark and Avon exceeded analysts' quarterly profit forecasts, while Colgate met expectations. P&G posted higher quarterly earnings, in line with expectations, on Tuesday, but its shares fell more than 2 percent as investors had hoped the company would do even better. Daley said during a conference call that P&G's priority for fiscal 2008 is to sustain strong sales growth. It plans to invest in its leading brands, innovation, and the way it brings its products to stores to succeed, he said. CHANGING TIDE Another item putting pressure on fiscal 2008 is P&G's plan to switch its North American liquid laundry detergent business, including Tide, to a concentrated formula. The roll-out of the smaller plastic bottles, which contain less water, will start in September. The move comes after Wal-Mart Stores Inc. ( WMT.N ) asked suppliers to cut back on the amount of packaging they use amid its environmental push. The change will lead to a number of costs during fiscal 2008 as Cincinnati-based P&G changes its manufacturing process and spends more on marketing to promote the switch. Daley also said P&G expects higher raw material and energy costs in fiscal 2008. The size of the increase should not be as great as during the past two years, when P&G grappled with soaring energy prices. P&G is comfortable with analysts' average earnings estimate of $3.47 per share for fiscal 2008, Daley said. NO MORE UPDATES The decision to stop giving mid-quarter updates came after investors said the announcements create greater short-term stock volatility and do not have strategic value. Most major U.S. consumer products companies that give financial guidance typically only give updates when they report results, unless a situation calls for a major revision. Daley said P&G would continue with updates for the next two quarters as it not want the change to be misconstrued as a lack of confidence or a potential problem. The change will become effective in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. Daley also said P&G plans to spend $5.5 billion on share repurchases this year and increase buybacks in fiscal 2008 while maintaining its AA credit rating. P&G will give more fiscal 2008 guidance during the fourth-quarter conference call, he said.
