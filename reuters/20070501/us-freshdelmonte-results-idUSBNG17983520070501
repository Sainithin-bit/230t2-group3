 (Reuters) - Fresh Del Monte Produce Inc. ( FDP.N ) said its quarterly profit more than tripled due to cost cuts and the closing of its Hawaii pineapple operations, driving its shares to a new year-high. 

 The company, which sells fresh and prepared fruits and vegetables, reported first-quarter net income of $51.6 million, or 89 cents a share, compared with $16.5 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a gain of 5 cents a share related to the closing of the pineapple operations, it earned 84 cents a share for the quarter. Net sales fell marginally to $836 million from $840 million due to the company's efforts to improve the performance of its "Other Fresh Produce" segment in North America. Analysts, on average, expected earnings of 40 cents a share, before exceptional items, on revenue of $859.5 million for the quarter, according to Reuters Estimates. Shares of the company rose about 17 percent, or $3.45, to $23.82 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, after hitting a new 52-week high of $24.43 earlier. (Reporting by Dilipp S.
