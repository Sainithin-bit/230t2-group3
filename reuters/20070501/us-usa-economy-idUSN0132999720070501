 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Manufacturing last month expanded at its fastest pace in almost a year, while pending home sales in March fell to their lowest in four years, according to reports on Tuesday that gave mixed signals on the economy. 

 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity rose to 54.7 in April from 50.9 in May, above the median forecast of 51.0 among analysts polled by Reuters. The reading was the highest since May 2006. Even so, it remains uncertain whether the April pickup in the factory activity would prove strong enough to offset a persistent slump in housing and lift economic growth after an anemic first quarter. "It's a shocking strong number on the manufacturing sector given the fairly weak indicators in April," said Keith Hembre, chief economist at FAF Advisors in Minneapolis. "But my feeling is that it will be short-lived given the weaker tone of the domestic economy." The National Association of Realtors said its gauge of pending sales of existing U.S. homes fell 4.9 percent to 104.3 in March, its lowest in four years. That compares with an upwardly adjusted 109.7 in February. The median forecast of analysts surveyed by Reuters was for a March reading of 109.0. Stocks and bonds reacted negatively to the unexpectedly strong manufacturing data, which suggested rising inflation and reduced likelihood that the Fed could cut rates this year. The dollar rose as the ISM data suggested an improved U.S. economic outlook. (Additional reporting by  John Parry  in New York and Patrick Rucker in Washington)
