 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Volkswagen reported on Tuesday U.S. vehicle sales data for its two largest brands in April that showed a drop in deliveries at its core VW nameplate and a rise for its luxury brand Audi. 

 VW brand car sales fell 7.0 percent to 19,086 units last month due mainly to a sharp decline in demand for its two best selling models Jetta and Passat. Audi enjoyed a gain of 9.4 percent to 8,106 vehicles as sales of its A4 convertible rose by almost 23 percent and deliveries of its relaunched TT Coupe and Roadster soared.
