 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) said on Tuesday U.S. April vehicle sales fell 13 percent from a year earlier, hurt by a weak housing market and a cutback in fleet sales. 

 The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it sold 228,623 vehicles in the United States last month, compared with 262,722 vehicles a year earlier. Results for Ford include its import brands and some medium- and heavy-duty trucks and are not adjusted for the two extra selling days in April 2006. Ford said sales of its cars were down 23.6 percent, while truck sales declined nearly 6 percent. Sales of it's best-selling F-Series pickup trucks were down 12.4 percent, while sales of the large Expedition and Navigator SUVs were up 27 percent and 13 percent respectively, Ford said.
