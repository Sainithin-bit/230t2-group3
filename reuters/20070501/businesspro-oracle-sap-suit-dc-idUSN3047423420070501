 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Business software maker Oracle 
Corp. ORCL.O on Monday asked a U.S. court to make SAP AG 
( SAPG.DE ) preserve evidence on its computers, saying it was 
concerned its German rival might destroy electronic information 
at the heart of a corporate theft lawsuit. 

  Oracle in March accused an SAP business unit in Texas of 
illegally using customer log-ins to steal software and other 
material from its password-protected Web site to create a 
"storehouse of stolen Oracle intellectual property."  SAP, which could not be reached immediately for comment, 
has denied the accusations.  Oracle said in a U.S. district court filing late on Monday 
it has repeatedly requested information and assurances that SAP 
would preserve documents, but questioned SAP's willingness to 
do so.  "This failure to meet and confer about its preservation 
activities raises questions about whether SAP has in fact 
protected highly relevant evidence from alteration or 
destruction," Oracle said.  Oracle said SAP was looking into the matter itself. The 
investigation "if performed without proper safeguards could 
result in the alteration or destruction of critical electronic 
records," Oracle said.  (Additional reporting by  Peter Henderson  in Los Angeles)
