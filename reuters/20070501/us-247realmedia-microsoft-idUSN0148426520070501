 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT.O ), the world's largest software maker, is a contender to buy Internet advertising firm 24/7 Real Media Inc. TFSM.O for as much as $1 billion, the New York Post reported on Tuesday. 

 Shares in 24/7 Real Media surged more than 28 percent in premarket trading to $12.75 from a close of $9.95 on Monday following the Post report, which cited unnamed sources. 24/7 Real Media and Microsoft could not immediately be reached for comment. The newspaper reported last month that WPP Group Plc ( WPP.L ), the world's second-largest advertising company, was also a suitor for 24/7 Real Media. At the time, analysts had estimated the company could be valued as high as $600 million. Online advertising companies have become a new focus for takeover activity since Web search leader Google Inc. ( GOOG.O ) announced a $3.1 billion deal to purchase Internet marketer DoubleClick Inc. Rival Yahoo Inc. ( YHOO.O ) said this week it would buy the remaining 80 percent it doesn't own in Right Media Inc. for about $680 million. Right Media provides direct marketing advertising to social networks and other large online audiences.
