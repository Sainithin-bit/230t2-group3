 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - NYMEX Holdings Inc. NMX.N said on Tuesday that first-quarter profit rose 67 percent, helped by strong growth in clearing and transaction fees. 

 NYMEX, which owns the world's largest physical commodities exchange, reported net income of $56.22 million, or 59 cents a share, compared with $33.63 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had forecast earnings of 57 cents a share before items, according to Reuters Estimates. Operating revenue for the quarter, mostly comprising clearing and transaction fees, rose 47 percent to $164.2 million. Average daily volume for the period was 1.513 million contracts, a 40 percent increase from a year ago. NYMEX shares were up about 1 percent in premarket electronic trading at $130.89. This was NYMEX's second quarter as a public company. The exchange sold shares in an initial public offering in November and was one of last year's strongest market debuts.
