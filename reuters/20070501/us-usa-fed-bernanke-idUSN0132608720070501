 BUTTE, Montana  (Reuters) - High savings overseas have held down U.S. interest rates, but the United States needs to raise its saving because that force will not last forever, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Tuesday. 

 "Around the world, there's a lot of extra saving being generated by countries which are cutting back their domestic consumption in order to focus on exports, and that saving is sloshing around the world ... looking for return," he said in response to questions after speaking to an economic development conference. "One piece of evidence for that is that real interest rates, despite the fact that there are issues of budget deficits and so on...remain very, very low, and that's the force of the savings that's coming into the country, pushing down real interest rates. We won't always have that, and that's why it's important for us to work on increasing our own savings rate," he added. In a speech, Bernanke said the United States benefits on balance from expanded trade, and warned against setting up barriers to imports as a response to jobs lost to international competition. "If trade both destroys and creates jobs, what is its overall effect on employment? The answer is, essentially, none," Bernanke said. The Fed chairman delivered remarks on global savings and international trade on a panel that included Montana Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat who chairs the Senate panel with oversight of taxes and trade. Baucus, who is up for reelection in 2008, has faced criticism at home for supporting trade agreements made by the Bush administration. Despite Bernanke's endorsement of the net benefits of expanded trade, they are subject to debate in the United States. U.S. lawmakers want the White House to include more labor protections in trade agreements. Bernanke acknowledged that changes associated with opening U.S. markets to imported goods and services can bring hardship for some individuals, communities and companies. "We need to continue to find ways to minimize the pain of dislocation without standing in the way of economic growth or change," he said. "No country is better placed than the United States to benefit from increased participation in the global economy," he added. Citing World Bank research, Bernanke said countries that have embraced globalization have faster-growing economies than nations that have resisted cutting import tariffs. The U.S. central bank chief played down worries that replacing American workers with lower-paid employees abroad will lead to an extensive jobs exodus. "Although globalization and trade will continue to be forces for economic change, concerns about a massive loss of jobs due to offshoring do not seem justified," he said. Erecting barriers to trade in response to job losses would indirectly raise costs for consumers and businesses, he said. "Such solutions might temporarily slow job loss in affected industries, but the benefits would be outweighed, typically many times over, by the costs, which would included higher prices for consumers and increased costs, and thus reduced competitiveness, for U.S. firms," he said.
