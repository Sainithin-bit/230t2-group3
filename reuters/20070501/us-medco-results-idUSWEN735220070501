 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Pharmacy benefit manager Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS.N said on Tuesday that quarterly profit rose sharply, helped by higher rates of dispensing generic drugs. 

 Net income rose to $274.8 million, or 94 cents per share. That compared with $44.8 million, or 15 cents per share, a year earlier, when Medco took a big charge for a legal settlement. Excluding items, earnings were $1.03 per share. Analysts on average expected 73 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.
