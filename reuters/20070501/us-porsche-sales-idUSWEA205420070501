 FRANKFURT  (Reuters) - Porsche ( PSHG_p.DE ) on Tuesday reported North American vehicle sales fell roughly 10 percent in April to 3,248 units. 

 Though its refreshed Cayenne sport utility vehicle, launched in March in North America, could boast a 9.4 percent gain in sales to 1,075 units, deliveries of its 911 coupe slid by almost 2 percent to 1,307 sports cars last month. Porsche sold 866 Boxster-based coupes, a figure which includes 509 Caymans in April. It said sales of its Boxster-based models dropped about 33 percent compared with last year.
