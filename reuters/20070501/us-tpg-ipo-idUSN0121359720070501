 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Private equity group TPG is exploring plans to sell less than 10 percent of the company to investors, a source said on Tuesday, who added that the buyout firm is also considering the launch of a public fund. 

 Both plans are in the very early stages, and the source said that the percentage TPG may sell of itself is in the "single digits." TPG's plans come as private equity firms seek infusions of cash and equity to ease fund-raising burdens, retain and payout top talent, and build out their business. "It allows founders and senior partners to cash out or deal more effectively with generational changes affecting many older, well established private equity firms," said Michael Cerminaro, a managing director at BlackRock Private Equity Partners. "Such private placement proceeds may also be used to acquire related business lines to broaden the firms business model outside of pure private equity," he said. Thanks to frothy debt markets and a steady economy, private equity firms, which buy and sell companies by borrowing most of the money, are experiencing what many in the business say is the most profitable era to date for the industry. Private equity deal volume doubled last year to more than $700 billion, with fund-raising also doubling to more than $400 billion. The good times have prompted some firms to seek ways to diversify from the traditional private equity model in preparation for a leveling off, or decline in the business. Private equity firms have traditionally raised money from pension funds and endowments and invest the capital over a three-to-five-year period. Leveraged buyout firms have sold portions of themselves to institutional investors before. American International Group ( AIG.N ) owns a stake in Blackstone, an investment that allowed Blackstone to build out its business. In March, Blackstone filed to take 10 percent of the firm public, an IPO that investors believe will see huge demand from institutional and retail investors. TPG TPG.UL raised a $14 billion buyout fund last year, and has invested in such deals as casino company Harrah's and Texas utility company TXU Corp. TXU.N. News of TPG's exploration of a stake sale and public fund were first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. TPG declined to comment. Last year, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Apollo Management launched publicly traded funds in Europe. That differs from what TPG is planning, which the source says involves packaging existing fund investments into a public fund rather than starting a fund from scratch. The advantage of that is the firm immediately has money at work, BlackRock's Cerminaro said. "A seasoned portfolio can potentially limit the negative drag in the early years and...recognize some early realizations," he said.
