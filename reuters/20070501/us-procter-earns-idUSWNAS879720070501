 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co. ( PG.N ) posted a 13.6 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, driven by developing markets, and raised the low end of its full-year profit forecast due to the growth in the quarter. 

 The profit only met, rather than exceeded, expectations, and shares of P&G fell 0.8 percent in early electronic trading. "Our initial take is that there is big headline risk for P&G this morning since the company did not beat estimates and raise guidance," said Bear Stearns analyst Justin Hott, who rates the shares "outperform." "We have seen big beats so far this quarter, but not this time from P&G," Hott said. Profit rose to $2.51 billion, or 74 cents per share, in the fiscal third quarter ended in March, from $2.21 billion, or 63 cents per share, a year earlier. The maker of Gillette razors and Pampers diapers said in March that it expected to earn 72 cents to 74 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 74 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 8.4 percent to $18.69 billion, exceeding analysts' average forecast of $18.59 billion. P&G had forecast a 7 percent to 9 percent rise. Organic sales, which exclude mergers and the impact of foreign exchange, rose 6 percent, in line with the company's forecast of 5 percent to 7 percent growth. Unit volume rose 6 percent, driven by products such as the Tide, Ariel and Downy fabric care brands, as well as Head & Shoulders shampoo and the Olay skin care line. Gross margin declined by a tenth of a percentage point to 51.6 percent of sales due to pressure from higher commodity costs and one-time items such as costs for the March recall of some Iams and Eukanuba wet pet foods manufactured by Menu Foods MEW_u.TO. LOOKING AHEAD P&G said it now expects to earn $3.01 to $3.03 per share this year, compared with a prior target of $2.99 to $3.03. That view includes dilution from the Gillette acquisition at the low end of the prior forecast of 12 cents to 18 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expect $3.03 per share. Cincinnati-based P&G said full-year sales should rise 11 percent to 12 percent, at the top end of its prior view, with organic sales up 5 percent to 6 percent. For the current fiscal fourth quarter, which ends in June, P&G forecast earnings of 64 cents to 66 cents per share. Analysts expect earnings at the top end of that range. Fourth-quarter sales should rise 6 percent to 7 percent, with organic sales up 5 percent to 6 percent, P&G said. P&G shares slipped to $63.78 in early electronic trading from a Monday close at $64.31 on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of P&G declined 1.7 percent during the quarter, while the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , of which it is a component, fell less than 0.9 percent.
