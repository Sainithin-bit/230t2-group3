 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Motorola Inc. MOT.N said on Tuesday that it had offered to work with activist investor Carl Icahn to identify a "mutually acceptable" board candidate but that the activist investor had declined the offer. 

 Icahn is asking shareholders to flout the company's recommendation and vote him onto its board at Motorola's shareholder meeting scheduled for May 7. "Since he became a Motorola stockholder three months ago, your Board has been listening to Carl Icahn," Motorola said in a filing at the Securities and Exchange Commission. "We even offered to work with Carl Icahn to identify a mutually acceptable candidate, but he declined," the company said.
