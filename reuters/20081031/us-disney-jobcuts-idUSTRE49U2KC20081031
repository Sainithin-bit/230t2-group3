 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co executives have been meeting this week to prepare belt-tightening measures that could include job cuts, the Los Angeles Times said, citing people familiar with the discussions. 

 The sources told the paper that staff reductions were being contemplated companywide. Anne Sweeney, co-chair of Disney Media Networks, asked senior staff to recommend possible cuts in case the economy deteriorates further, according to the paper. Other divisions have also been asked to make similar evaluations, the paper said citing one executive. Walt Disney Co could not be immediately reached for comment by Reuters.
