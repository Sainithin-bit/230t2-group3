 (Reuters) - October has been a month of records on financial markets, many of them unwelcome. Here are a few of them: 

 STOCK MARKETS -- MSCI's all-country world stock index was down 21 percent for the month. It was the largest monthly fall in the benchmark's 20-year history. -- Despite losses on Friday, however, the index was up more than 9 percent for the week of October 27 to 31, on the way to being the best or second best performance in the 20 years. -- MSCI's emerging market index, down around 28 percent in October, was having its worst month since August 1998, during the Russian debt crisis. -- October also saw the worst monthly performance ever for the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 and Japan's Nikkei average. The U.S. S&P 500 was close to its worst-ever monthly performance bar the nearly 22 percent loss during the October 1987 Wall Street crash. -- The VIX index, which measures volatility on the S&P 500 through options, hit its highest level since at least 1990 during the month. CURRENCIES -- The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of major currencies, had its strongest month since March 1991, up nearly 8 percent. -- The euro had its worst performance against the dollar since the single European currency's inception in 1999. -- The dollar fell around 7.5 percent against the Japanese yen, the largest monthly fall since December 1998. -- Sterling saw its biggest monthly drop against the dollar since 1992 when the pound was forced out of the European Union's exchange rate mechanism. FIXED INCOME -- The TED spread between three-month U.S. deposit rates and three-month Treasury bills hit a record wide of about 464 basis points on Oct 10, according to Morgan Stanley data. -- Two-year euro zone bond yields hit a four year low as investors piled in search of relative safety. -- The yield curve between euro zone two- and 10-year government bonds hit its steepest level since March 2005 as the short-end outperformed longer-dated paper. -- The investment-grade Markit iTraxx Europe index widened to an all-time record level on October 24 and also had a record one-day increase. -- The Markit iTraxx Crossover index, made up of 50 mostly "junk"-rated credits, also widened to an all-time record level. COMMODITIES -- The Reuters-Jefferies CRB index, a benchmark for global commodities, fell more than 23 percent in October, easily its worst month on record. The next worst month was September, when it fell 11.8 percent. -- The price of New York crude oil fell more than 36 percent, setting up October as a record monthly slide. -- The VIX index, which measures volatility on the S&P 500 through options, hit its highest level since at least 1990 during the month. INVESTOR CONFIDENCE -- The State Street Investor Confidence index slumped in the month to its lowest level in the more than 10 years it has been compiled. -- Reuters monthly asset allocation polls showed equity holdings by leading investors at the lowest level in the 4-1/2 years data has been compiled from U.S, European, UK and Japanese fund management firms. Cash levels were at their highest. -- Merrill Lynch's monthly fund manager survey was deemed by the company to be the most pessimistic in its 10-year history. -- Risk appetite for equities based on UBS's internal calculations hit the lowest level in the 16 years it has been compiled.
