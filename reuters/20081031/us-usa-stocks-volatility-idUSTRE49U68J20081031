 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Stocks had their most volatile month in nearly a quarter century in October, with half of the 10 most erratic days on record occurring within the last 30 days, Russell Investments said on Friday. 

 The news comes as worries about the credit crisis and fears of a global recession leave global stock markets heading for their worst month ever. The Russell 3000 index, which measures 98 percent of the investable U.S. equity market, fell 19.2 percent in October and is on track for its worst month since the 1987 stock market crash. The index leaped 11.5 percent on October 13 and jumped 10.2 percent on October 28 -- the second and third most volatile days on record for the 24-year-old index. The volatility measured on those days was surpassed only by "Black Monday" on October 19, 1987, when the index dropped 18 percent. On that day, U.S. stocks overall plummeted 22.6 percent, the largest one-day percentage slide ever. Volatility is measured as the percentage change in the index's value from market open to close. Three of the five most volatile days were in mid- to late-October. The eight most volatile days recorded by the index were registered either this year or in 1987. The data comes at the end of one of the worst months ever for U.S. equities, which have taken a beating during the financial crisis. If stocks rise on Friday, it will be the first two-day rally since late September when big banks rallied in hopes that the government's proposed $700 billion rescue package would be passed.
