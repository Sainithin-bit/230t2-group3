 NEW DELHI  (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon urged rich countries Thursday not to lose sight of the developing world in tackling the worst global financial crisis in decades that could see development efforts suffer. 

 "I will try to be the voice of the voiceless, and the defender of the defenseless people," Ban said in a lecture. On his first visit to India as the U.N. chief, Ban gave a bleak outlook on the impact the financial crisis could have on countries such as India if measures were not taken swiftly. "I am very worried that development assistance will suffer, and that investors might pull back from emerging markets. "People who have striven so hard to rise out of poverty could fall back into destitution." In the past month Ban has stressed that the crisis should not hit hardest "those least responsible," and warned his top lieutenants last week that the financial turmoil could jeopardize everything the United Nations has done to help the world's poor and hungry. Ban will press the issue at a financial summit of G20 leaders called by President George W. Bush on November 15. Ban has said it is important that, despite the world economic downturn, the United Nations continue to pursue its Millennium Development Goals -- eight targets for slashing poverty, hunger and disease by 2015. Addressing business leaders Thursday in a meeting on tackling climate change, Ban said he was worried the financial crisis would discourage businesses from investing in green technology, and insisted that eco-friendly growth would benefit companies in the long run. "Moving in this direction makes tremendous sense," Ban said. "Fighting climate change is a bona fide business opportunity." (Editing by  Krittivas Mukherjee )
