 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines ( DAL.N ), which completed the takeover of rival Northwest Airlines Inc earlier this week, said on Friday it promoted Hank Halter, a 10-year Delta veteran, to chief financial officer. 

 In a memo to staff, Delta also said Steve Gorman, who joined the company in December 2007, has been appointed chief operating officer. Delta's takeover of Northwest closed on Wednesday in a deal that created the world's biggest airline and prompted new speculation about further industry consolidation. The all-stock transaction, the first domestic airline combination in three years, closed after clearing its biggest and last regulatory hurdle earlier in the day -- U.S. Justice Department antitrust review.
