 DETROIT  (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co ( F.N ) said on Thursday it will add a shift at its Dearborn, Michigan, truck plant in January to produce the newly designed F-150 pickup truck, adding 1,000 union-represented jobs at the plant. 

 Ford launched production of the all-new F-150, its best-selling vehicle, Thursday. Ford said it had invested $148 million at the plant to upgrade tooling and equipment for the 2009 model-year truck. Ford also invested $110 million at its Kansas City truck plant for the new truck, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said. (Reporting by  Soyoung Kim ; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)
