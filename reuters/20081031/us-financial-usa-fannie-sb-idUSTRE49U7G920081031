 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banks will receive a favorable tax treatment on losses from indirect investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the bank regulators said on Friday. 

 In short, the regulators extended the tax treatment for direct investments in the two government-sponsored enterprises to indirect investments. "Banks, bank holding companies, and thrifts (banking organizations) are permitted to adjust their September 30, 2008, regulatory capital calculations for the tax effects from losses on direct and indirect investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock," the regulators said in a statement.
