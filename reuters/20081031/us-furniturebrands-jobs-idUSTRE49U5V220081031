 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Furniture Brands International Inc FBN.N said on Friday that it plans more cost cuts, including job reductions, to cope with slumping demand for home goods. 

 "Our non-production costs don't match our projected sales levels, and we'll make cuts in the coming months to lower those cuts," Furniture Brands Chief Executive Ralph Scozzafava said during a conference call on Friday. "Some will be in the form of corporate expense cuts and some will be in headcount." The company's shares were down 42 cents, or 7 percent, at $5.60 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have fallen 43 percent this year. Late Thursday, Furniture Brands posted a wider third-quarter loss, cut its full-year earnings view and suspended its quarterly dividend. The quarterly results included pretax charges tied to the closure of unprofitable Lane retail stores, factory downtime, severance and inventory writedowns. The St. Louis company has been revamping its business by consolidating U.S. plants and exiting store leases, particularly for its Lane and Broyhill operations. Furniture Brands intends to sell those two mid-priced brands mainly through traditional furniture retailers and mass merchants, rather than dedicated stores.
