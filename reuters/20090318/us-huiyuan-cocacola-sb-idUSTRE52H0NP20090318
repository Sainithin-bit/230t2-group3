 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Huiyuan Juice shares were suspended on Wednesday after falling 22 percent, hit by a newspaper report that Coca-Cola may drop an around $2.4 billion takeover bid for China's top juice maker. 

 The iconic Atlanta-based beverage giant may drop its bid for Huiyuan Juice after Chinese antitrust regulators signaled Coca-Cola would have to relinquish the China Huiyuan Juice brand after the acquisition, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed sources. Shares of Huiyuan opened at HK$8.00, down 22.3 percent, and well below Coke's HK$12.20 per share offer price. The acquisition by Coca-Cola would be the largest-ever takeover of a Chinese company by a foreign rival, and has been seen as a test of China's tougher anti-trust rules. Coca-Cola spokesman Kenth Kaerhoeg said in an e-mailed statement to Reuters on Wednesday that it would be inappropriate to comment on the approval process. "We are focused on the regulatory approval process. We are in very regular contact with the MOC (Ministry of Commerce), and we try to be as helpful as possible in answering questions and providing supplementary information," he said. Sources had told Reuters earlier they expected the deal to be approved with conditions, including keeping the Huiyuan brand name and possibly maintaining contracts with local farmers worried about their possible future relationship with the U.S. firm. Huiyuan shares have traded below Coca-Cola's offer price, indicating doubt among investors that a deal would be completed. (US$1=HK$7.8) (Reporting by Donny Kwok and Fion Li; Editing by  Ken Wills )
