 (Reuters) - Political pressure cast a new shadow over Rio Tinto Ltd's ( RIO.AX ) ( RIO.L ) planned $19.5 billion tie-up with Chinese state-owned Chinalco, with Australia's Senate voting on Wednesday to hold an inquiry into foreign investment. 

 Under the deal, China's top aluminum firm will pay $12.3 billion for stakes in Rio's iron ore, copper and aluminum assets and $7.2 billion for convertible notes that would double its equity stake in Rio to 18 percent. Following is background on the deal's chances of approval. WHY IS THE BID BEING SCRUTINISED? Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) examines all direct investments by foreign governments or their agencies. The board also examines investments worth A$100 million ($66 million) or more in Australian companies or foreign companies with major Australian assets. Chinalco's bid is the biggest overseas investment by a Chinese company. WHAT ARE THE POLITICAL OBJECTIONS? Independent Senator Nick Xenophon said he was concerned about the Chinalco bid as it would give the state-owned group an important stake in a strategic industry. Conservative politician Barnaby Joyce, National Party leader in the Senate, has said Chinese ownership of Australian resources is the issue -- and asserted that China would never allow the Australian government to buy a mine in China. The Greens oppose the deal because of China's human rights record. WHO MAKES THE DECISION? The FIRB reviews the deal and advises Treasurer Wayne Swan, who makes a final decision based on whether the deal is in the national interest. "The national interest" is not defined, but last February Swan outlined six general principles he would consider on foreign investment decisions. WHAT ARE THEY? * An investor's operations are independent from the relevant foreign government. * An investor is subject to and adheres to the law and observes common standards of business behavior. * An investment may hinder competition or lead to undue concentration or control in the industry or sectors concerned. * An investment may impact on Australian government revenue or other policies. * An investment may impact on Australia's national security. * An investment may impact on the operations and directions of an Australian business, as well as its contribution to the Australian economy and broader community. HAS AUSTRALIA APPROVED SIMILARLY CONTROVERSIAL DEALS? Singapore Telecommunications' $A14 billion ($9.2 billion) takeover of Australia's No.2 phone operator Optus was delayed by considerable opposition before passing in 2001. Critics cited security concerns, as the deal allowed a Singapore state-owned company to control Australia's surveillance satellite platform. Approval came with conditions, including an agreement between Singtel and the Defense Department on security matters. HAS AUSTRALIA BLOCKED BIG OVERSEAS DEALS? The biggest to be turned down was a A$10 billion hostile bid for Australian oil major Woodside Petroleum ( WPL.AX ) by Royal Dutch Shell ( RDSa.L ) in March 2001. Former Treasurer Peter Costello rejected the bid due to concerns Shell, with competing projects in other parts of the world, might not maximize the development of, and sales from, Australia's North West Shelf project. WHAT'S THE TIMETABLE FOR RIO-CHINALCO? A decision is unlikely before mid-June. The FIRB said on Monday it extended its review for another 90 days. It could then be prolonged for an additional 60 days, if necessary.
