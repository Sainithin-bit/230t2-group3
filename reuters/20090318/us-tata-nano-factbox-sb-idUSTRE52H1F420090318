 (Reuters) - Tata Motors will on Monday launch the "People's Car," the Nano, which it unveiled in January 2008 as the world's cheapest car with a dealer price of 100,000 rupees ($1,900). 

 Following are some details of the 4-door car, available in standard and deluxe versions: * Length: 3.1 meters * Height: 1.6 meters * Width: 1.5 meters * Engine: Rear-wheel drive, 2-cylinder, 623 cc, multi-point fuel-injection petrol engine, rear mounted. Tata said it is the first time a 2-cylinder gasoline engine is used in a car with single balancer shaft. * Safety: Has an all sheet-metal body, with crumple zones, intrusion-resistant doors, seat-belts, and rear tailgate glass bonded to the body. Tires are tubeless. * Environment: Tailpipe emission performance beats current regulatory requirements, and the Nano has a lower overall pollution level than two-wheelers made in India, Tata has said. A high fuel efficiency (20 km/liter) ensures low carbon dioxide emissions. * The Team: In 2003, a four-member team at Tata's Engineering Research Center in Pune city started work on a "very low cost transportation with four wheels" and a price of 100,000 rupees. Helped by the Institute of Development in Automotive Engineering in Italy, the team grew to 500, headed by Girish Wagh. * Nano Europa: Will launch in some European markets by 2011: Length: 3.29 meters; Width: 1.58 meters; Wheelbase: 2.28 meters.
