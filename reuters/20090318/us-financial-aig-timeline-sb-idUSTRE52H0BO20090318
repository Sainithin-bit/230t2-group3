 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner found out about the impending bonuses to executives at insurer AIG last Tuesday and alerted the White House on Thursday, an administration official said. 

 The official said Geithner called AIG Chief Executive Edward Liddy on Wednesday evening to express outrage about the bonuses and demand that he renegotiate them. Geithner and Treasury lawyers also started then to look for "legal solutions" to the issue. On Thursday, the official said, Geithner told the White House about the AIG payments and senior aides passed on the news to the president. On Friday, Geithner spoke to Liddy again and AIG agreed to modifications to the bonus payments. (Editing by  Sandra Maler )
