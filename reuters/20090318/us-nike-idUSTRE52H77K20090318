 Corrects to show that analyst Thomas Shaw is with Stifel Nicolaus, not Susquehanna Financial in sixth paragraph 

 By  Alexandria Sage SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Nike Inc ( NKE.N ) reported on Wednesday sliding quarterly margins and warned of shrinking worldwide demand, especially in Europe. The largest global athletic shoe and apparel maker's third-quarter earnings handily beat Wall Street expectations, but its shares fell nearly 5 percent after-hours. Nike, now in the midst of a companywide review to cut costs, also warned it would swallow restructuring charges of $175 million to $225 million in its fiscal fourth quarter, but did not provide an outlook for the period. Net profit in Nike's fiscal third quarter ended February 28 was $243.8 million, or 50 cents per share, from $463.8 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. But excluding a 49-cent per-share impairment charge from the recently acquired Umbro soccer brand, Nike earned 99 cents per share. Analysts, on average, had been expecting the company to post earnings of 79 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. "If you strip out the Umbro impairment, the 99 cent number looks quite strong," said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Thomas Shaw. "But at the same time people are looking at where's business going from here on." Shaw noted that global future orders -- an indicator of demand -- when adjusted on a constant currency basis fell 2 percent, slightly below the 1 percent to 2 percent rise that most analysts had been expecting. Demonstrating that the shoe giant is not immune to a worsening global consumer environment that has seen shoppers cut back on purchases, revenue fell 2 percent to $4.44 billion, just shy of the $4.48 billion expected by Wall Street. DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD Revenue rose 3 percent in the United States as footwear sales offset declining apparel demand. But turnover fell 14 percent in a region encompassing Europe, and 5 percent in the overall Americas. The only international region that saw growth was Asia, with an 8 percent revenue rise. Revenue from non-Nike brands, which include Cole Haan and Converse, rose 1 percent. Global orders for delivery of shoes and apparel from now through July slid 10 percent overall, slipping 1 percent in the U.S. and 25 percent in the region that includes Europe. They fell 1 percent in the Asia Pacific and 4 percent in the Americas. All international results had been hurt by a strong U.S. dollar. Nike warned in February it could cut up to 4 percent of worldwide jobs as part of an ongoing effort to streamline its business. That review is scheduled to end May 31. Gross margins fell in the quarter due to higher product costs and markdowns to clear inventories, but selling and administrative costs came down in the quarter as part of the company's push to trim expenses. Nike's shares, which are down 10 percent this year, fell 4.7 percent in extended trade after closing on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $45.92, up 1 percent.
