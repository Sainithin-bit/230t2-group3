 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama on Wednesday assailed AIG's hefty executive bonuses as an "inappropriate use of taxpayer funds" and said the government needed tools the prevent a situation like AIG's from ever again posing a risk to the financial system. 

 "Just as outrageous is the fact we find ourselves having to clean up after AIG's mess," Obama told reporters after the head of bailed-out American International Group Inc said in congressional testimony the "cold realities of competition" compelled the insurer to pay $165 million in bonuses. In response to a reporter's question, Obama said that he had "complete confidence" in Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and his other economic advisers to deal with the crisis.
