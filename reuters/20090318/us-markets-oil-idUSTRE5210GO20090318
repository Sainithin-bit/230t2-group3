 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures rose to nearly $50 in post-settlement trading late Wednesday, rising as the value of the U.S. dollar fell. 

 U.S. oil has not reached $50 per barrel since January 6. April delivery crude hit a high of $49.83 a barrel, after settling earlier on Wednesday at $48.14 a barrel. After striking $49.83, trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange Globex platform fell to around $49.40 per barrel. The U.S. dollar fell to two-month lows versus the euro after the Federal Reserve said it will buy $300 billion in long-dated Treasuries in the next six months. The euro surged to more than $1.35 for the first time since early January. Before the Fed decision, the dollar was trading at $1.31 to the euro. Crude oil prices often rise when the value of the U.S. dollar falls because buyers using other currencies like the euro have increased buying power. U.S. oil prices fell earlier on Wednesday after weekly government data showed crude inventories at their highest level since June 2007. The U.S. Energy Information Administration showed crude stockpiles up 2 million barrels, to 353.3 million barrels. That was more double the increase expected by industry analysts. Also pressuring prices on Wednesday was a cut in 2009 economic growth in China in a World Bank forecast. Behind the United States, China is the No. 2 consumer of petroleum. The World Bank forecast showed gross domestic product growth at 6.5 percent in 2009, down from a 7.5 percent forecast given in November. (Reporting by  Bernie Woodall )
