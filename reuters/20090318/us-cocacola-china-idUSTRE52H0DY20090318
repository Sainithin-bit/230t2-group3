 BEIJING  (Reuters) - China has rejected a $2.4 billion bid by Coca-Cola for China's top juice maker, Huiyuan Juice, China News Service reported on Wednesday, citing the Ministry of Commerce. 

 The acquisition would have been the largest-ever takeover of a Chinese company by a foreign rival. Bankers and investors had eagerly anticipated the ministry's ruling as a litmus test of China's attitudes toward overseas investment in the wake of last year's promulgation of a tough anti-monopoly law.
