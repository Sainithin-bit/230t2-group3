 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banking authorities closed four banks on Friday, bringing the total number shuttered in 2011 to 22. 

 In 2010, 157 banks failed following 140 failures in 2009. The bulk of the failures have increasingly been smaller institutions, those with less than $1 billion in assets, as large banks have recovered more quickly from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The FDIC announced the following closures on Friday: *Habersham Bank of Clarkesville, Georgia was closed. The bank's eight branches will reopen as part of SCBT National Association ( SCBT.O ). As of December 31, 2010, Habersham Bank had approximately $387.6 million in total assets and $339.9 million in total deposits. *Citizens Bank of Effingham of Springfield, Georgia, was shuttered, with its four branches reopening on Saturday as part of HeritageBank of the South ( HBOS.O ). As of December 31, 2010, Citizens Bank of Effingham had about $214.3 million in total assets and $206.5 million in total deposits. *Charter Oak Bank of Napa, California, was closed. The two branches of Charter Oak Bank will reopen on Tuesday as branches of Bank of Marin. As of December 31, 2010, Charter Oak Bank had approximately $120.8 million in total assets and $105.3 million in total deposits. *San Luis Trust Bank, FSB of San Luis Obispo, California, which had one branch, will reopen on Tuesday as part of First California Bank. It had about $332.6 million in total assets and $272.2 million in total deposits as of December 31, 2010. (Editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid)
