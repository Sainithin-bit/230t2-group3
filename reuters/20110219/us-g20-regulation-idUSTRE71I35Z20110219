 PARIS/LONDON  (Reuters) - The world's biggest banks must have higher capital safeguards and supervisors will widen their net across the sector, finance ministers from the Group of 20 leading economies said on Saturday. 

 Ministers also agreed there could be "possible actions" to calm food and other commodity price surges that have sparked street riots -- but stopped short of price controls, saying there needed to be further study as countries remain divided over what is driving markets higher. The G20 entered new regulatory territory by calling for global rules on consumer protection by October. Above all the meeting signaled fresh determination to shackle the world's top banks and avoid taxpayers having to shore up the sector again in the next financial crisis. G20 leaders had failed to agree on extra safeguards for systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) last year but aim to reach a deal when they meet in November. "It's good we now have a clear timetable by the leaders' summit," British Finance Minister George Osborne said. The package will be applied to the biggest banks first but all firms whose failure would disrupt markets are targeted. "It's also significant that having come up with a new regime, it will move expeditiously to cover all SIFIs," Osborne said. Britain had wanted mandatory capital surcharges on SIFIs but faced fierce opposition from France and Germany. Although ministers reiterated that banks will have to hold higher loss absorbency measures, this will be done through a "menu of viable alternatives that may include, depending on national circumstances, capital surcharges, contingent capital and bail-in instruments." Contingent capital and bail-in instruments comprise debt that converts into equity when a bank's capital runs low -- a cheaper alternative than having to hold additional equity. "We have reassured each other, that it will need higher capital requirements for those kind of banks," said Axel Weber, head of Germany's Bundesbank. "There is still a discussion about the concrete instruments for that. I think that we will end up with a broad approach," Weber said. The SIFI measures will come on top of tougher capital requirements for all banks, known as Basel III, from 2013. The world is heading toward its fourth anniversary since the financial crisis began in a corner of the U.S. home loans market and G20 ministers said there was still much to do to improve financial regulation. IMF Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said little had been done to beef up cross-border supervision and resolution of banks. The G20's regulation task force, the Financial Stability Board, faces a growing workload and ministers asked it to present proposals by April on how to strengthen its governance, resources and outreach. SHADOW BANKS, COMPUTERISED TRADING G20 ministers injected some urgency into cracking down on the shadow banking sector of money market mutual funds, off-balance sheet vehicles and hedge funds. It is closely linked to the main banking sector, creating contagion channels in times of stress, according to regulators. "It was common sense that regulating the banking-sector is not enough. We must also look at the shadow-banking-sector. Indirect regulation is not enough," Weber said. The FSB will make recommendations by mid-2011 on supervision and new regulation of the shadow banking sector to "address the risks, notably of arbitrage, associated with shadow banking and its interactions with the regulated banking system." The G20 also said it wants a global approach by mid-year to supervising computerized trading of vast amounts of share trades in nanoseconds, making it hard for regulators to keep track when things go wrong. COMMODITIES CAUTION G20 ministers responded cautiously to French calls to dampen commodity price surges to record highs in recent months which some blame on speculation. The G20 statement simply spoke of the impact of "potential excessive commodity price volatility," signaling no consensus on whether speculators unduly influence prices rather than supply and demand factors as some countries argue. Ministers requested a study of "underlying drivers and the challenges" posed for consumers and producers and consider "possible actions." "Clearly we have to sort out the drivers of commodity markets... Let's improve physical market transparency, improve regulation of commodity derivatives... and thirdly we should address food security," said Gyorgy Matolcsy, finance minister for Hungary which holds the rotating EU presidency. G20 studies of oil price volatility will be extended to cover coal and gas.
