 VIENNA  (Reuters) - European Central Bank Governing Council member Ewald Nowotny said on Monday he backed ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet's support for a strong U.S. dollar. 

 "Of course I agree with my president (in support of strong dollar), there has always been an interest both from the side of the euro zone and the side of the US ... we have a shared interest in avoiding wide (FX market) fluctuations," he told reporters. Earlier on Monday Trichet told a European Parliament committee he backed the argument for a strong dollar in foreign exchange markets. "As regards the dollar, I would say that in the present situation it is extremely important that we can have in the framework at the level of the global finance and the global economy a strong dollar... The solidity of the dollar is very important," Trichet said. (Reporting by  Mike Winfrey , Writing by Marc Jones)
