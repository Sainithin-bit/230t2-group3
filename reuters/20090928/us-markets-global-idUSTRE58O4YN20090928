 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Global stocks and oil rose on Monday as news of several billion-dollar takeover offers boosted confidence in a global recovery and led investors to wade back into riskier assets after last week's sell-off. 

 The U.S. dollar dropped for a third session versus the Japanese currency, sliding below 89 yen at one point, after comments by Japan's finance minister raised speculation the new government was unlikely to intervene to weaken its currency. Oil rose more than 1 percent toward $67 a barrel as equity markets jumped and news emerged that Iran was test-firing missiles. U.S. stocks snapped a three-day losing streak and European shares broke two days of losses on increased merger and acquisition activity, which is considered bullish as it suggests companies are optimistic about the economic outlook. Abbott Laboratories ( ABT.N ) said it would buy the drug unit of Solvay ( SOLB.BR ) in a 4.5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) deal, and Xerox Corp ( XRX.N ), in its biggest acquisition ever, plans to buy Affiliated Computer Services Inc ( ACS.N ) for $6.4 billion in cash and stock. "It's always a positive sign when you see companies putting money to work, whether they buy other companies, invest in new plants, (or) buyback their own stock," said Tim Smalls, head of U.S. stock trading at brokerage firm Execution LLC in Greenwich, Connecticut. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 124.17 points, or 1.28 percent, at 9,789.36. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  gained 18.60 points, or 1.78 percent, at 1,062.98. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  jumped 39.82 points, or 1.90 percent, at 2,130.74. The yen later gave up most gains after Japanese Finance Minister Hirohisa Fujii told Dow Jones newswires it was wrong to see his comments as a license to push the yen higher. "The comments by the finance minister seemed to be an open door to people who were bullish on the yen," said David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets. The dollar was up against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY up 0.23 percent at 76.988. The euro slipped 0.57 percent at $1.4603. Against the yen, the dollar fell 0.01 percent at 89.62. Oil gained as M&A activity bodes well for the economy and increased energy demand. Iran test-fired a type of missile which defense analysts said could hit Israel and U.S. bases in the Gulf region, Iranian state television reported. U.S. crude rose to settle up 82 cents at $66.84 a barrel, after earlier hitting an intraday high of $67.54. London Brent rose 43 cents to settle at $65.54. U.S. 30-year Treasury bonds extended their gains, rallying more than a point in price as investors remained heartened by last week's assurances that the Federal Reserve will preempt inflation before it takes off. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note was up 9/32 in price to yield 3.29 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rose 34/32 in price to yield 4.04 percent. Bets that inflation will remain low, spurred by German consumer price data and comments by the European Central Bank president, helped longer-dated U.S. and euro zone government debt to rise. "There's no inflation, and people are catching on to that," said Glen Capelo, co-head of rates at BroadPoint Capital in New York. Germany's consumer price index fell a faster-than-expected 0.3 percent annually in September, while the ECB's Jean-Claude Trichet said inflation is expected to remain subdued over the medium term. The 10-year Bund yield was almost two basis points higher at 3.254 percent in late trade, having hit a low of 3.213 percent. Bond yields and prices move inversely. Gold futures rose toward $1,000 an ounce as a wave of economic optimism prompted investment inflows into asset classes across the board, bolstering the status of gold as a hedge against inflation. December gold futures settled up $2.50 at $994.10 an ounce in New York. Copper steadied by the close, as a rally in equities helped offset concerns about rising inventories, falling Chinese imports and weak demand in western countries. Copper for December delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division fell 1.35 cents to close at $2.7270 a pound. The Nikkei share average  .N225  shed 2.5 percent to hit a two-month low and briefly fell below the 10,000 line. The MSCI benchmark of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 1.3 percent, while the Thomson Reuters index for regional shares .TRXFLDAXPU shed 1.4 percent.
