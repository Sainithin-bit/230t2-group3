 (Reuters) - Technology companies have been beefing up their portfolios by buying up service providers, which are proven to be attractive targets with their relatively high-margin businesses and stability during tough economic times. 

 On Monday, Xerox Corp said it plans to buy Affiliated Computer Services Inc in a deal valued at $5.4 billion. Xerox Chief Executive Ursula Burns said the company's revenue from services will triple to an estimated $10 billion next year from $3.5 billion in 2008 after the deal.
