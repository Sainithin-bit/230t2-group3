 (Reuters) - Carlyle Capital Corp CARC.AS, an affiliate of U.S.-based buyout firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL, says it is in default on about $16.6 billion of its debt and its lenders would likely seize its remaining assets. 

 2007 July 4 - Guernsey-based Carlyle Capital Corporation Ltd (CCC) begins trading on Amsterdam's stock exchange at $20 per share in an initial public offering that was postponed and trimmed due to "headwinds" in the market.

July 11 - CCC says an over-allotment option for additional shares has been fully exercised, bringing total number of shares to 18.2 million shares and gross proceeds to $345.5 million, compared with initial target of $400 million.

CCC says it is also scrapping a planned dividend and selling $900 million of assets to help shore up the fund.

March 6 - CCC says its has been unable to meet some margin calls and has received a notice of default. It says that since the liquidity crisis in global fixed income markets started in August, it had sold almost $1 billion in assets to improve liquidity and reduce leverage.
