 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A review of U.S. capital markets, led by the Treasury Department and released on Thursday, said investment houses improperly weighed risky investments and held too little capital to protect against losses. 

 Current regulation "encouraged the securitization of assets through facilities with very low capital requirements," stated a report from the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. Regulators knew too little about exposure to off-balance sheet investments and how Wall Street firms were measuring their exposure to risky mortgage investments, the report said. The report recommends higher capital requirements and better disclosure of risky investments. It also outlines new consumer protections for the mortgage lending industry.
