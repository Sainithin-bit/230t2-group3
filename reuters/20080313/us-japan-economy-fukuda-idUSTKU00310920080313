 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda said on Thursday that rapid fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are undesirable. 

 He also said he does not want any policy vacuum when Bank of Japan Governor Toshihiko Fukui retires next Wednesday. Fukuda was speaking to reporters after the dollar broke below 100 yen for the first time in 12 years, hammered across the board by worries over the health of the U.S. economy and the financial sector. The dollar fell as low as 99.80 yen according to Reuters data, down 1.6 percent on the day and testing levels last seen in late 1995. (Reporting by Sumio Ito)
