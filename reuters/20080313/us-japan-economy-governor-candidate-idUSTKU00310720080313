 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Ruling and opposition lawmakers are to ask Japan's government to resolve an impasse over a new central bank governor by proposing a new candidate by March 17, a senior opposition lawmaker told reporters on Thursday. 

 "We have agreed that it is desirable to avoid a policy vacuum, even just for one day," said Kenji Yamaoka, a senior lawmaker in the main opposition Democratic Party. He was speaking to reporters after meeting Tadamori Oshima, head of the parliamentary affairs committee for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. Yamaoka said Oshima suggested the government might propose changing the Bank of Japan Law. There has been speculation that the government might seek to extend the term of Toshihiko Fukui, who is due to retire as BOJ governor on March 19. (Reporting by  Hideyuki Sano )
