 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Jiro Yanase, the man who paved the way for many foreign automakers to break into the Japanese market and helped European brands become a status symbol here, has died at the age of 91, a company spokesman said on Thursday. 

 Born the son of a car importer, Yanase joined the family business in 1939, just as the increasingly nationalistic Japanese government banned sales of foreign cars. After World War Two, he restarted imports of GM vehicles in 1948, and later secured the rights to sell Mercedes, Volkswagen, Audi and Volvo among other makes, thereby making the name Yanase almost synonymous with imported cars. "Jiro Yanase has provided American and European manufacturers the initial entrance -- and the most successful means of selling cars -- to the Japanese market," the U.S. Automotive Hall of Fame said when it inducted him in 2004. He was also honored by the German government for his services to the country's car industry. Some prestigious European car makers such as Mercedes-Benz have gone on to carve out healthy niche markets in Japan. But vehicles from U.S. makers have struggled to make inroads in Japan, while Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota have triumphed in the United States, resulting in trade friction between the two governments in the 1980s and 1990s. U.S. manufacturers have in the past blamed import and currency restrictions while Japanese automakers have countered that they just didn't make good small cars. About 8.3 percent of new passenger vehicles sold in Japan in 2006 were imported, compared with a peak of 10.6 percent in 1996. "As an industry leader he made a huge contribution to the development of car imports," the Japan Automobile Importers Association said in a statement. "We would like to continue his work," it said.
