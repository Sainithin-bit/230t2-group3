 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The head of Europe's employers lobby said on Thursday he hoped for action to curb the strength of the euro which hit new record highs against the dollar earlier in the day. 

 "We consider the euro and the dollar as two potential weaknesses for the future and I hope something will be done about them," BusinessEurope President Ernest-Antoine Seilliere told reporters. He was speaking as he arrived for a regular meeting with top EU officials and ECB chief Jean-Claude Trichet before a summit of EU leaders in Brussels.
