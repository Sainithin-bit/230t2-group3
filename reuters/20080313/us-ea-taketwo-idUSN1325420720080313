 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O plans to make a tender offer to acquire all of rival video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc's ( TTWO.O ) outstanding shares for $26 each, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the matter. 

 A spokesman for Electronics Arts was not immediately available. On February 24 EA made an unsolicited bid of $26 a share, or $1.9 billion, for Take-Two, publisher of the Grand Theft Auto game. Take-Two rejected the bid as inadequate. Take-Two shares closed up on Wednesday at $24.91 on Nasdaq. (Reporting by  Yinka Adegoke )
