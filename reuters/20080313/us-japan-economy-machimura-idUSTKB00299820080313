 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan's top government spokesman said on Thursday that he was watching stock and currency moves with great interest, while he declined to comment on specific levels. 

 "As I always say on currency and stock prices, it is not appropriate to say whether they are high or low," Chief Cabinet Secretary Nobutaka Machimura told a news conference. "But I'm watching with the utmost interest as to how their moves would affect the Japanese economy." The dollar tumbled to a 12-year low below 101 yen on Thursday, sliding on doubts about the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's efforts to aid strained credit markets and limit the damage to the U.S. economy.
