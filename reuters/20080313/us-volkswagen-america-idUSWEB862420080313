 WOLFSBURG, Germany  (Reuters) - Volkswagen ( VOWG.DE ), the world's fourth-largest carmaker, confirmed widespread speculation that it was concentrating its search for a new North American plant in the United States. 

 "Initially we plan an annual capacity of 100,000-150,000 vehicles," VW production boss Jochem Heizmann said. Volkswagen said it had hedged its foreign exchange risks to varying degrees into 2012. (Reporting by  Christiaan Hetzner )
