 PARIS  (Reuters) - An employee of Societe Generale has been freed by police, the day after he was arrested in connection with a probe into a rogue trading scandal at the bank, the Paris prosecutor's office said. 

 The prosecutor's office said the employee would not face further questioning. On January 24, SocGen unveiled 4.9 billion euros ($7.53 billion) of trading losses which it blamed on rogue deals carried out by Jerome Kerviel, a 31-year old junior trader at the bank. Investigators are trying to see whether Kerviel had any accomplices. SocGen has said Kerviel acted alone. (Reporting by Thierry Leveque)
