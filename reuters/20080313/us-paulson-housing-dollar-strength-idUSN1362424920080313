 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary said on Thursday -- for a second time on the same day -- that a strong dollar was in the U.S. interest and that economic fundamentals remained solid. 

 "We've taken quite a clear position on this in saying that a strong dollar is in our nation's interest and then recognizing that our economy like any other is going to have its ups and downs," he said on National Public Radio. "But our long-term fundamentals are strong and I believe that they're going to be reflected in the value of our currency here," he said on a day when the dollar's value hit fresh lows against the euro.
