 SAN FRANCISCO  (Reuters) - Electronic Arts Inc ERTS.O plans to make a $26-a-share tender offer for all outstanding shares of rival video game publisher Take-Two Interactive Software Inc ( TTWO.O ), following its rejection of EA's unsolicited offer at the same price last month, according to a person familiar with the matter. 

 EA's tender offer will expire on the midnight of April 11, 2008, but could be extended, this person said. Take-Two, which publishes the blockbuster Grand Theft Auto game, had rejected EA's offer as too low and ill-timed.
