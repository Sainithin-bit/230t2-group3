 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials on Wednesday pushed back against European claims the World Trade Organization found U.S. aircraft maker Boeing had received more than $20 billion in U.S. government subsidies. 

 "There seems to be a number of significant inaccuracies," Nefeterius McPherson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Trade Representative's office, said in response to published reports based on European sources. Earlier on Wednesday, Reuters quoted an unidentified European source who said a WTO dispute settlement panel had found Boeing received more than $20 billion in U.S. government subsidies and called for them to be withdrawn. McPherson said she could not discuss the content of the reports because it was still confidential. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by  Jackie Frank )
