 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan has intervened in the currency market on Wednesday for the first time in six years, buying the dollar to stem a rise in the yen that is threatening a fragile economic recovery. 

 COMMENTARY: LEE JIN-WOO, HEAD OF RESEARCH CENTER, NH INVESTMENT & FUTURES, SEOUL "Japan's authorities have declared war in sending a signal that they will not allow the dollar/yen to fall to 80 easily. It has become difficult for investors to make a one-way bet on a stronger yen. I think dollar/yen may try to rise to 86, a 60-day moving average and where players have built up large dollar-short positions." "Today's intervention showed that all countries in the globe want weakness in their currencies. So, I don't expect any other countries to help Japan." JUNYA TANASE, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN, TOKYO "The amount of intervention isn't likely to be as much as Japan was spending the last time it intervened, so it won't be enough to stop dollar/yen from falling. It is also unlikely that other countries will cooperate. "I don't think the Bank of Japan will lower interest rates. The BOJ doesn't want to kill the functioning of money markets with zero rates. They could conduct some other type of easing, such as using funding operations." SIMON WONG, REGIONAL ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK, HONG KONG "Naoto Kan's victory yesterday has further consolidated his powers. He has now gained a stronger mandate here to support the economy and this is only the first step what he will likely do going forward. I think today's step is clearly a signal to be more proactive in pursuing more pro-growth polices. That would mean the government may step up pressure on the BOJ to expand measures such as more direct purchases of JGBs." Authorities have clearly indicated that they don't want the yen to strengthen above 80 per dollar. It is intervening around 83 levels. In the medium-term the government will continue pursuing pro-growth policies." TAKAO HATTORI, ANALYST AT SECURITIES RESEARCH CO TIW "In the short term it provides some relief. Taking action is important in itself. But it's too early to say whether the trend has changed, so it's not as though companies in the electronics sector, for example, can relax completely. "There is still concern that the yen might go as high as 80 to the dollar." TAKEO MIYAMOTO, TECH SECTOR ANALYST, DEUTSCHE SECURITIES "The companies I cover are exporters, so a move that puts the brakes on the strong yen is positive. But the 84 yen level is still higher than what most companies have assumed for this business year, so conditions are still severe from an absolute figure point of view." JOHN VAIL, CHIEF GLOBAL STRATEGIST, NIKKO ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "Clearly the U.S. is not going to be too friendly toward it although they may not argue too much about it in that Japan is a big customer for its Treasury securities." "I'm not sure we are going to see a major weakening of the macro statistics in Japan, but if we do that would obviously help weaken the yen, but exports were quite strong in July both on a nominal and real basis so it's a bit of a quandary for Japan." "But the biggest problem for Japan is not the U.S. cross rates, it's the Korean won, and the Korean won has just been ridiculously weak. Yet G20 officials have yet to really pressure Korea on this at all, which I think is really to Japan's detriment." SATORU OGASAWARA, ECONOMIST, CREDIT SUISSE SECURITIES JAPAN, TOKYO "The BOJ has said it will not target the currency as part of its monetary policy, just that they will watch the market closely, so I would not anticipate any movement from the BOJ from this movement." YASUO YAMAMOTO, SENIOR ECONOMIST, MIZUHO RESEARCH INSTITUE, TOKYO "There were views in the market that (Prime Minister) Kan was more tolerant of a higher yen and the yen rose after he was won the ruling party leadership vote yesterday. "The government probably wanted to stamp out those views. "But the question is: will the yen stop rising from here? It's not clear. "The impact may depend on how the U.S. authorities see this. Even if the U.S. did not join in intervening, if they show understanding for the latest move, it could mean they could cooperate in joint intervention when the yen goes to 80 per dollar." SEIJI ADACHI, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE SECURITIES, TOKYO "I don't think it could have an immediate impact. But if the government intervenes over and over again it could be a message that Japan will not allow the yen to get stronger and could have some impact. "It also depends on the size of the intervention whether it could be effective. It is possible for the government to spend 10-20 trillion yen ($120-241 billion)." FUJIO ANDO, ADVISOR, CHIBAGIN ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "This action delivered a message to the world that Japan is ready to act if the yen appreciates further from the 83 yen-per-dollar level, especially since the domestic political chaos is seen stabilizing after yesterday's DPJ election. 'Japan is finally ready', is my first impression. "This is good news for Japan, although the intervention could have taken place a month ago." MASARU HAMASAKI, SENIOR STRATEGIST, TOYOTA ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "The market took the intervention as a surprise as many market participants had expected the Kan government may not be able to act flexibly in the currency market. The intervention can buy time, but the government simply can't intervene heavily for a long time as its effect will run out quickly. "Along with the intervention, the government needs to come up with distinct policies to stem the yen's rise and boost the domestic economy. Otherwise, the yen could start firming quickly and share prices could come under pressure again." MASANOBU TAKAHASHI, CHIEF STRATEGIST, ICHIYOSHI SECURITIES, TOKYO "The government was waiting for the result of the DPJ elections... but not many market players think this will have a huge impact. It's just a pre-emptive strike to show that the government is keeping an eye on the yen." TAKEO OKUHARA, FUND MANAGER, DAIWA SB ASSET MANAGEMENT, TOKYO "The market expectation from Kan has been that he will not take a decisive stance on intervention, so the fact that he took decisive action is being received favorably by the market. "It was also very timely that it came as the yen renewed its highs against the dollar after Kan's victory yesterday and the pace of the rise was quickening. There was some slight anticipation for the government to step in after the yen's surge yesterday, so in this sense, too, the intervention met market expectations. "The action also followed business leaders voicing concerns about the yen's strength. "The impact of the intervention will likely be limited as it is a solo intervention, but it will help to slow the pace of the yen's rise. "Taking such an action right after Kan's election yesterday is aimed at showing the government's stance on currencies." TAKAO HATTORI, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, MITSUBISHI UFJ MORGAN STANLEY SECURITIES, TOKYO "The size of the currency market is no longer small enough for intervention to change the trend in the yen. I am interested in seeing how the government would announce its stance and its approach to support the economy. "If they intervened, it was good for the government to show its strong stance but the market is too big for the intervention to change the yen's trend."
