 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are holding hearings this week on what the United States should do to pressure China to let its currency rise more in value against the U.S. dollar. 

 Lawmakers in both the House and Senate have prepared bills designed to put pressure on Beijing. Here is a primer on where things stand with the legislation: HOW LIKELY IS CONGRESS TO ACT? U.S. lawmakers have threatened legislation for years without ever sending a bill to the president's desk. However, given the volatile politics and a grim jobs picture, some analysts think either the House or Senate could pass a bill ahead of congressional elections on November 2. Congress would have to work quickly; lawmakers want to break to campaign by mid-October. Even if both chambers pass bills, time could run out before a final compromise between the two competing bills is reached. Administration officials have not said whether President Barack Obama would veto a bill if one were to reach his desk. HOW WOULD CHINA RESPOND? China reacted angrily last year when Obama slapped duties on its tire exports to the United States. It would likely be even more irate if Congress passes and Obama signs legislation treating China's undervalued currency as a government subsidy. Beijing would almost certainly challenge the action at the World Trade Organization and could also retaliate by making life difficult for U.S. exporters. The bill could also dampen Chinese willingness to cooperate in other areas, including on the Iran nuclear issue. But Beijing has tended to keep its economic disputes with Washington at some distance from other areas of diplomatic engagement, and tends not to link the two. Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao is likely to warn Obama against currency legislation when they meet at the United Nations next week. And enactment of a bill would make for frosty meetings between Obama and Chinese President Hu Jintao at the G20 summit and a meeting of Asia-Pacific leaders in November. WHY IS THE ISSUE HEATING UP NOW? U.S. manufacturers -- mainly those who compete against imports from China -- have complained for years that the yuan is undervalued by 25 percent to 40 percent. They say that gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage, contributing to U.S. job losses and a U.S. trade deficit with China that could approach $250 billion this year. China's strong economic growth when the U.S. economy is struggling adds to the resentment. With majority Democrats facing potentially large losses in the November elections, many may feel a tough vote against Beijing could play well at the polls. Current U.S. law requires the Treasury Department to identify any country that manipulates its currency for an unfair trade advantage -- but President Barack Obama and his predecessors have never taken this step. Earlier this year, China eased its currency peg to the dollar and avoided the manipulator label when Geithner issued his twice-yearly report on currency manipulation in July. Since China's June move, the yuan has risen just 1.25 percent against the dollar and many U.S. lawmakers feel like Washington was duped. This week, the  yuan posted its fastest 5-day gain in two years, a move some analysts see as an effort by Beijing to calm the political waters ahead of this week's hearings. HOW DO THE HOUSE AND SENATE BILLS DIFFER? Both bills would authorize the U.S. Commerce Department to slap duties on goods from countries with "fundamentally misaligned" currencies. The House bill lays out criteria to identify countries with undervalued currencies and instructs the Commerce Department on how to calculate countervailing and antidumping duties to offset the undervaluation. The Senate bill is more complicated and gives the White House discretion to avoid taking punitive action. It seeks to clarify that the Commerce Department already has the authority to treat undervalued currencies as a foreign subsidy for the purpose of calculating countervailing duties, and requires the department to investigate that charge if presented with a petition by a company. It also requires the Treasury Department to produce a report each March and September to identify two categories of currencies: "fundamentally misaligned currencies" and a "priority" category where misalignment is caused by government action. If the Treasury Department designates any country as a priority country, it must first begin talks to try to persuade it to reform its exchange rate policy. If the designated country does not take sufficient action within 90 days, the United States can start applying antidumping duties on individual goods to offset currency undervaluation. Companies from the designated country generally would be ineligible for U.S. government procurement contracts, government-backed financing assistance and U.S. support for International Monetary Fund or World Bank financing projects in the offending country. In addition, the Treasury secretary, in consultation with the U.S. Federal Reserve, is instructed to consider intervening in foreign exchange markets against the misaligned currency. The president is given authority to waive any of the above actions if he determines that would be in the national security or economic interest of the United States. Congress can overturn the waiver with a vote by both the Senate and House. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer  in Washington and Chris Buckley in Beijing; Editing by Andrew Hay and  Tim Dobbyn )
