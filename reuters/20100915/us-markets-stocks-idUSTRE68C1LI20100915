 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday but remained stuck in a recent trading range as disappointing economic data hindered the S&P 500 from breaking through 1,130, a key technical level. 

 The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  gained 46.93 points, or 0.45 percent, to end unofficially at 10,573.42. The Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  rose 3.99 points, or 0.36 percent, to finish unofficially at 1,125.09. The Nasdaq Composite  .IXIC  added 11.55 points, or 0.50 percent, to close unofficially at 2,301.32.
