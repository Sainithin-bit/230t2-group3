 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner will tell lawmakers that China's yuan currency has risen too slowly and he is examining what tools may be needed to persuade Beijing to move faster. 

 "We are concerned, as are many of China's trading partners, that the pace of appreciation has been too slow and the extent of appreciation too limited," Geithner said in prepared testimony to the Senate Banking Committee to be delivered on Thursday. "We will take China's actions into account as we prepare the next Foreign Exchange Report, and we are examining the important question of what mix of tools, those available to the United States and multilateral approaches, might help encourage the Chinese authorities to move more quickly."
