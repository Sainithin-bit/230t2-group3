 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan has intervened in the currency market on Wednesday for the first time in six years, buying the dollar to stem a rise in the yen that is threatening a fragile economic recovery. 

 COMMENTARY: SIMON FLINT, NOMURA SECURITIES GLOBAL HEAD OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESEARCH BASED IN SINGAPORE "Japan will be seen as a special case. Obviously its economy has been in significant trouble for a while, stocks have been depressed for some time, export performance relative to the Asian peer group has been very weak. To some degree there will be some sympathy in the rest of the world for Japan's predicament. "Having said that it does slightly complicate global fx policy because Japanese intervention does create some cover for other major Asian interveners who could be tempted to tell the international community that if Japan can intervene, we should also be able to do the same. But I don't think it will be the dominant reaction or the dominant result of Japanese intervention but I do think that is important. "Take the ratio of China's exports to Japan's exports over the last 10 years. Currently China's exports are over 200 percent of Japan's, 10 years ago it was exactly the other way around. This gives you an idea how much competitiveness China has gained versus the Japanese. "The story is also true in a place like South Korea. Korean exports as a proportion of Japanese exports were around 35 percent in 2000. That ratio is now about 65 percent. Japan has lost a lot of market share in export markets. Obviously the yen has been very strong and the economy has been quite depressed. There will be some comprehension of what has led them to do this (intervention). I don't think there will be a huge amount of endorsement either. But there should be some understanding. LEE JIN-WOO, HEAD OF RESEARCH CENTER, NH INVESTMENT & FUTURES, SEOUL "Japan's authorities have declared war in sending a signal that they will not allow the dollar/yen to fall to 80 easily. It has become difficult for investors to make a one-way bet on a stronger yen. I think dollar/yen may try to rise to 86, a 60-day moving average and where players have built up large dollar-short positions." "Today's intervention showed that all countries in the globe want weakness in their currencies. So, I don't expect any other countries to help Japan." JUNYA TANASE, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, JPMORGAN, TOKYO "The amount of intervention isn't likely to be as much as Japan was spending the last time it intervened, so it won't be enough to stop dollar/yen from falling. It is also unlikely that other countries will cooperate. "I don't think the Bank of Japan will lower interest rates. The BOJ doesn't want to kill the functioning of money markets with zero rates. They could conduct some other type of easing, such as using funding operations." SIMON WONG, REGIONAL ECONOMIST, STANDARD CHARTERED BANK, HONG KONG "Naoto Kan's victory yesterday has further consolidated his powers. He has now gained a stronger mandate here to support the economy and this is only the first step what he will likely do going forward. I think today's step is clearly a signal to be more proactive in pursuing more pro-growth polices. That would mean the government may step up pressure on the BOJ to expand measures such as more direct purchases of JGBs." Authorities have clearly indicated that they don't want the yen to strengthen above 80 per dollar. It is intervening around 83 levels. In the medium-term the government will continue pursuing pro-growth policies."
