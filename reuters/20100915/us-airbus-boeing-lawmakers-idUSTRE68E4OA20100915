 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Two Kansas lawmakers on Wednesday brushed off a World Trade Organization ruling against U.S. government support for Boeing, saying any subsidies for the U.S. manufacturer paled in comparison to European government support for Airbus. 

 "When you compare side by side the alleged Boeing subsidies with Airbus' confirmed launch aid and illegal subsidies, it's easy to see who tips the scales. I am convinced that we must account for illegal subsidies in defense procurement programs, particularly in the case of the new KC-X competition," Senator Sam Brownback said in a joint statement with Representative Todd Tiahrt, both Kansas Republicans. They were referring to an Air Force competition for a new refueling tanker that has pitted Boeing against Airbus. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer ; Editing by  Eric Beech )
