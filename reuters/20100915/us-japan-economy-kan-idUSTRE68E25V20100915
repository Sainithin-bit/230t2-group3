 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Prime Minister Naoto Kan said on Wednesday that Japan intervened in the foreign exchange market because the yen had reached a level at which action was necessary. 

 Kan told reporters that Wednesday's intervention had achieved a certain effect but the government was watching foreign exchange moves with a sense of urgency. Japan sold yen in the market on Wednesday for the first time in six years to help stop the currency's relentless rise from hurting exporters and threatening a fragile economic recovery, a day after Kan won a ruling party leadership race to keep his job.
