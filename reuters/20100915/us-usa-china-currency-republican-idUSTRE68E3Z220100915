 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - A proposed bill to press China to revalue its currency would not address fundamental Chinese trade barriers, the senior Republican on the House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee said Wednesday . 

 "The legislation being discussed today ... is not the best way forward," said Representative Dave Camp in prepared remarks. He said the bill might violate World Trade Organization rules, draw legal retaliation against American businesses, and shut down trade in inputs from China that are needed by U.S. industry. Camp, who represents the troubled industrial state of Michigan, told the panel he agreed that China's currency is undervalued and should be allowed to appreciate according to market supply and demand. "But at the same time we cannot lose sight of more fundamental problems with China's economy that affect our trade balance, including the increasingly blatant and disturbing increase in the economic dominance of state-owned enterprises and the proliferation of non-tariff barriers preventing U.S. companies from exporting to China," he said. Camp said that instead of passing a currency bill, the Obama administration should aggressively raise the currency issue in bilateral talks and enlist allies to bring pressure on Beijing in multilateral meetings such as the Group of 20. He also said the United States "needs to get its own fiscal house in order" because China wouldn't be piling up Treasury bills if Washington weren't rapidly running up debt.
