 NEW YORK/BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Fewer Americans fell behind on their credit card loans in August, but improvement is coming at a slower pace, suggesting banks' consumer loan losses may take years to return to normal levels. 

 Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and JPMorgan Chase and Co ( JPM.N ) reported their lowest monthly delinquency rates of the year on Wednesday. Those same lenders said their overall loss rates rose slightly in August, but analysts largely dismissed that as an expected seasonal uptick. Delinquencies are a warning of future credit losses and are seen as a more important indicator of the credit outlook than charge-offs of debts as uncollectable, analysts said. While lenders welcome the ongoing improvement in credit card delinquencies, they are struggling with weak consumer demand for new loans as unemployment remains high and the economic recovery is uncertain. "We are seeing ... a dramatic pullback by consumers," Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ) Chief Executive Richard Fairbank told investors at a conference on Monday. The rise in charge-offs was largely expected, analysts said. Credit quality usually worsens slightly once consumers stop getting tax refunds, because they have less extra money to pay off their debt. "As you get closer to June, your (charge-off) numbers get better and better. Then as you get closer to fall, the numbers weaken again," said analyst Henry Coffey of Sterne, Agee & Leach. But the August rise in charge-offs was not as high as expected, analyst Bill Carcache of Macquarie Research said. And since delinquencies have continued to fall, charge-offs should come back down in future months, he said. LOSSES UP, DELINQUENCIES DOWN Bank of America's delinquency rate fell to 5.68 percent from 5.92 percent, but in prior months, its delinquency rates fell by higher amounts. Its charge-offs rose to 11.73 percent in August from 11.39 percent in July. Capital One's delinquencies fell to 4.56 percent from 4.66 percent, but for most of the year, it has experienced much bigger declines in percentage terms. Capital One's annualized net charge-off rate for U.S. credit cards rose to 8.19 percent in August from 8.13 percent in July. American Express Co ( AXP.N ) continued to report the best results of the major credit card lenders. Its charge-offs remained flat at 5.5 percent in August, while its delinquencies fell to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent in July. The company lends directly to consumers but also competes with Visa Inc ( V.N ) and MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ) to process transactions for other banks. JPMorgan Chase's delinquency rate fell to 3.89 percent from 4.06 percent. Its charge-offs ticked up to 8.18 percent in August from 7.95 percent in July. Discover Financial Services ( DFS.N ), which like American Express both lends directly and processes transactions, said its loss rate rose to 7.98 percent in August from 7.28 pct in July. Its delinquency rate fell to 4.47 percent from 4.72 percent. (Reporting by Brenton Cordeiro in Bangalore and Maria Aspan in New York; Editing by Vinu Pilakkott, Aradhana Aravindan and  Tim Dobbyn )
