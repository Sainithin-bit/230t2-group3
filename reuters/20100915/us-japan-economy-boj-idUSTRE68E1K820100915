 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan has no plan to support government yen-selling intervention with an immediate easing of monetary policy, sources said, but it will be prepared to act in early October if the fragile economic recovery remains under threat. 

 The central bank called an emergency meeting late in August, so sees no need for another one so soon. However, it could change its mind if the currency intervention fails to check the rise in the yen and triggers strong political pressure for central bank action. The dollar jumped 2 yen on Wednesday from a 15-year low after Japan's authorities intervened in the currency market to sell the Japanese currency for the first time in six years. Markets have long speculated about potential currency intervention and how the Bank of Japan might then respond since policymakers have been concerned for months that the yen's rise was hampering Japan's recovery from the global financial crisis. "There is absolutely no plan for an emergency meeting, at least now," a source familiar with the central bank's thinking said. "But as the governor has said, we will act in a timely manner when necessary. If there is enough evidence of downside risks for the economy, there is no reason to wait," the source said. A further loosening of policy on October 4-5 cannot be ruled out, he said. Another source expressed a similar view. Both declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. BUYING GOVERNMENT BONDS FAVOURED The BOJ cut its policy rate to just 0.1 percent during the crisis and in three moves dating back to December 2009 has set up a loans scheme for banks, which many analysts have said was primarily aimed at keeping yen gains in check. In June, it set up a separate loan scheme for banks aimed at boosting lending to firms with growth potential. Now the BOJ is lining up its options for easing policy again. An increase in government bond buying is emerging as a more likely option than other steps, such as expanding the cheap fund-supply tool yet again, sources said. But there is no consensus yet within the BOJ on what action should be taken, if need be. Increasing the central bank's purchases of government bonds is a particularly sensitive issue now because Japan has a public debt twice the size of its $5 trillion economy, leaving the government with little room for fiscal expansion. Indeed, some senior central bank officials, including Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, have opposed buying more government bonds in case the move is interpreted by markets as a willingness by the central bank to print money to fund public debt. Other possibilities being prepared for discussion include the central bank buying private-sector assets from banks, or increasing the size of the BOJ's loan program for growth industries. The BOJ is due to hold two policy meetings in October. At the second meeting on October 28, the central bank will issue a twice-yearly report that is widely expected to revise down its long-term growth forecasts and project a delay in Japan's exit from deflation. The BOJ has kept interest rates near zero and currently buys 21.6 trillion yen ($260.2 billion) in long-term government bonds per year from the market. The BOJ can increase its government bond buying by around 200 billion yen per month. A bigger amount would mean the BOJ would have to review its self-imposed rule of capping government bond holdings to the amount of bank notes in circulation, something sources say it is not ready to do just yet.
