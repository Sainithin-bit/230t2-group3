 BANGALORE  (Reuters) - Regional bank Flagstar Bancorp Inc ( FBC.N ) is trying to raise $600 million via a share sale and has approached private equity firms that may be interested in buying an equity stake, Bloomberg said. 

 The Troy, Michigan-based lender, majority owned by private equity fund MatlinPatterson Global Advisers LLC, has been posting losses for the last few quarters, hit by the fall in U.S. home values and the recession. The bank may also sell shares to current investors, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. Flagstar, which has operations in Michigan, Indiana and Georgia and originates residential mortgage loans throughout the United States, is also seeking buyers for a $1 billion pool of loans, according to the report. Bloomberg said the lender, which intends to use the proceeds of the share sale to boost capital and pursue possible buys, is not close to a deal and may opt not to pursue either option. Flagstar could not be immediately reached for comments by Reuters. (Reporting by  Krishna N. Das  in Bangalore; Editing by  David Holmes )
