 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Japan intervened in the currency market on Wednesday for the first time in six years, selling yen to stem a rise in the currency that is threatening a fragile economic recovery. 

 The dollar spiked 2 yen higher, off a 15-year low of 82.87 yen it had reached earlier. Two traders said the Bank of Japan, acting on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, appeared to have bought dollars at around 83 yen. Following are recent key quotes by government and BOJ officials. FINANCE MINISTER YOSHIHIKO NODA, September 15, to reporters. "We will take decisive steps if necessary, including intervention, while continuing to closely watch currency market moves from now on," Noda said at a news conference where he confirmed that Japan had intervened. BANK OF JAPAN GOVERNOR MASAAKI SHIRAKAWA, September 15, in a statement "There has been growing uncertainty about the future, especially for the U.S. economy, and foreign exchange and stock markets have been unstable. In these circumstances, the downside risks to Japan's economy warrant attention." "The Bank of Japan strongly expects that the action taken by the Ministry of Finance in the foreign exchange market will contribute to a stable foreign exchange rate formation." "The Bank will, while pursuing strong monetary easing, continue to provide ample liquidity to the financial markets." CHIEF CABINET SECRETARY YOSHITO SENGOKU, September 15, to reporters "We are making efforts to persuade, to ask for understanding from the United States and Europe." "We cannot tell the BOJ what to do because of its independence, but I do hope that the BOJ will ease the heavy mood hanging over Japan due to the strong yen." PRIME MINISTER NAOTO KAN, August 14, quoted by Japanese media. The sudden strengthening of the yen "has become a bit of a concern. I want to continue watching it carefully ..." "I want to be sure to communicate as necessary (with the Bank of Japan)." NODA, August 12, to reporters. "The government's basic stance is that excessive and disorderly moves in foreign exchange rates would have a negative impact on the stability of the economy and financial markets. We must watch them with the utmost attention. In particular I'm watching currency moves very carefully and with great interest." "I'm closely in touch with the prime minister and the chief cabinet secretary with regard to market moves. We will respond appropriately while carefully examining economic trends." "Today the vice finance minister for international affairs exchanged views on market moves with a senior BOJ official, and we will keep in close contact with each other from now on." "I'll refrain from commenting on intervention." "Officials (in the finance ministry) are sharing information with officials not only in the United States but other countries at the working level ... I'm not thinking about (a teleconference with other G7 members) at the moment." SHIRAKAWA, August 12, in a statement. "Currency and stock markets are showing big fluctuations against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty about the U.S. economic outlook." "The BOJ will closely watch market fluctuations and their impact on the Japanese economy." BANK OF JAPAN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HIROSHI NAKASO, in charge of international affairs, August 12, to reporters. "Rate checks are part of our intention to closely watch currency market moves." SHIRAKAWA, August 10, news conference after board meeting. "I acknowledge that yen rises pose a downside risk to business sentiment. We need to examine the impact on the overall economy in a balanced way." "We spent much time debating how the recent yen rise could affect business sentiment and the Japanese economy. This is an important point for us to examine ..." "No central bank in developed nations targets forex levels in managing monetary policy." (Reporting by Stanley White; Editing by  Michael Watson )
