 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - The European Union's top business group, BusinessEurope, voiced its opposition on Wednesday to Japan's foreign exchange intervention to weaken the yen currency. 

 "We are not in favor of market manipulation. We can understand the situation of Japanese industry, they are under pressure, but the effectiveness of these interventions is very doubtful," BusinessEurope chief economist Mark Stocker told Reuters. "Market forces need to be defining the price of currency in all countries, in emerging markets and in China in particular," he added. BusinessEurope, Europe's biggest employers group, represents 20 million companies. It has long denounced moves that could harm their exports.
