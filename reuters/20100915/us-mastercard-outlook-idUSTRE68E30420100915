 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc ( MA.N ) gave a long-term earnings outlook that was higher than some on Wall Street had expected and said it would find ways to benefit from U.S. financial reforms, sending its shares up nearly 6 percent. 

 The company expects earnings per share to rise at a compound annual rate of more than 20 percent for 2011 through 2013, it said in a regulatory filing that kicked off an investor meeting on Wednesday. The meeting "got off to a strong start," analyst David Parker of Lazard Capital Markets wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. He praised the company for providing "long-term guidance that should sit well with investors" and addressing "head-on the challenges created by the recent legislation." MasterCard executives told investors that they were working "very aggressively" to prepare for upcoming restrictions on their debit processing transaction fees and that they even see opportunities to pick up more business as a result of the restrictions. A provision of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reform law will limit the fees that merchants pay banks and transaction processing networks every time a customer buys something with a debit card. Shares of MasterCard and rival Visa Inc ( V.N ) have fallen more than 20 percent since the provision was first introduced in May. MasterCard said it expected net income to rise at least 20 percent in 2010. It also said it expects its net revenue compound annual growth rate to be 12 percent to 14 percent for 2011 through 2013. It expects its annual operating margin to be "a minimum of 50 percent," MasterCard said in the filing. MasterCard's targets were revised slightly downward from its 2009 to 2011 guidance for earnings per share and revenue growth. But Parker wrote that the new targets were higher than what he had expected. Shares of MasterCard were up 5.7 percent at $211.20 after hitting a 52-week low of $191.00 on Monday. On Tuesday, MasterCard said its board had authorized a $1 billion share buyback program. (Reporting by Maria Aspan, editing by Dave Zimmerman and Lisa Von Ahn)
