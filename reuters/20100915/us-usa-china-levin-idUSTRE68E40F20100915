 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee Chairman Sander Levin said on Wednesday he favored a multilateral approach to pressure China to raise the value of the yuan, but also endorsed the United States using duties against Beijing's currency practices. 

 Levin, in opening remarks at a congressional hearing, said China's policy of keeping its currency at a low value against the dollar was one of several Chinese practices that has led to a "staggering" U.S. trade deficit with the Asian giant. Levin said he and many other lawmakers believe China's currency practices violates market-opening commitments Beijing made when it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. He also urged the Obama administration to take "expeditious action" on a complaint that the United Steelworkers union has filed against alleged Chinese subsidies to stimulate its clean energy sector. Levin said the panel was holding the hearing to examine options for dealing with the concern. (Reporting by  Doug Palmer )
