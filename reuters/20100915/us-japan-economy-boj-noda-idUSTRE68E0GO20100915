 SHIMONOSEKI, Japan  (Reuters) - Bank of Japan policy board member Tadao Noda indicated on Wednesday that the central bank may leave currency intervention unsterilized but added that it would not link its policy actions directly to currency intervention. 

 Japan stepped into the currency market on Wednesday for the first time in six years, selling yen to stem a rise that is threatening a fragile economic recovery. "We will pursue policy responses depending on moves in the economy and in prices but the BOJ will not consider policy in a manner that links directly to the latest (intervention) step," Noda told a news conference in Shimonoseki, in southern Japan. Noda, a banking industry veteran, was the sole dissenter when the BOJ cut interest rates to 0.1 percent in December 2008, arguing that pushing rates that low could distort market functions. Noda mostly supported the adoption of unconventional steps taken during the global financial crisis, but along with one other member he opposed the BOJ's additional easing steps on March 17.
