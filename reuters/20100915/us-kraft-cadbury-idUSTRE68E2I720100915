 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N said it will be able to squeeze an additional $1 billion in revenue from its global business by 2013, even as its North American unit continues to face economic challenges. 

 As unemployment is still high, North American consumers remain focused on value, said Tony Vernon, president of Kraft Foods North America. "We are still looking for those so-called green shoots," Vernon said at a meeting on Wednesday with analysts, at which North America's largest packaged food company laid out a 3-year growth plan in the wake of its $18.4 billion purchase of Britain's Cadbury. The acquisition, which followed a nearly five-month battle, added Cadbury chocolate, Trident gum and Halls lozenges to a portfolio that included dozens of brands such as Oreo cookies, Philadelphia cream cheese and Maxwell House coffee. Kraft said the integration of Cadbury was progressing well and that it was already taking advantage of technologies from each side of the business to improve its products. For example, the company is exploring the use of resealable plastic bags, like those used by Kraft, for Cadbury chocolates. The largest part of the $1 billion in incremental revenue opportunities Kraft sees from the deal will come from its chocolate business, where it can use complementary distribution networks and technologies from Cadbury and Kraft to sell more products in more markets and boost revenue beyond the sum of both parts. Overall, Kraft, which gets more than half of its revenue outside North America, expects to generate organic revenue growth of 5 percent or more, margins in the mid- to high-teens and earnings per share growth of 9 percent to 11 percent, it said. The revenue growth should be fueled by increases in both price and volume, as well as by selling a greater proportion of more expensive products, the company said. It also said it expects to raise prices on some products to offset rising commodity costs. The forecasts were no surprise, but Kraft laid out new details on how it plans to meet those targets, such as by focusing on its so-called power brands, said Consumer Edge Research analyst Robert Dickerson. "There wasn't anything today that would make me more negative on the stock," said Dickerson, who has an "outperform" rating on Kraft shares. Kraft shares closed up 54 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $31.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. They have already gained nearly 12 percent since early July. GROWING AROUND THE WORLD The acquisition of Cadbury broadened Kraft's exposure to fast-growing developing markets and higher-margin gums and candies. The acquisition improved Kraft's long-term earnings trajectory by 2 percentage points, said Chief Financial Officer Tim McLevish. He said Kraft's forecast reflects expectations for sales growth in the snack business at a mid- to high single-digit percentage rate, regional power brands at a mid-single-digit rate and local brands at a low single-digit rate. By region, sales are expected to grow at a double-digit rate in developing countries and 2 percent to 3 percent in Europe. In North America, sales are expected to grow 3 percent to 4 percent, which is slightly below Kraft's historic North American growth average of 3 percent to 5 percent. "This reflects a new normal of moderately lower growth than we had previously anticipated," said Chief Financial Officer Tim McLevish. Still, as the economy improves, Kraft expects to return to historic growth levels, said Chief Executive Officer Irene Rosenfeld. "Our turnaround phase is now over, and we've fully shifted our focus toward growth," Rosenfeld said. By 2013, Kraft said the proportion of business in developing markets will increase from a quarter of total revenue to about one third.
