 MILAN  (Reuters) - Europe's fourth-largest bank UniCredit ( CRDI.MI ) laid out bold plans for growth in central and eastern Europe (CEE) on Thursday, where it is already the biggest lender, while cutting back on jobs in western Europe. 

 In a two-tier strategy for 2008-2010, Italy's second-biggest bank in terms of retail branches said in a statement it would open 1,300 outlets in CEE with the addition of 11,500 jobs, but shed 9,000 posts out of 100,000 in Italy, Germany and Austria. UniCredit had a total workforce of about 180,000 at the end of June. It has already had to sell nearly 200 branches in Italy to meet antitrust requirements. The bank said "dynamic growth" in the CEE region and cost cuts would help it boost earnings per share by 10-12 percent annually through to 2010. Many international banks are suffering from credit crunch woes but those with interests outside struggling economies in western Europe and the United States are faring better. Earlier this month, Spain's Banco Santander bank said its profits would be buoyed by growth in Latin America. UniCredit said it expected central Europe's economies to grow an average 4.5 percent to 2010 compared with 1.7 percent in the euro zone. In its plans to "unleash the full value of Europe's leading franchise," UniCredit confirmed its earnings per share target of 0.52-0.56 euros for 2008 and said it aimed for compound annual EPS growth of 10-12 percent through to 2010. Analysts at JP Morgan said in a note the plan so far was "reassuring on capital but disappointing on earnings," as their target for 2010 earnings per share was 0.72 euros. Shares were down 3.89 percent at 3.96 euros by 3:24 a.m. EDT as the DJ Stoxx index of European banks .SX7P fell 2.59 percent. UniCredit, the most European of Italy's banks, has suffered more from current financial market storms than domestic rivals such as Intesa Sanpaolo ( ISP.MI ), which have conservative domestic lending policies. Its job cuts follow other banks trying to cope with financial turmoil caused by the U.S. subprime credit crisis. Switzerland's UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) said last month it was slashing 5,500 jobs or about 7 percent of its workforce. DIVERSITY DEFENCE UniCredit said its plan was "built on the fundamental belief that ... banks with a strong franchise and a well diversified revenue base are best protected from uncertainties." UniCredit reaps around 50 percent of its revenues from outside Italy and has a presence in 23 countries with over 40 million clients. In the CEE region, it says it has the largest international banking network with over 3,600 branches. UniCredit has already reported credit-related writedowns and losses of 1.726 billion euros ($2.69 billion). On Thursday, it said there had been no additional net writedowns in its ABS portfolio during the second quarter. It said implementing new guidelines on capital adequacy known as Basel 2 would give it a Core Tier 1 ratio of 5.74 percent and this should be over 6.2 percent in 2008. Analysts had worried its Core Tier 1 ratio -- which is based on capital available against the risk perceived in its assets -- would not be adequate for growth. The bank, which is worth about 54 billion euros, said it aimed for a Core Tier 1 ratio of 7.1 percent in 2010. It had previously reported a Core Tier 1 under Basel 1 of 5.5 percent at the end of the first quarter and aimed for 6.0 percent at the end of this year on the same basis.
