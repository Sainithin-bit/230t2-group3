 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - General Electric Co's ( GE.N ) auction of its $30 billion credit-card business is attracting only tepid interest, according to an article on the Wall Street Journal's website. 

 Prospective buyers are afraid that customers of stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ), J.C. Penney Co ( JCP.N ) and Lowe's ( LOW.N ) are having trouble paying their bills, said the report. JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), which was seen as a likely acquirer of the business, recently dropped out of the bidding, the article said, citing people familiar with the situation. Other companies with large credit-card portfolios, such as Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) and Capital One Financial Corp ( COF.N ), also aren't expected to submit bids, as a result of rising delinquencies and charge-offs in their own card portfolios, said the report. In addition to Wal-Mart, J.C. Penney and Lowe's, GE also issues cards for a other retailers, including Brooks Brothers, home-furnishing chain Ikea and the Dillard's department-store chain. GE is one of the largest issuers of so-called private-label credit cards, which can be used only in specific stores. Retailers may help to pitch these cards to customers, but GE -- or any other private-label issuer -- bears the financial responsibility of owning the loans, the article noted. Jeffrey Immelt, GE's chairman and chief executive, has personally reached out to prospective buyers, said the report, citing a person familiar with the situation.
