 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Bill Gross, manager of top bond fund Pimco, on Wednesday said he prefers owning two-year swaps over two-year Treasury notes, given his belief that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates unchanged for the rest of the year. 

 The Fed held its key interest rate steady at 2 percent on Wednesday but voiced greater concern about inflation, taking a step down a road that could lead to higher borrowing costs. "Two-year swaps yield 3.73 percent versus 2.83 percent for Treasuries," Gross told Reuters via e-mail. "With 'rolldown,' two-year swaps should return 4-percent-plus under a 'do-nothing Fed," he added. Gross, who manages the $130 billion Pimco Total Return fund, said he prefers owning securities at the short end of the curve because they are "controlled by the Fed." "The back-end (of the yield curve) is susceptible to deleveraging as levered holders of duration are forced to reduce their value at risk." (Editing by Dan Grebler)
