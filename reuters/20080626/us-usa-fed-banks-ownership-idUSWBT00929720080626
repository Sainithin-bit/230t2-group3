 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering changes to make more clear and transparent what constitutes a controlling interest in banks, a Fed official said on Thursday. 

 "We are looking at ways we can make those things more workable and gain from the experience we've had over the past few years," Federal Reserve general counsel Scott Alvarez said. The review comes as private equity firms have been seeking ways to invest in U.S. banks and thrifts while avoiding restrictions that bar owners of these institutions from other businesses.
