 (Reuters) - Belgian-Dutch financial services group Fortis FOR.AS FOR.BR said on Thursday it planned to boost its solvency by more than 8 billion euros ($12.5 billion), including issuing new shares and selling assets. 

 Following are the measures Fortis intends to take. NEW EQUITY The bank plans to raise about 1.5 billion euros of equity starting on Thursday. The increase is within the mandate given by shareholders to Fortis to issue new shares. NO INTERIM DIVIDEND The decision not to pay an interim 2008 dividend will preserve solvency as the interim dividend was expected to impact second quarter solvency by 1.3 billion euros. A proposal to pay the full-year 2008 dividend in shares will be made to the annual shareholders meeting in March 2009. SALE AND LEASE BACK Fortis will sell and lease back part of its real estate portfolio in the second half of 2008 and in 2009, which is expected to result in a capital relief of about 1.5 billion euros. NON-DILUTIVE TIER 1 INSTRUMENTS The bank is considering issuing preference shares at group level, which would need to be approved by an extraordinary shareholders meeting and is expected to raise up to 2 billion euros of core capital. DISPOSALS Fortis said it had reviewed its portfolio of activities and identified a number of additional non-core assets which could be divested. The disposals, which Fortis said relate to businesses that are mature and not crucial to its growth strategy, are expected to result in a total solvency uplift of around 2 billion euros. ** For the latest story on Fortis please double click on <ID:nL2668178> (Reporting by Harro ten Wolde; Editing by  Louise Ireland )
