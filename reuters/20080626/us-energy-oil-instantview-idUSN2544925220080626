 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil supplies rose last week for the first time in six weeks, defying analyst expectations for a draw, the government said in a weekly report on Wednesday. 

 ANALYST COMMENTS:  TIM EVANS, ENERGY ANALYST, CITI FUTURES PERSPECTIVE, NEW YORK: "The build in crude stocks and the larger-than-expected build in distillates are the main surprises here; the slight draw in gasoline was not far off from the consensus expectation. Four-week average gasoline demand is down 2.7 percent from a year ago. Four-week average distillates demand is down 2.3 percent. Jet fuel demand is off 5.8 percent. The combination of week product demand and the build in crude should be bearish overall."  PHIL FLYNN, ANALYST, ALARON TRADING, CHICAGO: "The big build in distillates is leading us lower. We had been focused on sending distillates to China, refiners were maxing out production to meet worldwide demand. We are now building supplies at a pretty good rate. This is good news if you are a trucker. "On gasoline, we are starting to catch up with demand destruction in the MasterCard survey. People are revolting against high prices, taking bicycles and public transportation. "It's a bearish start to the day. "The key to staying lower is the Fed meeting. So it's up to Mr. Bernanke and the Fed to see how they word that statement. "The news out of Saudi about the aborted attack appears that they are one step ahead of Al Qaeda for a second time. It seems that their intelligence is very good. It kind of lowers the terror premium. Before, this would have run it up."  CHRIS JARVIS, SENIOR ANALYST, CAPROCK RISK MANAGEMENT, NEW  HAMPSHIRE: "Higher refinery runs with capacity coming back on line should continue to boost distillate numbers and bring the crack spreads lower, putting downward pressure on the market." "Even though the inventory numbers were moderately bearish, the demand numbers are still relatively strong given how high prices are. We're not really seeing the demand destruction you'd think we'd see given the price levels."  JIM RITTERBUSCH, PRESIDENT, RITTERBUSCH & ASSOCIATES, GALENA,  ILLINOIS: "The report is receiving a bearish reception so far. However, the only bearish surprise that we see in the data is the larger than expected increase in distillate stocks, a development that could provide a drag on the rest of the complex. "Although the crude stock build contrasted with most expectations for about a 1 million barrel draw, we are not viewing this increase as a surprise. "Furthermore, the increase in Cushing stocks, albeit slight, could help to maintain pressures on the curve. Although the virtually unchanged level of gasoline supply was proximate to most ideas, the upswing in demand last week combined with the unexpected drop in refinery activity could prove worthy of some support by day's end."  JAMES CRANDELL, ANALYST, LEHMAN BROTHERS, NEW YORK: "Overall, I would say there's bearish bias to these stats. Crude imports stayed stable, well above year-to-date averages; demand for refined products was weak, down 400,000 barrels per day versus last week. But yields improved for both gasoline and distillates meaning production was up even with a decrease in refinery activity. "For crude, the stock build marks a change in path for inventories. It was the first build in a few weeks and for distillates the build was larger than consensus which continues the path upward for distillates stocks in the United States."  MARK WAGGONER, PRESIDENT, EXCEL FUTURES, HUNTINGTON BEACH,  CALIFORNIA: "The market will take these EIA numbers as bearish because we don't have a big draw on gasoline, despite the driving season, and the crude build is small."  ROB KURZATKOWSKI, FUTURES ANALYST, OPTIONSXPRESS, CHICAGO: "Its actually a bearish report all around. We've cut imports by 500,000 bpd. We were expecting a drawdown and we've got a build. We got a build at the Cushing delivery point (for NYMEX futures)." "This with the Mastercard report from yesterday shows that consumers are getting hit really hard by prices... The market will be on a bearish bias for a while with the Fed statement coming up."
