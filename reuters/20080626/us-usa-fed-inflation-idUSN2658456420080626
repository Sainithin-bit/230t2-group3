 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has signaled inflation expectations will play a key role in future decisions about interest rates, placing ever greater emphasis on an elusive concept that has proven difficult to measure. 

 Like many policy-makers around the world, Fed officials have been taken aback by the relentless surge in oil prices. They are hoping such spikes will not make Americans too accustomed to faster price increases. If consumers and businesses begin to take such inflation for granted, the Fed fears, they might set off a self-reinforcing cycle of demands for better wages and costlier products. "The upside risks to inflation and inflation expectations have increased," the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said as it wrapped up a two-day meeting on Wednesday, at which it decided to keep its benchmark interest rate steady. For now, the U.S. central bank appears to hope tough talk can help tamp down these tendencies, avoiding the need for a near-term increase in borrowing costs. While expectations are seen as a key ingredient in the future rate of inflation, economists caution a policy that relies heavily on measuring them has its perils. "Conceptually it's very powerful, everybody can agree this is a big deal. But there's a lot of wiggle room for how that gets executed," said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at the Economic Cycle Research Institute. Because gauging consumer and business psychology is difficult, the Fed risks either underplaying or overstating the case for higher rates. In either instance, the repercussions could be costly. "Even though it is critically important to monetary policy, expected inflation is poorly measured," says Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan. MOVIN' ON UP Investors need not look too far to see why the Fed is worried. No matter how you measure them, inflation expectations are moving higher, although some barometers are flashing more urgently than others. Spreads between regular U.S. government bonds and their inflation-protected cousins are at their highest levels since early May, even if they have receded considerably from highs seen during the turbulent markets of last summer. Household surveys, too, have captured a much less sanguine consumer. The Conference Board's index of one-year inflation expectations is stuck at an all-time high of 7.7 percent, while its Reuters/University of Michigan counterpart remains near its highest since the early 1980s. Yet so far, both the economy and credit markets have remained weak enough to support the central bank's prediction that inflation will eventually come down, despite skyrocketing prices for oil and other commodities. "They're hoping that their verbal commitment and increasingly tough anti-inflation rhetoric will be enough," says Richard Iley, economist at BNP Paribas. "In effect, we have a central bank that is targeting inflation expectations." Iley said the Fed would be more alarmed if the Reuters/Umich measure of inflation expectations five years out, currently at 3.4 percent, rose too far above its historical average. "It has not significantly broken out of that yet," Iley said. SO MUCH FOR TARGETS Analysts long presumed the Fed's implicit aim was to keep core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, between 1.0 percent and 2.0 percent. It has recently climbed above that range, with no corresponding action from the Fed, which was too busy dousing fires in the housing and banking sectors to deal with the prospect of an eventual inflation scare. However, the sheer persistence of the rise in crude oil prices, which hit a record above $140 a barrel on Thursday, has prompted a pause among policy-makers. Indeed, Richard Fisher, one of the Fed's more hawkish members, voted for an interest rate increase this week. Using inflation expectations as a primary benchmark for monetary policy could lead to trouble if what eventually turns out to be a serious inflation threat is dismissed because it has not permeated all indicators of expectations. "Given how miserable we (economists) are at forecasting inflation, how can we expect the people you're interviewing out there to be any better?" quipped former Treasury official John Taylor at a recent Fed conference on inflation.
