 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama is engaged in a week of diplomatic activities with other leaders in New York and Pittsburgh to tackle many of the world's major challenges. How is he doing? 

 U.S. IMAGE Obama addressed the U.N. General Assembly and sounded a theme likely to be popular among Americans: That the United States is willing to do its part but cannot do it all alone and need help shouldering the load. He called for joint action in confronting the nuclear programs of Iran and North Korea, the war in Afghanistan and achieving a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. It was Obama's attempt to launch a new era of engagement with the world after his predecessor, George W. Bush, tended toward a more unilateral foreign policy. "Those who used to chastise America for acting alone in the world cannot now stand by and wait for America to solve the world's problems alone," Obama said. On the major foreign policy challenges, Obama has made little progress. He has concentrated much of his energies on trying to coax the U.S. economy back to life and persuading the U.S. Congress to approve a healthcare overhaul. THE MIDDLE EAST Obama used the U.N. speech to tell Israelis and Palestinians bluntly they should relaunch negotiations on the most intractable issues -- the "final status" issues that include the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian prisoners and the borders of a Palestinian state. Until now, Obama has pressured Israel for a full freeze in the construction of Jewish settlements on the occupied West Bank, leading some of Israel's supporters in the United States to charge he was being tough on Israel but not tough enough on the Palestinians. The "final status" issues are viewed as the most difficult and so should be left to the end. U.S. diplomacy until now has focused on the parties agreeing on some confidence-building steps to create a positive atmosphere. "Now, I am not naive," Obama said. "I know this will be difficult. But all of us -- not just the Israelis and the Palestinians, but all of us -- must decide whether we are serious about peace or whether we will only lend it lip service." REBALANCING THE GLOBAL ECONOMY The U.S. drive to build a more balanced global economy picked up the qualified support of China. It is a sign that Group of 20 leaders may be ready to take joint action to prevent future economic crises. The idea is to correct the world's economic imbalances by shrinking surpluses in big exporting countries like China and boosting savings in debt-laden nations that include the United States. China's support would be key because it has an export-driven economy and would be loathe to slow it down in ways that could harm the Chinese economy.
