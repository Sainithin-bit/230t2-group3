 OSLO  (Reuters) - Oslo-listed Seadrill ( SDRL.OL ), a leading offshore oil and gas contractor, expects demand for its services to grow as oil companies became "more comfortable" with oil prices around $70 per barrel, its chief executive said. 

 Chief Executive Alf Thorkildsen told Reuters in an interview that after a sharp contraction in spending by oil producers when oil tumbled to $40 per barrel, activity has been picking up. "What we have seen after the summer, which is linked to the oil price, is a significant increase in activity levels but far from sufficient to keep all rigs at work," Thorkildsen said, adding that demand for jack-up rigs was hit hardest. He said Bermuda-registered Seadrill's core deep-water rig segment was more resilient and he now saw "increasing activity for (contracts in) 2011 and 2012, where there is demand for rigs in a long-term perspective." Thorkildsen said he expected to gain a contract for Seadrill's nearly completed West Gemini rig by the first quarter of 2010. "Depending on where in the world that contract is based, it will be (worth) plus/minus $500,000 per day," he said. Thorkildsen said a "dramatic" $100 per barrel drop in the oil price from mid-2008 highs stunned oil producers, who remain cautious even with oil stabilizing around $70 over past months. "When oil companies start believing that $70 or more is the future, you will see an increase in activity. There are still uncertainties toward that price," he said in an interview.
