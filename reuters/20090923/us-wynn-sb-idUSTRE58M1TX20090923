 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Wynn Resorts ( WYNN.O ), the world's third-largest casino operator by market value, said on Wednesday that Singapore's two upcoming casinos will not pose a threat to its Macau business, even as the city-state aims to draw high-rollers in with lower taxes. 

 Las Vegas Sands' ( LVS.N ) Marina Bay Sands and Genting Singapore's ( GENS.SI ) Resorts World at Sentosa will pay taxes of about 10 percent on net revenue from high-rollers, much lower than Macau's tax of about 39 percent, giving operators more incentive to draw gamblers to the city-state when the casinos are up and running by the end of this year or early next year. "People from all over will go to Singapore to check it out, some more than once," said chief executive Steve Wynn at a media briefing. "But as far as in the day in, day out, month in, month out of our business, proximity is the most important factor." "Singapore will not be a major threat to our market," Wynn said, adding that the Chinese and Macau governments would protect the gambling market. "We're at the hands of a government that is very much aware ... of what they want Macau to be." Half of Macau's visitors are day-trippers from mainland China, most of them from neighboring Guangdong province, according to Credit Suisse analyst Gabriel Chan. Wynn is seeking to raise $1.6 billion from a spin-off of its Macau unit, in what would be Hong Kong's second-largest IPO so far this year, behind Metallurgical Corp of China's (MCC) $2.34 billion Hong Kong offering. The IPO -- which may be the fourth-largest in the world this year -- comes on the back of record monthly gaming revenues in Macau in August, and news that China has quietly eased restrictions on its citizens traveling from Guangdong province to Macau, signaling a faster-than-expected recovery in the world's largest gambling market. "A careful analysis of our numbers will show we don't need the money, but it certainly is not a reason for us not to take it," Wynn said. Wynn is pricing its 1.25 billion shares in the HK$8.52-HK$10.08 range, according to its prospectus. Demand has been heavy with interest in the international tranche of the share offering about five times subscribed, according to a source at one of the banks underwriting the deal. Wynn's archrival Sands is aiming to raise $1 billion to $2 billion through the sale of a minority stake in its Macau operations at the end of November or early December. "This IPO has given us a chance to do something that's very important to us and that is to share the ownership of this concession with the Chinese public, participants and financial institutions and basically become more of a Chinese company," Wynn said. "I feel safe in China, I think it's going to be a great place for our company," he said. (Editing by Chris Lewis)
