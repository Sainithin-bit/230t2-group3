 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ) and Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) said on Wednesday they are eliminating some overdraft fees altogether and trimming others, after Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ) announced a similar move on Tuesday. 

 The changes follow U.S. congressional leaders' criticism of bank account fees and come as the banks digest rule changes for credit card fees. New York-based JPMorgan said it made the changes, which include removing overdraft fees if a customer's account is $5 or less overdrawn, in a bid to help its 25 million debit card customers amid the recession and rising U.S. unemployment. The second-largest U.S. bank is also ending overdrafts for debit cards unless the account holder opts into an overdraft service and it will start recognizing debit-card transactions and cash withdrawals as they occur, according to the statement. San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said it will charge no more than four overdraft fees in a day and it will allow customers to opt out of having an overdraft facility. Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, said it was reducing overdraft and other account fees over the next year. (Reporting by  Elinor Comlay ; editing by Lisa Von Ahn and  Andre Grenon )
