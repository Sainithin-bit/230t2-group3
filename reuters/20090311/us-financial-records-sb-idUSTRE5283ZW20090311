 (Reuters) - Japan's current account balance swung to its largest deficit on record in January, with the income surplus tumbling about a third from a year earlier, adding to pressure on an already falling yen. 

 Here are some details of the new records being set: * BUDGETS: -- Japan had a current account deficit of 172.8 billion yen ($1.8 billion) in January, its first time in the red since January 1996 and much bigger than a forecast of 15.3 billion yen. The deficit came as the global financial crisis dried up demand for Japanese exports. -- U.S. President Barack Obama on February 26 forecast a deficit of $1.75 trillion for 2009, which at 12.3 percent of GDP would be the biggest since World War Two. A $569 billion U.S. budget deficit for the first four months of fiscal 2009 was a record for the period. -- China's 2009 budget deficit is expected to leap eight-fold to 950 billion yuan ($139 billion), its biggest on record. -- Britain's budget deficit for the fiscal year so far hit a record high and statisticians warned bank bailouts could raise total debt by up to 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.15 trillion), or 100 percent of GDP. Public sector net borrowing stood at 67.201 billion pounds between April 2008 and January, the highest since records began in 1993. * CORPORATE LOSSES: -- American International Group Inc reported a $61.7 billion fourth-quarter loss on March 2, the largest quarterly loss in U.S. corporate history. -- Royal Bank of Scotland posted the biggest loss in UK corporate history on Feb 26 with a 24.1 billion pound ($34.3 billion) loss for 2008. * FUNDS: -- Investors pulled a record $155 billion out of hedge funds in 2008 marking just the second time since 1990 that the industry suffered net annual outflows. * INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT: -- Japanese industrial production fell 10.0 percent in January the largest monthly drop ever. -- Euro zone industrial production in November fell by a record 7.7 percent year on year, the steepest drop since records started in 1990. -- German industrial output in December fell by a record 4.6 percent month on month and by 12.0 percent from a year earlier. * INFLATION: -- Sweden's yearly inflation rate posted its biggest monthly decline since records began in the 1950s, eclipsing a 1.0 percent decline in January 1998. -- Prices fell a monthly 1.3 percent in December 2008 versus a forecast 0.5 percent decline and a 0.8 percent drop a month earlier. The official consumer price data series began in 1980 but before that there was another monthly cost-of-living indicator that started in 1954. * INTEREST RATES: -- The European Central Bank cut interest rates to an all-time low of 1.5 percent on March 5, the lowest level in the ECB's 10-year history. -- The Bank of England cut interest rates by 50 basis points to a record low of 0.5 percent on March 5, their lowest level since the bank was created in 1694. -- Sweden's central bank cut its key interest rate a record low of 1.0 percent on February 11, lowering the repo rate, now at its lowest level since its introduction in 1994 and marking the lowest official Swedish interest rate since records began in 1907. * JOBS: -- The U.S. unemployment rate rose to a 25-year high of 8.1 percent in February as employers, axed 651,000 jobs. February's jobless rate was the highest since December 1983. The increase was the biggest for any month since April 1980. -- Canada cut a record 129,000 workers in January in its worst job losses since data began in 1976 -- Ireland's unemployment benefit claims in January hit the highest monthly level since records began in 1967. Its seasonally adjusted Live Register tally hit 326,100 in January up from 293,100 in December, the highest ever monthly rise. * MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS: -- More mergers and acquisition deals were withdrawn in 2008 than ever before, with overall activity down 35 percent as more than 1,100 deals were canceled. * STOCKS: -- Gloom over the global economy hurt the Tokyo stock market, with the Nikkei average hitting a 26-year closing low on March 9, of 7,086.03. -- Tokyo's Nikkei stock average fell around 42 percent in 2008, the biggest loss in its 58-year history. -- World stocks, measured by the MSCI index, on February 24 hit their lowest level since April 2003 -- Japan's broad TOPIX index touched a 25-year intraday low on March 9. -- China's stock market fell 65 percent in 2008 in the worst fall in its 18-year history and the worst performance by major stock market for the year. * TRADE: -- Britain's goods trade gap with the rest of the world widened to 8.330 billion pounds ($12.46 billion) in November from 7.631 billion in October, the biggest since records began in 1697.
