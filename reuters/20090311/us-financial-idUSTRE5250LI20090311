 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Tumbling Chinese exports, sliding German factory orders and falling prices in Japan underscored the weakness of the world economy, while U.S. and British leaders staked out positions ahead of a global finance meeting. 

 Switzerland's UBS AG ( UBSN.VX ) ( UBS.N ) highlighted the depth of distress in the banking industry. The world's biggest wealth manager said earnings would remain at risk for some time as it revised up its full-year net loss to 20.9 billion Swiss francs ($18.1 billion). Finance ministers from the G20 group of rich nations and emerging powers will meet this weekend in Britain to prepare for a summit in London on April 2. Ahead of the meeting, Britain and the United States said that leading economies should unite to spur global economic growth and strengthen regulation in response to the financial crisis. "We believe it is important for G20 nations to commit to substantial and sustained actions for a period that matches the likely duration of the crisis," U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told reporters. Another senior U.S. Treasury official testified on Capitol Hill that a Treasury-led effort to soak up toxic assets from bank balance sheets could draw private investors with the right government financing. Earlier, International Monetary Fund Managing Director Dominique Strauss-Kahn warned that governments were moving too slowly to clear banks' balance sheets of such problem assets. "On the (bank) restructuring side things are really lagging ... I'm afraid that if it goes that way for two or three more months then recovery in 2010 will be difficult," he told Reuters in an interview. In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, former U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan denied Fed policy was to blame for the U.S. housing bubble, the fallout from which has plagued the global financial system. U.S. stocks were flat in choppy afternoon trading. .N Earlier, the pan-European FTSEurofirst 300  .FTEU3  closed up .25 percent. BEST EFFORTS, WEAK DATA Economists offered a dour outlook on a global recovery. World economies are expected to remain in a vicious grip well into 2010 while unemployment hits multiyear records, Reuters polls found. Indeed, National Semiconductor Corp ( NSM.N ) said it would cut 26 percent of its global workforce, or 1,725 jobs, in the latest sign of distress for the global chip industry. The effects of the economic downturn are being felt on global trade flows, with China reporting its trade surplus shriveled to $4.84 billion in February, much lower than analysts had expected. Exports fell by a quarter from year-ago levels, the biggest drop since bankers started keeping records in 1993. "China has finally and spectacularly succumbed to the world financial crisis on the export side, and it's difficult to see why that would improve in the short term," said Paul Cavey, an economist with Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong. Governments are pumping money into their economies and central banks are slashing interest rates in a bid to prevent recession turning to slump. South Korea plans to introduce a supplementary budget worth $20 billion this month to boost domestic demand, the ruling party was quoted as saying. In Britain, the Bank of England will officially start quantitative easing -- effectively printing money to help pull the economy out of recession. Despite governments' best efforts, however, economic data show scant signs of improvement. Nearly a third of U.S. consumers feel it will be a year before their families are better off than they are today, and more than a quarter think it will take longer, according to a survey on behalf of Reuters. Japan said wholesale prices fell 1.1 percent in February from a year earlier, the biggest annual fall in nearly six years and prompting fears of deflation. In Germany, producer prices fell 1.2 percent month-on-month in January, while manufacturing orders for the same month plunged 8 percent from December, the second-biggest drop since reunification in 1990. Britain joined in the gloom. Its goods trade gap widened more than expected in January as the balance with non-EU states hit a record deficit. Providing a glimmer of hope, U.S. mortgage applications rose for the first time in three weeks as near-record low interest rates spurred demand for home refinancing and purchase loans, data from an industry group showed.
