 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday that pay in the financial industry got "way divorced" from reality and Group of 20 nations supported finding a way to impose standard controls. 

 "I do believe that compensation just got way divorced from any meaningful appreciation of risk and that helped contribute to this huge build up in leverage and risk," Geithner told reporters ahead of a meeting of G20 nations near London. There is a "shared sense across the major economies" that compensation practices must be reformed throughout the financial system and in all the major markets, he said. The G20 will be held on Friday and Saturday. (Reporting by  Alister Bull ; Editing by  Chizu Nomiyama )
