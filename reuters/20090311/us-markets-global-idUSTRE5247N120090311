 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. stocks eked out a second day of gains on Wednesday after JPMorgan became the second big bank to cite profitability, but oil slid 7 percent on further signs of weak global demand and rising inventories. 

 U.S. government debt prices rallied on a revived safety bid for lower-risk investments and as a sale of 10-year notes eased supply worries, while the dollar fell on the lack of any new fundamental economic news to prompt demand for the greenback The dollar was also hurt by a Chinese trade report that cast doubts on China's ability to finance the U.S. current account deficit, which in the long run could weigh on the dollar. Economic news again highlighted weakness in the world economy, as Chinese exports tumbled, German factory orders fell and prices slid in Japan. "Unless we see some improvement in economic indicators we are just going to bounce around in a wait-and-see mode," said John McCarthy, director of foreign exchange trading at ING Capital Markets in New York. "With equity markets bouncing we could easily trend for a while." But comments by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM.N ) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon to CNBC television reversed a broad decline in stocks and came after a speech in which he said the bank's bond department had just had its two busiest months ever. Dimon's comments that JPMorgan was profitable in January and February echoed comments by Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram Pandit, that had fired Tuesday's rally. Dimon also said he sees "modest signs" of an economic recovery, helping JPMorgan shares to rise 4.6 percent and spurring a 3.1 percent advance in the KBW banking index .BKX. Dimon "calmed the markets down, he was the voice of reason," said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore. A broker recommendation that investors buy shares of Hewlett-Packard ( HPQ.N ) pushed technology stocks higher and the Nasdaq ended up more than 1 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI  closed up 3.91 points, or 0.06 percent, at 6,930.40. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index  .SPX  added 1.76 points, or 0.24 percent, at 721.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  gained 13.36 points, or 0.98 percent, at 1,371.64. European stocks also rose for the second day but sentiment remained fragile and trading was volatile as poor economic news continued to make the headlines. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 index  .FTEU3  rose 0.25 percent to close at 692.65, supported by the financial sector. The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 1.00 percent at 87.63. Against the yen, the dollar fell 1.46 percent at 97.25. The euro rose 1.39 percent at $1.2846. The greenback was also pressured by news that China's exports slid 25.7 percent in February from a year earlier, sharply exceeding the forecast for a 5.0 percent drop. U.S. Treasury debt prices jumped after demand at a record reopening of 10-year notes was not as weak as feared, supporting the view of solid appetite for the government's massive supply plan. Doubts about the rebound on Wall Street spurred investors to increase their safe-haven holdings in lower risk government debt, traders and investors said.. "There was a sigh of relief that this auction went okay," said Tom Girard, who manages the $805 million MainStay Balanced Fund in New York. "There's also concern that equities could slide again." The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose 24/32 to yield 2.92 percent. The 2-year U.S. Treasury note closed at break-even, to yield 1.02 percent. Oil fell more than 7 percent to $42.33 per barrel on further signs of weak global demand and rising inventories in top consumer the United States. U.S. government data showed crude stocks in the world's largest energy consumer rose 700,000 barrels last week, while overall products demand over the past four weeks dropped 2.1 percent against last year's levels. U.S. crude settled down $3.38 to $42.33 a barrel, while London Brent crude fell $2.56 to $41.40 a barrel. Spot gold prices rose $10.45, or 1.17 percent, to $906.25.
