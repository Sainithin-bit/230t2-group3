 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Boosting economic stimulus and launching regulatory reforms are complementary objectives and the United States will be pressing for both at this weekend's Group of 20 finance ministers meeting, U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said on Wednesday. 

 "We've got these two critical objectives and they're each important. We need to move together on them," Geithner told a news briefing. "You're going to see from the United States very strong support for an ambitious set of (financial) reforms globally." Geithner earlier said it was important for the world's wealthiest countries, largest developing economies and international financial institutions to work together to increase and sustain stimulus actions into 2010.
