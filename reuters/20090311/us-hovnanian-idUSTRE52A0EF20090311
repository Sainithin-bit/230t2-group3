 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises ( HOV.N ) on Tuesday reported a bigger quarterly loss that missed analyst estimates, but a federal tax refund increased its cash cushion slightly, 

 The Red Bank, New Jersey-based builder posted a first-quarter net loss of $178.4 million, or $2.29 per share, compared with a loss of $130.9 million, or $2.07 per share, last year. Analysts had forecast a loss of $1.58 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Homebuilders are mired in a prolonged downturn. The market peaked in 2006, fueled by the rampant risky lending of the boom years, but faltered as a glut of foreclosures flooded the market and weakened further in the recession. In this climate, cash is the key metric. Builders have focused on generating it, even at the expense of profitability, in order to pay their bills and maintain their debt obligations while waiting out the downturn. Last Friday, Moody's cut Hovnanian's corporate family ratings deeper into junk on an expectation that cash flow will weaken in 2009 and droop further in 2010. Hovnanian did increase its cash balance during the quarter to $842.6 million at January 31, from $838 million at October 31, but cash would have declined were it not for a federal tax refund of $145.2 million. That means Hovnanian's operations actually consumed about $140 million in cash, almost twice as much as Morningstar analyst Parrish Glover had expected, he said. By his calculations, that rate of cash consumption combined with the company's cash needs is enough to keep it running through the summer of 2010. But Chief Financial Officer Larry Sorsby said Glover's model is flawed because the first quarter's cash flow is not representative; rather, it is the company's worst quarter for cash flow. "If we believed that we would run out of cash by 2010, then we would not have recently spent our cash to buy back over $350 million of our debt," Sorsby said. Hovnanian's revenue declined to $373.8 million from $1.1 billion while charges to write down the value of land increased year-over-year to $132 million from $94 million. Homebuilding margin before interest expense was 5.7 percent for the first quarter, down from 6.7 percent last year. "Prospective homebuyers are still faced with making the decision to buy a home against an exceedingly difficult economic backdrop and we expect demand for all homes to remain far below normalized levels," said Chief Executive Ara Hovnanian in a statement.
