 LANCASTER, Pennsylvania  (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve needs to stop continually easing policy and have some patience because there are risks associated with its massive bond-buying program, Philadelphia Fed President Charles Plosser said on Wednesday. 
 "We are not even standing pat. We are trying to be easier and easier and easier," he told reporters. "That's why I believe it's time ... to quit trying to ease." (Reporting by  Jonathan Spicer ; Editing by  James Dalgleish )
