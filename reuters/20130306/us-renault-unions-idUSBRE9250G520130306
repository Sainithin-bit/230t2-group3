 PARIS  (Reuters) - French carmaker Renault ( RENA.PA ) has won support from workers for a nationwide deal on pay and conditions to boost its competitiveness as a second union gave its backing to the move on Wednesday. 
 Force Ouvriere said in a statement that it had decided by a large majority to sign the new agreement "for a new growth dynamic and social development at Renault in France". Renault has been pushing workers to accept a deal on French pay and conditions to cut costs and align productivity with cheaper European sites such as its Palencia plant in Spain and alliance partner Nissan's ( 7201.T ) Sunderland factory in England.
