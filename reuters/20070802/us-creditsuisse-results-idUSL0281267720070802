 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Credit Suisse ( CSGN.VX ) said second-quarter net group profit was up 17 percent on the previous quarter to 3.189 billion Swiss francs ($2.66 billion), well ahead of expectations, fuelled by record earnings from investment banking. 

 The result was far ahead of most analysts' forecasts. The average forecast in a Reuters poll of 16 analysts was for net profit of 2.3 billion francs. Chief Executive Brady Dougan, who took the helm at Credit Suisse in May, said he expected more challenging conditions in some markets to continue. "I am particularly pleased with our performance given the fact that we had more challenging conditions in some markets, which we expect to continue," Dougan said in a statement. Apart from Dougan's remarks on conditions in some markets, Credit Suisse made no immediate mention of the crisis in the subprime mortgage market in the United States and consequent turmoil in credit markets. The results are a first indicator of how Dougan, who has barely made any public pronouncements since taking over Credit Suisse's helm in May, might run the bank in the future. Net revenue in investment banking was up 70 percent from a year earlier at 7.538 billion francs while total operating expenses were up 39 percent. The investment bank division also cut non-compensation costs and the compensation/revenue ratio in the division fell to 51.5 percent from 53.5 percent a year earlier. The bank reported net inflows into wealth management of 13.3 billion francs, below an average analysts' forecast of 14.4 billion francs and also said inflows into asset management were 20.4 billion francs in the second quarter. Credit Suisse is seen as particularly vulnerable to a downturn in leveraged financing through its investment bank and investors have said they would pay more attention the impact of the credit upheaval than to the details of the results.
