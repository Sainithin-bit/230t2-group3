 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Boeing Co. ( BA.N ) booked 149 plane orders in July, marking its busiest month since December, as new buyers lined up for its lightweight 787 Dreamliner that made its public debut last month. 

 The plane maker now has 688 net firm orders for the year, putting it about level with European rival Airbus, which had 680 orders through the end of June, but is likely to add more when it reports its July figures next week. Boeing's year-to-date tally is 30 percent higher than the 531 firm orders it had at the same stage a year ago. Last year turned out to be Boeing's best ever, booking a record 1,044 net orders. That won Boeing the title of biggest-selling plane maker back from Airbus, a unit of aerospace group EADS ( EAD.PA ), which had held the lead in annual orders for the previous five years. Boeing's big wins in July included an order for 25 787s from German low-cost airline Air Berlin ( AB1.DE ), worth about $4 billion, which was announced in Seattle just before Boeing rolled its newest plane into public view. The carbon-composite, fuel efficient 787 -- which has attracted more than $100 billion worth of orders -- is set for its first test flight in September and first delivery next May. The tally of 149 orders for July is Boeing's biggest monthly total since it booked 212 orders last December. (Reporting by  Bill Rigby )
