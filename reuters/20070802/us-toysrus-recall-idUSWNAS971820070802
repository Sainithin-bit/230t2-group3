 (Reuters) - Toys "R" Us Inc. on Thursday said it removed all toys recalled by Mattel Inc. MAT.N. from its stores in the United States. 

 On Wednesday, Mattel announced a worldwide recall of toys made by its Fisher-Price unit -- including popular Sesame Street characters Elmo and Big Bird -- over concerns their paint may contain too much lead. (Reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore)
