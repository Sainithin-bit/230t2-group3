 LONDON  (Reuters) - British bank Barclays Plc ( BARC.L ) said it was still confident of succeeding with its takeover bid for Dutch rival ABN AMRO AAH.AS, but acknowledged that much will depend on its share price in the next two months. 

 "Am I confident about our ability to win the ABN AMRO merger? Yes I am, but I recognize there is a significant dependency on where our stock is trading at the relevant time," Barclays Chief Executive John Varley told reporters on a conference call accompanying its results. "The issue is not where the share price is today, it's where the share price is when ABN shareholders come to vote, and that is more than two months away," he added. Britain's third biggest bank is engaged in the world's biggest bank takeover battle for ABN with a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland ( RBS.L ). Barclays' offer for ABN, mostly in shares, is currently valued at about 65 billion euros ($88.8 billion), below the consortium's mostly cash offer of near 71 billion euros. Barclays said it had received regulatory approval to start a 2.4 billion pound ($4.9 billion) share buyback program on Monday, which it hopes will aid its share price. By 0730 GMT Barclays shares were up 1.3 percent at 686.5 pence, valuing the bank at just over 44 billion pounds. Its shares have been hit by sharp falls in equity markets in the past week, which also threatens to slow growth at its Barclays Capital (BarCap) investment bank unit. Bob Diamond, head of BarCap, said turbulence in credit markets was likely to continue and it would take time for the U.S. subprime mortgage market to recover. The leveraged debt market should recover more quickly as there was "ample liquidity available". "That market will probably recover much more quickly, I would expect sometime in the next 2-3 months to see that market at more normalized volume levels," Diamond said. Barclays said despite the capital market turbulence, BarCap's net income in July was ahead of a year earlier. BarCap's profits jumped 33 percent to 1.66 billion pounds in the first six months of this year to drive a 12 percent rise in group profits to 4.1 billion pounds, the bank confirmed on Thursday. It released headline results last week when it revised its offer for ABN. Mike Trippitt, analyst at Oriel Securities, said the results were "solid", but Barclays and other banks faced some issues. "The word of the reporting season is headwinds, and there are some headwinds here. Overdrafts (refunds) are one, a tough comparison period, and currency, which has taken the wind out of Absa and BGI," Trippitt said. Barclays said it paid out 87 million pounds in refunds to customers to cover past bank charges. British banks have been hit by a wave of requests for repayment of charges after a consumer backlash over the fees, and they have repaid some customers who complained. The refunds have since been suspended as banks await a regulatory decision over whether charges on unauthorized overdrafts are fair. Barclays' refunds were near to the amount announced by rival HBOS HBOS.L, and below the near 120 million pounds of refunds announced by HSBC ( HSBA.L ) this week. Barclays said profits from its UK retail banking business, which it is attempting to revive after several tough years, rose 9 percent in the first half to 651 million pounds as income grew 5 percent, excluding the settlements on bank charges. The economic outlook for the UK and globally was "broadly positive", which left it "well positioned to grow further in the years ahead," the bank said.
