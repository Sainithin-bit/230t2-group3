 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Asian stocks rose on Thursday as investors snapped up beaten-down shares such as BHP Billiton following a rebound on Wall Street, but Toyota Motor fell after posting its first U.S. sales decline in almost three years. 

 Bargain hunting helped U.S. stocks stage a last-minute rally on Wednesday, soothing worries about deteriorating credit conditions that led to a steep fall in global markets in the previous session. "The volatility is very high these days, but the strong rebound in U.S. markets last night could help support stocks today," said Kim Joong-hyun, an analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities in Seoul. At 0026 GMT, Tokyo's Nikkei average  .N225  had climbed 0.3 percent, following Wednesday's 2.2 percent fall, with exporters such as Canon Inc. ( 7751.T ) and electronics components maker Kyocera ( 6971.T ) further boosted by a softer yen. "The market could expect a rebound following the U.S. market and also because it lost too much ground yesterday," said Kazuhiro Takahashi, general manager of the equity marketing department at Daiwa Securities SMBC. Astellas Pharma ( 4503.T ) advanced 1.6 percent a day after posting upbeat earnings, but Toyota Motor ( 7203.T ) slid 0.9 percent. In South Korea, gains of 1.4 percent for Samsung Electronics ( 005930.KS ) and 0.6 percent for ship builder Hyundai Heavy Industries ( 009540.KS ) helped propel the benchmark KOSPI  .KS11  up 1.0 percent. The index had dropped 4 percent on Wednesday. Brokerage firm Samsung Securities ( 016360.KS ) put on 1.4 percent after it reported its best net profit in five quarters. Also on the rebound, Australia's key S&P/ASX 200 index .AXJO gained 1.5 percent, recouping about half of Wednesday's 3.3 percent slide -- its biggest one-day percentage drop in nearly six years. Among the gainers, BHP Billiton ( BHP.AX ) added 1.8 percent, all the big four local banks climbed more than 1 percent each and top investment bank Macquarie Bank MBL.AX jumped 4.4 percent after Wednesday's 10.7 percent drop. Macquarie had warned on Wednesday that two of its debt funds face losses of up to 25 percent as fallout from the global credit crunch widened. MSCI's measure of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.7 percent, steadying from Wednesday's 4 percent slump. On Wall Street, the blue-chip Dow  .DJI  put on 1.1 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index  .IXIC  added 0.3 percent.
