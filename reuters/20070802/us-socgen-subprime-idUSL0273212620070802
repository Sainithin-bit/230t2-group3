 PARIS  (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale ( SOGN.PA ) said on Thursday it had a low exposure to the current turmoil in the credit markets related to concerns over U.S. home loan losses. 

 SocGen highlighted in its second quarter results statement that it had no retail banking activity in the United States. It added that its U.S. based asset management company TCW had no proprietary risk from its business as a manager of CDOs (collateral debt obligations) since it was "purely a service provider remunerated on a commission basis." The company said its corporate and investment banking (CIB) arm also had limited exposure to asset classes at risk, with its exposure to leveraged buyout (LBO) financing representing 1 percent of the division's credit portfolio. SocGen added that its exposure to hedge fund counterparties from its market activities represented around 1 percent of total counterparty market risk.
