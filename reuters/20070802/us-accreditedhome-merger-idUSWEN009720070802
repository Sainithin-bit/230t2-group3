 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, a subprime mortgage lender, said on Thursday it is "proceeding as planned" to work toward closing its acquisition by private equity firm Lone Star, which involves a tender offer. 

 "While there is no guarantee that the transaction will close, the company expects the tender offer to be concluded in the third quarter," San Diego-based Accredited said. (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel)
