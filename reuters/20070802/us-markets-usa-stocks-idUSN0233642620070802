 NEW YORK (Reuters) -The S&P 500 index slipped on Thursday, as nervousness following further signs of worsening credit conditions clouded enthusiasm about a fresh batch of strong earnings. 

 The Nasdaq rose, buoyed by takeover news, while the Dow was little changed in volatile trading. Among the latest signs of mortgage market distress was Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. -- a subprime lender in the process of being sold -- which raised concern about its ability to stay in business. Its shares plunged 37.3 percent to $5.17 on the Nasdaq. But on the positive side, pharmacy chain CVS Caremark Corp. and MTV networks owner Viacom Inc. were among companies that posted results that topped Wall Street's expectations, sending their shares higher. "We're in a bit of a skittish time and any news that has a whiff of disappointment is going to lean on the downside on the market. Investors are a bit on edge here after the declines last month and there are still concerns about subprime issues," said Kurt Brunner, portfolio manager at Swarthmore Group, in Philadelphia. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 19.02 points, or 0.14 percent, at 13,381.39. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 3.05 points, or 0.21 percent, at 1,462.76. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 9.26 points, or 0.36 percent, at 2,563.13. News that electronic payment company CheckFree Corp. is being bought for $4.4 billion in cash helped lift the Nasdaq. CheckFree shares jumped 23.6 percent to $45.51. In a further indication of deteriorating credit conditions, bond insurer MBIA said delinquencies among some subprime home loans serviced by Countrywide Financial Corp. are rising. Shares of Countrywide fell 0.7 percent to $27.01 on the NYSE. Hewlett-Packard Co.'s stock rose 2.4 percent to $47.86 after UBS raised its price target on the computer and printer maker. Shares of Viacom, owner of MTV Networks, Paramount movie studios and Nickelodeon cable channels, rose 0.8 percent to $38.32, while CVS' shares gained 3.5 percent to $36.77, both on the New York Stock Exchange. News that jobless claims rose slightly less than expected last week from the previous week cheered investors, but they were less enthused about a government report showing new orders at U.S. factories rose less than expected in June.
