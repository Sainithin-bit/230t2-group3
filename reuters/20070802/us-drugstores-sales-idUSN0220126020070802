 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Drugstores CVS Caremark Corp. ( CVS.N ), Walgreen Co. ( WAG.N ) and Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ) on Thursday posted higher July sales at stores open at least a year, but pharmacy sales growth was weakened by the introduction of cheaper generic drugs. 

 CVS, the drugstore chain and pharmacy benefits manager, said same-store sales rose 5.2 percent in the four weeks that ended July 28. Walgreen reported a 7.2 percent rise in July same-store sales while at Rite Aid, July same-store sales increased 1.6 percent. July same-store pharmacy sales increased 4.8 percent at CVS, 8.2 percent at Walgreen and 2.1 percent at smaller rival Rite Aid. Generic drugs sell at lower prices than their branded counterparts but are generally more profitable for drugstores. During its quarterly conference call, CVS said generic versions of Lamisil and Toprol-XL affected July pharmacy same-store sales. CVS also reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Thursday. CVS shares were up 90 cents at $36.44 after rising as high as $37.05 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Rite Aid's shares slipped 11 cents to $5.41, while Walgreen stock was up 12 cents at $44.85. CVS said same-store sales of general merchandise rose 6 percent in July. At Rite Aid, such sales increased 0.7 percent and at Walgreen, same-store sales of general merchandise rose 5.5 percent. As of July 28, CVS had 6,180 stores and Rite Aid had 5,151. On July 31, Walgreen had 5,850 stores.
