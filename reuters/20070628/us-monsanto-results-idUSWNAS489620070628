 KANSAS CITY, Missouri  (Reuters) - Monsanto Co. ( MON.N ) reported sharply higher quarterly earnings on Thursday, driven partly by surging U.S. sales of its genetically modified corn and other seeds. 

 Monsanto reported fiscal third-quarter profit of $1.03 a share from ongoing operations, compared with 60 cents a share a year earlier. Analysts on average were looking for $1 a share, according to Reuters Knowledge. St. Louis-based Monsanto has been benefiting from increased farmer interest in planting corn this spring. Corn demand has surged amid a rally in corn prices and strong demand from the ethanol, food and livestock feed sectors.
