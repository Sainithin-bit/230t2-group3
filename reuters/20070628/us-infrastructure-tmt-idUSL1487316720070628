 LONDON  (Reuters) - Investment bankers are tinkering with the traditional definition of infrastructure to attract a wider range of bidders and higher valuations, increasing the risk profile for cash-rich, asset-hungry buyers. 

 Infrastructure funds have built a following for buying low-risk, stable cash flow businesses, but some of the assets recently billed as infrastructure are more volatile, and risk leaving investors with headaches down the line. Traditional infrastructure assets include privatized, regulated monopolies such as utilities and toll roads, necessities less susceptible to economic cycles and not as vulnerable to technological advances. But recent auctions have seen businesses such as broadcast masts and satellites tagged as infrastructure. And according to some bankers, these assets have little in common with those of old and present greater risks. "Five years ago, infrastructure was strictly defined to mean physical infrastructure," said Anand Jagannathan, head of investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort's UK utilities and infrastructure advisory. "Now the liquidity in the market means some investors are prepared to price the service elements in hybrid assets." TOP DOLLAR Because of their longer-term investment outlook, infrastructure funds can afford to pay more than their private equity counterparts, giving them a competitive advantage in auctions. And with record amounts of cash seeking investment, funds have a huge incentive to look at more and more assets outside the traditional mould, exposing their investors to higher risks than they bargained for. Funds managed by Australia's Macquarie Bank Ltd. MBL.AX have, for example, invested in broadcast masts previously owned by NTL and National Grid ( NG.L ). They also bought Telefonica's ( TEF.MC ) Airwave unit, the digital communications network used by British emergency services. Infrastructure typically hold assets for at least 10 years, and often much longer, while private equity's range is more commonly three to five years. "We have a different model to private equity on infrastructure-type deals," said Martin Stanley, the head of Macquarie's European infrastructure funds. "The main reason for that is that our business model requires us to hold assets for the long-term. So our valuations are based on an extended time-frame. We can hold long-term debt and spend money to grow the investment over the long-term." Even satellite operators are being eyed by infrastructure funds. Spanish infrastructure company Abertis ( ABE.MC ) said earlier this month it is negotiating to buy a share in satellite operator Hispasat, in which it already has an indirect holding. At least one infrastructure fund was also in the hunt for satellite operator Intelsat, which was ultimately sold earlier this month to UK private equity firm BC Partners. "The next wave of consolidation in satellite is very likely to see infrastructure buyers," one telecoms banker said. TRADITIONALISTS Some infrastructure funds remain unconvinced they should go beyond their traditional investment targets, however. Macquarie rivals including Goldman Sachs's infrastructure fund consider such telecommunications assets too risky because of the more volatile and short-term nature of their business compared with, say, water companies. Businesses like National Grid's broadcast masts are seen as too dependent on technology and license renewals to fit the same profile as utilities or toll roads for some funds. But the stockpiles of excess cash available to the likes of Macquarie, Abertis, Babcock & Brown and others encourages them to test the boundaries, and tempts sellers to classify more assets as infrastructure. "People like Macquarie have stretched the definition of infrastructure," said one investment banker. "If you're a seller, you want to take advantage of infrastructure valuations, and if you're a buyer you want to get as many things as possible into your infrastructure universe."
