 AMSTERDAM  (Reuters) - Carlyle Capital Corporation Ltd (CCC) has cut the price of a planned initial public offering, its chief executive said on Thursday, blaming market "headwinds". 

 "We have priced the deal at $19 a share. Originally, it was $20-$22," CEO John Stomber told Reuters in an interview. Stomber said the volume of the IPO had been cut to $300 million from $400 million. The issue would be postponed but the new date was unclear. He said the decision was due to "headwinds in the market" and that the investment company, an affiliate of private equity firm the Carlyle Group CYL.UL, expects the IPO to go ahead next week after refiling its application with Dutch market regulator AFM on Thursday morning. "By law, AFM has seven days. We do not expect it to take the full time period allowed," said Stomber. Private equity giant Blackstone Group LP's ( BX.N ) shares surged 13 pct last Friday, the first day of trade following its IPO, but dropped below the listing price on the third day of trade. Some observers cited to Blackstone's lofty valuation and a bill in Congress that would raise the tax rate on the profits of publicly traded private equity firms to 35 percent from 15 percent. Investors are also concerned about higher interest rates and that the impact of the U.S. subprime mortgage market may spread. World markets were recovering on Thursday. Guernsey-based Carlyle Capital Corporation Ltd. (CCC) said last week it planned a listing, offering a total of about 19 million class B shares between $20 and $22 a unit. CCC invests in fixed income assets, including residential mortgage-backed securities and bank loans, CCC said in its offering memorandum. Carlyle Investment Management manages CCC.
