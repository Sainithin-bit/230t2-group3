 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - KB Home ( KBH.N ), the No. 5 U.S. home builder, posted a quarterly net loss on Thursday as home revenue dropped sharply due to the weak housing market. 

 KB Home, whose shares fell 2.3 percent in premarket trade, said the results reflected an oversupply of new and existing homes, aggressive competition and weak demand. It said it was unable to provide a full-year earnings forecast. KB Home reported a net loss of $148.7 million, or $1.93 per share, including French discontinued operations, for its fiscal second quarter ended May 31, compared with a profit of $205.4 million, or $2.45 per share, a year earlier. Revenue, excluding discontinued French operations, fell 36 percent to $1.41 billion, primarily because of lower housing revenue, which dropped 41 percent. KB Home reported a loss from continuing operations of $174.2 million, or $2.26 per share, largely due to a pretax nontax charge of $308.2 million related to inventory and joint venture impairments and abandonment of land contracts.
