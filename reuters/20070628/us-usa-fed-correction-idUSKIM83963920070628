 Corrects second paragraph to say 17 straight increases 

 By  Mark Felsenthal WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policy-makers meeting for a second day on Thursday look set to hold borrowing costs steady as they monitor risks that U.S. inflation could rekindle and that economic growth may stall. Financial markets widely expect the U.S. central bank to hold benchmark overnight interest rates at 5.25 percent, a level reached in June last year after 17 straight increases. Investors will watch closely to see if the Fed nods to a recent easing in measures of core inflation, which strip out food and energy prices to give a better sense of price trends, when it announces its decision around 2:15 p.m. (1815 GMT). Markets will be sensitive to any suggestion policy-makers are relaxing their emphasis on inflation risks, an emphasis that implies a readiness to raise borrowing costs if needed to extinguish price pressures. One possibility is that officials could drop a description of core inflation as "elevated" that has become a staple of its interest-rate announcements. The Fed has worried about elevated levels of inflation since the middle of last year, but core inflation has drifted down to the outside of the central bank's widely presumed comfort zone of between 1 percent and 2 percent. Analysts say the Fed is likely to remain cautious and indicate once again that it is more worried that inflation will fail to recede than it is that growth will falter. "Views on whether and how much inflation has improved may differ, but all will agree the risks remain on the high side," Douglas Lee, president of research firm Economics from Washington, wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Fed policy-makers may find it hard to set aside their inflation worries due to a tight labor market, sharp gains in food and energy costs, and higher import prices. Nevertheless, they have also been attentive to any signs the economy could lose steam as housing market activity falls, even though they are counting on sluggish growth to curb inflation pressures. Since the Fed's last meeting on May 9, solid job growth and some indications of a factory resurgence have pointed to an economy likely growing quite a bit faster than the anemic 0.6 percent annual rate posted in the first quarter. But housing markets still pose a possible obstacle to recovery as higher long-term interest rates raise squeeze home buyers. "The overall picture suggests that we are not about to see a turnaround in the housing sector any time soon," Deutsche Bank economists said in a note on Wednesday. "So far spillovers to consumer spending have been limited, but we still see the ongoing correction in the housing sector and declining home price inflation as significant downside risks to the economy," they said.
