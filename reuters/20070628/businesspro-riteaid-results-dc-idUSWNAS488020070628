 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Rite Aid Corp. ( RAD.N ), the 
third-largest U.S. drugstore chain, posted a higher quarterly 
profit on Thursday as an income tax benefit and a gain on asset 
sales offset acquisition costs. 

  Profit was $27.6 million, or 4 cents per share, in the 
fiscal first quarter ended June 2, up from $11.0 million, or 1 
cent per share, a year earlier.  Analysts, on average, expected the Camp Hill, 
Pennsylvania-based retailer to post a loss of 1 cent per share, 
according to Reuters Estimates.  Rite Aid bought the U.S. Brooks and Eckerd drugstore chains 
from Canada's Jean Coutu Group (PJC) Inc. ( PJCa.TO ) on June 4, 
just after the quarter ended.
