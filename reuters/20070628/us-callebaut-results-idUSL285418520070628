 ZURICH  (Reuters) - Switzerland's Barry Callebaut ( BARN.S ) said it is looking to sell U.S. candy maker Brach's, which weighed on nine-month sales growth, and repeated that higher commodity prices would burden the full-year results. 

 The world's largest maker of chocolate posted a 4.1 percent rise in group sales to 3.285 billion Swiss francs ($2.67 billion) for the first nine months of its 2006/07 fiscal year, below the range of 3.317 to 3.51 billion francs forecast by analysts. "The continued unsatisfactory performance of Barry Callebaut's North American consumer business prompted the company to put the business unit under strategic review," the group said in a statement. The company said it was looking at a joint venture or a partial or a full sale of the Brach's business and that a sale would be the most favorable outcome. The company said it was confident it would reach its three-year financial targets for the period ending in the 2007/08 financial year but reiterated higher commodity prices would weigh on the outcome. "Higher raw material prices will have a negative impact on our financial results in fiscal year 2006/07. The deterioration of the combined (cocoa) ratio is expected to have a negative effect of around 25 million Swiss francs," the company said. The combined cocoa ratio measures sales prices of cocoa butter and cocoa powder relative to the cocoa bean price. "Higher milk prices will also weigh, but are expected to be partly offset by price increases," the company said. The group has three-year financial targets of annual top-line growth of 3 to 5 percent, operating profit growth of 8 to 10 percent and net profit of 12 to 15 percent for the period 2005/06 through to 2007/08. Barry Callebaut has recently won a series of outsourcing contracts from Nestle ( NESN.VX ), Hershey Co. ( HSY.N ) and Cadbury CBRY.L. The group also said it was planning to issue a 350 million euro bond to increase financial flexibility.
