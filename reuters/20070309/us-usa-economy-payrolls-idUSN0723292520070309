 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added a slightly weaker-than-expected 97,000 jobs in February, the smallest gain in more than two years, as increases in service-sector employment offset declines in construction and manufacturing, a government report showed on Friday. 


 However, substantial revisions to employment in January and December boosted payrolls by 55,000 more jobs than previously reported, the Labor Department said. Analysts polled by Reuters were expecting the economy to add 100,000 jobs outside of the farming sector in February. Story: <ID:nN08340546> Table: <ID:nOAT001042>  KEY POINTS: - The Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics revised job gains up to 146,000 in January and to 226,000 in December. - The U.S. trade deficit narrowed slightly more than expected in January to $59.1 billion, as U.S. exports rose to a new record and imports declined, a Commerce Department report showed on Friday. The monthly trade gap shrank 3.8 percent from December and was less than the median forecast of $59.7 billion made by Wall Street analysts surveyed before the report. Story: <ID:nN08347988> Table: <ID:nCAT001380>  COMMENTARY:  STEVE GOLDMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, WEEDEN & CO., GREENWICH,  CONNECTICUT: "The concern for investors is the economic acceleration of the trend on the downside, moving out of this Goldilocks scenario. It's very hard to show that to be the evidence in today's jobs report. The economy is still hanging in there, standing tough and the market likes that."  TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL  LLC, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY: "It was stronger-than-expected employment when you include the 35,000 upward revision. Also, the unemployment rate is now down to 4.5 percent -- data is bad for bonds, good for the dollar and should be good for stocks. You have earnings consumption which calls into question inflationary risks."  MATTHEW STRAUSS, SENIOR CURRENCY STRATEGIST, RBC CAPITAL  MARKETS, TORONTO: "Bullish for the U.S. dollar. We have the headline NFP number slightly higher than expected, but a strong revision for the prior month. We also had the unemployment rate dipping to 4.5 percent. Less important but still bullish for the U.S. dollar is the lower than expected trade deficit."  MARKET REACTION: - U.S. Treasury debt prices fall after nearly in-line payroll reading. <ID:nNYE000105> - U.S. rate futures fall on February jobs data, trim chances of Fed rate cuts. <ID:nCHB000262> - U.S. stock index futures rise after Feb jobs data. <ID:nN09348153> - Dollar rises after Feb jobs growth in line with forecasts, Jan trade deficit narrower than expected. The euro slipped to around $1.3120 after the jobs data from around $1.3155. The dollar rose to around 117.80 yen from 117.35 yen. <ID:nNYA000096>  LINKS: - U.S. Feb payrolls poll story: <ID:nN07241506> - For the text of the U.S. payrolls data, click on USLD01 - Derivatives traders in auction see 75,500 U.S. nonfarm payroll jobs increase in February: <ID:nNYG000538> - U.S. Jan trade deficit poll story: <ID:nN05275565> - For U.S. trade deficit data, the Web site is:  here #trade
