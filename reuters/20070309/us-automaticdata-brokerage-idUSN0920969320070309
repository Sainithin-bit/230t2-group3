 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Automatic Data Processing Inc., one of the world's largest payroll processors, on Friday said its board of directors approved the proposed spinoff its brokerage services unit to shareholders. 


 The unit will be called Broadridge Financial Solutions Inc., and its shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "BR". ADP shareholders will receive a dividend of one Broadridge common share for every four ADP shares they own. Roseland, New Jersey-based ADP expects the transaction to be tax-free to shareholders. It expects the distribution to take place on March 30 for shareholders of record as of March 23. Broadridge helps Wall Street firms and other investors process trades, and has generated about $2 billion of annual revenue. Competitors include Bank of New York Co.'s Pershing unit. The proposed spinoff was first announced on August 2, 2006. ADP said it expects Broadridge to obtain a credit facility before the spinoff, and pay it a $690 million dividend from proceeds. It previously forecast a $500 million to $700 million dividend. ADP said it will use the $690 million, plus $60 million from its Canadian units, to buy back stock over the next year. Shares of ADP fell 2 cents to $48.59 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
