 SEOUL  (Reuters) - South Korea and United States have picked 
up the pace of talks on a trade deal with an end-March deadline 
looming, aiming to strike an agreement both countries' 
legislatures will approve, the chief U.S. envoy said on Friday. 


  The deal, which studies said could add about $20 billion to 
their annual $71.5 billion in trade, must be wrapped up in 
three weeks to meet provisions of a U.S. trade law that allows 
the White House to negotiate pacts Congress can reject but not 
amend.  "It will be a win-win agreement, and we will both be able 
to be proud to bring home an agreement that will gain the 
necessary support from our legislatures," U.S. trade envoy 
Wendy Cutler told a group of young Koreans working for foreign 
companies.  Cutler and South Korea's chief negotiator, Kim Jong-hoon, 
said a deal was within reach on what could lead to the biggest 
U.S. free trade pact in 15 years.  "We are spending a lot of time together," Cutler said.  South Korea said the areas that could not be resolved in 
these talks -- the final formal round -- would make their way 
to senior negotiators who would try to craft last-minute 
compromises before the end of the month.  Key sticking points include U.S. demands to further open 
the South Korean market for its cars and medical products, and 
South Korean calls to change U.S. anti-dumping laws Seoul says 
are unfairly applied to its products.  A separate dispute about U.S. beef exports to South Korea 
has also clouded the discussions in Seoul that must end on 
Monday.  The deal could be the biggest U.S. free trade pact since 
the North America Free Trade Agreement of 1992. South Korea is 
Washington's seventh-largest trading partner, while the United 
States is Seoul's third-largest trade partner.
