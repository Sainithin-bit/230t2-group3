 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Inflation pressures fell in February due mainly to measures for vendor performance and the job market, which were partly offset by inflationary moves in interest rates and commodity prices, a report said on Friday. 


 The Economic Cycle Research Institute's U.S. Future Inflation Gauge, designed to anticipate cyclical swings in the rate of inflation, fell to 118.7 in February from 119.4 in January, revised down from 119.5. "The USFIG remains in the cyclical downtrend that began in the fall of 2005. Thus, U.S. inflation pressures continue to retreat," said Lakshman Achuthan, managing director at ECRI. The index's annualized growth rate, which smoothes out monthly fluctuations, dropped to minus 3.3 percent from minus 2.8 percent in January.
