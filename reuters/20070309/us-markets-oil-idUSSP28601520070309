 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Oil prices fell over 2 percent on Friday as easing U.S. supply concerns spurred a bout of profit taking. 


 U.S. crude CLc1 settled at $60.05 a barrel, down $1.59 or 2.6 percent, after trading as low as $59.99. London Brent crude LCOc1 gave up $1.20, or 1.9 pct, to settle at $61.13. A fall in U.S. gasoline and crude inventories had pushed oil prices over $62.00 on Wednesday. Despite the draws, analysts said the United States would probably be well stocked ahead of the summer driving season, with crude inventories expected to rebound as fog along the Gulf Coast import center lets up. U.S. oil fell 18 cents on Thursday as traders began to take profits from highs struck earlier in the week. "I think the market is moving on some profit taking," said Eric Wittenauer, Energy Futures Analyst for A.G. Edwards Inc. "The data definitely had a bullish skew, but realizing there was a ship channel closure impacted some of the numbers, its not surprising some would take profits here." News that Shell ( RDSa.L ) expects to restore operations at its 100,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery on Friday following a power failure on Sunday also helped push prices lower in late activity. EYES ON OPEC Analysts were eyeing OPEC's upcoming March 15 meeting in Vienna where members of the producer group will discuss output policy and Iran's standoff with the West. Disruptions to 180,600 bpd of Australia's oil supplies, about half of national output, by Cyclone George has also supported prices. A second storm is threatening operations further. "While crude's flat price could remain rangebound in the high $50s to low $60s in the very short term, our view is that near-term price risk is to the upside. We see good fundamental support for crude in March-April," J.P. Morgan said in a report. OPEC economists favor keeping output steady for now, an official told Reuters on Thursday after the Economic Commission Board discussed available data. At its previous two meetings in October and December, OPEC agreed to cut a total of 1.7 million bpd, roughly 6 percent of production.
