 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. ( KO.N ) Chairman and Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell received $7 million in salary and performance-based pay in 2006, nearly 17 percent more than he was paid a year earlier, the world's largest soft drink company said on Friday. 


 Isdell's salary was unchanged at $1.5 million but his $5.5 million in incentive compensation for 2006 was $1 million higher than 2005, according to Coke's proxy filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Including awards of stock, options, pension value, deferred compensation and all other benefits, Isdell's total 2006 compensation under new SEC disclosure requirements was $32.3 million, compared to an estimated $26.1 million in 2005, if the new rules had been in effect at that time. Isdell, 63, was named to Coca-Cola's top job in June 2004. He received $12.1 million worth of stock awards and $7.3 million worth option awards in 2006, after receiving $7.3 million in stock awards and $10.8 million in option awards in 2005, Coke said. Part of the larger total compensation figure stems from the amount Coke accrued for Isdell's pension, which the company had not previously disclosed. Coke said it accrued nearly $5.4 million for the pension in 2006, up from $1.4 million in 2005. Isdell's compensation actually received for 2006, excluding items such as stock awards which have not been paid out yet, was $7.5 million. Under the old rules, Isdell's 2005 compensation was about $6.5 million, Coke said. The compensation committee kept Isdell's base salary unchanged after deciding that it was at a competitive level and that any adjustments to his 2006 compensation should focus on long-term responsibilities, the company said in the filing. Coke said Isdell's incentive award was based on the company's strong performance during 2006, including results at the top end of its long-term volume and profit goals. The company's unit case volume and net income each rose 4 percent in 2006. Atlanta-based Coke said it plans to hold its annual meeting on April 18 in Wilmington, Delaware. At the meeting, shareholders will vote on whether to reelect the company's 11 board members, approve a performance incentive plan and vote on five shareholder proposals. The board recommended that shareholders vote against all five of the shareholder proposals. Shares of Coke, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average  .DJI , rose 43 cents to $47.58 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Coca-Cola trades at about 16.8 times expected 2008 earnings, compared with a multiple of 17.2 for rival PepsiCo Inc. ( PEP.N ), according to Reuters data.
