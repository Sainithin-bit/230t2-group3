 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - New Century Financial Corp. NEW.N shares fell 17.1 percent to an eight-year low on Friday after analysts said the largest independent U.S. subprime mortgage lender, which faces a criminal probe and has stopped making new loans, may soon seek bankruptcy protection. 


 The subprime sector, whose lenders offer financing to people with poor credit histories, suffered a further blow as General Electric Co.'s ( GE.N ) WMC Mortgage unit said it would lay off 460 people, or 20 percent of its work force. Shares of Irvine, California-based New Century fell a day after it said it stopped taking loan applications, lined up $265 million of funding secured by its mortgage loan portfolio and other assets, and would refinance $710 million of loans. Morgan Stanley provided the financing, people familiar with the matter said. Analysts said New Century probably would be unable to resolve disputes with other lenders, including at least five that have so far refused to waive borrowing covenants. Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Kenneth Bruce and JPMorgan analyst Andrew Wessel both wrote that a bankruptcy filing for the real estate investment trust "seems imminent." A New Century spokeswoman declined to comment. The REIT has said it made $51.6 billion of subprime loans in 2006. More than 20 subprime lenders have quit lending or gone bankrupt in the past year as defaults soared. "What's happening is the front end of this wave of teaser-rate loans that are coming into full pricing," Federal Reserve Governor Susan Bies said on Friday. "So what we're seeing in this narrow segment is the beginning of the wave. This is not the end, this is the beginning." Bies spoke at a conference in Charlotte, North Carolina. The job cuts at Burbank, California-based WMC follow 300 cuts last week at New Century, and a decision Monday by Fremont General Corp. FMT.N, a Santa Monica, California lender, to put many workers at its subprime unit on paid leave. "We've realigned our resources to be more consistent with today's market," WMC spokeswoman Brandie Young said. WMC also said it stopped making loans to people who do not make down payments. Other lenders including Washington Mutual Inc. ( WM.N ) have made similar moves. Shares of New Century closed down 66 cents at $3.21, their lowest close since October 1998. The shares fell 78.1 percent this week, and are down 89.9 percent this year. NEGATIVE VALUE AT NEW CENTURY? Friday's decliners among subprime lenders also included San Diego's Accredited Home Lenders Holding Co. LEND.O, down 6 percent; Kansas City, Missouri's NovaStar Financial Inc. NFI.N, down 3.1 percent, and Santa Monica, California's Fremont General Corp. FMT.N, down 3.7 percent. Fremont this week stopped making residential mortgage loans and is also trying to sell its subprime unit. Analysts said New Century, having pledged most of its assets as collateral, has little left to offer creditors. "It is likely that New Century just used up its last option to avoid collapse," Wessel wrote. Chris Brendler, a Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst, wrote that New Century's value if it were liquidated could be negative $63 million, and "in a 'fire sale' situation, likely lower." He said the REIT has more value as a takeover candidate, "given its large origination and servicing platforms." New Century a week ago disclosed a federal criminal probe into its accounting and trading in its securities, and said its survival might depend on relief from lenders. Its market value has fallen in 2007 to around $178 million from $1.75 billion. (Additional reporting by  Scott Malone  in Boston, Hart Matthews in Charlotte, North Carolina, and  Al Yoon  in New York)
