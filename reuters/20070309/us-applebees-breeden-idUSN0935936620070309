 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Applebee's International Inc. APPB.O said on Friday negotiations with hedge fund Breeden Capital have failed to produce an agreement after Breeden rejected the company's offer of two board seats. 


 Breeden Capital, a 5 percent shareholder in the restaurant chain, is seeking four seats on Applebee's board of directors. Applebee's said that over the past eight months, board members and company representatives had held numerous conversations with representatives of Breeden Capital, and that it continued to consider Breeden's comments regarding its business strategies. In recent months, Applebee's has been under pressure from Breeden to reduce capital spending, boost cash returned to shareholders and sell more restaurants to franchisees. A representative from Breeden was not immediately available for comment.
