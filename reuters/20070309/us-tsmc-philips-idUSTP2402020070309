 TAIPEI  (Reuters) - TSMC ( 2330.TW ), the world's largest contract chip maker, said on Friday Philips ( PHG.AS ) plans to sell TSMC shares it owns to help it make an orderly exit from its current $8.5 billion stake in the Taiwan company. 


 Dutch Philips, which owns a 16.2 percent stake in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (TSMC) ( TSM.N ), plans to sell up to $1.75 billion worth of shares in TSMC in the near future to long-term financial investors in Taiwan, the two firms said in a joint statement. Philips also plans to offer up to $2.5 billion worth of TSMC shares, in the form of American Depositary shares, through a public offering in the United States, they said. The shares are expected to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. "We are pleased to have reached agreement with TSMC on this plan to facilitate our exit from our current shareholding in TSMC in an orderly, responsible manner," Philips Chief Financial Officer Pierre-Jean Sivignon said in the statement. Meanwhile, TSMC plans to conduct a share repurchase on the Taiwan Stock Exchange to buy back up to about $1.5 billion worth of its shares, and cancel the repurchased shares, the companies said. Philips intends to participate in the share repurchase. TSMC will also conduct additional share repurchase programs between 2008 and 2010. TSMC has said that it could use its excess cash to buy back the Philips shares, helping it manage its cash more effectively. Analysts say that the move will also help eliminate market concerns about what might happen to the Philips stake. "This will be positive to TSMC's share price," said Chu Yen-min, a vice president at Taiwan's KGI Securities. "People have had concerns about how Philips is going to sell TSMC shares recently and now we clearly know how (Philips) will do." In Taipei, TSMC shares rose 0.91 percent to end at T$66.50 on Friday, while Taiwan's main TAIEX  .TWII  share index fell 0.07 percent. The stock has fallen 6.6 percent since the year's intraday high hit on January 18. (US$1=T$33.0)
