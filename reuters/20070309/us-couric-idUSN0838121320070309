 LOS ANGELES  (Reuters) - Six months after Katie Couric's much-ballyhooed debut as "CBS Evening News" anchor, the network signaled on Thursday an overhaul of her flagging newscast by hiring one of the industry's most experienced hands to oversee her program. 


 Rick Kaplan, a former president of both CNN and MSNBC who also worked with such names as Walter Cronkite, Ted Koppel and Peter Jennings at CBS and ABC, was named executive producer of the "CBS Evening News with Katie Couric" effective immediately, the network said. The decision to hire Kaplan was made by CBS News President Sean McManus alone, though Couric, who also is managing editor of her newscast, was made aware of the development, according to a network spokeswoman. Couric's original executive producer, Rome Hartman, the former "60 Minutes" producer named to run the evening newscast in January 2006, will be assigned to a new post at CBS News, the network said. Couric, 50, became a celebrity during 15 years as co-host of America's top-rated morning show, NBC's "Today," before debuting at CBS in September as the first woman solo anchor of a major U.S. network evening newscast. After six months on the job, she remains stuck in third place in the network news ratings behind rivals "ABC World News" with Charlie Gibson and the "NBC Nightly News" with Brian Williams. Her average audience to date this season is 7.6 million viewers, down 2 percent from the year before. Earlier this week, NBC replaced the executive producer of "Nightly News," whose long-term ratings dominance has been challenged in recent weeks by ABC. At stake in the battle for supremacy among the network newscasts is a nightly audience of roughly 25 million viewers and $450 million in annual advertising revenues. 'INFLATED EXPECTATIONS' In a marketing blitz for Couric's CBS debut, the network sought to promote her as a more "accessible" journalist who also possessed the experience to carry its flagship newscast. But with her program no better off in the ratings than when she replaced interim anchor Bob Schieffer following the resignation of veteran Dan Rather, some question whether Couric is worth her reported $15 million a year salary. "She's suffered from inflated expectations," independent news analyst Andrew Tyndall said. "She certainly hasn't lived up to her paycheck, but I consider that to be a problem with CBS management." He said what many viewers saw tuning into the first weeks of her CBS stint, when the network's ratings briefly spiked, was a "work in progress" before all the kinks of an evolving broadcast had been ironed out. Tyndall also said Couric appears less comfortable reading the news than she did in the more ad-libbed environment of morning television. Other critics have suggested her program needs a harder edge and faster pace. Kaplan declined to speak specifically about how he plans to change the newscast or to assess Couric's performance so far. But he hinted that hard news stories should be a priority, saying "This is a very serious time, with all that's going on in the world." A successful broadcast needs to present its audience "with news they need to know that they may not know they need to know," he said.
