 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. economy added 97,000 jobs in February, the smallest gain in two years, but job growth in prior months was revised higher and the unemployment rate dropped, the government said on Friday in a report that eased fears over a sharp economic slowdown. 


 Other reports showed the U.S. trade deficit narrowed a bit in January as exports hit a record high, while wholesale inventories grew, suggesting economic growth in the first quarter might prove stronger than many economists had thought. The jobs data, in particular, helped dispel rising concerns about the outlook for the world's largest economy. Reports last week of sagging housing and factory orders had contributed to a steep decline in U.S. stocks. Bearish remarks on the economy by former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan had also fanned worries in the markets. "It's not a question of whether the economy is roaring back again -- it's not, it's growing sluggishly -- but there's no indication that things are spiraling down," said Nigel Gault, U.S. economist for Global Insight in Lexington, Massachusetts. Stocks initially shot higher on the data but failed to hold their gains as worries about mortgage lenders continued to weigh. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 16 points. At the same time, the U.S. dollar rose and prices for government bonds fell as traders scaled back expectations that the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates soon. While the jobs report showed the weakest gain in nonfarm payrolls since January 2005, the Labor Department revised up its count of employment for January and December by a net 55,000 jobs. In addition, the unemployment rate edged down to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent in January. While the February job gain was in line with forecasts from economists, financial markets had braced for a weaker number. A derivatives auction held just before the report showed traders had expected a job increase of just 75,500. "It's certainly better than the market's worst fears," said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist for RBS Greenwich in Greenwich, Connecticut. WEATHER TAKES A TOLL The Labor Department said construction employment fell by 62,000 last month, probably prompted in part by cold and stormy weather in much of the country. While economists said some of the construction weakness would likely prove transitory, they were left debating the extent to which it could still reflect a soft housing market. Doubts over whether the housing market's darkest days are past have been compounded in recent weeks by troubles in the subprime mortgage sector, where surging defaults have worsened the financial outlook of leading lenders. The jobs report also underscored the economy's other weak spot -- manufacturing -- as factories shed 14,000 positions, marking the eighth straight month employment in the sector shrank. Production cuts by auto makers have weighed on factory output in recent months, but the woes of the U.S. housing sector are taking a toll as well. David Huether, chief economist at the National Association of Manufacturers, noted that nearly a third of the 14,000 factory jobs lost jobs could be accounted for by a drop in employment in the wood products sub-sector. "It's clear that the continued downturn in residential investment is having a pronounced effect on housing-related manufacturing sectors," he said. In contrast, the services side of the economy created 168,000 news jobs in February. Employment in health care, which accounted for one in six jobs added to U.S. payrolls in the last 12 months, rose by 33,000. The report also showed average hourly earnings increased by 6 cents, or 0.4 percent, ahead of the 0.3 percent expected on Wall Street. Fed officials are concerned the tight labor market might lead to wage gains that could prove inflationary, and economists said February's relatively steep rise would keep those worries alive. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said the U.S. trade gap narrowed by 3.8 percent in January to $59.1 billion as U.S. exports climbed and imports fell. The trade gap had set an annual record for the fifth straight year in 2006. (Additional reporting by  Doug Palmer )
