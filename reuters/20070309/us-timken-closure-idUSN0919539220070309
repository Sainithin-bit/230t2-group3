 BOSTON  (Reuters) - Timken Co. ( TKR.N ), a maker of bearings and alloy steels, said on Friday it plans to close a factory in Sao Paolo, Brazil, citing weak demand from North American auto makers. 


 The plant, which currently employs 300 people, will close by the end of the year, the Canton, Ohio-based company said. Auto components were a weak spot in the company's 2006 financial results, reporting an operating loss and declining revenue, while results at the company's industrial and steel units improved. Since 2005, Timken has cut headcount in its auto-related businesses by 2,500. "Following the dramatic decline in vehicle production by certain North American customers that occurred in 2006, we are balancing our manufacturing capacity," said Jacqueline Dedo, president of Timken's automotive group. The Big Three Detroit automakers -- General Motors Corp. ( GM.N ), Ford Motor Co. ( F.N ) and the Chrysler unit of DaimlerChrysler AG DCXGn.DE -- have been suffering of late, as consumer enthusiasm wanes for the light trucks that are their most profitable products. That's cleared the way for foreign companies including Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ), the fastest-growing major automaker, to gain ground. Timken shares were up 18 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $29.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. (Additional reporting by Ankur Relia in Bangalore)
