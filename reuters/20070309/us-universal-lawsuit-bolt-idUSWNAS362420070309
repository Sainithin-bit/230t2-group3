 (Reuters) - Universal Music Group, a unit of France's Vivendi ( VIV.PA ), and Bolt Inc. said they reached an out-of-court settlement resolving the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by UMG against Bolt last year. 


 Under terms of the deal, Bolt agreed to provide UMG with a multi-million dollar payment for damages for past infringement, the companies said in a joint statement. (Reporting by Anup Roy in Bangalore)
