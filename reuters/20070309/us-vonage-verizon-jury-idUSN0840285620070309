 ALEXANDRIA, Virginia  (Reuters) - A jury dealt a blow to loss-making Internet phone provider Vonage Holdings Corp. on Thursday, ordering the company to pay $58 million plus royalties on future sales for infringing three patents owned by Verizon Communications Inc.. 


 The eight-member federal jury found that Vonage had infringed on three of five Verizon patents covering key Internet phone call technology. It rejected Vonage's argument that the patents were invalid and said Vonage must pay a 5.5 percent royalty rate on sales going forward. However, the penalties were less than the $197 million in damages and a 19 percent royalty rate sought by Verizon. Vonage said it would appeal the verdict. Customers "should see no change" in their service, said Vonage, which reported a net loss of $65 million in its fourth quarter. Stanford Group analyst Clayton Moran said the verdict was harsher on Vonage than he expected. "In and of itself, it doesn't render its business model as not viable, but I think it will have a significant impact on the stock," Moran said. Shares of Vonage shed nearly 4 percent after the verdict to $4.86 in regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange before dipping another 4 percent to $4.67 in extended trading. Vonage, which priced at $17 per share in its initial public offering in May last year, ranks as the worst-performing IPO in the past 15 months, according to analysts. The patents at issue in the case are related to voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology, which allows consumers to make calls over the Internet. After a day of deliberations, jurors concluded that Vonage infringed two Verizon patents covering technology to connect Internet calls to the traditional phone system and for features such as call-waiting and voice-mail. The jury said Vonage also infringed on a third patent involving wireless Internet phone calls. Verizon has asked the judge to impose an injunction barring the use of the technologies that infringe its patents. U.S. District Judge Claude Hilton has set a March 23 hearing for arguments on whether he should issue an injunction. "We don't believe there is any basis to support Verizon's request for an injunction," Vonage said in a statement. "If the trial court does impose an injunction, we will seek an immediate stay from the federal court of appeals." The jury said Vonage was not "willful" in its infringement of the three patents, sparing the company even stiffer penalties. Verizon welcomed the verdict. "Patents encourage and protect innovations that benefit consumers, create jobs, and keep the economy growing," Verizon lawyer John Thorne said in a statement. Verizon's request for an injunction against Vonage could be complicated by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last year involving online auction company eBay Inc.. That ruling made it more difficult for some patent holders to get an injunction against infringers, especially those that do not put their patents into practice in selling a product. As part of their defense against Verizon, lawyers for Vonage have argued that Verizon sat on its Internet phone patents for years and only reluctantly offered to sell the service to customers who were about to defect to Vonage. Verizon says it is actively marketing its own Internet phone service but was delayed in bringing it to market by regulatory hurdles.
