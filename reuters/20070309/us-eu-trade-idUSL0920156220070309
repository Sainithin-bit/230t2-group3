 BRUSSELS  (Reuters) - European Union leaders pressed other trading powers on Friday to move to wrap up more than five years of global trade talks, making clear the EU would also pursue the option of bilateral deals with Asian partners. 


 A draft summit statement called for an "ambitious, balanced and comprehensive agreement" to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Doha round of negotiations aimed at boosting the global economy and lifting millions of people out of poverty. Other countries should "act in the same spirit of constructive commitment in order to bring the negotiations to a successful close," it said. The EU, the United States, India and Brazil are trying to narrow differences, mostly over agriculture, to free up negotiations in other areas such as industrial goods and services, involving the WTO's full 150-country membership. "At the same time, building on the platform of the WTO, bilateral and regional Free Trade Agreements with relevant partners should be taken forward rapidly," the text said. The European Commission, which negotiates trade deals on behalf of the 27-nation bloc, has said it plans negotiations starting this year for new bilateral and regional deals with countries from South East Asia, India and South Korea, which is trying to close a free trade deal with the United States. "This shows we have two irons in the fire," an EU diplomat said. Those agreements would go further than the WTO's Doha round by including issues such as rules for foreign investment and public procurement in order to create big new opportunities for European companies, EU trade officials say. In another reference to what European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson has said is a more "hard-headed" trade strategy, Friday's draft stressed the importance of getting more access for European companies in fast-growing developing nations. The United States and the EU should narrow their regulatory differences further, smoothing transatlantic business, as well as boost joint efforts to fight intellectual property theft and cooperate more on energy and the environment, it said.
