 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Internet phone company Vonage Holdings Corp. said on Friday it was not going out of business despite a jury's verdict a day earlier that it infringed on three patents owned by Verizon Communications Inc. 


 "In the unlikely event the monetary award ($58 million) and royalties are ultimately upheld/paid, they will not jeopardize Vonage's financial position as we focus on achieving profitability," the company said in a statement. It also said there would be no change in its phone service and that it was confident it could stay any injunction. The company's shares were down around 15 percent in afternoon trade.
