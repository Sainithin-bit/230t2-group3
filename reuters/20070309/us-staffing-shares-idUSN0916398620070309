 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Shares of U.S. staffing companies were mostly higher on Friday after an essentially in-line monthly U.S. employment report that reflected slow but steady growth and sharp upward revisions from prior months. 


 The U.S. economy added 97,000 jobs outside of the farm sector in February, slightly below the 100,000 average forecast by economists, but the U.S. Labor Department also revised up jobs growth for January and December and the U.S. unemployment rate edged down to 4.5 percent from 4.6 percent. Demand for temporary workers was about flat in February from a year earlier, Bear Stearns analyst Andrew Steinerman said in a research note that described the trend as "hovering" and attributed it to construction and manufacturing. "In contrast, professional staffing and perm growth remain strong," Steinerman wrote, adding that trends remain strong for the best staffing companies, especially those focused on professional, permanent or international staffing. A scarcity of skilled workers requires companies to move quickly to fill positions and has resulted in counter-offers, Spherion Corp. SFP.N Chief Executive Officer Roy Krause said. "We continue to see incredible demand for accounting and finance people," Krause said in an interview. "I just read that the economy is still expanding, maybe a little bit slower." Kelly Services Inc. ( KELYA.O ) Chief Executive Carl Camden, who follows the revisions more closely than initial figures, said steady jobs growth the past three months has been reflective of sharp demand for educated skilled workers. "This was pretty much what everyone expected and was built in to the equity markets," Camden said in an interview. "I think there will probably be a little sigh of relief." The U.S. economy could produce 125,000 to 130,000 jobs growth per month post-revisions through the summer, then the question will be whether it begins to accelerate, Camden said. Steve Wolfe, a senior vice president at Hudson Highland Group Inc. HHGP.O, said jobs growth was not as strong as the company would have liked, but the decline in the unemployment rate reflected a continued tightening in the jobs market. "We don't see a huge hiring spike, but the good news for us is that we also don't see any significant reductions in force by companies," Wolfe said in an interview. The Standard & Poor's HR Employment services index .15GSPEMPL, a gauge of staffing and human resources stocks, was up 0.3 percent in afternoon trade despite a 1.3 percent drop in large constituent Robert Half International Inc. ( RHI.N ) Monster Worldwide Inc. ( MNST.O ) and Manpower Inc. ( MAN.N ), two of the other large constituents in the S&P HR index after Robert Half, were up less than 1 percent. Among the bigger gainers, Hudson Highland shares were up 75 cents, or 4.92 percent at $15.98; CDI Corp. ( CDI.N ) up 63 cents, or 2.16 percent, at $29.75; and Kelly up 48 cents, or 1.54 percent, at $31.55.
