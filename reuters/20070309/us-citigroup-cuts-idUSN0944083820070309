 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Fifty-two billion dollars is a lot of money. 


 It's the net worth of Warren Buffett, according to Forbes magazine. It's the gross domestic product of Vietnam, according to the World Bank. It's enough to buy every American 172 double cheeseburgers off a typical McDonald's Dollar Menu. It's also the total of Citigroup Inc.'s ( C.N ) operating expenses last year. Chief Executive Charles Prince says it's too much. Investors agree. They expect to learn this month how he'll get it down. "I hope we're looking at a philosophy of continuously addressing the cost side, and not letting it run away," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates LLC in Chicago, which owns 550,000 Citigroup shares. Prince ordered Chief Operating Officer Robert Druskin to figure out by the end of March how to cut costs, a drag on the largest U.S. bank's share price. Druskin may reduce overlap in several businesses, or perhaps move jobs from pricey areas such as New York to lower-cost areas such as Texas, or overseas, Prince has said. "It's not easy, it's not fast, it's certainly not glamorous," Prince said on a January 19 conference call. Reports have said Druskin may cut at least $1 billion from expenses. That's less than 2 percent, a small percentage compared to what some rivals are doing. It may not satisfy investors. They want faster revenue growth, especially in U.S. consumer operations, Citigroup's biggest unit. In 2006, overall revenue rose 7 percent to $89.6 billion, but costs rose 15 percent. "You have to cut costs without destroying your revenue base," said Jim Huguet, co-chief executive of Great Companies LLC in Clearwater, Florida, which owns Citigroup shares. "You don't shrink to greatness, you grow to greatness." Citigroup spokesman Mike Hanretta said executives were not immediately available for further comment. FAIRLY VALUED? Greater efficiency could boost profit. So might a series of foreign acquisitions, including this week's $10.8 billion bid for Japanese securities firm Nikko Cordial Corp. 8603.T. But investors want results now. They have good reason. Through Thursday, Citigroup stock is up just 11 percent since Prince took over in October 2003. Take out gains in December, when Prince promoted Druskin and announced the cost-cutting plan, and Citigroup stock is under water. The increase lags gains of 30 percent at Bank of America Corp. ( BAC.N ) and 42 percent at JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( JPM.N ), Citigroup's biggest rivals. Bank of America in November briefly passed Citigroup as the world's largest bank by market value. "Execution has been poor (and) management has been weak," said Jon Fisher, who helps invest $1.5 billion at Fifth Third Asset Management and doesn't own Citigroup shares. "To get a better valuation, they have to earn it." Even so, investors may be demanding a lot. Indeed, by other measures, Citigroup looks more fairly valued. Its shares trade at 11.2 times analysts' projected 2007 earnings, and 2.1 times book value. In comparison, Bank of America trades at 10.3 times earnings and 1.7 times book, and JPMorgan at 11.9 times earnings and 1.5 times book. LONG-SUFFERING On January 31, Prince said "we don't need four or five layers of headquarters activities" for corporate and investment banking -- including in two Manhattan towers six miles apart. He also lamented how each U.S. consumer business runs separately, with its own technology platform, and middle and back offices. "We don't need separate middle and back offices for each of our consumer businesses in one country," he said. But Citigroup's size suggests cuts may need to be deeper than what some rivals are extracting. For example, Wachovia Corp. WB.N, the No. 4 U.S. bank, is weeding $1 billion from its own expenses, which at $17.5 billion are just one-third as high as Citigroup's. And SunTrust Banks Inc. ( STI.N ), the No. 7 bank, plans to save $400 million. That, however, is 8 percent of a $4.9 billion expense base. While Prince has rejected much of the vision of his predecessor Sanford "Sandy" Weill, the latter still enjoys a reputation as a cost-cutter, if at times a ruthless one. Prince may need some of that to restore more luster to his leadership. "Changes being made now will change the way people look at this company," Front Barnett's Front said. "We've had (our) shares for a long time, and for the last two or three years we've been suffering, but I don't think our wait is in vain." (Additional reporting by  Dan Wilchins )
