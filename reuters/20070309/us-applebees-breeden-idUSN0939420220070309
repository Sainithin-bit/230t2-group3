 ATLANTA  (Reuters) - Applebee's International Inc. APPB.O said on Friday negotiations with hedge-fund investor Breeden Capital have failed to produce an agreement after Breeden rejected the restaurant chain's offer of two board seats. 


 Breeden Capital, a fund run by former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden, owns 5 percent of Applebee's shares and is seeking four seats on the board. The board currently has 12 members. "We expect the proxy battle to continue and believe it unlikely that Applebee's will make another similar offer," Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co. analyst Ashley Woodruff said in a research note. The company said last month it was exploring a possible sale amid pressure from Breeden Capital to reduce capital spending, boost cash returned to shareholders and sell more restaurants to franchisees. It said Breeden refused board seat offers twice this month. On March 2, Applebee's said it offered a board seat to Breeden founding partner Steven Quamme if Breeden Capital would withdraw other nominees. After that proposal was rejected, Applebee's said it offered Breeden a second seat on its board, and was again refused. Applebee's said that over the past eight months, board members and company representatives had held numerous conversations with Breeden Capital and that it continued to consider Breeden's comments regarding its business strategies. "Despite our good faith attempts to reach out to Mr. Breeden and his firm throughout this process ... he has consistently rejected our overtures," Applebee's Chief Executive Dave Goebel said in the statement. A representative from Breeden Capital, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, was not immediately available to comment. Applebee's, based in Overland Park, Kansas, has been hurt by a pullback in consumer spending as competition increases with other casual-dining chains. Last month, it said sales at restaurants open at least 18 months fell 4 percent in February as winter weather kept customers away. The chain's shares were up 5 cents to $25.22 in morning Nasdaq trading. The stock has risen about 2 percent this year.
