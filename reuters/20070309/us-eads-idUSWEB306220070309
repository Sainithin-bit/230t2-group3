 MUNICH, Germany  (Reuters) - An industrial crisis blamed for sweeping job cuts at Europe's Airbus slashed profits at parent EADS by 86 percent in 2006, sending its shares lower on Friday as it ruled out a quick recovery this year. 


 Troubles with the Airbus A380 superjumbo led to 2.5 billion euros ($3.29 billion) in charges EADS ( EAD.PA ) said offsetting better performance in its defense and space units. EADS earnings before interest and taxes fell to 399 million euros on revenues of 39.4 billion euros, up 15 percent. What should have been a positive surprise, with investors predicting the pan-European group would barely break even after a trio of profit warnings, failed to lift its shares as analysts focused on the dearth of any rebound in its forecasts for 2007. EADS shares fell as much as 5.9 percent to 22.30 euros. EADS predicted another "substantial loss" for Airbus this year, which company officials said would be similar to an operating loss of 572 million euros posted by Airbus for 2006. EADS said its own performance would also be "roughly stable". A380 delivery delays and a weak dollar prompted Airbus to announce 10,000 job cuts a week ago, sparking union uproar and hijacking the campaign for France's presidential elections. Its Power8 cost-cutting plan is aimed at ensuring Airbus has the money and margins it needs to stay competitive with Boeing. In a surprise move EADS deferred a dividend announcement, saying its board would recommend a level at its next meeting. Analysts had expected a dividend of 0.42 euros compared with 0.65 euros a year earlier, according to Reuters Estimates data. The dividend has proved politically sensitive, with unions drawing up criticism of investor gains as Airbus workers lose jobs in France, Germany, Britain and Spain. French Socialist candidate Segeolene Royal has spoken out against "lazy profits". The conservative French government said this week it did not expect to receive a 2006 dividend for its 15-percent stake and said it stood ready to pump more cash into EADS. Co-Chief Executive Tom Enders acknowledged the question had become political but denied the company had bowed to pressure. "No government can decide our dividend," he told reporters. EADS is wading through a list of funding needs including the 10 billion euro cost of its next model, the A350, but says there is no immediate need for a capital hike. Until its cash needs are clear, the dividend is difficult to set, officials said. EADS also denied suggestions by many financial analysts that it had stacked Airbus with losses in 2006 -- a year of record deliveries for existing models -- to force through its job cuts. "I don't play this game because it is a very dangerous one," said French co-CEO Louis Gallois, who also heads Airbus. "If we don't take the decision now, we will have to take tougher decisions in two or three years." MARGIN TARGETS Wiring troubles have led to costly delays in producing the A380 superjumbo which is due for first delivery this October. Protracted delays in settling on a design for the A350, as well as a weak dollar, have also hurt earnings. Gallois' remedy includes the full or partial sale of six European factories and outsourcing half of A350 production. EADS said it would bring Airbus margins back to "mid-single digits" over the medium term, which Gallois called two-to-five years. Airbus had an operating margin of 10.4 percent in 2005. EADS said it was also committed to restoring its group operating margins in coming years, but this would be at a lower level than the 8.3 percent seen in 2005. Bright spots in EADS's earnings included a stronger operating performance by the Military Transport, Eurocopter and Defense units as well as space business EADS Astrium. Order backlogs for airliners and helicopters are at record highs and Airbus despite its woes had a record 434 plane deliveries and its second best year in new orders. Airbus, meanwhile, took a charge of 352 million euros as a cushion against overruns on its A400M military airlifter, but said this was offset by positive items elsewhere in EADS. The plane designed for seven NATO countries remains on time, it added. (Additional reporting by  Tim Hepher  in Munich, Benoit Van Overstraeten in Paris,  Jason Neely  in London)
