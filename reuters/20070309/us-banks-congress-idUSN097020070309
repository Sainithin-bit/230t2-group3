 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - The U.S. House Financial Services Committee plans a March 22 hearing on whether to close the federal banking loophole that allows retailers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Home Depot Inc. to operate banks, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. 


 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) has extended a freeze through the end of the year on commercial companies' applications for the banks known as industrial loan companies (ILCs) to give Congress time to weigh in on the issue. Three sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said federal banking regulators and various financial trade groups have been asked to testify at the hearing this month. The chairman of the House panel, Democrat Barney Frank of Massachusetts, has already introduced legislation with Ohio Republican Paul Gillmor that would block retailers from owning or operating an ILC. But the legislation faces strong opposition from Republican Sen. Robert Bennett of Utah, where many ILCs are based. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd said he will examine the ILC issue. ILCs are chartered by a handful of states and supervised by the FDIC, which insures their deposits. The fast-growing industry had combined assets of about $155 billion as of July 2006. The opposition to retailers owning banks stems mainly from community banks that fear a competitive disadvantage should a giant retailer such as Wal-Mart enter the business. U.S. banking laws have traditionally walled off banking and commerce. But Utah and a handful of other states have permitted nonfinancial companies to own banks through the ILC loophole. Opposition was also echoed by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in a speech delivered earlier this week to the Independent Community Bankers of America trade group. He said if Congress really wants to keep banking and commerce separate, "it should take note of this problem." Comptroller of the Currency John Dugan, an FDIC board member, said in January that if U.S. lawmakers failed to act within the one-year extended moratorium, he would resume reviews of ILC applications by commercial companies. Wal-Mart and Home Depot are among the commercial companies with ILC applications now in limbo.
