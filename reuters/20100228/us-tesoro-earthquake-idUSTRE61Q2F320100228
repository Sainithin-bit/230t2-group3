 TORONTO  (Reuters) - Tesoro Corp ( TSO.N ) said on Saturday that the tsunami generated by an earthquake in Chile had not hurt its 94,000 barrel per day refinery in Kapolei, Hawaii. 

 Hawaii escaped serious damage when a tsunami triggered by a powerful earthquake in Chile merely lapped ashore. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center has now lifted its warning for the U.S. state. The Kapolei refinery is the largest of the state's two refineries, Tesoro said. The other is Chevron Corp's ( CVX.N ) 54,000 bpd refinery on Oahu. Earlier on Saturday, Tesoro said it was monitoring the tsunami alerts prompted by the earthquake and that it would take the steps "deemed necessary." Tesoro said it plans to have operating rates at the refinery back to normal levels within the next 12 hours. The company said it does not expect any fuel shortages and supplies should soon return to normal, although terminal operations would remain closed until all clear signals are received from the government. Seven retail sites that were closed due to potential water damage would also reopen upon receiving the all clear from authorities, said Tesoro. Tesoro has committed "to not raise fuel prices during this time of recovery for the state of Hawaii." The company operates seven refineries in the western United States with a combined capacity of about 665,000 barrels per day.
