 TOKYO  (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp ( 7203.T ) said its president would hold a news conference in Beijing on Monday as the automaker looks to limit the damage from a massive global recall on the fast-growing Chinese market. 

 Akio Toyoda will brief the media at 6:00 p.m. in Beijing (5 a.m. EST) on Monday, with the aim of explaining to the public about its recent quality issues, Hitoshi Yokoyama, a spokesman for a China unit of Toyota said. The briefing will follow Toyoda's appearance last week in Washington, where he was grilled by U.S. lawmakers for a series of recalls that have tarnished the carmaker's brand and reputation for quality. Toyota has recalled more than 8 million cars globally for unintended acceleration and braking problems, in a widening safety crisis that broke about a month ago. The bulk of the recalls are in the United States. Toyota said last month that it had submitted an application to recall more than 75,000 of the RAV4 sport utility vehicle in China, the world's largest auto market in 2009. The cars were made at Toyota's joint venture plant with China's FAW in Tianjin. (Editing by  Alex Richardson )
