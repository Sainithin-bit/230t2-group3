 ATHENS  (Reuters) - Greece has appointed banker Stelios Papadopoulos as new head of the country's Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA), a finance ministry official told Reuters on Tuesday on condition of anonymity. 
 Papadopoulos replaces Petros Christodoulou, who left the PDMA earlier this year to become a senior executive at National Bank of Greece, the country's biggest commercial lender. The debt agency oversaw the country's debt restructuring earlier this year and will conduct a planned debt buyback under its latest bailout. (Reporting by Lefteris Papadimas)
