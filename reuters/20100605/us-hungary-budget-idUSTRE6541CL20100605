 BUDAPEST  (Reuters) - Following are analysts' comments on the Hungarian government's announcements on Saturday on meeting its deficit target and the state of public finances. 

 GERGELY SUPPAN, TAKAREKBANK "It's obviously, clearly positive that they keep to the deficit goal. Markets have clearly overreacted and they will need an excuse for a correction and it's reassuring now that the government keeps the deficit target. "But markets will really calm down only when they see that there is a detailed program which contains how they (the government) can achieve it." "A program underpinned by the proper details is needed to win credibility which convinces investors that the deficit target will be really attainable." "A small overshoot (of the target) like 0.1-0.2 percent of GDP would not worry anyone, while it's reassuring that the deficit will not be 7 percent or (the analyst median consensus of) 5 percent." "Tax cuts are possible only if on the other side they are counterbalanced by spending cuts. Hungary should reduce its state redistribution (ratio) by several percentage points in the next 5-6 years anyway." ZOLTAN TOROK, RAIFFEISEN, BUDAPEST "This is a very reassuring development. That's very positive that the fact-finding committee came to the conclusion that (the government) will keep to the deficit target. This should really calm down the markets, although the details will be important." "It has also triggered concerns in the market that one head of the dragon does not know what the other says. (Government communication) has been confusing." "Keeping to the deficit target can well offset the earlier concerns. This is beyond most expectations as everybody had expected a deficit overshoot of a certain size. I don't say of course that the forint will return to the 274 level against the euro on Monday, where it had been before the plunge. Cautious, slow consolidation can start in the market, but everybody will be nervous and they will want to see the details." "In communications this is to counterbalance the impact of Friday's events. I am surprised that they keep to the deficit goal." "Concerns will certainly not pass completely... The 3.8 percent target is achievable only if the government will do something, it cuts spending or raises revenues. I don't think that tax cuts are possible in this situation." GYORGY BARCZA, K&H BANK, BUDAPEST "It seems there will not be a significantly higher deficit this year, contrary to earlier news. But we have to wait to see the details, how well founded this is. "If they are committed to the (2010) deficit target, or there is only a slight deviation from the target, that is a very good thing." "Markets may clam down slightly on Monday, but it takes time to heal credibility wounds." (Reporting by Krisztina Than and Sandor Peto; editing by John Stonestreet)
