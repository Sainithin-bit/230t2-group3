 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Airlines shares were broadly lower on Monday after a Nigerian man was charged with trying to blow up a Northwest Airlines ( DAL.N ) plane on Christmas Day. 

 Shares of Delta were down 2.97 percent to $11.42 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange. AMR Corp AMR.N, parent of American Airlines, saw its shares fall 2.7 percent to $7.92. Shares of UAL Corp UAUA.O, parent of United Airlines, were down 3.06 at $12.69 on Nasdaq. Shares of US Airways Group ( LCC.N ) were down 2.8 percent at $5.23. The airline industry has struggled this year with economic recession and falling demand from well-heeled business travelers. Experts have said renewed terror concerns and potentially tighter airport security measures could dampen business travel demand just as it recovers.
