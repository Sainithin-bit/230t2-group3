 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc ( C.N ) said on Tuesday it boosted the base salaries for its chief financial officer and a global markets co-head, but still plans to pay Chief Executive Vikram Pandit $1 for the year. 

 The compensation changes are the latest in a series of shifts by Wall Street as banks try to figure out how to get senior staff to perform well. The disclosures attach names to some of the 25 pay packages that Kenneth Feinberg, special master for Troubled Asset Relief Program executive compensation, approved last month. Feinberg disclosed the packages, but did not indicate the names of the recipients. CFO John Gerspach's annual base salary will increase to $500,000 effective November 1 from $400,000 prior to November, while James Forese is receiving $475,000, compared with $225,000. Gerspach is also receiving $2.92 million of stock salary for 2009, while Forese will get $5.4 million. Pandit will receive a base salary of $1 a year, with no stock salary. The bank did not request higher compensation for Pandit, a person familiar with the matter said. Pandit received a base salary of $958,333 last year, while Forese received a base salary of $225,000. Gerspach was not CFO in 2008 and his compensation was not disclosed. Feinberg is looking at compensation for the best-paid employees at seven companies that have received multiple rounds of government support, including Citigroup. Stephen Volk, vice chairman, will receive a base salary of $500,000 and $3.4 million of stock. (Reporting by  Dan Wilchins ; editing by  Richard Chang  and  Andre Grenon )
