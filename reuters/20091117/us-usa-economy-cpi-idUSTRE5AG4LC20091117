 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - Rising energy costs likely pushed consumer prices up in October, but core inflation was likely tempered by sagging rents, according to a Reuters poll of economists. 

 A forecast 0.2 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index, the most broadly used gauge of inflation, would match September's increase, based on the median estimate of 78 economists. With the erratic food and energy sectors stripped out, the so-called core rate of consumer prices is forecast to rise 0.1 percent after gaining 0.2 percent in September. Economists said steady to slightly lower readings in rent and owners' equivalent rent will likely offset new car prices, which are expected to have moved higher. "Rental vacancies are at record highs and are still increasing, which should continue to put downward pressure on rents," JPMorgan Chase Bank analysts wrote in their Global Data Watch. "New car prices are expected to move higher, reflecting the remaining unwind of the cash-for-clunkers effect, while quotes for used cars should continue the upward trend seen in recent months," Morgan Stanley & Co Inc analysts said in research notes. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the CPI report for October at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT) on Wednesday. The following is a selection of forecasts and comments from economists: BMO CAPITAL Forecast: Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent Core Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent Headline inflation will turn positive next month because of the massive decline in energy prices late last year. An expected slight gain in core prices in October could lift the yearly rate for the second straight month. While the core rate could return to the Fed's long-run forecast range of 1.7 percent to 2.0 percent in coming months, it will likely trend down in 2010 as a result of spare capacity. MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM Forecast: Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent Core Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent Tenants' rent and owners' equivalent rent, which are 39 percent of the core basket, now appear to be falling and will not recover soon. As unemployment pushes up already-elevated vacancy rates, rents will face further downward pressure. Elsewhere in the core basket, some volatile components, including lodging away from home, public transportation including airfares and tobacco prices, probably took a step down after increasing sharply in September. RBS Forecast: Consumer Price Index +0.2 percent Core Consumer Price Index +0.1 percent A weak housing market may spur fears that this sector will drag the core rate lower in the coming months, but the September data are consistent with our view that disinflation pressures are dissipating as the economy improves. The core rate could have climbed by 0.1 percent, owing to gains in education, airfares, new vehicles and medical care, partially offset by continued softness in shelter costs.
