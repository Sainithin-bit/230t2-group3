 BRATISLAVA  (Reuters) - The Swedish government can guarantee a European Investment Bank loan to General Motors ( GM.N ) unit Saab if a new owner that can cover half the necessary financing emerges, Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt said on Monday. 

 Loss-making Saab sought protection from creditors this week to survive the current global economic malaise and buy time to find a new owner after GN decided to cut its ties with the unit by the start of 2010. Reinfeldt repeated the government did not want to own Saab but said it could guarantee a loan for the company if the carmaker found a new owner to keep it running. "Either GM change their decision on the exit or a new owner or a group of owners will come forward," he said. "If there is an owner that provides half of the resources, we can put up a state guarantee for the other half." In a court filing this week Saab said it made a 3 billion Swedish crown ($342 million) loss in 2008 and expected to lose as much again this year. It needs around 500 million crowns a month just to keep running, Reinfeldt has said, and billions of crowns more to invest in new models to make it competitive. Reinfeldt told reporters during a visit to Bratislava the government could guarantee a loan to Ford's ( F.N ) Swedish unit Volvo ( VOLVb.ST ) because Ford was not preparing an exit from the Swedish firm.
