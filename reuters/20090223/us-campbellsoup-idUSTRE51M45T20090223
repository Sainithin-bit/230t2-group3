 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - Campbell Soup Co ( CPB.N ) posted a deeper drop in quarterly sales on Monday than analysts had expected as retailers cut back on inventories of items like condensed soup, usually seen as a consumer favorite in economic hard times. 

 Shares in the world's largest soup maker fell almost 3 percent as the sales news overshadowed earnings that beat analysts' estimates by a penny and a full-year forecast that could top Wall Street's expectations. Several retailers chose to cut back on inventories at the end of the year and a number of manufacturers, including Campbell and Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N saw sales hurt by retailers "destocking." But soup remained one food of choice for consumers trying to save money and Campbell executives said sales by retailers to consumers outpaced the company's sales to retailers. "I believe we will weather this storm better than most companies," CEO Douglas Conant said, during a conference call with analysts. Campbell's profit fell 15 percent to $233 million, or 64 cents a share, in the second quarter ended on February 1 from $274 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding restructuring costs and other items, earnings were 65 cents a share. Analysts on average forecast 64 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales fell 4 percent to $2.12 billion as the stronger dollar curbed overseas revenue, consumer bought less-expensive products and promotional spending increased. Those factors were partly offset by prices increases that Campbell took to cope with higher grain and energy costs. Analysts had forecast sales of $2.22 billion on average. MORE SHELF SPACE Campbell's U.S. soup sales rose 8 percent. While the destocking hurt sales of condensed soups, the company said there were signs it was gaining shelf space at retail chains. Campbell has faced pressure in the soup segment as General Mills Inc's ( GIS.N ) Progresso brand has gained market share. The sales "decline in the quarter was worse than we expected, as volume and mix turned negative in each of the company's operating segments," JPMorgan analyst Terry Bivens said in a research note. But Campbell also said that fiscal 2009 earnings-per-share growth would be at the high end of its 5 percent to 7 percent forecast range, excluding the impact of the dollar and other one-time items, as it benefits from improving margins and lower interest costs. Including the currency impact, the company forecast would equal earnings as high as about $2.13 per share for the year, while analysts had forecast $2.12, according to Reuters Estimates. Campbell warned in November that the stronger dollar would cut into sales and earnings. The company derives about 25 percent to 30 percent of sales from outside the United States. Campbell shares were down 2.4 percent at $28.73 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trade. (Reporting by Brad Dorfman; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn,  Leslie Gevirtz )
