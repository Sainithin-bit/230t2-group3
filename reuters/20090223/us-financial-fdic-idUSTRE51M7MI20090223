 WASHINGTON  (Reuters) - U.S. banks face higher premiums for deposit insurance in the coming months and will likely get more time to issue debt under a voluntary guarantee program when regulators meet this week to consider rule changes being crafted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 

 The FDIC has scheduled a meeting for Friday to set new premiums for the second quarter and possibly extend the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) for up to 10 years from three years and include secured debt in the program. The FDIC program currently guarantees qualifying debt that matures no later than June 30, 2012. The FDIC established the guarantee program in October to cover certain senior unsecured debt and banks' transaction deposit accounts, an effort to boost confidence in the banking industry and reduce the risk of bank runs. The changes could reflect the program provided in mid-January to Bank of America Corp <BAC.N. For Bank of America, eligible assets guaranteed against losses include residential and commercial real estate-backed securities, corporate debt and derivative transactions. The FDIC's backstop for Bank of America lasts 10 years for residential assets and five years for nonresidential assets. An FDIC official told lawmakers recently that banks have been able to improve their access to funding through the guarantee program and that as of January 28, outstanding debt covered by the FDIC facility totaled about $221 billion. Under the current program, eligible senior unsecured debt must be issued between October 14, 2008, and June 30, 2009. The FDIC could extend that window through October, according to sources familiar with the FDIC's proposed changes. HIGHER ASSESSMENTS With a steady stream of bank failures this year, the FDIC is trying to replenish its industry-funded pot of money used to guarantee up to $250,000 per depositor when an insured bank fails. That $250,000 amount only lasts through this year unless Congress raises it permanently from $100,000. At Friday's meeting, the FDIC's board of directors is expected to raise insurance premiums for the second quarter and finalize a proposal to reflect risk factors into the premiums. FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair has repeatedly voiced concern that some failed banks relied too heavily on deposits brokered by third parties and advances from the Federal Home Loan Banks, which are paid before depositors when a bank fails. Banks that do not rely on these types of deposits might be rewarded with some assessment relief, according to a source familiar with planning for the meeting. The FDIC expects the deposit insurance fund to drop to about $29 billion in the first quarter. It had $34.6 billion at the end of September 2008. The FDIC will release data for the quarter ended December on Thursday. As a steady parade of bank failures erodes the insurance fund, legislation has been introduced in Congress aimed at extending the amount of time the FDIC has to replenish the fund to eight years from five years. The FDIC is trying to build back its fund to 1.25 percent of estimated deposits. Bank failures have caused the ratio to drop to 0.76 percent as of September 30, 2008. "We are concerned that the reserve ratio may have fallen, which may cause the FDIC to propose raising the assessment rates further than what was originally proposed," said Chris Cole, a senior regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America. In December the FDIC raised rates for the first quarter by 7 cents for every $100 in deposits. Depending on the institution, premiums range from 12 cents to 50 cents. The legislation under consideration by the House Financial Services Committee also seeks to raise the FDIC's borrowing authority with the U.S. Treasury Department to $100 billion from $30 billion and to allow the agency to charge banks a "systemic risk" special assessment. The Congressional Budget Office said on Monday the House bill could boost the U.S. deficit by $14 billion through 2013, but recoup that amount five years later.
