 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Nova Chemicals' bonds soared by as much as 40 cents on the dollar on Monday following news it is being acquired by Abu Dhabi's state-owned International Petroleum Investment Co in an all-cash deal. 

 Nova Chemicals' NCX.N 7.4 percent bonds due in April this year rose to 100 cents on the dollar from about 60 cents last week, according to Christopher Munck, a high-yield trader at B. Riley & Co in Los Angeles. IPIC said the total value of the deal, including assumption of Nova Chemicals' debt, is about $2.3 billion. Earlier this month, Standard & Poor's had slashed Nova Chemicals' rating by three notches to "CCC-plus" and said it may cut the rating again, citing concerns about the company's ability to pay off a large amount of maturing debt. With the IPIC acquisition, the market's view is that payout of the bonds due in April is no longer in question, Munck said. (Reporting by  Dena Aubin , Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)
