 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - Hong Kong shares were up 1.8 percent on Monday as some of the uncertainty over the fate of U.S. banks subsided, giving investors an excuse to buy recently beaten down stocks, but shares in HSBC lagged ahead of its earnings. 

 By 0238 GMT the benchmark Hang Seng Index was 220.62 points higher at 12,919.79 after losing 6.3 percent last week amid a global rout in financial stocks. Shares in Europe's biggest bank were down 0.4 percent at HK$54.60, after dropping to a decade-low of HK$53.80 earlier as investors fretted about dividend cuts and recapitalization at the bank. HSBC will announce its 2008 earnings on March 2. U.S. stock futures were pointing higher on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Citigroup is in talks that could give the U.S. government as much as a 40 percent stake in the bank. Citigroup stock had dropped below $2 on Friday for the first time since January 1991, buffeted by speculation it was prime candidate for nationalization. "The news itself is hardly positive, if anything it is indicative of further weakness in the financial markets going forward, but at least now investors know the extend of the damage that will be done in terms of equity dilution," said Alex Wong, director with Ample Finance in Hong Kong. Other analysts also expect a sharp reversal of fortune later in the week as investors come to terms with the implications of a U.S. government stake holding in one of the world's leading banks. New listing Realgold Mining was trading at HK$6.36 after opening at HK$6.90, well above its offer price of HK$6.25, as investors continued to seek the safety of bullion. The China Enterprises Index of top mainland firms was up 1.2 percent at 7,153.10, running counter to a 0.6 percent drop in the main Shanghai index.
