 PARIS  (Reuters) - French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said on Monday her U.S. counterpart, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, was moving closer to European countries' position on tax havens. 

 European countries that are part of the G20 club of industrialized and emerging economies pledged on Sunday to crack down on tax havens when the G20 meets in April to discuss reforming the global financial system. "I noted with great interest when I was in Washington and I met my (U.S.) counterpart that on the issue of tax havens in particular ... my U.S. colleague is moving closer to our positions," Lagarde told Europe 1 radio. Lagarde visited the United States last week. (Reporting by Francois Murphy)
