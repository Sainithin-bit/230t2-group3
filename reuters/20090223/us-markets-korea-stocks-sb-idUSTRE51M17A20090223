 SEOUL  (Reuters) - Seoul shares reversed early losses to rise 2.2 percent by Monday afternoon as banks climbed and other blue chips extended gains following a report that the U.S. government may raise its stake in Citigroup. 

 The Wall Street Journal reported on its website the U.S. government may end up holding as much as 40 percent of Citigroup's common stock, citing sources familiar with the plans. Expectations that the stake purchase would help cushion battered U.S. financial firms and steady global markets revived investors' appetite for stocks, analysts said. "For those who don't own Citi shares, it's good news," said Shim Jae-youb, an analyst at Meritz Securities. At 0259 GMT, the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was up 23.61 points at 1,089.56 points. The index fell as much as 1.35 percent earlier. KB Financial Group, parent of top domestic bank Kookmin, rose 2.19 percent reversing earlier steep losses. Hana Financial Group jumped 6.59 percent. Bellwether Samsung Electronics Co Ltd also turned higher, rising 2.89 percent. Flat screen maker LG Display Co Ltd climbed 4.71 percent and top local carmaker Hyundai Motor Co soared 4.71 percent.
