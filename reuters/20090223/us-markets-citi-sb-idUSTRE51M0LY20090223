 HONG KONG  (Reuters) - U.S. equity futures turned positive, and Treasuries fell, early on Monday after the Wall Street Journal reported that Citigroup Inc is in talks that could give the U.S. government as much as a 40 percent stake in the bank. 

 Bank executives hope the stake will be closer to 25 percent, the Journal said, citing people familiar with the situation. S&P 500 futures were up 0.9 percent and Dow futures rose 0.7 percent. The benchmark 10-year yield ticked up to 2.82 percent from 2.79 late on Friday. (Reporting by  Kevin Plumberg )
