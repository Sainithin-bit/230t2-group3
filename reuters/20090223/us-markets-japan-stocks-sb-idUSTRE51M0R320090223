 TOKYO  (Reuters) - The Nikkei average trimmed earlier losses on Monday after a media report that the U.S. government may end up holding as much as 40 percent of Citigroup's common stock. 

 Citigroup executives are hoping the talks with U.S. federal officials will result in a stake closer to 25 percent, the Wall Street Journal reported. But slumping global demand hurt exporters such as Sony Corp. The benchmark Nikkei dipped 0.2 percent to 7,398.84, after falling to as low as 7,209.43 at one stage. The broader Topix, which posted on Friday its lowest finish in 25 years, fell 0.3 percent to 737.03. (Reporting by  Aiko Hayashi )
