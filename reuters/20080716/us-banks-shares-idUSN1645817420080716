 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co ( WFC.N ) led U.S. bank shares to their biggest gains in well over a decade on Wednesday after reporting a surprisingly high profit and increasing its dividend. 

 The KBW Bank Index .BKX of large banking companies rose 17.3 percent, its biggest gain in at least 15 years, while the KBW Regional Bank Index .KRX rose 14.6 percent. Both recovered most of their losses this month. The broader Standard & Poor's 500  .SPX  index rose 2.5 percent, aided in part by a more-than-$4-per-barrel decline in oil prices CLc1. "There's almost a feeling of relief out there," said Matt McCormick, an analyst at Bahl & Gaynor Investment Counsel in Cincinnati. "There's a great deal of interest in financials turning the corner." Wednesday's gains came after Wells Fargo, the nation's fifth-largest bank and second-largest mortgage lender, posted second-quarter profit of $1.75 billion, or 53 cents per share. Though profit fell 23 percent from a year earlier, it topped the average analyst forecast for earnings of 49 cents per share. The San Francisco bank also raised its dividend 10 percent at a time many rivals are lowering theirs. Wells Fargo shares rose $6.72, or 32.8 percent, to $27.23. "Wells Fargo results were commendable when contrasted against the deteriorating macroeconomic and credit conditions," wrote David Hendler, an analyst at CreditSights Inc. Most major U.S. lenders are scheduled to report results over the next week, including Bank of America Corp ( BAC.N ), Citigroup Inc ( C.N ), JPMorgan Chase & Co ( JPM.N ), Wachovia Corp WB.N, Washington Mutual Inc ( WM.N ) and National City Corp  NCC.N. Shares of Bank of America rose 22.4 percent on Wednesday, while Citigroup rose 12.9 percent, JPMorgan 15.9 percent, Wachovia 16.1 percent, Washington Mutual 25.5 percent and National City 22.2 percent. Sentiment for lenders deteriorated this month as worries about capital and liquidity grew, and as regulators on Friday seized the mortgage lender IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK. Wachovia, Washington Mutual and National City have this week all released statements intended to reassure investors and customers about their financial health. "Sentiment right now is very volatile," said Subodh Kumar, chief investment strategist at Subodh Kumar & Associates in Toronto. The banking sector has absorbed more than $400 billion of write-downs and credit losses since the global credit crisis began a year ago. Through Tuesday, financial stocks comprised 12.9 percent of the market value of the S&P 500, down from 16.7 percent at year end and 20.8 percent at the end of June 2007, Reuters data show. The latter date was the eve of the credit crisis. Chris Hagedorn, who helps invest $21.4 billion at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati, said investors viewed Wells Fargo as a high-quality lender that can benefit from market stress. He also said they were pleased with results, given that the bank set aside $3 billion for credit losses. "A large reserve build strengthens a bank's financial position, which is what the market wants to see," he said.
