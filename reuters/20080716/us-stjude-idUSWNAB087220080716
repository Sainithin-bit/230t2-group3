 CHICAGO  (Reuters) - St. Jude Medical Inc ( STJ.N ) on Wednesday said quarterly earnings rose 55 percent, beating Wall Street estimates, as sales of its implantable cardioverter defibrillators, or ICDs, rebounded from a year earlier. 

 The cardiovascular device maker, which also raised its profit forecast for the full year, said second-quarter net earnings were $208.5 million, or 58 cents per share, up from $134.8 million, or 39 cents per share, a year earlier. The results beat analysts' estimates, but the extent of the beat was not immediately clear, according to Reuters Estimates. Sales rose 20 percent to $1.14 billion, helped by favorable foreign exchange rates. ICD sales rose 24 percent to $406 million. Sales of all implantable devices that monitor errant heart rhythms, including ICDs, rose 20 percent to $712 million. Sales of devices that treat atrial fibrillation rose 35 percent to $135 million; sales of neuromodulation products rose 17 percent to $61 million; cardiovascular device sales rose 14 percent to $228 million. The company said it expects third-quarter earnings of 56 cents to 58 cents a share, and raised its full-year guidance to a range of $2.28 to $2.33 per share from an April forecast of $2.15 to $2.20. It said the higher guidance assumes the federal research and development tax credit is approved and the benefit is recognized during 2008. St. Jude shares closed on Wednesday at $43.96 on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have traded between $48.10 and $36.91 over the last 52 weeks.
