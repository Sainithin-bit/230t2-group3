 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc ( ABT.N ) on Wednesday said second-quarter earnings jumped 34 percent, beating its expectations, fueled by sizzling sales of its medical devices, Humira arthritis treatment and other drugs. 

 The suburban Chicago drugmaker, whose shares rose 2.5 percent, said it earned $1.32 billion, or 85 cents per share. That compared with $989 million, or 63 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter. Excluding special items, the company earned 84 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 79 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates. Quarterly sales jumped almost 15 percent to $7.31 billion, about $100 million higher than the Reuters Estimates forecast. They would have risen 8.9 percent if not for the weak dollar, which raises the value of overseas sales. Humira, an injectable drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, took center stage. Its global sales soared 48 percent to $1.09 billion, despite strong competition from Johnson & Johnson's ( JNJ.N ) Remicade and Wyeth's WYE.N Enbrel. Like its rivals, Humira works by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called tumor necrosis factor. Sales of Kaletra, which combines two treatments for HIV, rose almost 13 percent to $355 million. Niaspan, the most widely used medicine to raise levels of "good" HDL cholesterol, rose 14 percent to $194 million. Global sales of medical products jumped almost 15 percent, amid growing demand for its diagnostics and its new drug-coated Xience stent used to prop open arteries that have been cleared of plaque. Abbott is counting on Xience and Humira to propel company earnings growth in coming years. Abbott shares were up $1.45 at $59.30 in premarket trading.
