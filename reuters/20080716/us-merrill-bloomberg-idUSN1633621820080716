 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch & Co Inc MER.N has agreed to sell its 20 percent stake in Bloomberg LP back to the news and financial data company for about $4.5 billion, a source familiar with the situation said on Wednesday. 

 The Wall Street investment bank and brokerage has also decided to retain its 49.8 percent stake in money manager BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ), the source said. Merrill is expected to announce the sale of the Bloomberg stake on Thursday when it also announces second-quarter results, the source said. Merrill spokeswoman Jessica Oppenheim and BlackRock spokesman Brian Beades declined to comment. Bloomberg did not immediately return a phone call and e-mail seeking comment. Selling the Bloomberg or BlackRock stakes could help Merrill Chief Executive John Thain raise capital to make up for write-downs related in part to subprime mortgages. Analysts on average expect Merrill to report a second-quarter loss of $1.94 per share, its fourth straight quarterly one, according to Reuters Estimates. Merrill may take write-downs totaling as much as $6 billion, analysts have said, on top of more than $30 billion in write-downs since the third quarter of 2007. Bloomberg was founded by billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who is now New York's mayor and still owns about 70 percent of the company. It is not immediately clear what role, if any, he has played in the Merrill transaction. Thain told investors last month that Merrill's 20 percent stake in Bloomberg was worth roughly $5 billion to $6 billion. Merrill took its stake in BlackRock when it sold the company its investment management business in 2006. It would plan to retain a strategic relationship with BlackRock even if it sold part of the stake, a person close to Merrill said earlier this month. BlackRock is run by Laurence Fink, once considered a top candidate to run Merrill after the ouster in October of Stanley O'Neal. Thain took the job after previously running NYSE Euronext NYX.N NYX.PA. Merrill shares closed Wednesday at $28.00, up $3.31, or 13.4 percent, as financial stocks rallied broadly. The stock has fallen 47.8 percent this year. (Additional reporting by  Murali Anantharaman ,  Robert MacMillan  and Jonathan Stempel; editing by  Mark Porter  and Jeffrey Benkoe)
