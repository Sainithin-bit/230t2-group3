 NEW YORK  (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas storage levels are expected to rise 88 billion cubic feet when weekly U.S. Energy Information Administration data is released early Thursday, according to a Reuters poll on Wednesday. 

 In the survey of 24 industry traders and analysts, injection estimates for the week ended July 11 ranged widely from 71 bcf to 102 bcf. For the same week last year, stocks rose an adjusted 76 bcf, while the five-year average gain for that week is 83 bcf. The median build in the survey was also 88 bcf. The EIA storage report will be issued Thursday at about 10:35 a.m. EDT (1435 GMT), the agency's new release time until further notice to prevent early accessing of the information. The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said there were 80 cooling degree days last week, 18 more than the previous week and nine above normal but one less than the same week last year. Degree days, a measure of departure in the mean daily temperature from 65 degrees Fahrenheit, are used to reflect demand for energy to heat or cool homes and businesses. In the last report, overall storage rose 90 bcf, below the Reuters survey estimate of 95 bcf, the year-ago gain of 98 bcf and the five year average increase for that week of 103 bcf. Eastern stocks climbed 61 bcf in the last report and narrowed to about 11 percent below last year's levels. Consuming Region West storage, which edged up 15 bcf for the week, was 18 percent below last year, while inventories in the Producing Region added 14 bcf and were unchanged at 19 percent below the same week in 2007. Last week's EIA report showed that total domestic gas inventories climbed to 2.208 trillion cubic feet but were still 389 bcf, or 15 percent, below last year and 3 percent below the five-year average. A build Thursday at the Reuters estimate would narrow the deficit to last year to about 3778 bcf. In the previous four reports, total stocks rose 322 bcf, or 81 bcf per week versus a 368 bcf increase for the same one-month period last year and a 373 bcf five-year average gain for that period. NOAA said it expected 83 cooling degree days this week, 9 more than normal and 10 more than the same year-ago week. Early injection estimates for next week's EIA report range from 60 bcf to 80 bcf versus a 70 bcf adjusted build for the same week in 2007. To get inventories back to a comfortable 3.4 tcf by winter, weekly injections must average 70 bcf for the remaining 17 weeks of the stock building season, well above the 62 bcf five-year average pace for that period. If weekly storage gains through October match the five-year average, stocks will begin next heating season with 3.26 tcf in the ground, well below last year's record high of 3.535 tcf. The following is a partial list of forecasters who participated in this week's survey. If forecasters provided a range, the midpoint was used. (Reporting by Joe Silha; Editing by  Christian Wiessner )
